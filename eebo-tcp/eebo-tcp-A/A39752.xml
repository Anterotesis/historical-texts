         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will be acknowledged by all, who have any ſerious
impreſſion of the truth, on their ſpirits, what ſore,
and trying times, we are now fallen in, and how deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
ſad the preſent ſtate of religion is almoſt every
where; yea what need ſeems for our being awake
with ſome deeper apprehenſions, of what may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of ſo many preſages, that this <hi>night,</hi> is not
yet at the darkeſt, but one of the ſoreſt conflicts
which the reformed Churches have hitherto mett with, may be on a very
near approach: of which one remarkably ſad, and moſt threatning
preſage, is now too obvious in this late aſtonishing <hi>rent,</hi> and breach, hath
been in <hi>the Church of Scotland,</hi> ſo impetuouſly driven and fomented by ſome
there, to the furtheſt <hi>ſcandal,</hi> and reproach of the truth, and giving the
adverſary, ſuch occaſion to blaſphem; Thus hath there been ſo ſore wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of religion, and the <hi>holy ſpirit of God</hi> greatly provoked, and greived
thereby. I confeſſe ſuch a tryal would have been litle either feared, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in a time, when ſo hot a <hi>furnace</hi> hath been ſet up amongſt us,
and that the Church had ſmarted, and been ſo ſore brunt, with the <hi>offence,</hi>
which followed upon former breakings; yea when it is ſo joyntly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
how much the <hi>honour of Chriſt</hi> the <hi>ſpreading of the Goſpel,</hi> and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
of the <hi>Church,</hi> is concerned, and in the higheſt meaſure prejugded
herein; this is a ſad <hi>ſubject,</hi> which should call each to that ſerious inquiry,
and tryal of their own work, and frame of ſpirit, in ſuch a day, as may lead
in to peace, and aſſurance of heart, before the Lord in this mater; and
to be ſeriouſly affected with what we have ſeen following thereon (yea might
have been feared, with the firſt breaking up of this ſtrange <hi>rent)</hi> of the ſpirit
of <hi>error,</hi> and <hi>deluſion,</hi> in the Holy righteouſneſs of God, now with ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence
over ſome, whoſe work had been, to put the Church in a flame
and unſetle others, as they can find no ground where to fix themſelves,
but are like to shake looſe all <hi>principles,</hi> and run that length as is incompatible,
not only with <hi>Christian</hi> but <hi>humane ſociety.</hi> Some few things, with reſpect
thereto I would premit now in the <hi>entry,</hi> to be <hi>conſidered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Firſt what light, doe thus break forth, out of the very bowels of ſuch
confuſion, both for <hi>conviction,</hi> and <hi>confirming</hi> of us in the truth; if we be but
<pb facs="tcp:65578:3"/>
ſerious obſerves of the work of the Lord in this day; and I would yet hope
may tend to put ſome Deeper impreſſion of theſe things on this generation,
when as with one audible voice from heaven, ſo much hath occurred, <hi>to ſeal our
inſtruction</hi> herein. 1. That none thus ſo eaſily adventure, after what we have
ſeen on ſuch a publick <hi>rent,</hi> and breach of the Church as this, and to hazard
on a <hi>precipice,</hi> and <hi>rock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> on which ſo many hath dashed, and been broke,
and where the loſing of communion in <hi>love,</hi> hath not long wanted a ſad
breach in the <hi>unity of faith.</hi> 2. That there may be now more fear, and
dread, of managing differences in judgment within the <hi>Church,</hi> with that
bitterneſs, and paſſion, as hath too viſibly been of late, to ſtumble, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
wrath, more then conviction; or to make ane offering of ſuch <hi>strange
fire;</hi>
the truth and cauſe of God can be promot only by theſe meanes, and
that ſpirit, which he doeth himſelf require. 3. That Profeſſors of the truth, be
more deeply preſſed about the <hi>ground work,</hi> and for a ſolid founding on the
great <hi>fundation-truths,</hi> and principles of religion, when this ſad want may be
ſo viſibly now read, on all our diſtempers, and make us yet fear where ſome
great pretences, to religion may end. Here is one of the ſadeſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the time, much Ignorance of the truth, and <hi>rule of the Goſpel;</hi> with
a louſe and unſtable mind, tho with greateſt confidence otherwiſe, amongſt
too many under a Profeſſion of godlineſs this day; through which the <hi>tempter</hi>
hath gotten ſuch advantage, yea on ſome whoſe affection and tenderneſs of
ſpirit, I dar not queſtion, but thought they could not run too far at a diſtance
from what they judged wrong, not fearing a deſtroying ſnare on the other
hand, and that corruption of the <hi>mind by error,</hi> is no leſſe mortall then in
the <hi>life</hi> and practice; yea which is too ſadly obvious leſs hope of a cure, where
ſuch a <hi>leproſy</hi> is once broke forth in the <hi>head.</hi> 4. And have we not now
ſeen, for our furtheſt conviction herein, that none lift up themſelves above
that which is meet, upon the repute, and credit of their profeſſion; before
him who is no <hi>reſpecter of perſons,</hi> and <hi>reſiſteth the proud,</hi> to ſo ſever a
ſmiting, and thruſting down of their Brethren, and fellow-ſervants, as hath
too obviouſly been in theſe late differences; and without that ſuteable fear,
and dread, leiſt theſe whom they gave ſo ſore a thruſt to, under the warrant
o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſome opprobrious deſignation, be ſuch, whom Jeſus Chriſt will own,
and finds his ſervants, and meſſengers, thus lye a bleeding under that <hi>wound.</hi>
5. I would hope alſo, that ſuch a witneſs of the jealouſy, and diſpleaſure of
the Lord, againſt deſpyſers and revilers of the Miniſters of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> may
have more weight on the conſcience of many after this; when with ſo diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and awfull a voice, this I humbly judge, hath been ſpoke and
may be applyed, to all ſuch who profeſſe the truth, and the generations yet
<pb facs="tcp:65578:3"/>
to come, to fear, and dread, to give thus the <hi>authority of the Son of God,</hi> the
<hi>ſupreme head of his Church,</hi> ſo publick ane affront in the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
as this party hath of late done, in our <hi>Church;</hi> or riſe up in ſuch a
conſpiracy againe; and no pretences when tryed at that <hi>bar</hi> of the ſcriptures of
truth can poſſibly bear out. 6. And ſhould not this clear the ſpotleſs way of
the Lord, and <hi>ſeall our inſtruction</hi> from what we have ſeen; that when no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
fruit is to ſuch a ſeaſon of the meanes of the Goſpel, as hes been of
late, nor ane embracing the <hi>truth</hi> in its ſimplicity, and with deſyre after the
<hi>ſincere milk of the word,</hi> as might have been hoped for; but a ſeeking more
after <hi>new</hi> and <hi>ſtrange doctrine,</hi> and to follow theſe things which tended not
to edify; that ſo ſad and dark ane ecclipſe ſhould follow; Tho I hope ſome
bleſſed fruit of theſe times paſt, ſhall be yet found and abide with many. O
that after this a more fervent, and ſerious reſpect to the ordinances of Chriſt,
might yet revive in our Land, and a keeping cloſe by this appointed way, not
only to beget, but to <hi>confirme, feed, and</hi> make the <hi>ſaints perfect, Epheſ.</hi> 4: 12.
I hope ſuch as under theſe meanes hath known a neir, and ſenſible fellowſhip
with <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> with that ineffably ſweet and fragant ſavour of his name;
and that ſurely he <hi>feeds</hi> his people there; cannot at ſo eaſy a rate be taken off
theſe <hi>breasts,</hi> as too many of late hath been. It is ſure the more true growth,
and livly the work of grace, is on the ſoul, the more felt need, and deſyre
will be then after the ordinances of Chriſt; and it may be feared beſides all
we have ſeen, if ſo ſad a falling off from thoſe, be ſtill owned as to reject the
meſſage of truth, from ſuch known, godly, and eminently qualified <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Chriſt,</hi> to his Church, upon that pretence of the <hi>late indulgence,</hi> leiſt
they loſe even what they had once attained, when thus out of the way of the
Lord, and from under his promiſe for protection, and being keeped, from
the prevalence of that ſpirit of <hi>error,</hi> and <hi>deluſion,</hi> which by the very ſame
entry hath now got ſuch viſible power on others. I nothing doubt but many
hath beene ingadged herein without fear or apprenſion of ſuch <hi>hazard,</hi> and
as judging it duty; and that ſome whoſe appearance this way hath had moſt
weight and credit with others, their heart would have <hi>trembled,</hi> at what
hath beene now ſeen to follow thereupon, whilſt the tendencie and <hi>product</hi>
of ſuch things hath out-rune ſo much their intent; but it ſhould be
mater of grief to all what ground we have thus loſt, and what the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
of the Church hath gained, to prejudge the intereſt of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I muſt premit this further to be conſidered, that it is not ſo much want
of <hi>light,</hi> as of <hi>practice,</hi> which is the greateſt let to the Churches <hi>cure;</hi> and I
would humbly offer ſome few, things where both unqueſtionable <hi>duty,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:65578:4"/>
the <hi>remedy</hi> of theſe ſore diſtempers now amongſt us, are joyntly obvious, as
we might yet hope to ſee another appearance on the <hi>Church,</hi> when theſe are
in earneſt followed. 1. To keep cloſſe by the <hi>ſcripture,</hi> with a ſincere humble
inquiry for <hi>light</hi> there, and a more intire reference, to its alone <hi>deciſion.</hi> It
is ſure the <hi>conſcience</hi> muſt be no <hi>rule</hi> to us, nor can alter the nature of things,
to make that good, which is evill, but muſt have a <hi>rule</hi> for its ſelve; nor is
it further the <hi>voice of God,</hi> then it is truely <hi>inlightened;</hi> yea nothing hes beene
more threatning to the Church, then the ſtrong <hi>impulſes</hi> of one <hi>erring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi>
which ſeldome keeps within any bounds. And tho I would deſyre
with the furtheſt tenderneſs to ſpeak in this preſent caſe, ſo far as a neceſſare
owning of the truth can admit, yet I muſt ſay, it hath beene to me, one of
the aſtoniſhing things of this day, How ſuch violence in driving this ſad
<hi>rent</hi> in our Church, and on theſe grounds as hath beene pretended, could
ſeek ſhelter under this patrociny, of the <hi>Scriptures of truth,</hi> or plead its war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from that <hi>bleſſed rule of the Goſpel,</hi> which is ſo expreſſe, plaine, and
full herein; and what should meane this ſtrange halting, if the <hi>Lord
be God let us follow him</hi> and ſubject wholly to his word, for at that <hi>bar</hi> only, I
hope it is, we deſyre to appear and be tryed: what a ſweet teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
will this then be on the ſoul of a dying Chriſtian, that the truth was ſo
dear to them, as no preingadgment, nor any intereſt of their ſuppoſed cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
did interpoſe between the authority of his <hi>word,</hi> and their <hi>conſcience,</hi> or
betwixt their conſcience, and a <hi>declaring</hi> the ſame to the world both for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>glory to the truth,</hi> and the advantage, and edification of others; yea this
from ſome of greateſt repute in the Church, hath tended to tranſmit their
memorie with a moſt ſweet ſavour, and credit to after times. 2. A ſerious
inquiry and <hi>tryall</hi> by all of their own way with much <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi>
of themſelves should be a bleſſed ingredient in our <hi>cure</hi> and <hi>relieffe</hi> this day,
when ſnairs and hazards are ſo thick ſpread: and I think it may be now further
convincing, that whatever be the caſe of our Church, ſuch a way and
methode, was no ſutable <hi>cure,</hi> as did viſibly tend to <hi>inflame</hi> the wound,
more then to <hi>heal, nor that the wrath of man, worketh the righteouſneſs of
God:</hi> I hope a <hi>ſecond</hi> inquiry, and tryal, by any of a ſerious ſpirit, will let
them yet clearly ſee, that ſuch pretences they founded on, can never ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
this late <hi>rent,</hi> and falling of thus from <hi>Church fellowship,</hi> where not only
they could continue without <hi>ſinne,</hi> but with much hope of a bleſſing.
3. And doeth not here both the <hi>rule of duty</hi> and <hi>our relieffe</hi> in this ſad caſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly
meet, in a ſeeking to <hi>overcome evill, and privat injuries with good.</hi> It
is true this is a ſpecialy pungent <hi>tryal</hi> and will not want ſome conflict, but I am
ſure is found one of the choiſeſt opportunities of a Chriſtians life, for
<pb facs="tcp:65578:4"/>
theirafter peace, yea the more <hi>wreſtling</hi> may thus be upon ſpecial provocations
and with ſome peculiar aggravating circumſtances, to reach this bleſſed <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi>
over themſelves, the more comfort and joy will be, upon their after
thoughts heirof, and I am ſure thus is greater advantage, for a juſt <hi>vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
by Chriſtians of themſelves whilſt preſſed thereto, as this is with leaſt
bitterneſs or recrimination followed. 4. It is clear that the ſpirit of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
cals for keeping a diſtance with ſuch things as may tend to <hi>engender
ſtriffe, and debate in the Church,</hi> and not to <hi>edifie,</hi> as our dutie; and I think it
may be too ſeen, how ſad influence this hath had, to break the comfort and
edification, of <hi>Chriſtian fellowship,</hi> where once profeſſors of religion hath
beene involved in ſuch a way. There was no ſuch <hi>practice,</hi> or <hi>cuſtome,</hi> in theſe
<hi>firſt pure times of the Church,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> lived, and was ſpecially ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to then; <hi>but if any be contentious we have no ſuch cuſtome in the Churches of
God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 5. It is duty alſo, for the furtheſt convincing tenderneſs
to be uſed by ſuch, who through grace, have beene keeped fixed, for <hi>reſtoring
of others with the ſpirit of meekneſs,</hi> and according to the rule, <hi>of ſome putting a
difference;</hi> great <hi>peace</hi> ſhould thus follow upon a tender bearing with the
frowardneſs, and revilings of any, under theſe ſaddiſtempers, upon this
deſigne, and for <hi>being thus all things to all;</hi> to gaine one from the <hi>error of his
way,</hi> is a greater <hi>victory</hi> then to gaine a <hi>city.</hi> I find in the life of bleſſed <hi>muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
this followed with much ſucceſs in dealing with ſome at <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> who wer
then under a ſad ſad prevalence of the ſpirrit of <hi>error,</hi> by ſeaking firſt to gaine
on their heart &amp; affection and then to deal with their conſcience, which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at laſt effectual. 6. It is ſure we are now called in this preſent <hi>tryal</hi> not to be
ſecure as to what further growth ſo ſtrange a contagion may have; when the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſheweth a <hi>litle leaven leaveneth the wholl lump,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 6. Which
as a deſtroying <hi>plague,</hi> may thus quickly ſpread from one <hi>houſe,</hi> to a city and
thence thrugh the wholl land yea it is known how ſmall the riſe of <hi>Quakeriſme</hi>
was within theſe few years in the <hi>Churches of Britaine.</hi> Nor are theſe light or
ſmall things hath beene now with a ſtrange confidence owned by ſome of that
way, or what may be feared of its further prevalence if the Lord doe not
graciouſly prevent and rebuke ſuch a <hi>ſpirit</hi> which hath thus troubled the poor
<hi>Church.</hi> 7. There needs much advertence alſo on the <hi>other hand,</hi>
that there be a continued <hi>fear,</hi> and no <hi>coolneſs,</hi> from this ſad extreme, in our
watching of the <hi>Churches</hi> hazard from open adverſaries, and to what aſſault
may be yet made to the rights and liberties of the <hi>Kingdome of our bleſſed Lord,</hi>
the alone <hi>ſupreme head, and King of his Church;</hi> but that thus an equall <hi>fear,</hi>

               <hi>Reader</hi> for this preſent publick appearance I ſhall us but a few words it may

could obviat the moſt sharpe reflections of any who are this day unbayaſed
in ſuch a <hi>caſe,</hi> but I forbear herein to ſpeak more particularly; only as
to the occaſion of my moving further upon this <hi>ſubject,</hi> was from that which
is contained in the <hi>firſt Section</hi> which upon ſome deſyre and aime for a ſerious

ſome few <hi>friends;</hi> and did choiſe that way by writ, to prevent any erruption
might be of <hi>heat,</hi> as too uſually there is hazard of, in verball reaſoning
upon ſuch things; and ſince I found it ſo frequently challenged how any
could oppoſe themſelve to what is owned and aſſerted in that <hi>Hiſtory of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,</hi>
as that which they judged enough to anſwer al; in ſuch a <hi>caſe,</hi> I was

that evidence of the truth, as may shew the miſtake and invalidity of theſe
grounds, on which ſo ſtrange a ſuperſtructure when ſeriouſly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and weighed, hath beene raiſed; Nor have yet found more urged u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the mater by any on this <hi>head</hi> then what is made uſe of there. It is ſure no
times paſt hath beene ever with ſo intire ane <hi>onneſſe</hi> in judgment as no occaſion
of <hi>difference</hi> did fall out amongſt the truly godly in ſome concerne of the truth;
but it is ſad that ſo dreadfull a hazard of occaſioning a <hi>breach</hi> in the Church
this way, is not yet credit upon <hi>tryal,</hi> until ſome have once tryed it themſelves.
My great unfitneſs to move in ſuch a caſe, was juſt ground of fear, beſides much
averſion otherwayes to intermedle with ſo ſad, and unpleaſing a ſubject, but
being preſſed herein, I hope I may ſay, it was, with a ſerious aim, and inquiry
after the <hi>truth;</hi> and to be confirmed by <hi>Scripture-light</hi> in a matter of ſuch great
publick conteſt; and with ſome deſire to prevent the ſtumblings of many
as may now be much feared on theſe amazing and shaking things, that have
ſince followed on this breach; for what incongruity may be judged, in the

ſuch a <hi>ſubject;</hi> I thought was ſo far ſuteable, as I am ſure a greater weight
thereof, would be found ane effectuall meane to take off theſe ſad unedifieing

            <p>There are ſome conſiderable miſtakes at the preſs both in words, and in

where friends ſo truely dear on every ſide are thus intereſted, &amp; when
our diſtempers ſo ſadly prevail, as moſt ſeem not in caſe to bear mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

beyond hope, if ſome bleſſed touch of the great healers hand do not
marvellouſly ſurpriſe us in this day, beſide the crowd and noiſe now may be feared,
is ſo great, as to ſhut all acceſs for a being heard on ſuch a ſubject. And for my
ſelf I may ſay, I have been ſtruck with that terrour of theſe ſad imbittering animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and heats now amongſt us, as to judge it no leſs deſireable to find an hiding
place from the ſtrife of tongues, than from the pride and violence of men; yet ſince
it is ſure, true friendſhip and love gaines more by freedome and openneſs of heart
with others, than to keep at a diſtance. Beſides that ſad impreſſion of this deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
breach and rent in our Church hath preſſed me to write theſe few lines, not
for debate or contending, I may ſay, in the leaſt; but for the truths ſake in a
ſober and humble reaſoning, with ſome exoneration of my own ſpirit in a few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals,
with the grounds thereof, which without prejudice or offence I would
deſire, yea obteſt to be ſeriouſly pondered. And I hope, I may humbly adventure
to ſay, it hath been with ſome deſire to prove my own heart in this matter, before
him who is the grear ſearcher thereof, and under ſome preſent conſtraint of light
have now write this, as I durſt not (though they were my dying words with peace
or quiet of ſpirit retreat here) But before I offer theſe propoſals, I would deſire
to premit ſome few <hi>conceſſions,</hi> which I hope on every hand (what ever be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
differences) will be acknowledged.</p>
            <p>1. That there muſt be no coolneſs or indifferency in any intereſt of the truth under
the greateſt hazard, this being ſo invaluable, as there cannot be too dear a purchaſs
thereof; yea that truths comparatively ſmall may be great in their ſeaſon, ſo as a
teſtimony thereto, with greateſt reſpect is then neceſſarily called for, when a publick
oppoſition is made to the ſame.</p>
            <p>2. That this great truth of the <hi>viſible Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> over his Church,
and its independance on the Magiſtrat, and his being the alone ſupreame head and
Lawgiver thereto, is of ſuch high concerne and elevation, as we ſhould not count
our life dear (if called of the Lord to be offered up as a Sacrifice thereon) yea that
a publick teſtimony ſhould be then more ſpecially owned thereto, with a clear and
diſtinct ſound, when ſo viſibly oppoſed, as in this day.</p>
            <p>3. That is muſt on all hands be confeſſed a ſad decay of a true publick ſpirit now
amongſt us, and of that zeal, integrity and watchfulneſs for the things of God,
and deep impreſſion of the Covenant with God theſe nations are ſo ſolemnely
engaged to, as hath formerly been with too ſad and unſenſible a wearing out from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65578:6"/>
under former impreſſions of duty in this long continued triall now in the Church,
and that ſucceſs which ſeemes to wait on a ſinful courſe, for which all of us have
cauſe for being deeply humbled before the Lord this day.</p>
            <p>4. I would hope alſo this will not be under debate, that an endeavour for a ſafe
<hi>union</hi> (and without any prejudice to the truth) amongſt theſe who have been hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in this day to witneſs and ſuffer againſt prelacy, and are one in the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
of truth &amp; godlineſs, is both a commanded and indiſpenſibly neceſſary duty,
and will be found as expreſly charged upon us, as any duty I know in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>5. That there may be differences in a purely Reformed Church in matters of
truth conſiſtent with mutuall edification, and without any diviſion or breach amongſt
ſuch, yea that ſuch will be ſtill here, whilſt we know but in part.</p>
            <p>6. This conceſſion I hope may not come under queſtion, that it is a part of our guilt
this day, our not being more ſuteably affected with both the ſin and judgment of this
preſent <hi>rent</hi> and diviſion, as we ought: when our Maſter hath ſo expreſly told,
that a Kingdome divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand, and no leſs thus threatned than
the utter diſſolution of ſuch a Church.</p>
            <p>7. That there is now need of more cloſs correſpondence, and perſonall freedome
with greateſt tenderneſs to be managed in this preſent difference with other, ſince
they may thus tear one another at a diſtance, before they underſtand them, and
that prejudice thus entertained with perſonal reflections, and alienating of affection
muſt neceſſarily tend on every hand to widen the breach.</p>
            <p>8. That this deplorable <hi>rent</hi> now amongſt the godly hath that ſad gravamen
therewith, that it is a ſtriving and devouring one another in the furnace, whilſt ſo
ſore preſſed otherwiſe under the croſs, yea in the publick view of all our Adverſaries,
who ſo eagerly thus watch for our halting.</p>
            <p>9. That there is a great hazard in credulity, and eaſy entertaining reports to the
prejudice of others in a time, when too many ſeem deſignedly to tread in the dark
this way, as if it were to promot a party, rather than to ſeek the truth, and follow
an intereſt on the ruine and fall of the repute of others, who have had a moſt ſweet
ſavour in the Church of Chriſt, and been much bleſſed for the edification of many:
this we may fear is one of the provoking evils in this time, and as a ſmoak in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils,
who hath ſaid, <hi>ſuch as ſow diſcord amongſt brethren are an abomination unto
him Pro.</hi> 6: 19. <hi>and hath curſed ſuch as ſmiteth his neighbour ſecretly Deut.</hi> 27: 24.
which may be no leſs ſad and ſore by ſmiting by the tongue, than by the ſword.</p>
            <p>10. I hope this alſo will be mutually granted, that a ſafe managing of <hi>differences</hi>
and rents amongſt the godly in ſo breaking a time as this, is one of the moſt difficult
things in Chriſtianity, ſo hard it is to get our own ſpirits kept out, to reach that
tender and due regard to preſent circumſtances for publick edification; yea to be
kept in an humble and ſpirituall frame in ſuch a caſe, and to have the life of grace
kept in vigorous exerciſe, ſo as thus to have pride, wrath, and bitterneſs of ſpirit
made to melt down in meekneſs, humility and love. Having premitted theſe few,
<hi>Conceſſions,</hi> which may be found of ſome weight in this ſad caſe, we are now in, I
muſt humbly offer theſe following <hi>Propoſals</hi> to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>PROP. I. Should we not with greateſt fear and trembling look on a breach
and rent of the Church, and amongſt the truely godly in this day on theſe grounds?
1. That it ſo expreſly controlls the authority of our great <hi>Maſter,</hi> who hath enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by ſuch reitereated commands, love and concord amongſt his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> ſo as I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65578:6"/>
can find no duty in the New Teſtament with more frequent obteſtations and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
preſſed than this. And though it is unqueſtionable, that ſome muſt be more
culpable in the cauſe of the difference than others, yet doth he preſs thus with ſuch
vehemency, and without any ſuch reſerve, to ſiſt, untill there should be an intire
onneſs in judgment amongſt themſelves, elſe there were no ſuch difficulty or neid of it
to be thus preſſed. 2. That it was his dying charge <hi>Joh.</hi> 15: 17. <hi>to love one another,</hi>
and to guard againſt any breach amongſt themſelves, and ſeemes to have been the
thing his heart was moſt fixt on, when he was to leave the world, as a witneſs of
their being his Diſciples, <hi>and that the world might know him to be ſent of God,
Joh.</hi> 17: 21. and thus be for a teſtimony to the truth of the Goſpel, and to enforce
a conviction of the excellency of Chriſtianity and doctrine thereof on the greateſt
Atheiſts. 3. And may we not ſee theſe prejudices, which follow on a formed and
growing <hi>breach</hi> of the Church, are oft ſuch, as the cauſe and occaſion thereof do
bear no proportion thereto, when brought to the Teſt of that great rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
love in its due latitude, as preſcribed by our bleſſed Maſter; yea that thus there is
a being ſo ſadly engaged in diſputings &amp; ſidings with parties, with ſuch exaſperation
of ſpirit, and neglecting of theſe offices of <hi>love</hi> we ow to others. 4. That we may
ſee ſuch a ſad <hi>rent,</hi> the more it is followed, the more it becomes a labyrinth and
maze, and no way found thus to get out, but that by which they firſt entered.
5. That conſpicuous <hi>beacon</hi> alſo, which in all ages hath been ſet hereon, may make
us tremble hereat, and how this hath reſolved not only into <hi>ſtrife,</hi> debate, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and diſturbances both publick and private, but to hazard the very ruine and
diſſolution of ſuch a Church. We find <hi>Salvian</hi> ſhewing that this was one of the
ſaddeſt preſages of that deſolating ſtroak, that came upon the <hi>Affricain</hi> Churches,
and we may ſee the very firſt viſible degenerating of Chriſtianity in the primitive
times begin here, for it is at ſuch a breach the envious one waits to ſow his tares;
and how rare is a ſtop, or fixing found in ſuch a current, but like the breaking in of
waters, doth carry many a further length than they ever intended. It is known on
what grounds that ſad breach by <hi>Labadie</hi> and his party began here in the <hi>Belgick</hi>
Church, with whom many went in the ſimplicity of their heart, and by ſuch a
deſigned cure to the offence was then taken by them, did but heighten the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
and occaſioned ſo much prejudice againſt the power and truth of godlineſs
in this land.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. May we on any ſafe ground break up <hi>Church fellowship</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
ſo far with thoſe who have accepted the late <hi>indulgence,</hi> as not to <hi>hear</hi> or
receive the publick ordinances from them as being ſuch: I muſt propoſe this on
theſe grounds. 1. That hereby no approbation of the <hi>Indulgence</hi> can be neceſſarily
inferred, and the ground of offence can never be owned ſuch, as to pollute the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
or make communion with theſe in the leaſt ſinfull to us. But it would
be adverted on what ſide the moſt dangerous and deſtructive inconveniences are,
and hazard of the greateſt offence hereby to the Church. 2. That we muſt ſtill
own theſe as our brethren (what ever be the preſent difference) with whom we
are one (we hope) in Chriſt, and in the great concernes of truth and godlineſs, in
the ſame doctrine and principles of the Church: for in theſe we differ not in Theſi,
what ever the application hereof is matter of difference; yea ſhould be tender to
judge, in ſo far as they profeſs (whom we ſo aſſuredly know to be both ſerious and
godly) in their oppoſition both to the Prelatick and Eraſtian Adverſary. 3. That
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65578:7"/>
they are ſuch we muſt own to be the undoabted Miniſters of Chriſt, cloathed with
a Miniſteriall power to preach and diſpenſe the ordinances, ere ever this <hi>Indulgence</hi>
was on foot, theſe being <hi>Acts</hi> of their <hi>office,</hi> which flowes from no convey or
grant of the Magiſtrat to ſuch places; and that be vertue of their office and calling,
the peoples tey ſtandeth ſtill in force to hear them, with reſpect to that primary rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they were under, as <hi>Officers</hi> of the Church univerſall. 4. That this cannot
be made practicable, except we take the very Government of the Church off its
hinges, without a declarative ſentence; ſince upon the matter it is to draw out one of
the higheſt cenſures againſt ſo conſiderable a party of the Miniſtry, yea to exercea
<hi>critick</hi> and juridicall power ſome way, not only over theſe who are <hi>indulged,</hi> but
over muſt of the whole Non-Conformiſts, who are ſtill free and enforced in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to own ſuch in their Miniſtry. 5. That this ſhould be a departing from an
<hi>union</hi> once acknowledged in our fellowſhip and communion with them in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
ordinances. It hath been hitherto publickly owned, that if the whole
Church had been ſo far left, as to ſome ſad compliance for a time that way,
and thus the peoplefixt under the Miniſtry of ſuch, that even on an after diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the evil thereof, there would not be allowed the ſame neceſſity, or
expediency of <hi>ſeparation,</hi> or for refuſall to hear them, as there is now in our
caſe for a non-compliance with that party, and keeping thus at a continued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which was a ground had ſuch weight with our worthy <hi>Anceſtors</hi> in the
former times of prelacy, when it was not brought in at once, but by degrees
into the Church, and thus found it not ſafe and eaſy to break up ſo far, as not to
have Chruch fellowſhip in receiving the publick ordinances then from ſuch, though
a moſt vigorous oppoſition to the ſinfulneſs of that way was ſtill followed, 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this might quickly tend to a caſting off of moſt, if not the whole of the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
non-conforme Miniſtry now in the Church, who have been helped to ſtand and
withſtand againſt Prelacy, and to open ſuch a doore for any of the people at their
pleaſure to quite or turn off the Miniſters of the Goſpel, without any fixed or
previous cognition in ſuch a caſe. And Oh! how hard, or difficult will it be
found to ſet bounds, or fix new landmarks, when once the old are taken up, may
be eaſily judged.</p>
            <p>PROP. III. Is ſuch a refuſall to hear theſe Miniſters who are indulged, now
owned, becauſe it is <hi>ſimpliciter unlawfull,</hi> or on that ground of its <hi>expediency,</hi>
and for edification? I would hope, none yet dare come to own the firſt; but for
the ſecond of <hi>expediency</hi> in ſuch a preſent caſe, I muſt humbly judge ſuch a practice
would ſeem very unanſwerable thereunto, on theſe grounds. 1. That this ſad
effect hath ſo viſibly followed thereon, to break up that ſweet edifying fellowſhip,
which was formerly amongſt Chriſtians in many places, ſo as theſe who were
wount to walk together, and keep Chriſtian converſe, for building up one another
in the truth, can now hardly joyn or pray together, 2. That none ſeem to have
gained by this late heightned breach, except the publick Adverſary, yea <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ words">
                  <desc>〈◊…〉</desc>
               </gap>ad a
daſh to theſe publick meetings in the fields thus given, which here to fore were ſo
eminently bleſſed, whilſt thus ſuch open contradiction of late in preaching hath too
evidently brought a ſtumbling to the weak, and a reproach on the way of the Lord,
as we may fear ſhall not in haſte be taken off. 3. That thus the prelatick party
ſeems more hardned, and to have leſs reckoning of that heavy charge of perjury
and defection from the truth, when ſo great a part of Non-Conforme Miniſters
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65578:7"/>
they find publickly claſſed with them, who yet are otherwiſe known to be both
able and godly; yea which hath been ſadly regrated, that the edge of that wounted
zeal which was againſt <hi>Prelacy</hi> and the common Adverſary, hath been thus blunted
in a more hot purſute of the other party. 4. The ſhaking and ſtumbling of many,
which I muſt here write with a ſad remembrance of a Chriſtian, who I durſt not
but ſay but was truely ſerious, who ſpake to me almoſt weeping, when I was laſt in
our Country, of being put to that through this late breach and viſible contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in publick preaching; yea that ſome had openly declared there were ſcarce
<hi>four</hi> faithfull Miniſters of the Church to be found, that they knew not what, or
whom to credit, but like to be ſhaken in the very foundation. And I muſt humbly
judge, if this breach ſhould grow, I know no gain will ever recompenſe the <hi>Kings
dammage herein,</hi> I mean of our <hi>King and head</hi> in the edification of his people. Yea
who are there, if not fixt and eſtabliſhed by grace, that can look on theſe devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
heats and breakings amongſt both Chriſtians and Miniſters in this day, but are
in hazard to take prejudice at the whole of Religion, and muſt needs judge that
theſe cannot be the fruits of the Spirit of Chriſt. 5. I muſt yet add on this ground
of expediency, if it would ſeem to engage the multitude in theſe controverſies, and
make this their buſineſs, ere many ſuch know what the ſolide work and exerciſe of
godlineſs is, or what either the principles and power of Religion means, and why
is that ſo expreſly commanded <hi>Rom.</hi> 14: 1. <hi>Him that is weak in the faith receive,
but not to doubtfull diſputations.</hi> It is ſure, that it much concernes all who preach
the Goſpel, to know the meſſage they deliver be ſuted for ſolide edification, and in
bearing teſtimony to the truth in this day, which is ſo unqueſtionably a duty, that
yet it be with ſuch a grave miniſterial ſeriouſneſs and Chriſtian wiſdome, as it may
commend the truth to the conſcience of the people, ſo as this duty be neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected,
nor unſuteably managed, otherwiſe a light and too ordinary a way in
ſpeaking on ſo grave a concerne, or on publick differences, without ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
and ſuteable weight herein, and when it is with perſonal reflections, we
may fear would ſtumble much more then convince, as would ſeem a thruſt rather at
the perſons of ſome, than at their way, and to gain an intereſt to a party more than
for the truth.</p>
            <p>PROP. IV. Are not ſuch expreſly called, yea with an intenſe ſtudy to <hi>unite</hi>
ſo far for the truths ſake, and in following clear uncontroverted duties, who are
otherwiſe like minded in things of the Lord, what ever now may be in difference
amongſt us, ſo as that union should not, nor ought to ſiſt, untill a through onneſs
of judgment be attained in this preſent controverſy (which were ſo much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired)
upon theſe grounds. 1. That the Scripture clearly determines this; <hi>ſo far
as we have attained, to walk by the ſame rule, and mind the ſame things, however even in
ſome matters of truth not one, Phil.</hi> 3: 15. 16. and with hope, <hi>that the Lord in due
time may graciouſly convince</hi> ſuch who are in the preſent difference moſt culpable. And
I ſhould hope, that more tender and affectionat condeſcendence in the way of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with ſuch might tend more to reclaime and recover, than any violent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory
way. 2. Becauſe, if ſuch an uniting in unqueſtionable duties ſhould
ceaſe, untill there be a full union in judgment amongſt the truely godly, what times
of the Church have been favourable, that we could then ever hope, or eſſay any
concord in duty. 3. That it is ſure, the moſt eminent Inſtruments in the work of
the Goſpel, both in the primitive times, and ſince the Reformation, have been
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65578:8"/>
oft at a very ſad difference amongſt themſelves in the matters of truth, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
otherwiſe in carrying on the work of the Lord, hath been moſt remarkea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſealed with a bleſſing. 4. That a bearing and forbearing in many differences of
judgment amongſt the godly for the Churches peace, and without any involvement
in the ſin of others, hath not been hitherto queſtioned by the greateſt lights and
witneſſes to the truth in theſe late times, eſpecially where both the doctrine and
Government of the Church hath been in the great and weighty concernes thereof
adhered to. Thus bleſſed <hi>Calvin</hi> doth ſo preſſingly obteſt the <hi>English</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at <hi>Francfort</hi> for a tender bearing and mutuall forbearing amongſt themſelves,
in that preſent difference was then, with reſpect to the circumſtances they ſtood
under, and for the truths ſake, though he was far from owning that party in that
wherein the reſt of their brethren had been ſohighly grieved.</p>
            <p>PROP. V. Is it not one of the great concernes and trials of Chriſtian wiſdome
in the Church, how to apply the rule in things lawful and commanded, with a due
regard to <hi>edification</hi> in ſuch a caſe. I propoſe this on theſe grounds. 1. The expreſs
warrant of the Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10: 23. <hi>all things are lawfull, but not expedient,
all things are lawfull, but edify not.</hi> 2. That this hath been one of the greateſt
depths of Satan to turn men over in the managing of a duty on another ſad extreame,
as the very way to break it, <hi>but he that handleth a matter wiſely shall find good.</hi>
The way of the Lord, and a cloſs adhering to his truth doth never of it ſelf occaſion
a breach in the Church, but what our corruption, and unſuteable following of duty
doth on either hand occaſion; nor is there any jarre, except what is from our ſelves
betwixt zeal and Chriſtian prudence, ſince theſe are both expreſly enjoyned, and
equally obliging by the holy Ghoſt, nor can they ever part, but with a ſad prejudice
to the truth. There is a holy contemperature of zeal, meekneſs and love, all which
being from one and the ſame ſpirit, do with a ſweet onneſs neceſſarily concurre for
the ſame end. Nor can I poſſibly reconcile a being profeſſedly hot in the one, with
being cold and unconcerned in the other, except I ſhould quite the revealed rule of
our duty for both. 3. Becauſe the truth may get a very ſore thruſt by the manner of
our contending for it: the <hi>fruit of righteouſneſs is ſown in peace,</hi> and both ſhould be
ſeriouſly adverted to, that the cauſe of God be neither neglected, nor yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juged,
through a non-ſuteable following thereof. A wound needs both a tender
and skilfull hand to handle it, elſe it were eaſy to deſtroy, where the caſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
conſtitution of the patient is not conſidered a right. O! if that Scripture were
more practically owned, for a humble tender condeſcendence in our dealing with
others for the truths ſake, I <hi>was all things to all, that I might gain ſome.</hi> Our bitter,
hot and unadviſed expreſſions may ſome times wrong the intereſt of our bleſſed
Maſter more, than we may find eaſy with our furtheſt work to recover.</p>
            <p>PROP. VI. Is there not ground both to fear and watch againſt a giving any
thruſt at the credit and repute of the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſtin our Church,</hi> who in this
hour of tentation, and after many ſore wreſtlings and differences, have yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
mercy to ſtand and ſuffer againſt prelacy, what ever cauſe they may have
to weep before the Lord over themſelves for ſaddeſt failings and unanſwerableneſs
to the work of their day? I moſt propoſe this on theſe grounds. 1. Though I
would be far from judging it to be deſigned, yet <hi>ex intentione operis,</hi> is it not too
viſibly inductive concurring with the ſame end, and intereſt both of the <hi>Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
party</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> and thus may give a ſadder thruſt, than is apprehended, at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65578:8"/>
the <hi>propheticall,</hi> as well as the <hi>kingly</hi> office of our bleſſed head? 2. That this
upon the matter is ſome way all one, as to ſilence them and caſt them out of the
Church: ſince it muſt needs tend to diſable and render them uſeleſs in their Maſters
work, what ever tends to break their credit, as Miniſters of the Goſpel. And
ſhould it not be deeply conſidered, if the charge be ſuch, and of that neceſſity to
follow for making them in a manner contemptible to the people, as the labour and
fervice of ſuch this day in the vineyard of the Lord may amount to. 3. What help
thus can the poor ignorant and impenitent ſinners have for their cure, if thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
and taught to turn their back on ſo many ſerious and godly Miniſters, whoſe
work hath had a convincing ſeal on many? And I hope with greateſt deſire would
ſeek the ſaving of ſouls, yea when the prophane, drunkards, ſwearers and worldlings
ſhall thus flee under ſuch a patrociny, that many if not moſt of the non-conforme
Miniſters of the Church are neither to be heard, nor owned, how ſad ſhould this
be? Or if they go that length, as to hear, yet with having them in ſuch contempt,
as without any dread or fear to ſlight their miniſteriall exhortations. And Oh! the
ſouls of many thus in hazard to be undone, and to run to their own deſtruction,
and take ſuch advantage, when ſo much is given to revile Miniſters known to be
unqueſtionably godly, and fixed in the Government of the Church, when they
would ſeek to draw them to repentance. This is no perſonall intereſt, nor will it be
found a light or ſmall matter, pretend who will to the contrary, to give a publick
thruſt at the credit of a <hi>Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who may yet have ſome ſervice for
his Maſter under his hand, and whoſe ſin being blotted out ſhall be for ever hid in
the day of their appearance before the great judge. Or thus rake up what we may
hope he hath covered. I remember what I heard preſſed in the time of the late diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
about the publick reſolutions after a communion before a moſt ſolemne audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and by one of the greateſt Miniſters of Chriſt I know then; yea when to the
conviction of all he was owned with greateſt evidence of the preſence of God. I
think, ſaith he, as to the ſad differences now in the Church, we ſhould with <hi>Shem</hi>
and <hi>Japhet</hi> take the mantle, and with our eyes ſhut go backward, and lay it upon
<hi>Noah,</hi> yet was he in his judgment fixt againſt the reſolution. 4. Hath not the
greateſt ſtrength which error and ſeduction have got in the Church of <hi>Brittain,</hi> moſt
viſibly followed on the reproach and ſubtile breaking of the credit of the Miniſters
of Chriſt? And what doth the Popiſh Adverſary more viſibly deſigne than this?
As <hi>Conzen a Jeſuite Polit.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. writes,<q>that the ſureſt way to reduce the
Church to Popery, was to have their great aim againſt the Miniſters of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, by blaſting of their reputation, as well as perſecuting of their
perſons.</q> 5. And how ſad may this be judged for ſuch, after many years toſſings,
and being expoſed to many ſore difficulties, to be made to ſuffer at laſt more from
friends, than publick Adverſaries, and thus be under both theſe rods at once. I write
this, I hope I may ſay, without the leaſt countenancing of whatever hath been
matter of grief or offence in the practice of any; but that I am preſſed from that due
reſpect I ow both to the perſons and Miniſtry of known able and godly Miniſters,
and ſtraiching the principles of the Church. 6. I muſt further add, that I fear it be
found a guilt lying heavy on <hi>Scotland,</hi> and on many Profeſſors there, beyond moſt
of the Reformed Churches this day, a high and daring contempt of the Miniſters of
Chriſt there, without reſpect to their former ſufferings, integrity and weight in the
Church, with a deſigned ſpreading and agreaging their infirmities, becauſe of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65578:9"/>
differences from them: for which we may yet fear this ſin be write in our judgment
by the Lord his recalling further his deſpiſed Meſſingers. And now whilſt it ſeemes
the plague of the time for many to hate and revile the Miniſtry of Chriſt, need they
be thus further killed and hardned with prejudice againſt ſuch a remedy, and that
theſe even by their friends ſhould be thus put to do their work with grief and not
with joy?</p>
            <p>I ſhall but further add, that it would be deeply pondered, how far the credit of
the truth, which is of more concerne than our ſouls are worth, hath been expoſed to
ſaddeſt reproach; how much reall exerciſe of ſoul in the ſerious and internall work
of Religion hath been made of late to reſolve in imbittering debates, and as it were
a drawing into parties. Oh! how muſt our care be yet further write in letters of
blood? That <hi>Rabies Theologorum,</hi> as it was tearmed in the <hi>German Church,</hi> was
ſuch as made ſome eminent Miniſters of Chriſt then to long for death, to get out of
ſuch a flame into that land of peace. We may not quite the leaſt of truth for the peace
and concord of the Church, nor can theſe be ever in oppoſite tearmes, but as we
make them, and I may with ſome confidence ſay, that what is now here writen,
hath been with a ſerious deſire in reſpect to both; but I hope ſome may ſpeak in the
words of <hi>Bucer,</hi> that for a ſafe healing, and to have it made effectuall to a broken
and rent Church now, they would judge it of that concerne, as if called and
helped of the Lord herein, to lay down their life for the ſame, and thus for their
brethren.</p>
            <p>I have been in ſome meaſure preſſed to write this, if I could with that ſingle
regard to the intereſt of the Lord thus deal with my own conſcience, and others.
And though I deſigned in as few words as poſſible, to ſpeak my heart herein, yet
muſt add a few things more on a ſubject, though very ſad, yet of much weight
and import.</p>
            <p>1. That it may be too viſibly the great want which is this day in the ſerious work
of Chriſtianity, and gives the ſaddeſt riſe to theſe high diſtempers now amongſt us,
that if theſe graces of the ſpirit were in more lively exerciſe, the love of Chriſt,
humility, patience and meekneſs, <hi>a putting on of bowells of mercy, tenderneſs
and compaſſion, as the Elect of God</hi> towards theſe we differ from, with more
ſevere ſelf judging, and ſuteable fear in judging, and condemning others, we are
commanded to have; this preſent difference ſhould never have come to a formed
breach in the Church; yea thus more advantage to the truth, and a more clear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
kept up thereto by a ſpirit of love. It hath been aſtoniſhing to ſee imbittering
heats and animoſity, with ſuch ſore thruſts at a diſtance to break the credit of others,
which are ſo viſible corruptions of corruption, yet plead a patrociny for the ſame.
O my friends, why is it ſo? The <hi>zeal</hi> of God muſt be for the <hi>Churches edification,</hi>
and alſo bring us thus under a conſtraint for union: the wiſdom that is from above,
and is pure, is peaceable, gentle and eaſy to be intreated, without hypocriſy and
without partiality. And do any feele the comforts and ſealings of the ſpirit with a
dividing and imbittered temper? It was a ſad rebuke the Diſciples of Chriſt got,
though on a juſt reſentment they had of the wrong done their Maſter, but that
tended more to deſtroy, than to gain, <hi>you know not of what ſpirit you are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Have we not hitherto ſeen, that on a ſmall remove and ſeceſſion in our Church
fellowſhip, ſuch have made more haſte than good ſpeed, nor have found it eaſy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to fixe, untill they have been a length their heart would ſome time have trembled
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65578:9"/>
at; yea thus beſides the wounding the heart of the godly, darkning the glory of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Goſpel, and ſhaking the faith of many, have been forced to run on ſaddeſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
and new principles to maintain their way. What ever length the difference
about the publick reſolutions of late came to (which was a viſible preſage of the
ſtroak that after came) yet was there no daſhing on ſuch a rock as this is now. And
we may know, that what ever tends to divide amongſt the godly, or betwixt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Miniſters, gets but too eaſy an hearing oft amongſt many, it is ſo ſib to our
corruption, and one of the ſtrongeſt luſts of the flesh.</p>
            <p>3. Is there not an undoubted neceſſity this day to eſſay to the fartheſt an <hi>union</hi>
and healing in the Church, when of no leſs import, than the keeping up of the
worſhip of God, the ſalvation of the people, the credit of the Goſpel, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the ſtumbling of many now in ſuch viſible hazard, which are more than our
ſouls are worth? And can we ſee how theſe ſhall be ſafe, if this breach be ſtill
widned? The longer continuance will make it the more difficult to heal, when on
all hands we are made to mourn, and ſee the iſſue, which we would not formerly
believe; and is not this a ſtrange rent and diſtemper in a day, when the Lord hath
caſt us all down, that our great work ſhould be to bear down others, with ſuch a
pronneſs to take offence, as well as there is in giving it, is one of the high provoking
cauſes of wrath and judgment, which as in greateſt letters, I muſt ſay, hath been
write before our eyes in the <hi>late providences of</hi> this time.</p>
            <p>4. Since each is concerned to prove his own heart and work herein, and what
may be his acceſſion to ſo highly a provoking guilt and ſtroak as threatens no leſs
than an utter quenching the light of the Goſpel in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to be overwhelmed
with <hi>Popery, Atheiſme,</hi> and all ungodlineſs, which ſo much gain ground by our
<hi>breach.</hi> It were well, if there could be ſo impartiall a ſearch herein, and triall
more of our ſelves, than by rolling it over on others, what may be our part therein;
and if theſe things bring not a ſad involvement in ſuch a guilt. 1. When there is no
tender abſtaining from harſh cenſuring of others. 2. When there is a preſſing more
of that which tends to divide, than what there is to unite, and in how far we are
ſtill one in our former principles. 3. When high prejudice, and alienation of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is not cloſly watched againſt, which like the predominant humour of the
jaundice, will quickly preſent all things in the ſame colours, and make it difficult
to judge of the way of others we differ from, without a ſad by aſs. 4. When con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings
even for the truth are more paſſionat and breaking, than with humble ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
to be rationally convincing and healing, which is ſo unlike the way of the
Lord, <hi>and in being defamed, yet to intreat.</hi> 5. When there is not ſome ſtudy to
walk cloſs together in ſo far as we are one, and mutually convinced, which I am
ſure would help to come more neer in what is now the matter of difference, I muſt
here confeſs for my ſelf, it hath been heavy on my ſpirit, that I did not with more
ſeriouſneſs, and according to my ſmall meaſure move herein, when laſt in my own
countrey, and had ſo neer a proſpect of theſe deplorable confuſions, nor have been
under that ſuteable weight, as ſuch a time calls for, when the Church there is as
ſtrugling betwixt life and death, though I may ſay, it hath oft made me covet a
hiding and more abſtractneſs from ſo ſad a noiſe: but O bleſſed they, to whom it
it ſhall be given to ſtand in ſuch <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> breach this day, ſo as it may be convincingly
evident the zeal of God, and a healing ſpirit do moſt ſweetly concurre.</p>
            <p>5. And what can we poſſibly anſwer to our own conſcience, and to all the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65578:10"/>
Reformed Churches this day, yea at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt, that now the
poor Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when in the furnace, and ſo long in a ſuffering condition,
is like to be more ruined by our ſelves, than by other Adverſaries; and ſuch a ſore
rent now amongſt theſe, who are ſtill one in <hi>doctrine, worship and Government,</hi>
and we hope have acceſs to the Father by the ſame ſpirit, as have in a ſad meaſure
broke up Church fellowſhip in the Goſpell ordinances, and in the moſt concerning
duties of Chriſtian ſociety amongſt many; yea this to be ſtill growing, and yet no
eſſay nor endeavour to prevent ſuch a ruine, that is like to be entailed even on the
offſpring, and what may be the thought of the generation that ſucceeds, when ſo
deplorable a hiſtory ſhall be put on record.</p>

         <div n="2" type="section">
            <head>SECTION II.</head>
            <p>IT may be ſtrange and matter of aſtoniſhment this day, what ſo ſevere a ſtretching
of that controverſy about the late <hi>Indulgence,</hi> in our Church, and bringing things
to ſuch ane extreme, can poſſibly meane? As though no party elſe were to contend
with, when the whole of Religion, is like to be ſwallowed up betwixt <hi>Popery,
Prelacy, and Atheiſme,</hi> and that the peace and true edification of the Church were
now ſo low and cheap, as to ſacrifice them upon ſuch ane account; yea, while ſo
many are in that hazard to be ſhaken, as they are like to loſe all ſetted perſwaſion of the
truth: but ſince ſuch ſtreſſe hath been by ſome layed on theſe grounds adduced in
the late <hi>Hiſtory of the Indulgence,</hi> for not hearing, or receaving the ordinances of
the Goſpell, from ſuch Miniſters as have accepted thereof, to a further widening
thus of the breach; and, that I have been expreſly referred thereto, as a full anſwer
to what is held forth in the forgoing <hi>Paper,</hi> or whatever can be ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
I was preſſed to ſome peruſall thereof, ſo far as to know whence a concluſion
ſo ſtrange, and of ſo high and univerſall concern to all the Churches, could poſſibly be
inferred or eſtabliſhed by any, who admit the Truth and Authrity of the Scriptures,
and theſe principles wherein we have hitherto walked. But ere I touch this more
particularly, I muſt, to prevent miſtakes, premitt ſome few things in the entry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is ſure the queſtion of <hi>Separation</hi> is one of the moſt difficult things,
and lyes more in the dark, then moſt things that are controverted; and that all acts
of extremity, ſuch as this, ſhould be with greateſt reluctation, and on convincing
and neceſſary grounds followed; nor can we ever ſee ſuch away hath in any time
been bleſſed, (how favourable ſoever it might ſeem in the eyes of ſome) which
hath tended to perplex and precipitantly to break a poor Church and how ſad a
mark is put thereon, by the holy Ghoſt, may be read <hi>Jude verſ.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though ſome ſeem too viſibly unconcerned, and in ſtead of being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
affected, to account this growing <hi>breach</hi> rather ane ornament and matter of
boaſting; yet, when ſeriouſly conſidered, of ſuch import is it, and that queſtion
anent Church fellowſhip and communion; as this may be truly called, <hi>Articulus
ſtantis &amp; cadentis Eccleſiae,</hi> and upon no leſſe hazard now, (if grace doe not marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
prevent) then the diſſolution of a Nationall Church: and is not that <hi>James</hi> 3.
16. written in greateſt letters this day before us, <hi>that where ſtrife is there is confuſion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65578:10"/>
and every evill work,</hi> and that thus both the work of converſion and intereſt of the
Goſpell is moſt viſibly obſtructed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We muſt take no meaſure of preſent duty, from the event, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
propoſalls or eſſayes ſhould be for any compoſure or healing now in the
Church, I hope, I may ſay, it is no ſinfull tampering, or with any ceding or lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in the leaſt, in the matter of God; but let truth ſtill have the firſt place, for I
ſhould reckon any ſuch peace with greateſt terrour, which might cauſe a breach with
God: <hi>have ſalt in your ſelfes, and peace one with another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is not the caſe of the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> or the acceptance thereof by any of
our Brethren, that is now the controverſy amongſt us, nor is here touched further,
then a neceſſary oppoſing, ſo ſtrange and unjuſt inferences, as hath been made
thence, to make this difference ſeem greater then it is; and for renting the poor
Church; but it is known when that deſign of the Magiſtrate was ſet on foot, what
ſutable and ſerious freedome (in the opportune ſeaſon) was uſed to prevent any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
among us, and to keep of any concurrence therewith, yet with that due and
tender reſpect to there Miniſtry, with whom we herein differed, to prevent any
publick rent or breach, and as we judged theſe moſt ſutably conſiſtent, ſo it is ſure,
the thoughts of ſuch things, we now ſee, and of ſuch a ſpirit as is now aloft would
have made our hearts then tremble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly,</hi> I doubt not that this great duty will be acknowledged by all, if it had a
ſutable weight on us, in ſuch a day, to adore the holy and ſpotleſſe righteouſneſſe
of God in what he hath done, and ly in the duſt before him, againſt whom we have
ſinned, and be much in humble and ſerious ſelfjudging; for we ſhould tremble
either to juſtifie or extenuate the ſad declinings which hath been in our Church, in
theſe later times, from that <hi>firſt love,</hi> tenderneſs and zeall for God, and the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of his truth; yea mourn, that ſo ſad a faint hath been among us, and deſpondency
of ſpirit, for ſuch a ſutable, <hi>unite,</hi> and ſolemne appearance, as was called for in bearing
<hi>teſtimony</hi> againſt theſe invaſions made on the Kindome of our bleſſed Maſter, whilſt
many opportunities hath been too viſibly loſt of this great duty by us al.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly,</hi> Yet upon the other hand we muſt not ſhut our eyes, nor conceall ſuch a
ground of hope, and token for good, that the Lord will not deſtroy, but dwell in
our land, that he hath accepted a <hi>teſtimony</hi> by the ſufferings of his poor people,
even of all ranks now for theſe years paſt, who have cheerfully endured, with much
long-ſuffering, ſome unto death, baniſhment, impriſonment, and the ſpoiling of
their goods, as I may adventure to ſay, upon this account a greater <hi>teſtimony</hi> hath
not been given to the way of the Lord, and his truth in our Church, ſince the firſt
begun Reformation from Popery; yea, that what ever be theſe ſad deplorable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
now amongſt us, yet are they not ſtated upon a publick diſowning of any
principle of truth either in doctrine, worſhip, or Government; and hopes, that
many of theſe who are moſt ſeverly reflected on by ſome, would through grace, (if
called to publick confeſſion, of the <hi>glorious headship and ſupremacy, of our bleſſed
Head, King, and Lawgiver to his Church,)</hi> not account their life dear unto the death,
to be offered up as a ſacrifice thereon: Wherein I judge as is meet, and with more
peace of minde now when I write this, then to judge with that ſeverity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emtorineſſe,
which have been by ſome, againſt their Brethren, and fellow-ſervants
this day. I ſhall but add, that what is here touched, hath been with ſome deſire and
aime, to keep a diſtance from any <hi>perſonall reflections,</hi> or to provoke and give a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65578:11"/>
thruſt at the repute of any; but Oh, if a delivering ourſelfes up to the truth, were
reckoned to be the greateſt <hi>Victory,</hi> and however provoked or injured, yet by <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of the truth</hi> to their conſciences, in a humble, tender, and convincing
way to deall with ſuch; ſurely, this ſhould be matter of peace and joy in the ſhutting
up of our dayes, and not to have <hi>recompenced evill with evill,</hi> but to have thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
the gaining the ſoul of their Brother, <hi>by overcoming evill with good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having premitted theſe, I muſt touch alittle ſome <hi>grounds</hi> layed down in that
<hi>hiſtory of the Indulgence,</hi> for not hearing of the indulged Miniſters; and ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
as ſeem to have been taken, for a ſtretching this difference ſo far, as to break
of Church communion and fellowſhip with theſe, whom yet they dare not but own
as the Meſſengers of Chriſt to his Church; which I muſt ſay upon ſome ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
hath been aſtoniſhing to ſee, ſo high a charge and arguments adduced
there, and with ſuch confidence followed, which, if fearched unto, by any ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and unbyaſſed Reader, may enforce them to ſee, the concluſion would ſeem
to have been eſtabliſhed befor the premiſſes; though in this as to the tendency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and theſe ſad and deplorable conſequences that are like to follow, I hope, was
neither deſigned, nor forſeen by the <hi>Author,</hi> to whoſe memory, (if ſuch as is pretended
to be) <hi>I</hi> doe own great reſpects, and to have no further reflection on what is
there, then the truth, which muſt have preference to all, indiſpenſibly requires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We may ſee in ſtead of <hi>Arguments,</hi> ſome high and confident aſſertions,
where I muſt ſay, the enditement goes above the evidence; and that (1.) There
is both ane impoſing of a <hi>ſenſe</hi> upon their Brethrens practiſe, and a being judge alſo
themſelfes; and ſuch a ſenſe, as theſe who have been known moſt averſe from any
acceptance of that <hi>Indulgence,</hi> yet can neither ſee nor admitt; but how hard is it,
in a dividing time, when all humors are ſo much aloft, to cenſure without ſlander.
(2.) Here is a preſſing of that <hi>ſenſe</hi> on this practiſe, which themſelves doe with a
profeſſed abhorrence diſown; whoſe candour and ſincerity otherwayes, in the
greateſt concerns of Religion, I hope, none dare debate; and how ſad is it, when
deductions, and inferences, are rather forced, then found, from the way of
others, and a deſigne more to defame, and make things worſe, then they are to
reclaime: and to urge things beyond their due weight: there is a rigide and ſevere
proſecution even in things lawfull, that brings much ſcandall on Religion, and the
way of the Lord, ſo as to make many ſcarr and take a judgment thereof by this
practiſe, which yet, is ſo full of a holy ſweetneſſe and condeſcendence. (3.) What
is held forth there, as it too obviouſly exceeds, ſo it is a diveſting of the matter, of
theſe juſt extenuating circumſtances that it is capable of, whilſt no cenſure ſhould
extend further according to the rule, then what neceſſarly muſt be inferred from the
fact: for that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. commanded <hi>Charity, which thinketh no evill of our Brother,</hi>
ſo alſo reaſoneth no evill, ſo as to put ane harder conſtruction then it can juſtly hear,
as if there were ſome deſire, to have ſuch ane advantage to ſpeak evill, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete
doubtfull things in the worſt ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For theſe <hi>multiplied diviſions</hi> of many arguments, and a ſtrange em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
of ane accumulative defection from the truth, and falling in with <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianiſme;</hi>
I confeſs was aſtoniſhing, what ſuch a heaping up of theſe ſhould meane,
with ſo viſible a coincidence upon the matter, as if to repeat the very ſame thing,
though in another form twenty, or thirty times over, could thus have the more
weight: but we know, arguments muſt be weighed, and not numbered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65578:11"/>
               <hi>Thirtly,</hi> And is there not to viſible a tendency of all theſe high aggravations,
and reaſonings there upon, to cauſe a further breach, and ſtretch this difference,
beyond, either what was needfull, or expedient, for edification, in making that
a ſtumbling block for many to break themſelfes on, which was not ſo before; and
thus in ſhunning one extreme, hath ruſhed both themſelfes, and others, one another,
as is like, (if the Lord prevenr not) to cauſe a further ſtated diviſion in other points
of truth; and to what a ſad extreme now are things thus come; when it is ſo expreſly
declared in the <hi>preface to that Hiſtory,</hi> that he can pray for nothing elſe in behalf of
the indulged Miniſters, <hi>but repentance, and untill that, may have no ſute elſe to God
in their behalf;</hi> which is ane expreſſe denying to pray for the ſucceſſe of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
and edification of the people, untill they be once convinced, and have changed
their judgment: yea, thus could not joine with ſuch in prayer, upon any other
ſute that they ſhould put up for themſelfes, before the Lord. I ſhould wiſh this had
been ſo cautioned, as any ſafe or warrantable ſenſe, could have been put on ſo
ſtrange ane aſſertion, otherwiſe the communion of the ſaints, and the doctrine of
the Church herein, muſt undeniably be made void.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That here is a moſt ſad, and unwarrantable overſtretching of this
<hi>controverſy,</hi> (in ſo high a charge, as is thus brought, of <hi>Eraſtianiſme,</hi> and ane <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
formall, receiving of their Miniſtry from Magiſtrate)</hi> I muſt humbly judge,
is unanſwerable on theſe grounds. (1.) That thus, is charged upon them and their
practiſe, for having yeelded up more to the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> then is ſo much, as once
ſought or required by them, in that <hi>Act of Indulgence;</hi> ſince that which is expreſly
ſhewed there, is, that they allow and permitt ſuch the publick exerciſe of their
Miniſtry, in theſe reſpective places where they ſhould be confyned, to be without
hazard of law. (2.) Becauſe, (and, I hope, none will queſtion it) their <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi>
and the validity thereof, and that they did alſo exerciſe the ſame, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of any hazard from the law, before any ſuch <hi>Indulgence</hi> was, is ſufficiently
known. (3.) Whatever difference hath been in the application, yet their publick
adherence, to the ſame principles, in the point controverted is undenyable, only
they judge their practiſe herein, to be conſiſtent therewith, whilſt queſtioned by
others, which is the very ſtate of this preſent caſe. (4.) I hope none dare judge
theſe our Brethren (whatever difference of judgment be herein) or charge them
with wilfull errour, or controuling their light and conſcience in this matter, but
that they have walked accordingly; (and I muſt ſo judge as is meet) but if any will
aſſume ane authority both to judge, and paſſe ſentence on the conſcience of ſuch,
whom they know to be ſerious, tender, and judicious, in the matters of truth;
I cannot anſwer this, but muſt leave them to anſwer that great infallible rule of the
Scriptures of truth herein; but I muſt ſay, the putting of ſo a ſtrange a <hi>gravamen,</hi>
and exaggerating of this practiſe ſo far beyond all bounds, hath ſeemd ſtrange to mee,
how poſſibly ſuch could be without ſome fear and dread, (how light ſo ever it ſeem
now to ſome) of being found guilty of a ſad breach of the <hi>ninth command:</hi> and ſince
all ſhould <hi>prove their own work,</hi> I humbly think, they ſhould be as competent
judges in the truth of their profeſſion, and of what they have ſo ſolemnly declared,
as any elſe. (5.) Here alſo is a viſible oppoſing of them to themſelfes, in ſo far as
their declaration before the Councill, and ſet down in that Hiſtory is evident, and
hath theſe very words publickly, before the Magiſtrate: <hi>(We have receaved our
Miniſtry from Jeſus Chriſt, with full preſcriptions from him, for regulating us therein,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65578:12"/>
and muſt be accountable to him,)</hi> and if theſe ſo publickly owned this, and ſpoke the
ſame in truth, and ſincerity; then theſe ſtrange aſſertions ſo frequently renewed
there, even to the readers <hi>nauſeating,</hi> upon ſuch ane account of there having taken
their Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate, muſt be undenyably falſe: beſides its known
(and ſhould we deny what is juſt to our Brethren upon ſuch ane account,) their
practicall witneſs, and counteracting of any inſtructions impoſed on them by the
Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly,</hi> There ſeems much endeavour to invalidate any <hi>declaration,</hi> which was
then given before the Councell, upon the omiſſion of that clauſe, <hi>only,</hi> and that
though they owned their Miniſtry to be from Jeſus Chriſt, and to receave directions
from him for the exerciſe thereof, that, yet, this clauſe, <hi>only,</hi> was <hi>deliberatly</hi>
left out, and the <hi>Authors</hi> of that <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſeems the more preſſed herein, elſe their
whole ſcope were fruſtrate, ſince none could debate this to have been then, a full
and clear confeſſion of their Miniſtry, as from Chriſt alone, and independant on
the Magiſtrate, and therefore are concerned to prove, that this, <hi>only,</hi> was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
omiſſion, which I muſt confeſſe a ſtrange reaſoning to any diſcerning Reader,
that <hi>page</hi> 130. <hi>argum.</hi> 12. they with ſuch confidence ſay, <hi>it is apparent the indulged did
deliberatly shun to ſay, they had there Miniſtry only from Chriſt,</hi> and yet <hi>page</hi> 24. when
they give the reaſon why this was deliberatly done, becauſe it was <hi>deſigned by ſome,
(ſayes the Author) if I be not miſinformed:</hi> and muſt the whole ſtreſſe of moſt of their
arguments, be layed over upon their deſigne, and intention herein, and no leſſe
then a judiciall for faulture of their Miniſtry thence inferred, whilſt they are, yet,
put to confeſſe ane uncertainty, whither they were rightly enformed anent this,
yea, or no, or if this omiſſion was truly deliberate: and ſince this is a publick fixing,
a moſt high ſcandall on ſo many Miniſters of Chriſt, it would have been expected to
be with the furtheſt evidence to convince others, and that they are in caſe for
the full, and <hi>judiciall,</hi> out making thereof, when required; if they would give
that meaſure they expect from others, and which the Scripture indiſpenſibly requires
in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly,</hi> It is ſtrange, ſo ſudden a determining, and publiſhing the private judgings
of ſome, in a matter of ſuch weight and univerſall concern, without ſo much as a
previous communicating in Councill herein, with the muſt tender of their Brethren,
whom they would in charity judge to be ſerious, and have the Councill of God with
them, yea, this without laying down any ſuch convincing grounds, as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to juſtifie ſo ſtrange a practiſe, as the departure from fellowſhip in the publick
ordinances, with ſo great a part of the Church; as though this had no weight in
this day, for the ſpirit of the Prophets being ſubject to the Prophets. I muſt ſay,
though ſome ſhould own an <hi>revelation,</hi> or extraordinary <hi>impulſe</hi> in this, yet, ſo
far, it might have been judged, they might have keept of, as not to vent the ſame
in ane diſorderly and unſutable way; or adventure to bring in ſo ſtrange a practiſe,
and of ſo publick concern in the <hi>Church,</hi> without the <hi>Church;</hi> or to exerce their
private judgment, over the whole of their Brethren. The <hi>Apoſtle Paull,</hi> tho imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
called by Chriſt, <hi>yet would goe up to Jeruſalem to conferre with the Brethren;</hi> nor
would <hi>Paull and Barnabas</hi> together, adventure to determine in that difference at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
untill it was brought to the Apoſtles: the ſame ſpirit which leads unto all <hi>truth,</hi>
does alſo lead unto <hi>Humility,</hi> and to the furtheſt tender condeſcendence in Brethrens
dealling with other; nor ſhould it be light, whatever may be the private thoughts
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65578:12"/>
of ſome, in a matter of truth, to doe any thing precipitantly which may diſturb the
Church: and now when it is ſtrugling as if between life and death, was this a time
to drive with ſuch heat this preſent breach, and in a way to defame, more then
to convince and gaine, and with ſuch a height of ſevere reflection on all that comes
not to their meaſure this way, as if to be <hi>pious, and peacable</hi> at once, were wholly
inconſiſtent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sevently,</hi> And what ſhould it meane, or is it ſutable to that candour and tender
reſpect, which we owe to the <hi>Author</hi> of the late <hi>Apology,</hi> to ſet down theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he hath there for not hearing of the <hi>Curats,</hi> for not hearing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged;
and herein, to oppoſe him to himſelf, and his own expreſly declared ſenſe
to the countrary, whilſt now by his death he cannot anſwer. But his own words
there, I hope, will not be denyed, which yow may read <hi>pag.</hi> 128. and there alſo
ſee, a vigorous oppoſition to the <hi>indulgence</hi> yet without any breach or dividing
from theſe worthy Miniſters, who have accepted thereof, are no wayes incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent.
<q>Amongſt the many deſignes aimed at, (ſaid that Author) in this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and in part obtained, we know the breakings and dividing of our party
was a principall one; but, we hope, without the fruit our Adverſaries expected;
for whatever difference there hash been, and yet is among us, in our practiſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the indulgence, we are all agreed in our preceeding exceptions againſt it,
and if there had been acceſſe for repreſenting the ſame to the Rulers, our unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and concord in theſe had been more diſcovered and known to the world;
there is no change with us, of our known and profeſſed judgment anent the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church, in its diſtinction from, and independency on the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate;
ſome who take hold on all occaſions to reproach us, are pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
their acceptance of this <hi>indulgence,</hi> as contradictory to, and inconſiſtent
with our former profeſſed principles in Church Government; yet, any that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
what was ſhortly hinted at in the Councell, at the receiving of this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and what was more largly declared by them, to their congregations at firſt
entry, will be ſufficiently convinced of our conſtant adherence to former princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which by this acceptance is not at all changed: thus for he.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> But if the declared judgments, and authority of ſome may influence
any to a more implicite falling in with this way; I muſt yet further crave leave, to
oppoſe the judgment of one, who, I ſuppoſe, may have the ſame weight and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in this caſe, it is the <hi>Author of the true Non-conformiſt,</hi> who in his clearing
the duty of forbearance to hear the <hi>Curats,</hi> hath theſe words which I cited, in the
firſt Paper, <hi>Page</hi> 196. <q>I freely acknowledge, that if God had permitted this
whole Church to ſlide into the preſent evills of Prelacy, and thereafter had bleſſed
it with a diſcovery; yet, I would not admitt in that condition the ſame neceſſity
and expediency of ſeparation, that I now finde, to plead with for a non complyance,
in as much as our preſent non-complyance, was not only a more ſeaſonable and
ſafe duty, but alſo was attended with a faithfull and edifying adherence, to our
true and ſent Teachers. And <hi>page</hi> 194. hath theſe words, that ſeparation is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from ane union, once acknowledged, even in theſe things, that are in
themſelfes not condemned, and thus does moſt expreſly determine, the unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableneſs
of falling of from Church fellowship with the indulged Miniſters on
that head, after ſo known and acknowledged union with theſe in the publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
even after the acceptance of the indulgence, till of late, but that you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65578:13"/>
may know, what is the ſenſe and declared judgment of this <hi>Author,</hi> in this caſe,
I ſhall give you now further his own words, <hi>pag.</hi> 487. oppoſing himſelf herein to
theſe ſharp reflections of G. B. But you doe not only make your Non-conformiſt
to cede as it were to your reaſonings; but in a manner to own the late pretended
indulgence, as flowing from the ſupremacy, as on purpoſe to fix on theſe few
Miniſters of ours, who have been thereby reſtored, at leaſt a conſtructive appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of this evill. And there in the following page has theſe words. But not to
loſe time in theſe triflings, I differ from your Non-conformiſt, and am ſo much
againſt the ſupremacy, that <hi>I</hi> abominate the <hi>indulgence</hi> under this name, but that
God has diſpoſed the King to reſtore in any meaſure what was ſo ſinfully taken
away, we account it a great bleſſing, wiſhing that he may be in ſuch manner ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied
with the fruits of this courſe, as may more and more convince him of its
righteouſneſs, and encourage him to its proſecution. But if you, or any think,
by this poor and ſcant reſtitution, to bribe the Lords people, to the reſt of your
uſurpations; we truſt the Lord will deliver his own; and that as hitherto, our
Miniſters has looked upon themſelfes as ſuch, neither of Man, nor only by Man;
but by Jeſus Chriſt and God the Father;</q> ſo they will accordingly acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfes,
and in a ſpeciall manner teſtify for his right and ordinance, againſt all invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and that ſo much the more, as the hard condition of the preſent times, hath
engaged them to an ſeeming allowance of that of which they ought to purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfes
in the firſt place: thus you ſee what is the declared judgment of that <hi>Author</hi>
in this preſent caſe, yea, how far he is a length herein; and I hope non will
queſtion his ſpeaking his light, and judgment in this ſincerly; but that we may ſee
different judgments and apprehentions in this caſe ſhould not ſeeme ſo ſtrange now
in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nintly,</hi> But ſince ſo great a weight is layed on this, that the <hi>indulged</hi> Miniſters
are in the ſame claſſe, and caſe, with theſe who are <hi>Prelatick,</hi> yea, ſeems rather
to hold them out as worſe; I muſt now affer ſome few things on this head, for any
diſcerning Reader to conſidere. (1.) How viſibly this hath tended, to a ſad heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
the preſent breach; that the juſt grounds, whereon we have keept ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the hearing of ſuch, hath not been more weighed, and underſtood; and
how theſe can give no poſſible warrant, to make the ſame inference in this preſent
controverſy. (2.) That the ſtretching of this by ſome to ſo great a height, as to
take <hi>arguments</hi> hence, for forbearing to hear, ſo many eminently godly and able
Non-conformed Miniſters, upon this head of the <hi>indulgence;</hi> would truly ſeem,
as if deſigned, rather to weaken its ſtrenth againſt the <hi>Prelatick</hi> party, and give
ſuch, to ſad ane advantage againſt us, in this day. (3.) Since it is not in <hi>theſi,</hi> or
without a due conſideration of theſe ſpeciall grounds, and juſt concurrence of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
in the complex caſe now of our Church, this can be underſtood for not
hearing of the <hi>Curats,</hi> but as ſuch, which in a ſpeciall way muſt be ſtated by it ſelf:
(for it might otherwiſe tend, to a ſad prejudice to the truth, and publick intereſt of
the Reformed Churches, and run unawares on a very evident precipice) I muſt
therefore beſeech and obteſt, that this may be more adverted to, and that we may
know how ſutably to give a reaſon, of our light and practiſe herein, upon clear
and evident grounds for which I ſhall offer theſe. (1.) That with the late erection
of Prelacy, there was then no departure from any <hi>acknowledged union</hi> with ſuch,
but a <hi>ſimple Non-complyance,</hi> and a publick owning and adhering to theſe faithfull
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65578:13"/>
Non-conformed Miniſters, under whom they had been formerly ſed; though it
is true, that not a few after, when their heart was touched by the word, fell more
of from hearing of ſuch, upon ſo diſcernible difference, they found among them,
and the <hi>Non conformed</hi> Miniſters. (2.) That here is no dark or controverted caſe,
in our Church, as to the evill and dreadfulneſſe of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and of any acceſſion to
ſtrengthen that intereſt, but that wherein we are explicitly ſworn to by the oath of
God, to endeavour, in our ſeverall places and ſtations, the extirpation of, and
thus, ſhould be preſſed to keep at furtheſt diſtance from any tendency, to ſtrenthen
the ſame; yea, while ſuch ſevere acts and threatenings of the Councill, hath been
iſſued out there upon, does make this the more a caſe of confeſſion, tho they ſhould
be eaſily ſatisfied this day if all ſhould forbear to hear the <hi>indulged.</hi> (3.) That
forbearance now to hear the <hi>Curats,</hi> is in a caſe, wherein the previous cognition,
and authoritative judgment of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and generall aſſemblies
thereof, hath by a judiciall procedure, been ſo expreſſe and full thereanent; yea,
though not the ſame individuall perſons, yet in the very ſame caſe, conformity to
<hi>Prelacy</hi> hath been upon a clear, publick, and judiciall tryall, moſt ſolemnly judged
and ſentenced, by the indicatories of our Church; which ſheweth the great diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
betwixt this, and a few private perſons, taking on them, to judge and ſentence
their Brethren, upon a practiſe under ſuch debate this day, among the moſt ſeriouſly
godly in the land, yea, this in expreſſe oppoſition to the judgment of moſt of the
Non-conformiſts in our Church. (4.) This diſcernible difference is here alſo,
and may be convincing to all, as we are on all hands ſo fully one in acknowledging
of the truth, as we can debate theſe ſad differences among us, upon common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which are mutually conſented to, and does not divide in the ſame center,
whilſt by the Conformiſts there is ſo publick and profeſſed among of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> as both
there principles and practiſe are ſtated in ane expreſſe oppoſition. (5.) It is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable
likewayes, that the intruſion of moſt of ſuch as are Conformiſts, amongſt
theſe where they fixed, can have no place here; ſince, ſo far as I know, none
that accepted the <hi>indulgence,</hi> have wanted ſome expreſſe call from, and conſent of
both the Elderſhip and people, and however, that act of the Councell was antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
thereto, yet, were they neither commanded nor obliged, to any election of
theſe more then of others, by that act; but hath it left to their own conſent, whether
to call them or not. (6.) Nor can it be ſaid, that ſuch who were <hi>indulged,</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
theſe who hath that liberty to their own congregations) did come under any
further relation, but to exerce their Miniſtry there, upon mutuall conſent, where
they had more free and peacable acceſſe, and without prejudice, to any former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or tye, to their congregations.</p>
            <p>Laſtly I muſt further adde, with ſome aſtoniſhement at what is declared intent of
theſe <hi>arguments,</hi> adduced there that it is <hi>to vindicate the practice of ſuch as ſcruple to own or
hear any indulged Miniſters,</hi> &amp; thus to fix them who were bot heſitant before, to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
falling of from the hearing of ſuch, the tendency of which &amp; whether this would
lead, I muſt judge hath not been apprehended or advented to, and that theſe ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
would neceſſarily fallow thereon; firſt to lay a ſtumbling block in the way of
many thouſands of the people, who had no ſuch <hi>ſcruple</hi> herein ſo far as to prejudge, &amp;
weaken their edification by their Miniſtry; yea thus fruſtrat that ſucceſs and fruit
their work of the Goſpell might have; and Oh! muſt the ſcrupling of ſome few
be thus publickly vindicated, at ſo dear a rate as the too viſible hazard of ſo many
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65578:14"/>
immortall ſouls in taking them either wholly off or marring their profit in the
publick ordinances diſpenſed by ſo many able, and ſerious Miniſters of Chriſt; and
how very ſad a <hi>conſequence</hi> is this alſo to fix perpetuat a formed rent in the
Church, by laying thus down <hi>dividing principles</hi> (I muſt ſay not according to the
<hi>doctrine of Chriſt that we have receaved)</hi> to ſalve a <hi>dividing practice,</hi> which otherwiſe
we might hope, ſhould have ere now worn out; but there they expreſly fix the
unlawfulneſs of hearing any of theſe, ſo long as that caſe exist of their being indulged
except upon that ſuppoſall which I hope through grace ſhall never take place of
there being no preaching Miniſtry els in the whole Church, and thus doeth lay
down a new rule, and precedent buit with that diſadvantage that I humbly judge its
greateſt weight, and inforcement moſt be from the authority of the impoſers,
though of ſuch ane import as upon the matter it is noe leſs then to ſentence; yea, ſome
way <hi>unchurch</hi> all theſe congregations who own &amp; adhere to their Miniſtry. I thought
it a grave remark of a choiſe and eminent Miniſter of Chriſt, in thir late times upon
this head; <q>I could, ſayes he, relate many ſad ſtories of perſons profeſſing godlineſs,
who out of diſlike begane at firſt to ſeparate from our Church meetings, and after
many changes are turned now ſome <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſome <hi>Ranters</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi>
               </q> theſe
are his very words with this reaſon he did give thereof, that ſuch as fall off from
the publick worſhip are like a Man tumbling down a hill that never leaves, till he
come to the bottom.</p>

            <p>QUEST. I. What the <hi>indulgence</hi> is? About which, ſo high, and continued
a breach, is thus in our Church: for I have found a ſtrange noiſe and clamor, by
ſome, upon this account, who did not yet underſtand, what this truly was; beſides,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65578:14"/>
that aſtoniſhment that it cauſeth to ſtrangers abroad, about what the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
is this day, in ſuch a flame. I ſhall give but this ſhort, and plain account of
it. <q>It was ane order, and appointment of the Magiſtrate, to ſome Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Miniſters, who were expreſly named; to repaire to ſuch places, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
there confined; permitting, and allowing them to preach, and exerce the
others parts of their miniſteriall function, in the ſaid reſpective places, or pariſhes,
where they were thus confined.</q> This is the very ſubſtance, of the <hi>laſt act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
of date Sept.</hi> 3. 1672. and the former <hi>Act of Indulgence,</hi> which preceeded
ſome years before that, being upon the matter, one, and the ſame, only without
any ſentence of <hi>Confinement,</hi> I need not further mention, that about the acceptance
of this, there was ſome difference in judgment, amongſt the moſt ſerious both Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
and Miniſters in our Church, and with ſome free, plain, and tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning
among themſelfes, upon ſuch ane account; but, I may ſay, without any
deſigned tendency, to any ſuch breach, as ſome of late have made it their very work
to promote.</p>
            <p>QUEST. II. It may be needfull to know, how far there is yet, ane undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>onneſſe</hi> and agreement, among the true Non-conformed Miniſters, and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
of our Church, notwithſtanding of this preſent difference, about the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> to which I muſt anſwer, in theſe few. (1.) That we are
one, in a joint confeſſion, and publick owning of the ſame doctrine, worship,
and Government, as formerly: whatever by all of us, ſhould be ſadly regrated,
as to the want of that freedome, in ſuch a publick teſtimoy thereto, before Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
as theſe ſad encroachments hath been made, upon the Government of the
Church, eſtabliſhed by our bleſſed Head and Maſter, did in this day require.
(2.) That whatever hath been thus wanting in practiſe, (Oh! that we could truly
mourn over the ſame) yet, are we ſtill one, and agreed upon both ſides, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
and, I hope, ſerious diſowning, both <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and <hi>Eraſtianiſme</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Scripture. (3.) In this alſo are we one, that whatever the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>
hath aſſumed; yet, that he hath no juſt right and power, or is in the leaſt proper
for him, to judge of the ſpirituall condition and ſtate of the people, as to the fitted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Miniſters for labouring amongſt them; and thus to make application of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to particular places, for the exerciſe of their Miniſtry there; which is alone
proper and competent, to the ordering and cognition of the Church; this, ſo far,
as I know, is upon no ſide either owned or approven. (4.) Herein likewayes, doe
we jointly agree, that to none it belongs, but to our bleſſed Head and Lawgiver,
to preſcribe, and give <hi>rules</hi> to his ſervants, for the exerciſe of their Miniſtry; and
that theſe <hi>rules,</hi> we can only own and acknowledge, which he hath given, for the
ſame, to us, in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>QUEST. III. I know it is of greateſt weight, now to be conſidered, and,
wherein the <hi>ſtate of this controverſy</hi> much lyes; if there be ground, or warrant from
the Scripture, and doctrine of the Reformed Churches, to <hi>break of Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with theſe who have accepted of this late <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and refuſe ſuch as the
Miniſters of Chriſt, and by his autority, diſpenſers of the myſtery of the Goſpell,
upon this preſent <hi>difference,</hi> now held forth. I know, they doe not aſſert in that
<hi>Hiſtory of the Indulgence,</hi> this to be <hi>ſimpliciter</hi> ſinfull, to hear either ſuch, or the <hi>Curats,</hi>
but it is only in caſe, that no preaching Miniſtry were elſe in the land; otherwayes
doth moſt expreſly allow, and warrant a forbearing to hear ſuch, as theſe, who
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65578:15"/>
hath fallen under no leſſe, then a judiciall forfeiture of their Miniſtry, in ſo far, as
they have accepted of that <hi>Indulgence:</hi> and herein, doth in effect impoſe upon
the conſcience of the people, to rack and diſquiet their minde; ſo as many
through fear and ignorance upon this account, knowes not what to doe. Now to this
<hi>queſtion,</hi> I muſt give this plain and expreſſe <hi>anſwer,</hi> that it ſeemes a moſt convincingly
ſinfull, and offenſive practiſe, without any juſt cauſe, or warrant followed; which,
I here offer, to demonſtrate, from theſe following <hi>grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. That <hi>no Scripture command, or warrant is for the ſame,</hi> from the <hi>example</hi> of our
bleſſed Lord, nor was ever taught by his Prophets, &amp; Apoſtles, &amp; therefore ane unjuſt
and offenſive rent. I hope, this none dar debate, that the Scripture is the alone
inſtrument, and Rule of Church Government, and to this <hi>Law, and Teſtimony,</hi>
we muſt take ourſelfes, under every debateable caſe theranent; yea that any mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall
power given to us, is only <hi>executive,</hi> and <hi>declarative,</hi> to apply the revealed
will of the Lord unto his people, by a clear diſcovery thereof; and what is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that rule, none may admitt, though under the patrociny of ane Angell:
but that, for this practiſe we have no Scripture warrant, is moſt clear. (1.) From
the <hi>example</hi> of our bleſſed head himſelf, while he was here, upon the earth, and that
reſpect, he did expreſly own to the preſcribed worſhip, of the Jewiſh Church; yea,
that ſuch was his bleſſed way, as no viſible rent was by diſciples, from the publick
ordinances, even then, when the dreadfull declinings of that Church, was ſo great
a length. (2.) We ſee what both the <hi>Prophets and Apoſtles</hi> taught, and what was
their practiſe in this caſe, that as on the one hand, they ſought to keep the people
at furtheſt diſtance from all idolatry and falſe worſhip; ſo upon the other hand did
give no warrant, but expreſly to the contrary, as to any departure from the publick
worſhip, where it was not corrupted, notwithſtanding of theſe ſad declinings of
the Church otherwiſe; and I crave any to ſhew ane inſtance to the contrary. (3.)
Nothing can be more evident, then the care the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had to keep the <hi>Church of
Corinth</hi> from daſhing on ſuch a rock, to ſuch as doe but ſeriouſly read and conſider
theſe Epiſtles: nor doth our bleſſed Maſter, to the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> give the leaſt
ground or warrant, as to any falling of, or ſeceſſion, from the publick aſſemblies,
notwithſtanding of ſo ſad a charge, as is there given againſt ſome of theſe Churches:
but we may ſee, how concerned the Apoſtle was againſt this, as one of the publick
evills and ſcandalls, then breaking up in the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 25. <hi>the forſaking of
the aſſemblies,</hi> for the publick worſhip of God, as the manner of ſome was then:
and Oh! what can it mean? thus to rack the conſciences of the people, and
impoſe ſuch new terms and conditions of <hi>Church communion,</hi> as neither the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor examples of the pureſt Reformed Churches ſince the Apoſtles time, did
ever warrant; for which, I muſt here humbly challenge, any, who are otherwiſe
minded, to let us ſee, where the ſignature of one Scripture command is, for what
they impoſe; or what divine precept is violated by hearing the <hi>indulged;</hi> or if ſuch
a cure, and remedy, was ever taught by the great healer, as this practiſe, of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
no compoſure and <hi>uniting</hi> in controverted duties, untill there be a full onneſſe of
judgment among us; or thus to break and diſquiet a poor Church, (as though ſome
had no work elſe) almoſt outwearied with theſe ſad, and perpetuall contendings,
for making void their Miniſtry, which hath been and, I hope, yet ſhall be owned
of the Lord for his peoples edification.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Ground,</hi> to demonſtrate the unwarrantableneſſe of this practiſe, is this; that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65578:15"/>
it is expreſly <hi>contrare to that eſtablished order of Chriſt in his Church,</hi> as the proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
and releife, for any publick offences, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18: 15. and which is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
a rule given in this caſe, as can admit of no alteration; as alſo to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
14: 40. <hi>that all things should be done in order and decency:</hi> nor can there be any heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
herein, whether this practiſe and way, which is thus taken by ſome, does not
controll the ſame; thus to withdraw, and impoſe (upon the matter) ſo high and
publick a cenſure on others, by their private judgment and authority, except they
will adventure to determine on the <hi>rule,</hi> and theſe ancient Scripture bounds which
are there ſet to us; but as it is ſure, the things of Chriſt, muſt be by his warrant only,
&amp; no latitude elſe given us, but to obſerve he whatſoever commands <hi>Mat.</hi> 28 <hi>laſt:</hi> yea,
that no healing or cure will ever be to the Church, but by his appointed means; ſo
it is undenyable, that to withdraw from Church fellowſhip, in ſuch a manner as
this, is a moſt high and ſpirituall cenſure. Yea, <hi>not to eat with</hi> a ſcandalous Brother,
muſt be underſtood as ane <hi>act of judgment,</hi> and does ſuppoſe ſome previous tryall,
elſe, there ſhould be no fixed rule; but for each to be his own judge in pulling of
his Brother to <hi>shame;</hi> and, thus no bounds could be fixed, to prevent endleſſe
breakings and rents in the Church. Its true, a publick releife is not, as formerly,
now acceſſible, but as there is yet, through grace, a <hi>faithfull Miniſtry</hi> in our Church,
who hath the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, to cognoſce and judge of the matters of his
houſe, and to whom, the power of the keyes, both of doctrine and diſcipline, is
by his own warrant committ, (whatever eſſayes hath been, and ſtill are, to make
ſuch contemptible before the people, yea, ſome way, I muſt ſay, no leſſe thus to
exauctorate them, and controll their commiſſion this day, then hath been by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Adverſaries.) So is there alſo, ſome ſutable exoneration that each Chriſtian
may have, in the caſe of publick offence, (when there is not ſuch acceſſe by the
Church) to ſpread forth the ſame before the Lord, to endeavour in their capacity
and ſtation how to convince, gain, and reſtore ſuch with the ſpirit of meekneſſe,
and thus uſe perſonall freedome and tenderneſſe in dealing with others; wherein, I
am ſure, both more peace, and advantage to theſe they deall with, ſhould be thus
reached; then by any ſuch highly diſorderly way, and unwarrantable ſeverity, as
is now adventured on by ſome.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Ground,</hi> to clear the unwarrantableneſſe of this practiſe, is, that it is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
contrare to that approven and commended practiſe in the Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2: 2.
<hi>that they hath tryed ſuch who called themſelfes Apoſtles, and were not, but had found them
lyars;</hi> where as it is moſt clear that this was a judiciall tryall, and in a legall and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
way, of ſuch, before any declarative ſentence, and for this end is adduced
by the greateſt interpreters, to prove the neceſſity thereof, but this, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
touched, can give no advantage, in that caſe of the Conformiſts, to <hi>Prelacy,</hi>
where beſides other grounds mentioned, the antecedent judgment of our
Church, hath been ſo full, clear, and harmonious, there upon: whilſt I touch
this, I muſt cite the words and authority of bleſſed <hi>Mr Rutherfurd,</hi> in his <hi>divine right
of Church Government page</hi> 378. <q>We grant, ſayes he, that each ſhould eſchew
falſe Teachers, and all that walk inordinatly, but that every one, ſhould ſhun
theſe, whom in his private judgment he conceives to be ſuch, before he rebuke,
and labour to gaine, and in caſe of obſtinacy, then to tell the Church, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>and Lev.</hi> 19: 19. for if this ſayes he, ſhould be allowed, that I might
unbrother, and caſt out of heart and fellowſhip, every one whom I offend at,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65578:16"/>
and conceaves to walk inordinatly; were firſt a pathway to perpetuall <hi>Schiſmes.</hi> 2.
A violation of all Laws of Chriſtian fraternity and communion. 3. A diſſolving
and breaking all Church communion; and, it is ſtrange, ſayes he, that ſome
would have Chriſts order keeped, in private offences done by one Brother
to another, and not the ſame in publick offences where one may offend a whole
Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Ground,</hi> this is a practiſe which is ſtated againſt the <hi>very rule, nature, and end
of Church communion,</hi> in falling of from hearing upon that head of the <hi>indulgence,</hi>
which may be demonſtrable to any on theſe grounds. (1.) That according to this
<hi>rule,</hi> the ſin nor notoriely of corruption in <hi>Church offices,</hi> does not corrupt or defile
the ordinances, becauſe theſe are the ordinances of Chriſt; otherwayes they ſhould
have a neceſſary dependance on, and be of more or leſſe value according to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers:
but I grant, that may detract from our joy and comfort in partaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which yet does no way reach the validity of the ordinances. (2.) That it is
ſure, ſad differences both in judgment and practiſe in the Church, may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with the nature and ends of that bleſſed <hi>unity,</hi> which Chriſt doth require there,
and with a keeping of from partaking of the ſin of others. (3.) That <hi>Church Acts</hi>
even of theſe, who are not Paſtors according to Gods heart, tho externally called,
may be to themſelfes unprofitable, and yet edifying to the Hearers; nor can a grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and offenſive practiſe make their authority or acts void, ſince ſuch may have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
who have not approbation from the Lord, in diſpenſing his ordinances;
and will any adventure to ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt hath either diſowned, or withdrawen
from the Miniſtry of our Brethren who are thus deſerted by many; which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
is to me both ſad and aſtoniſhing, to ſee many now withdraw, and rather
keep their own houſe, then concurre in publick worſhip with ſuch, where Chriſt
in the power and efficacy of his word is yet to be ſeen; if this be the <hi>cure,</hi> that ſome
pretends for our preſent diſtemper, I muſt ſay, its more ſad then the <hi>diſeaſe.</hi> (4.) If
<hi>Church fellowship</hi> be truly underſtood, it will not be ſo eaſy to break of there, as
many judged, ſince all other ſafe meanes muſt needs be firſt eſſayed; nor may we
faſten a publick <hi>ſcandall</hi> on others, eſpecially upon officers of the Church, without
the furtheſt advantage to make it evident both to themſelfes, and convincing even
to the conſcience of others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5: 19. it is not a privilege of <hi>order</hi> only, but of
<hi>office,</hi> that Miniſters have to ſpeak in the name of the Lord, who hath ſaid, he that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth
you, deſpiſeth me;</hi> and to reject ſuch, is a higher guilt, then to reject the
ſame word in the mouth of a private Chriſtian, for they are the <hi>Meſſengers of the
Lord of hoſts,</hi> and bears his impreſſe. (5.) This is a practiſe, as hath therewith a
fixing of ſuch terms and conditions of Church communion, which hath not been, nor
can be found in any preceeding records, ſince the times of the Apoſtles; and I judge
it on ſpeciall cauſe of theſe ſad breakings now among us, and that ſo many contend as
them that beat the air; their miſtake and ignorance of the true <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>rule,</hi> of
externall communion in the Church; for if this ſhould be conſidered, upon clear
Scripture evidence, as it was in the firſt planting of the Chriſtian Church, I ſhould
not then fear any publick rent on this late difference; and that which is a neceſſary
condition of Church communion, I hope, muſt plead ſome Scripture warrant for
its impoſition. I know ſome will plead, that this is but a departure in ſome degree,
of Church-fellowſhip, which is both a poor and unwarrantable <hi>Apology;</hi> ſince
both the rule is thus far deſerted, and no ground to know where they may fix af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65578:16"/>
but we have to viſible ane account this day, where this ſad courſe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
landed.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Ground,</hi> that is ſad a and unwarrantable practiſe, which tends <hi>to cauſe
diviſion in the Church, contrary to the doctrine we have receaved, Rom.</hi> 15. which, I
am ſure, may be to evident, pretend any to the contrarie what they will, upon
theſe <hi>grounds.</hi> (1.) That whatever was the firſt riſe, or occaſion of the offence,
cannot be owned as the proper cauſe of ſuch a formed rent, as this now is; ſince
moſt ſad offences hath been without any ſuch effect, eſpecially when it was more
upon practiſe, then on any principles of truth; and the killing of a patient by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
through miſtake of the true medicine, can never be charged on this, that the
body was before in a ſad diſtemper; nor a miſapplication of the meanes to cure a
wound, when it hath cauſed a <hi>gangren</hi> in the body, be juſtly charged on the firſt
giving of the wound, ſince this otherwayes might have been ſafely healed. (2.) We
know that for ſeverall years after that accepting of the <hi>indulgence,</hi> that difference
both in jugdment and practiſe among us, yet did cauſe no ſuch effect; but the work
of the Goſpell did then muſt diſcernibly proſper, untill ſuch violent eſſayes theſe
two years now paſt, hath been for bringing things to ſuch ane <hi>extreme.</hi> And Oh!
from that ſad period may be too diſcernibly dated, ſome further degree of the Lords
departure from among us, and theſe deplorable effects of much <hi>blood,</hi> devaſtation,
reproach, weakening of the intereſt of Religion, ſtrenthening of the hands of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
beyond all that hath been in former times, and which hath encreaſed our
bonds more, then all our Adverſaries could ever doe. (3.) If ſo ſevere a ſtretching
of this late difference, and loading of the practiſe of others, with that which it
could not bear; if a carnall and violent way of following this debate, a high crying
up of ſuch in whom their own <hi>image,</hi> more then the <hi>image of Chriſt</hi> did appear,
and peremtory impoſing their judgment, without the leaſt tender condeſcendence
to theſe that differed from them, doe neceſſarily tend to engender <hi>diviſion</hi> in the
Church, and have ane undoubted <hi>cauſality</hi> from the very nature thereof to this
end; then it may be known, yea, (I dare appeall any diſcerning Chriſtian in the
Church) at whoſe door this muſt be layed, and who hath moſt actively moved to
put the poor Church in ſuch a flame, and this not upon any principle of truth,
which was on either ſide diſowned; but upon contraverted deductions, from a
different practiſe, and application thereof: this may be no leſſe amazing, then it is
ſad, that the way of ſome now ſeems more how to diſpatch things by <hi>cenſure,</hi> and
<hi>revilings,</hi> then by <hi>arguments,</hi> and by high words and invectives to exulcerate, more
then rationally to convince; but a ſharp cenſurer and a ſelf ſearcher does rarely meet
in one, though none more uſually needs the tender conſtruction of others, then
ſuch; this hath been to known an evill in our Church.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>Ground,</hi> this practiſe ſeemes ane expreſſe <hi>violation &amp; breach of Covenant,</hi> wherein
we are ſo ſolemnly engaged before the Lord, which, I know not, how any poſſibly
can evade, when we are no leſſe ſolemnly engaged there, againſt <hi>Schiſm,</hi> then either
<hi>Prelacy</hi> or <hi>Eraſtianiſme;</hi> and, if this be not ane unwarrantable <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and renting
of the Church, I know no ſuch charge could have been given againſt any ſince the
primitive times, and that on theſe grounds. (1.) That by <hi>Schiſme</hi> is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
a dividing from the doctrine, but from the communion of the Church, and
that it tends to a diſyointing from the body, thus we finde, even in the moſt pure
times of the Church, theſe put in a peculiar claſs, and looked on with no leſſe dread
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65578:17"/>
and fear, as ſuch, who did oppoſe the doctrine of the Church; and it is but to manifeſt,
that in all times, the moſt deſtroying errors hath been ſtill grafted on this ſtock,
whilſt on the other hand, the more near <hi>fellowship</hi> with our bleſſed head is keept up,
and where the life and power of godlineſſe is much in exerciſe, the more hath
this ſad rock been keept of; as the more near the lines are to the <hi>center,</hi> the
more near are they, and cloſe to one another. (2.) It is clear alſo from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
dealing with the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and about which he uſed ſuch ſharpneſſe that
they took a divided way of communicating and going about other duties, as tending
to make a breach and <hi>Schiſm</hi> then, in that Church, whatever gave the riſe thereto:
ſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: 18, 19. yea, does thus rebuke them, not only that ſome ſaid they
were of <hi>Paull,</hi> and others of <hi>Apollos,</hi> but even theſe that ſaid they were of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
ſo far as this upon the manner was in a contentious and divided way, ſince of him,
and him alone muſt the <hi>whole Church</hi> be named. (3.) It hath not hetherto been
under debate, from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and doctrine of the <hi>Reformed Church</hi> thereannent,
to be ane unqueſtionable <hi>Schiſme,</hi> where there is a departure from that <hi>union</hi> in the
publick worſhip and ordinances of the Goſpell in which they had formerly walked,
and thus a dividing and deſigned falling off from the ſame, without any juſt cauſe or
warrant from the Scripture, to a publick diſturbance of that order appointed by Chriſt
in his houſe, yea contrary to that commanded love, tenderneſs, prudence and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
ſo expreſly required of Church members towards one ane other, and to
his bleſſed authority who has ſo clearly warranted ſuch a forbearing with theſe, as
in ſome things may be contrary minded, upon different apprehenſions of the truth,
ſo far as both <hi>love</hi> amongſt themſelfes, <hi>the publick peace of the Church,</hi> may not be thus
diſturbed; it is ſure the choiſeſt of the ſaints doeth carry to heaven with them, both
errors, miſtakes and propheſieing in part, and ſome overclouding muſt ſtill be of
the brighteſt ſtares while they ſhine here; Oh! if that now which is the preſent cauſe
of theſe differences were but once brought to that <hi>rule</hi> of the word ſhould it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
many to be a wonder to themſelfes at the ſtrange way they have been upon,
and whether they have been carried in this deplorable <hi>rent</hi> of whoſe ſeriouſneſs
otherwiſe I doe not queſtion.</p>
            <p>VII. <hi>Ground,</hi> this is a practiſe contrary to moſt expreſſe Scripture commands, <hi>for
forbearance and condeſcendence among the godly</hi> in breaking times, which we may not
only ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14: 3, 4, 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4: 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9: 19. 20. but that it was for this end the
Spirit of God doe enjoine the ſame, that there may be no <hi>breach</hi> or <hi>rent</hi> in the Body
of Chriſt, about which he hath ſo tender a care, and is ſuch a <hi>forbearance,</hi> as we finde
expreſly commanded in this very caſe, upon a controverted practiſe of the Church,
and difference of judgment therein, whatever upon the one ſide might be more cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
herein then upon the other, as is clear in that debate about <hi>meats,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and
Oh! what can it mean? Whiles both our duty and remedy doth here meet at once,
yet, this ſhould have ſo litle weight with us, at this day: for if ſuch a commanded
<hi>forbearance</hi> can have no place among theſe who are one and agreed in this ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
even in the point controverted, and only differ in the application, yea are
mutually perſwaded of others ſincerity; I know no place then it could have ever
had, ſince there was a Chriſtian Church: which hath put me to ſome aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
what the peremtory way of ſome can intend, and to obſtruct ane union in
the way of the Lord only fought, without ceding in any truth, or being put to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
any thing they judge lawfull, or approve what they judge ſinfull, in the way
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65578:17"/>
of others; and if this be denyed, I would deſire then to know what ſinfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance,
or yeelding in any concerne of the truth, can be herein challenged; or
if ſuch a ſuteable eſſay hash yet been for a tender, ſerious communeing, with ſuch
they keep ſo great a diſtance with; to meet and concurre in what are uncontroverted
duties in ſuch a day. But oh! the temper of this time ſeems more now in <hi>paſſion</hi>
than <hi>argument,</hi> which is ſo naturall and pleaſing an evill, as the moſt expreſſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Scripture is not like to reſtraine.</p>
            <p>I muſt adde this further to be conſidered, if ſuch a departure from <hi>Church fellowship</hi>
ſhould be admitdon this head of the late <hi>indulgence,</hi> and the diſcretive judgment,
of any (which can only be pretended here) ſtretched to ſuch a hight as without the
Church to impoſe this, which is of ſo publik and univerſal concerne on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of the people, theſe <hi>conſequences</hi> of greateſt import muſt need follow.
1. To breake up <hi>Church fellowship</hi> and communion with moſt all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi>
this day; yea is a caice and practice under theſe circumſtances it is now ſtated, as
will finde no precedent, even from ſuch, who have formerly moſt pleaded for <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
who did never own this on any ſuch ground as a different practice, upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
apprehenſions thereof, among ſuch who are moſt intirely one in the ſame
doctrine and principles. 2. This alſo muſt follow to withdrauw from <hi>Fellowship
in hearing</hi> of the moſt choice and eminent <hi>Non-conforme Miniſters</hi> now in the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> whoſe liberty they had for a peaceable acceſſe to their publick meetings
ſome years now paſt, was of that ſame nature, and in als expreſſe termes one with
this <hi>indulgence.</hi> Yea it muſt neceſſarily tend like wayes to fall of <hi>communion in publick</hi>
with the <hi>whole Miniſtry of the Belgick Church,</hi> which to the furtheſt conviction of any
who will queſtion this can be demonſtrat on cleareſt ground. 3. Nothing can be
more evidently contrair then this practice is to the known judgments of the old Non-conformiſts,
yea of ſuch who have been moſt eminent both in the Churches of <hi>Old
and New-England</hi> of the <hi>congregational judgment,</hi> whoſe tender reſpect to guard
againſt any daſhing on ſuch a rock as this, they have publiſhed to the world, which
I forbear to ſet down here only to avoide prolixity.</p>
            <p>But I muſt yet ſpeak a few words more on this ſo important a caice, and obteſt
(I hope I may ſay with moſt tender reſpect) ſuch who in ſome ſimplicity of heart
hath been carried ſo ſtrainge a length in theſe differences, and may not be aware of
the hazard, and on what a precipice they are thus led to conſider. 1. If ther be no
caus to fear, leſt theyr reſolution be fixt before their light, and a ſerious tryall of
theyr way, and motion herein, ſince the ſincerity of our aime can make none approven
in that where a declining is in the matter from the <hi>rule.</hi> 2. And that the <hi>example</hi> and
<hi>authority</hi> of none can bear weight with the conſcience upon an after ſearch of what
they have done, ſinc each <hi>muſt prove his own worke,</hi> yea it is ſure non would take poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone
upon the credit or repute of others, nor can the wiſdom of words add any weight
to the word of truth. 3. Is there not much cauſe to fear (that without preventing
grace) <hi>diviſion</hi> is at ſuch a height, as it shall at laſt end in diſſolution. <hi>Julian</hi> knew
this to well, when as one of the greateſt means he followed for the undoing of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi>
was not only to tollerat but to foment <hi>differences</hi> among Chriſtians. 4. And
what can ſuch fore breakings as theſe mean, for ſure it is one of two that either we do
not <hi>center in Chriſt,</hi> and are unite by the ſame <hi>ſpirit</hi> with him, or that we are thus
under ſome dreadfull prevalence of temptation; It is not the <hi>lines</hi> that are <hi>ſtreight</hi>
but ſuch as are drawn <hi>crooked</hi> from the <hi>center,</hi> which do juſtle and tread on other.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65578:18"/>
5. Should it not be a ſtrainge contradiction, for a profeſt contending, upon the
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>ſupremacy</hi> of our <hi>bleſt head,</hi> over his Church; by a viſible controlling
of the <hi>authority of his Laws</hi> over our conſcience and practice, and can this be under
debate where there is ſo ſad an exceeding of theſe Scripture bounds ſett to us, in
mutuall contendings in ſuch differences as theſe now are, for which, I ſhall
but offer theſe expreſs commands given in ſuch a caice to be conſidered which I may
ſay could not poſſibly but reſtraine any ſuch rupture and <hi>ſchiſme</hi> now in our Church,
if ſome ſuteable weight thereof were on our ſpirits; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2: 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4: 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.
3, 4. <hi>James</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. Hath not in all times the Churches hazard been more from the
<hi>right</hi> then the <hi>left hand,</hi> and from ſuch a party as lyes in ambuſh to enter at every
breach; I mean the <hi>ſpirit of errour</hi> and deluſion, than from open aſſaults yea is there
any mean could have been eſſayed more ſad for the opening ſuch a door, then this to
divide the Church, and godly among themſelfs. 7. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whither hath this tyde
carried ſome, I am ſure much beyond their own thoughts and what deplorable
effects have thus been of late in ſo ſtrainge a keeping this breach up with theſe who
are <hi>partakers of the ſame precious faith,</hi> and when much more is yet to unite, then to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joine,
ſhall there yet be further daſhing on ſuch a rock whereon ſo remarkable a
<hi>beacon</hi> in theſe known ſad and diſmall conſequences hes been ſet up before us, yea
no eſſay for a binding up of ſuch wounds which are now like to bleed unto death.
8. What ſtrange pleaſure muſt it be that is more in bitter contendings (I fear) then
to live in the practiſe of theſe great truths we know; or what true gain can be thus
projected for our maſters intereſt; it is ſur ſuch a <hi>delight,</hi> ſould be greateſt paine to any
ſerious, and tender ſpirit. Yea have not ſuch intemperat heats yet ſpent their ſtrengh
under theſe ſtrange chainges which have of late gone over, as might have brought
ſome ſutable <hi>cool</hi> atlaſt to this <hi>fever.</hi> 9. Are <hi>profeſſors</hi> of the truth in ſuch a manner
now preſt to adorne the profeſſion thereof, as formerly, and under ſuch a weight how
<hi>great, great</hi> a thing it is for any to be <hi>eternally ſaved</hi> though never more cauſe to
walk under fear of this, then in the preſent age, or where moe in a way of <hi>profeſſion,</hi>
and with much of the <hi>forme of godlineſs</hi> hath been in hazard to periſh, and come ſhort
of heaven, yea with leſſe acceſſe to be convinc'd or to bear faithful dealling with
their conſcience then ſeems now; and do but conſider whom yow prejudge moſt in
withdrawing from the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of theſe, who I hope ſhall be ouned of the Lord
as his meſſingers to the Church and darre own no other reſentment both of greife
and ſorrow upon the viſible hazard of ſuch as ſeem not to be awarre thereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
10. Yow know that expreſſe command of watching with a godly jealouſy
againſt any <hi>ſtrainge doctrine, Heb.</hi> 13: 3. and it's but too known how eager a
graſping is by many more at what ſeems <hi>new</hi> and ſtrange, then what may <hi>edify;</hi> nor
hath ſuch oft apprehended the hazard of ſome plauſible error, untill it came to a more
formed complexion, as is now. 11. What advantage is thus given to the <hi>Prelatick</hi> party
for that charge of <hi>ſeparation</hi> againſt the whole <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> this day, and though
with cleareſt evidence we can evince the injuſtneſſe thereof; yet knows not how to
anſuer on your behalf when we are reproved. 12. Are we not both called and
taught, to <hi>trye the ſpirits whither they be of God,</hi> by cleareſt Scripture light: and that
the impulſe and <hi>motions</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit of grace,</hi> muſt aſſuredly tend to compoſe and
ſanctify the whole frame of the ſoul with a humble tender ſubmiſneſſe to the tryall of
the word herein, and is it not expreſly ſhewed what the fruits of the <hi>ſpirit and flesh
are. Galat.</hi> 21. 22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 2. 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> and how farre the way of the Lord is from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65578:18"/>
any irregular or impetuous courſes; yea ſuch as may ſeem incompatible with the
very uſe and exerciſe of reaſon. Theſe words of <hi>Luther</hi> in the <hi>ſecond tome of his
epiſtles,</hi> ar of much weight: <hi>ſayes he in your tryal and decerning the ſpirits ye would
trye whither they can prove their calling in what is ſtrange or extraordinary either in their
judgment or practice, for God never ſent any but they were either called by men, in his
appointed way, or declared by ſignes, no not his own ſon, and in no wayes, may we
accept the calling of any upon ſuch a warrant of ſome ſingular impulſes or revelation.</hi> I muſt
yet beſeech this further, to be layd to heart; that if any thing can be known by its
native and viſible effects, we may then read in greateſt Letters, what a <hi>Babel of
confuſion and diſorder,</hi> with dividing both of hearts and tongues hath followed on
this late aſtoniſhing rent, and <hi>Schiſme</hi> in our Church, yea when thus taken off any
certaine <hi>rule,</hi> for <hi>hearing</hi> and joining in the <hi>publick Ordinances,</hi> knowes not where
to finde themſelfs, or to be in one meaſure in ſuch a caice. I deſire to ſpeake this
with a tender reſpect to ſuch, who I darre not queſtion hath had a ſerious regard to
the truth yet hath not been awarre of the ſubtilty of this ſnare, and with hope
that upon ſerious after thoughts ſome more fixt uniting both in judgment and heart
may yet follow amongſt all who are indeed lovers of the truth, in our Church;
with ſome more ſuiteable fear to daſh againe on ſuch a rock; yea to ſee how true and
ſweet a conſiſtence, may be betwixt <hi>Zeal</hi> and fervency for the Lord, and that humble
fear and tenderneſſe in our private judgment in ſuch a difference, as this, where on
no ſide the truth is denyed; ſo as to keep of any publick <hi>rent</hi> in the Church.</p>
            <p>QUEST. IV. Which may be yet needful to touch on theſe late <hi>publick differences,</hi>
if it be either matter of <hi>duty,</hi> or <hi>expedient</hi> and for edification, to bring theſe in <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick</hi>
and engadge the people therein; and if ſome <hi>forbearance</hi> thus by <hi>Miniſters of the
Goſpel,</hi> be not in ſuch a time and under theſe circumſtances we ſtand, called for. For
clearing of which, I hope there is no debate; upon that great duty of a faithful
and free wairning againſt <hi>publick ſins,</hi> and though with a ſuiteable <hi>prudence,</hi> yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
to apply the rule againſt them, and to ſhew both the <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>dangers of
the time;</hi> but I humbly judge, no juſtleing will be found here, with a tender ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
and forbearance in ſuch a caice as this, where a different judgment and
practice is now, amongſt the moſt ſerious godly and faithful Miniſters, in our
Church who yet does ſo jointly concurre and are one in the ſame truth; upon theſe
<hi>grounds.</hi> 1. That this can not be pleaded as a <hi>publick Teſtimony</hi> to the truth; as it
thus reflects on the practice of their Brethren, with whom they differ on whom no
diſouning or oppoſing of the ſame. Without the furtheſt breach of charity can be thus
fixt; nor is this before any ſuch as are the known and publick adverſaries thereto, or
upon any viſible hazard, <hi>Luke</hi> 21: 12. <hi>When you shall be brought before Kings and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
for my names ſake, this shall turne to you for a teſtimony,</hi> but I muſt ſay the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie
of ſuch ordinare and publick <hi>reflections</hi> is rather like to darken the credit and
beauty of ſo great and honourable an appearance, as a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> indeed for the truth
is; and if theſe neceſſare requiſites thereto, according to the Scripture, were this
day more underſtood, there could not be ſo ordinare a pretending of this. 2. I
would know wherein this way is uſefull or expedient to moſt of hearers who can ſo
little judge on theſe things. We are indeed called to <hi>declaire the whole counſell of
God, Acts.</hi> 20: 27. But this is moſt evidently qualified by the ſame Apoſtle,
<hi>verſe</hi> 20. that <hi>he kept nothing back hereof which might be profitable for them,</hi> and thus
expreſly ſhowes what bounds Miniſters hath ſett herein by the holy Ghoſt in their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65578:19"/>
delivering of the meſſage of God to his Church that it be not only truth but ſuch as
may be for the edification of theſe they preach to. 3. Since it is clear that <hi>poſitive
duties</hi> do not <hi>binde ad ſemper.</hi> and no cauſe can be now pleaded in this caice for
guarding againſt any preſent ſnare or hazard to the Church ſhould not the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
which the contentious keeping up of theſe differences may occaſion have
more weight with us which the Apoſtle ſo ſharply rebukes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: 16. <hi>But if
any ſeem to be contentious we have no ſuch cuſtome nor in the Church of God;</hi> and oh! that
the loſſe and gaine herein were more impartially weighted, what both the <hi>Lucrum
ceſſans and Damnum emergens</hi> hath been this way. 4. And is this ſo ſmall a thing as may
ſeem to ſome, to bring in publick, and before the Church ſo high a charge of <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſme</hi>
and defection from the truth againſt theſe their Brethren who are thus as
expreſſely pointed at as they were named, ſince it is ſure there can be no publick <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke</hi>
and <hi>admonition</hi> before the people as this moſt evidently is, but as a <hi>publick
Church cenſure</hi> and <hi>juridical act of Diſcipline,</hi> yea which is no leſſe manifeſt then that of
excommunication, and if ſo publick a violation of that order which our bleſſed
head hath expreſſely fixt for his Church, be ſo lightly regarded; where are we.
Nor can this be, pretended as a <hi>doctrinal reproof</hi> which is ſuch an applying of the rule
againſt ſins of the <hi>time</hi> muſt as ſtil leave the particular application thereof to their own
conſcience who are thus guiltie, without any expreſſe deſigning of particular perſones,
where no judicial procedour and conviction by the Church hes gone before, but
here is a moſt publick and expreſſe fixing of ſo ſad a ſcandal even before the Church,
againſt ſo many particular <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel (who are ſtill labouring in the
vineyard of the Lord) as if they were deſigned by name. 5. And are not theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
requiſites for a <hi>publick reproofe,</hi> not only their <hi>calling</hi> thereto, that it be
orderly, and upon cleareſt evidence but that this be not expoſed to any <hi>prejudicate
exception,</hi> from their way who do thus reprove, which may be on too juſt ground
feared this day that ſome have put themſelves out of the furtheſt capacitie to edifie
by any ſuch mean, from their own unſuteable manageing hereof. 6, What if theſe
who are thus ſo openly reflected upon ſhould take the ſame freedom for publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction?
Wherein would this quickly reſolve, but a furder growing ſcandall,
to ruine the Church and make way for the endleſſe debatings, which as the Apoſtle
ſhowes does rather engender Queſtions then any godly edifying in the faith. We
know the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood <hi>Peter</hi> to the face, but it is obſervable on what
ground it was ſtated, that when <hi>Peter</hi> knew the differences then amongſt theſe of
the Jews and Gentiles who beleeved was ſuch as ſhould cauſe no rent or dividing the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reon;
yet to pleaſe the <hi>Jews</hi> had withdrawn and ſeparat from fellowſhip with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> yea that this rent was like to grow ſo as <hi>Barnabas</hi> alſo was drawn into
the ſame diſſimulation and thus a ſad and ruining breach like to follow. 7. Should
we not be to the furtheſt tender of unſettling of the ſpirits of the people when ſo
much allready ſhaken and in that manner now racked and toſſed to and fro with
<hi>every winde of Doctrine</hi> as many are like to loſſe all perſuaſion of the truth, yea
when it is ſo hard and all moſt impoſſible to keep ſome within any bounds; and
whileſt thus the triumph of adverſaries and ſtrengthening the hands of the ungodly
upon ſuch ſtrainge reflections, brought in publick, does viſibly gaine ground; and
what intereſt can be thus pretended for the Church of Chriſt in ſo publick a <hi>going to
Law</hi> with their Brethren before ſo watching an adverſary, whoſe ſtrength muſt
needs lye in our breach. 8. Is not alſo the bringing things thus to ſuch an extream, of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65578:19"/>
that viſible tendencie, as to bring under queſtion the <hi>validitie of their Miniſterial acts</hi>
amongſt the people, by ſo publick a thruſt at the credit and repute of their Miniſtry,
which is ſo far an expoſing of many to the hazard both of atheiſme and errour, beſides
the weakening ſuch in the publick work of the Lord, who are ſo known able <hi>Miniſters</hi>
of Chriſt. I ſhall adde no further but a humble and ſerious appeal to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
who may have judged this their duty, if on deeper reflection hereon; a
tender <hi>abſtinence</hi> and forbearance this way and to keep of any daſhing on ſuch a rock
as hath been allready touched, untill light and conviction from the Lord yet further
break up ſhould not be their own peace, and comfort as well as the publick peace of
the Church in that day when their eyes ſhall become dim, and the keepers of the
houſe begin to tremble.</p>

            <p>WHen ſuch ſad uſe is now like to be made of theſe times, as to give the truth
and credit thereof (which above all things ſhould be dear to us) a Deaths
wound, were it poſſible, by reproach; <hi>I</hi> hope it will not be incongruous to ſuch
a ſubject, to ſpeak yet a few words more; <hi>for anſwering ſome high pretences for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and ſtumbling, which ſeem now moſt publickly to be owned yea not only thus to break
and undo themſelves but to involve others in the ſame ruine;</hi> Not that the truth needs the
witneſs or reſpects of men to commend the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which as the ſun in it's ſtrength
keeps its courſe amidſt all the dark clouds which can interveen; but in a day of ſuch
<hi>blaſphemy and reproach,</hi> we ſhould require juſtice at the barre of mens own conſcience
herein, if there can be any cauſe for ſtumbling at the holy and unſpotted wayes of
the Lord, but what is from themſelfs, and from their ſeeking after ſuch a latitude in
their <hi>principles,</hi> as might ſure that liberty, which they take thus in their <hi>practice.</hi>
Now with ſome reſpect their to, I ſhall offer theſe <hi>eight grounds which are at this day
moſt pretented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Theſe ſtrange inteſtine conflicts and Differences in judgment that we are now in the
Church,</hi> and among profeſſors of the truth as though they were not the Children of
the ſame houſe, for ANSWER, I hope theſe things when ſeriouſly pondered may
ſilence any ſuch reflection on the way of truth, which I ſhall but leave to mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
1. That our bleſt Lord hath with cleareſt evidence layd down ſuch ſure
and fixt grounds, in his own word for the <hi>peace and concord of his Church,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
with theſe expreſſe <hi>rules</hi> and proviſion for the ſame as there can be no
known ground for ſuch ſad and deploreable breakings, but what mens own corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and declining from the <hi>rule</hi> doth occaſion. 2. It is muſt clear that one of the
greateſt of the <hi>Lawes of God</hi> to which with the furtheſt reiterat inforcements our
obedience is required for preventing the Churches hazard on this rock, is that
<hi>Law of charity, and love, for the Godly amongſt themſelves,</hi> ſo as without this he will
accept no mans ſervice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. And is ſuch the Apoſtle preſſes, <hi>above all things
to put on charity; which is the bond of perfection, Coloſſ.</hi> 3: 13, 14. 3. I hope it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable
alſo that theſe <hi>principles of union and love</hi> are ſo firmely fixt, as might be
conſiſtent both with ſome <hi>various apprehenſions, and difference in judgment</hi> amongſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65578:20"/>
his people here, who are unite in himſelf and in the great concerns of truth and
godlyneſs, ſo as upon ſuch an accompt the <hi>peace</hi> and concord of his Church ſhould
not be ſuſpended, ſince it is <hi>here we know but in part;</hi> and as all have not the ſame helps,
ſo not the ſame capacity for underſtanding of many things, which may cauſe ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the Church. Not that we ſhould think opinions are free, or <hi>errors</hi> in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not to be ſeriouſly watched againſt als well as corruption in practice ſince it is
not only through ſanctification of the ſpirit, but <hi>beleef of the truth</hi> we are appointed to
life. 4. For this end likewayes hath our bleſt head ſet ſuch <hi>bounds</hi> and meaſures to
his people in the manageing of theſe differences which may fall in as that there ſhould
be no fear of any ſad rent or breach where a due reſpect unto theſe is had, and to
walk according to the rule, and ſpirit of the goſpel, and oh! that theſe great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14: 3, 4. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2: 3. were more ſeriouſly pondered, there could
not but be ſome more lawfull regard to keep of ſuch bitter and offenſive breakings,
as may be oft ſeen amongſt us. 5. Nor is there cauſe to fear any <hi>breach</hi> from the moſt
ſerious and ſervent <hi>contending for the truth,</hi> and cloſſe adherence thereto which ſhould
be dearer to us then our life and can admitt no latitude or ceding there, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
rule of our duty herein is obſerved that this be managed with a humble ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
condeſcendence and <hi>cedeing in our own things,</hi> to one another, for oh! there
hath our ſaddeſt conteſts, and a nimoſity their greateſt ſtrength this day. It were
well if ſuch a bleſt contending, and <hi>ſtriving lawfully,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhewes were
thus ſtudied, that it be in the way of the Lord and by means of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>by pureneſſe, by long ſuffering, by the word of truth, by the armour of God on the
right hadn and on the left &amp;c.</hi> And where theſe are not mens ſtudy and practice they
muſt live in an expreſſe contradiction to theſe <hi>principles</hi> which yet they darre not
diſown, yea in ſo farre becomes not only a juſt matter of grief, but a <hi>ſpot</hi> in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of the ſaints. 6. Whatever ſad differences be oft amongſt theſe, which
both their darkneſſe of minde, and contrariety of natural diſpoſitions, may influence,
yet does not ſtill that bleſt <hi>unity of the ſpirit ſtand fixt and ſure,</hi> by which the whole race
of the ſaints are unite in a <hi>new and ſpirituall nature,</hi> In theſe ſweet &amp; ſenſible communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and do all meet in one bleſt <hi>center,</hi> yea ſo near an intercourſe of
ſouls and Sympathy does reſult thence (however the ſad prevalence of corruption
may for ſome time darken the ſame) as no union and concord like this is in all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of the earth, and may be ſuch a witneſs to the truth of chriſtianity, as to ſilence
even the greateſt <hi>Atheiſt.</hi> 7. Yea may we not have here a ſpecial confirming evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the certainty of the truth, that notwithſtanding of ſuch <hi>differences</hi> both in
judgment, and practice, with ſo ſore prejudice and eſtrangement of heart and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of naturall temper and diſpoſition of amongſt the Godly, yet this hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
from all theſe an undoubted aſſent, to the moſt great and weighty concerns
of religion, yea to a joint acknowledging of the ſame principle about which ſome
difference may be in the application thereof to ſome particular caice. 8. I ſhall but
adde, that it's known what ſweet harmony and oneneſſe of heart hath ſometimes
been among ſuch as did <hi>Profeſſe</hi> the truth, of all ranks in our Church, and in a fixt
adherence to the ſame cauſe, and how it was at a ſad ebb, that ſome differences
broke up amongſt the moſt eminently godly both Miniſters and profeſſors there,
for ſome time on that head of the <hi>publick reſolutions,</hi> though without any formed
breach or ſchiſme, but after among ſuch who thus differed, a moſt ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and concurrence in a joint oppoſition againſt prelacy and to ſuffer rather then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65578:20"/>
in the leaſt to conſent thereto did follow: yea though ſince amongſt the moſt ſerious
<hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> a greater freedom hath been in the judgment and practice of ſome,
then others, for hearing of <hi>Conformiſts to prelacie,</hi> yet ſo farre as I know hath it
been with a due and tender reſpect, as was ſuteable, to keep of either dividing or
alienation in ſuch a caice: but oh! it muſt be confeſt to what a hight have theſe late
confuſions, and breaches amongſt us come and what fewel this hath been to a great
increaſe of ſin; yet is there one ground to hope when almoſt there ſeemes no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
ſigne els, that <hi>he who hath ſeen our wayes, can he all them alſo,</hi> by a marvellous
ſurpriſeal of grace.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Prejudice it,</hi> which is by ſome highly entertained in theſe times for their
own breaking is the <hi>perplexedneſs and heſitation they are in what way to choice
when the truth ſeems now involved in ſuch a confuſion of different judgments and
ſuch viſible contradictions amongst profeſſors thereof. For Anſwer,</hi> if no thing were to
ſhake or offend there ſhould then be no tryed eſtabliſhment, yet ſince this ſeems one
of the ſaddeſt diſeaſes of the time in many's being <hi>ſoon ſaken in minde</hi> with ſuch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
and unſettledneſs in the truth I muſt ſpeak a few words thereto to witneſs
what greateſt advantage ſuch as deſire to walk in the light may have to hold faſt the
profeſſion of their faith without wavering and for the furtheſt quiet and aſſuring of
their heart therein on theſe grounds. 1. That the Scripture is ſo <hi>near, theſe living
oracles of truth,</hi> which do with ſo clear and diſtinct a ſound ſpeake if men had but ears
to hear. 2. That the Lord hath given to his people a <hi>ſpirit of diſcerning</hi> in ſome
greater and leſſer meaſure ſo as to <hi>prove all things</hi> by a ſerious perſonal tryal, yea
that none needs receive the truth upon truſt or to lean on the authority or example
of any herein but to judge their own eyes and conſcience ſhould be als faithfull to
them as any. 3. He hath given alſo as a ſpecial help a <hi>fixt Miniſtry</hi> to his Church
yea for this very end <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4: 14. that we ſhould henceforth <hi>be no more Children
toſſed to and fro</hi> with every winde of doctrine, and therefor with a divine miſſion
hath given ſuch ſpiritual gifts as the neceſſity and ſervice of the Church may require
for interpreting and clearing up of what may be the counſel and minde of the Lord
to his Church according to his own word. 4. That the moſt <hi>weighty things</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
both as to <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> are not intereſted in moſt of theſe ſad conteſts,
which are now amongſt but he hath ſo graciouſly condeſcended that what we ſhould
moſt live by ſhould not coſt us ſo dear and that the greateſt ſubtilties and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
controverſies which are ſo oft in the Church ye moſt out of our way, yea
ſuch as ſhould cauſe no trouble or diſquiet of minde herein. 5. Is not alſo moſt
clearly ſheued us, how we may know our being led and kept in the way of truth,
and what ſhould qualify, and make us <hi>meet</hi> for the bleſt conduct and <hi>teachings</hi> of
the <hi>ſpirit</hi> by his word, ſuch as a <hi>holy fear, and ſincere reſignation of the ſoul thereto,
meekneſs, humility</hi> with a fixt and ſerious reſolving to cloſe therewith, how croſſe
however it ſhould be to our own private affection and credit. 6. There is this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to know that bleſt and approven way, wherein we may have peace, as that in
which <hi>the footſteps of the ſaints</hi> and ſo innunerable a company, hath gone before
<hi>who received the ſpirit this way,</hi> and with greateſt aſſurance did know the truth of that
<hi>ſeal</hi> on their own ſoul, ſo as after no <hi>new</hi> or ſtrange light we need to inquire. 7. And
hath not the meaneſt of the ſaints theſe peculiar <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and marks whereby to
diſcerne the way of truth in a dark and trying time, by plaineſt <hi>Scripture light,</hi> both
for clearing and confirming of their minde herein. 1. That we <hi>should follow theſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65578:21"/>
things, which tend to peace and to edify Rom.</hi> 14. 19. For thus ſurely does the way
of truth tend to build and not to caſt doune: and if many caices which ſome does
now agitat, with much diſquiet both to themſelfs and others, were more brought
to that great rule of ſolid <hi>edification,</hi> I ſhould not fear that ſo much time ſhould be
loſt therein. 2. It is ſure the <hi>way of truth,</hi> muſt be ſtil <hi>rationally convincing</hi> ſuch as
doth perſuad by teaching, and to fix and clear the judgment before the will, by <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of the truth</hi> to mens conſcience for thus we are taught, <hi>and be alwayes ready; to
render a reaſon of the hope that is in yow with all meekneſſe and fear.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. 3. Such
is this bleſt way as it is cautious, and advertant to hazard on each hand, and to guard
againſt <hi>the dephts of Satan</hi> as well as to reſiſt his <hi>fury,</hi> a way which lyeth betuixt <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams</hi>
either on the <hi>right</hi> or <hi>left</hi> hand, for thus we are taught 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14
2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 2. 4. It is ſuch a <hi>way</hi> as leadeth us to regard the ſpecial varying of a caice,
as to ſome preſent duty with a due reſpect and ballancing of <hi>circumſtances:</hi> and to
ſee that the ſame way at all times is not to be followed in our practice, ſince what
may be moſt requiſite and edifiing ſome time and in one caice, may be deſtructive in
another, for this hath the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhewed that all things are <hi>lawful</hi> but not <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 23. 5. Thus we may know and diſcerne the <hi>truth</hi> and way thereof
which is <hi>according to godlineſs, Tit.</hi> 1. 1. when it is ſuch as viſibly tend, by its
power and efficacy on the heart, to heal the diſtempers of the minde and judgment,
and by practical obedience to a more full aſſurance of underſtanding in themſelves;
and may thus ſee its very native reſult and tendence, is to make profeſſours of the
truth, <hi>humble, meek, ſober</hi> and <hi>temperat</hi> in their perſonal converſation, yea
tender to provoke or excite the corruption of any. 6. Is ther not this neceſſare
tendence alſo of the revealed way of truth, <hi>to walk wiſely towards ſuch as are without
Col.</hi> 4. 5. and with the furtheſt tender reſpect to prevent their being further alienat
or hardened in their averſion from the way of the Lord, which I muſt ſay ſhould be
one of the moſt weighty concerns of a Chriſtians ſtudy, for adorning the profeſſion
of the Goſpel in ſueh a day. 7. I ſhall but add this more, what advantage a chriſtian
may thus have for true peace and quiet on ſuch a reflection of having kept guard
againſt any hid <hi>perſonal prejudice</hi> or ſuch a byaſſe which the preingadgment of their
judgment in the preſent caice, and that influence their intereſt in a divided party
might have occaſioned, yea thus of ſome tender reſpect to the <hi>Purity</hi> als well as <hi>the
peace</hi> of their own conſcience that there may be no private intereſt or ſetting up of
ſuch a ſtumbling block before their eyes as to darken their judgment herein.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Ground</hi> which I fear in theſe times may be much made uſe of by many for their
own ſtumbling is <hi>that ſtrange ſpirit and to viſible eruptions of pride, bitterneſs and
paſsion with which theſe conteſts and differences in judgments amongſt profeſſours of the
truth are ſo oft followed.</hi> For <hi>Anſwer</hi> whatever ſad occaſion be thus given of offence,
yet can there be none for taking <hi>prejudice</hi> or any reflecting thus on religion except
men will put out the very eyes both of their reaſon and conſcience, when it is ſo clear
1. How viſible a contradiction any ſuch ſad appearances of pride, bitterneſſe and
wrath are to the <hi>deſigne</hi> and intent of the Goſpel, which is for the furtheſt ſelf abaſing,
to ſubdue and mortify ſuch luſts and thus prevent any exorbitancy that way: as that
which is not only to adorne a chriſtian walk but is a moſt eſſential part of our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
and is not the authority of the <hi>rule</hi> herein ſuch on their conſcience, whom
yow may moſt thus challenge, as they are even inforced to ſeek a cover and hiding of
theſe evills, which they know to be their <hi>shame,</hi> and cannot bear the light being thus
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65578:21"/>
judged in themſelfs and ſo conſcious of their deformity. 2. <hi>Is</hi> not the <hi>reliefe</hi> alſo
and <hi>antidote</hi> to ſo dreadfull a <hi>poiſon</hi> moſt clearly held forth to us, how to watch
againſt this which both hath ſo ſubtile and forcible an infection, and deep rooting
in mens nature. 3. Or can yow challenge the leaſt ſhaddow of <hi>Latitude,</hi> from our
<hi>bleſt Lawgiver,</hi> and the <hi>lawes of his Kingdom,</hi> herein, which are ſo expreſſe not only
againſt any open eruption of ſuch evills, but againſt the moſt ſecret convoy, and
intertainement thereof in the heart, yea that, on no leſſe haz<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rd then of being ſhut
out for ever from that Land, which is above, we muſt both watch and wreſtle
againſt the ſame; for ſuch is the <hi>ſtraite and narrow way,</hi> and ſo many <hi>low entries</hi>
there, as none poſſibly can get through without a humble, and ſubdued Spirit, and
as <hi>little children to receive the Kingdom of God.</hi> 4. Can <hi>prejudice</hi> ſo farre overcome
mens conſcience, as not to ſee the excellency of a Chriſtian ſpirit, and the undoubted
reality thereof, which hath ſo brightly ſhined and I hope yet doth (to ſilence
the greateſt reproacher) in many convincing examples of <hi>humility, meekneſſe</hi> and in
the conqueſt of their <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>forgiving of injuries,</hi> as a convincing witneſs
to the world of ther being <hi>thus transformed into his bleſt image</hi> of whom as the great
<hi>pattern</hi> ſet before us we are to <hi>Learne.</hi> 5. And ſhould not tenderneſs and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
be more ſuteable then prejudice and ſtumbling at ſuch a ſight yow thus chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
when nothing can be more viſibly contraire to the very uſe of reaſon then
any ſuch ſad <hi>eruption of pride, bitterneſs, and wrath,</hi> which is ſo ſore a <hi>diſeaſe</hi> and a
<hi>fever</hi> of the minde, and cauſeth ſuch <hi>diſorder, ſad, and tumultuous ryſings</hi> there,
as they are made their own puniſhment and the very mean to fruſtrat that end they
moſt follow, yea in no way could more gratify and give the greateſt advantage
to ſuch they contend with and to put themſelfs in the pouer of every one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their <hi>tormentor.</hi> 6. Yow little know what ſharp and bitter <hi>reflections</hi> ſuch
may oft have on themſelfs upon any ſad appearance this way or advantage, their
corruption hath got under ſome ſad aſſault, yea ſuch, as even the ſenſe of a ſealed
pardon on thir ſoul can not ſometimes blunt the ſharp edge of this grief and
indignation againſt themſelves. 7. And may yow not clearly ſee what viſible deteſt
ſuch are even inforced to have at the appearance of theſe <hi>evills</hi> in others; which thus
hath a ſad outbreaking in their own <hi>practice;</hi> as convincingly ſhowes their way
muſt contradict both their own <hi>judgment and principles.</hi> 8. I ſhall but further
adde, what great incitements and cleareſt diſcovery doth the Scripture afford,
of that <hi>bleſt way,</hi> which was never known, nor attaind by nature, how to get ſuch
<hi>prevailing evills</hi> ſubdued; yea how to improve <hi>injuries</hi> to the greateſt advantage,
and thus by <hi>overcoming,</hi> to gaine the moſt glorious and deſireable victory and
revenge, on ſuch who have injured them, by <hi>humble and tender forbearance,</hi> and
what a ſueet facility might be found this way, when the <hi>firſt wave,</hi> and <hi>aſſault</hi> is
whoſe once broke and reſiſted but greateſt ſtrength ſtill lyes in the <hi>firſt aſſault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Ground and pretence for prejudic</hi> in theſe times, <hi>is that ſo little evidence ſeems
of tenderneſs and a convincing ſerious practice even in their way who have a name &amp;
repute of religion with ſuch abounding offences, as gives occaſion not only to queſtion the
ſincerity of their profeſsion, bot to ſtumble at the very forme and appearance of godlineſs.
ANSW:</hi> though nothing ſhould be more dreadfull then for any to make the truth
acceſſory to their ſin, or take thus ſhelter under its patiociny, yet ſince it is ſo
great a concern to <hi>vindic<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t pure, and undefiled religion, and the ſpotles rule,</hi> and
pattern thereof in a day of ſuch <hi>reproach,</hi> and when any advantage is ſo eagerly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65578:22"/>
ſought and followed for this end, I would but offer ſome few things, to
plead with their conſcience who thus, are in more hazard to undo and break them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfes,
then to hurt the credit of the <hi>truth.</hi> 1. If there ſhould not be more to ſhake
and ſtumble if ſuch <hi>offences</hi> were not in the Church of Chriſt when ſo expreſſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
as the <hi>Scripture</hi> els ſhould want a moſt convincing ſeall and witneſs thereto, yea
when, thus yow may ſee that not only an empty ſhow and <hi>the hypocriſy</hi> of ſome bot
the <hi>recorded blemishes</hi> and falling of the ſaints their, to be demonſtrative and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
of the <hi>truth,</hi> als well as the <hi>bright eſt evidences,</hi> and luſtre of their grace.
2. I confeſſe it were a ſuteable <hi>inference,</hi> for none to engadge with the <hi>profeſſion of
godlineſs</hi> without the <hi>power</hi> and how dreadfull a part ſuch acts, who live ſtangers
thereto but how ſtrange, and aſtoniſhing were it for ſuch, as are <hi>ungodly</hi> thus to
juſtify their own way. 3. If yow <hi>ſtumble</hi> here, and embrace no religion until
yow finde no <hi>offences</hi> amongſt the <hi>profeſſours</hi> thereof, then ye muſt have none, but
turne <hi>Athieſt,</hi> bot your conſcience herein, muſt needs tell yow (ſilence it as
yow wid) that the <hi>truth, and principles of godlineſs,</hi> bindes men over with the
greateſt tyes and engadgments to <hi>holyneſs, purity,</hi> candor and righteouſneſs, even
in all our dealing with men, under the ſevereſt threatnmgs and oh! muſt the <hi>glory,
and honour of the truth,</hi> which is <hi>according to godlineſs,</hi> thus come under reproach and
ſuffer from the untender, and unanſuerable practice of any who profeſſ the ſame,
4. Can yow poſibly debate this (which might both ſilence and make men aſhamed of
ſuch a challenge) that under any <hi>pretences,</hi> which have ever been to religion, in the
world it is the <hi>doctrine of Chriſt</hi> only, which indiſpenſibly requires <hi>truth and ſincerity</hi> of
the heart herein, and that the <hi>conformity</hi> of our duties on the <hi>matter to the rule,</hi> is not
enowgh without a ſerious reſpect to the <hi>quality of the principles of our acting,</hi> that it
be <hi>in faith,</hi> and <hi>from the love of Chriſt,</hi> which is ſo eſſentiall a requiſite therto, yea
that this is ſo framed as to correſpond with the <hi>inward man,</hi> to exerce an authority
over the <hi>conſcience,</hi> and our moſt retired thougths, als well as actings, and to put
ſhame and terrour on ſuch whoſe <hi>glorying is in appearance, bot not in heart.</hi> 5. Yow
know likewayes that the moſt ſelect ſocieties of ſuch who ever yet profeſt
the truth and ſince there hath been <hi>a Church</hi> on the earth, did never want a <hi>ſad mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
yea theſe feu <hi>choiſed difciples</hi> of our <hi>bleſt Maſter,</hi> was not only with a <hi>Judas</hi>
but a <hi>falling Peter,</hi> and a <hi>misbeleeuing Thomas</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mong them and ſhould this have
been a ground then for <hi>prejudice</hi> at the truth of <hi>chriſtianity</hi> in its firſt dauning when by
ſuch a conſtitution <hi>our great Maſter</hi> would have it known what his <hi>Church</hi> whilſt here
upon the earth will be even in the pureſt times thereof. 6. Will ye not allow
that meaſure which we finde in <hi>the primitive times,</hi> the Chriſtians did require of
their <hi>heathen</hi> adverſaries, upon any <hi>publict offences</hi> which were then objected to
them, to give but that <hi>allouance,</hi> which they did to their <hi>philoſophers,</hi> and ſuch
as profeſt <hi>morall vertue,</hi> amongſt them, which was not to charge the <hi>corruption and
offences,</hi> of the <hi>practice</hi> of any, <hi>on the rule of their profeſſion;</hi> whilſt yow have theſe
further inforcements of this, that yow know upon your own conſcience what a
ſore burthen and grief theſe are to ſuch, who are <hi>tender,</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> in following of
the truth, and how evident their diſcountenance of any ſuch appearance is, yea
may not the eſtablishment of <hi>Church diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>cenſure,</hi> with ſuch expreſs
<hi>rules</hi> herein by our <hi>bleſt head,</hi> convince and ſilence theſe who reproach. 7. Let
ſome who pretend moſt, to <hi>ſtumble</hi> on ſuch an accompt, ſpeak but their own
heart, if theſe be not much more their <hi>trouble, and torment</hi> whoſe walk does moſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65578:22"/>
convincingly tend, <hi>to adorne the profeſſion of the Goſpel,</hi> whoſe <hi>ſincere,</hi> and ſerious
embracement of the truth hes been with ſuch <hi>viſible outward diſſadvantage,</hi> and no
<hi>privat intereſt,</hi> to ſway them herein, as they ar enforced to ſee this, for none poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
could conceive, how this ſhould be on any other ground, then the <hi>known
pover and certainty therof on their ſoul.</hi> 8. Are not ſuch whoſe way is thus the
ground of your challenge, moſt viſibly <hi>condemned</hi> by their own <hi>avoued principles,</hi>
yea what ever eſſayes hath been to <hi>perſonat ſerious godlineſs,</hi> by a falſe ſhow yet
is it not moſt convincing, even to ſuch as look but at a diſtance, that <hi>native luſtre,
ſelf evidencing light,</hi> with that <hi>ſweet ſavour and efficacy,</hi> which accompanies the
ſame, as no poſſible <hi>invention,</hi> or <hi>art</hi> could ever reach, no more then to make a
<hi>dead picture</hi> live. Oh! that ſuch a day of reproach as this and that ſad <hi>woe</hi> the
world is ſo unſenſible of, becauſe of <hi>offences,</hi> might more ſuteably affect our hearts
and that it is with ſo viſible adeclining <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

love and zeall for God, ſelf denyall, and contempt of the world,</hi> ſeems to be all moſt
overgrown and worne out amongſt many profeſſours in this age.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Ground</hi> that I fear ſome may be ready this day to break and <hi>ſtumble</hi> on is, theſe
<hi>high pretences of zeall and fervency, for the truth in the way of ſo me as would ſeem
moſt viſibly to croſſe and interfer, with the moſt known principles of Chriſtian prudence,
yea that due neceſſar uſe of mens reaſone which the Scripture, does ſo indiſpenſibly
require. ANSW.</hi> though the <hi>zeall of God,</hi> and faithfullneſs for his intereſt even
with the moſt convincing evidence of the truth thereof to mens conſcience is that
which the world cannot bear; yet I hope theſe things when ſeriouſly conſidered
may ſilence any publict <hi>reflection</hi> herein. 1. That the greateſt want which may be
now matter of grief in all the <hi>Churches,</hi> is that of <hi>pure zeal and love to Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and
his truth and of ſuch a ſpirit to <hi>follow the Lord fully,</hi> and <hi>oh!</hi> our <hi>fall</hi> hath been too
great and univerſall from that <hi>firſt love</hi> which was wont to <hi>shine,</hi> and <hi>burne</hi> in theſe
who profeſt the truth to be hid this day, and ſeems one of the ſaddeſt preſages of a
dark night, yet coming on when with a continued <hi>light,</hi> the <hi>heat,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is ſo farre gone. 2. But to ſilence any ſuch reflection it may be demonſtrable
to the furtheſt; that the true and native tendence of the <hi>zeall of God,</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi>
in his work, can cauſe no <hi>breaking or diſorder,</hi> nor hath any <hi>irregular, violent motion</hi>
or ſcorching heat therwith, but where ever this moſt brightly ſhines, there alſo does a
humble tender condeſcendence to convince and gaine moſt evidently appear; how
<hi>by manifeſtation of the truth</hi> to mens conſcience, to prevent any ground may be thus
taken of offence; who <hi>is offended, and I burne not,</hi> was the temper of that bleſſed
mans ſpirit, when he was <hi>burning in zeall</hi> for God, and thus carried him out
that he might be <hi>all things to all, that he might gaine ſome:</hi> for ſuch ſhould be the
greateſt <hi>acrimony</hi> and <hi>sharpneſs,</hi> of theſe who ſhould be the <hi>ſalt of the earth</hi> that
it may allwayes tend to <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> to <hi>preſerve,</hi> and <hi>recover,</hi> and not to <hi>deſtroy.</hi> 3. And is
not <hi>Chriſtian wiſdom,</hi> and prudence a peece of our <hi>ſanctification,</hi> and a true and
native reſult of <hi>pure zeall, and love to Chriſt;</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o as the more a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the more
tender thus to keep by the <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>to walk circumſpectly not as fools,</hi> but as wiſe
(and is not mens <hi>folly</hi> ſtil a fruit of their own <hi>corruption)</hi> nor can the truth of godlineſs
be vigourouſly exerted, bot<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o farre, it will cauſe alſo ſnch a ſweet <hi>compoſure, and even
temper of ſpirit,</hi> as to watch with an equall advertance, to <hi>extreams upon either hand.</hi>
4. It needs be no ſtrange thing, or give any advantage to bring true <hi>Zeall,</hi> under
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65578:23"/>
diſcredit that there may be a more <hi>impetuo us motion,</hi> and making <hi>haſte</hi> by ſome
when they are out of the way, then they were formerly for the truth; it being too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
ſuch as are once under the <hi>influence of deluſion;</hi> are alſo in that dreadfull hazard to
be <hi>as winds carried about with a tempeſt;</hi> but ſuch is <hi>purezeal</hi> that tho it <hi>increas the ſtreame,</hi>
it does not <hi>overflow its bankes;</hi> nor wil <hi>breake the leaſt comand,</hi> for vindication of the
<hi>greateſt truth.</hi> 5. There is ſuch an indiſſoluble tye by the Holy Ghoſt betuixt <hi>true
zeall,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſtian moderation;</hi> which we ſhould <hi>make known to all,</hi> as none may
<hi>divide;</hi> but as the one tends to <hi>give life,</hi> and <hi>intenſneſs of Duty,</hi> ſo is the other to reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
all <hi>exorbitancy,</hi> and keep this in its proper channell; and that none be carried out,
beyond theſe <hi>juſt bounds,</hi> &amp; meaſures which are ſo expreſſly ſet to us by the rule, but ſo
as that it be without any <hi>lukewarmneſs</hi> or abatement of ſervency in ſpirit for ſerving
the Lord; for where on either hand theſe are <hi>divided,</hi> the credit of the truth,
and true intereſt of the Church, muſt then needs ſuffer, and get a ſor wound.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Ground of ſtumbling and offence</hi> which too viſibly many are like to <hi>break on,</hi>
yea to take <hi>prejudice allmoſt againſt the whole miniſtry of our Church, is that theſe who have
had greateſt weight and acceptance in the work of the Goſpell and hath endured
ſo much under many aſſaults, theſe years paſt, in their oppoſition to prelacy</hi> with ſome
unanſuerable conviction hereof; I hope to the <hi>conſcience</hi> of all, and with a continued
adherence to former <hi>principles, are yet with ſuch reproach, ſo publictly thus fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
even by profeſſed friends. ANSW.</hi> Though I hope the peruſall of what hath
been already touched on this <hi>ſubject</hi> may have ſome weight both for clearing, and
in ſome meaſure to ſilence thes ſtrange hightened <hi>prejudice</hi> of ſome this way; yet
ſince this is one of the <hi>greateſt tryalls</hi> of a <hi>Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> both on the account of
their <hi>work</hi> and the <hi>credit</hi> of their <hi>bleſt Maſter, who accounted them worthy to put into
his ſervice,</hi> and that many are thus in hazard to be ſhaken, I muſt yet further ſpeak
but a few things thereto; 1. That what ever may be their <hi>part</hi> who hath taken moſt
liberty this way, yet ſhould we reckon it is our <hi>ſins,</hi> that is their ſtrength; and
much unanſuerableneſs to <hi>ſo high and holy a calling;</hi> for which the holy God
doth thus call to <hi>a humble,</hi> and <hi>ſerious ſelf judging before him,</hi> and more deep tryall of our
own hearts and way with that fear leaſt our <hi>ſins should finde us out,</hi> if we be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to finde them and lay the ſame to heart; tho I hope ſuch yet, darre
with ſome confidence, leave their <hi>cauſe</hi> before the <hi>Lord,</hi> to plead herein
<hi>againſt the unjuſt reproach of men.</hi> 2. It'should be no ſtrange thing now what in all
tymes, hath been the lot of the moſt <hi>ſerious Miniſters of Chriſt</hi> even when they have
had a moſt ſweet, and ſenſible <hi>ſeall of his acceptance</hi> in their work, to have no other
requittall from men, then <hi>contempt,</hi> and <hi>hatred,</hi> who yet for the truths ſake, have
with the furtheſt tenderneſs ſought to gaine ſuch to the way of the Lord; yea have
had the tryall, of ſuch <hi>extreams</hi> as to be <hi>reviled by theſe</hi> who ſometimes would have
<hi>plucked out almoſt their eyes</hi> for them. 3. But it is ſure the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath with no
leſſe expreſſeneſs put a <hi>guard about the repute and credit of a Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> then
about their <hi>calling,</hi> for which <hi>read</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. 1. <hi>Theſſ</hi> 5. 12. 13. yea theſe are
ſo ſtraitely conjoined, as what ever tend to diſcredit their <hi>perſones,</hi> muſt needs
tend alſo to weaken the weight, and <hi>authority of their meſſage,</hi> on the conſcience of
the hearers; and is this of ſmall regard now with many, and to be without any
dread leaſt in ſo farre, the <hi>blood of ſouls,</hi> be charged on them in the day of the Lord;
who by ſuch notour reflections and without any juſt caus or calling thereto, did thus
beget ſuch <hi>a prejudice,</hi> and <hi>contempt,</hi> as to have the leſſe reckoning made of the word of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65578:23"/>
truth delivered by them. In this I muſt here exoner my own conſcience upon ſo
<hi>publict a ſin</hi> and of ſuch ſad conſeqence to the <hi>Churches hazard</hi> which ſeems ſo little to
touch this day. 4. Hath it been yet ever ſeen that where the <hi>Miniſters of
Chriſt,</hi> hath had no ſuteable <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>acceptance</hi> of their <hi>perſons,</hi> for their <hi>works ſake,</hi>
in any place bot there alſo was a moſt viſible abatement of peoples reſpect and love
to the truth and of any true grouth amongſt them under the ordinances, nor know I
an advantage which the <hi>envyous man</hi> could more deſire, to <hi>ſow tares in the vineyard of
the Lord,</hi> then this is when prejudice <hi>jealouſy, and diſreſpect,</hi> comes once to any
height, what ever pretences it may go under againſt ſuch who are in deed the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of truth, and diſpenſers of his ordinances. 5. And I hope there is juſt ground to
account ſuch the <hi>undoubted Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> in our Church and who ſhall be
thus owned in the day of his appearance; yea who have had a convincing ſeall to
their miniſtry on the hearts of many, who for miniſteriall abilities ſoundneſs in the
faith and being made examplary to others in <hi>humility, tenderneſs of walk love and fervent
deſire</hi> for <hi>gaineing of ſouls to Chriſt,</hi> would have been reckoned with the <hi>higheſt reſpect</hi>
in the firſt <hi>primitive times of the Church,</hi> who yet hath been this day expoſed to the
furtheſt revilings of ſome. And tho it is not the <hi>naked teſtimony</hi> or reſpects of men
that by ſuch would be either ſought, or ſatisfying, but how to have this
inforced on their <hi>conſcience,</hi> by a <hi>convincing witneſs,</hi> and <hi>example of a ſerious Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
practice,</hi> yet ſhould it not be ſtrange that ſuch be to the furtheſt concerned to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaine
the credit, &amp; authority of their miniſtry, which is not theirs but their Maſters.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Ground of prejudice, againſt the truth which is now highly pretended,</hi> is not only
upon the <hi>ſtrainge and highly irregular actings, by ſome, as may ſeem viſibly inductive to
greateſt confuſion and diſorder, bot that theſe have been owned and ſupported by ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
congruous thereto, as ſeem in compatible both with the practice, and profeſſion, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
of our Church. ANSW.</hi> Whatever advantage hath been given by any thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
which (I may with ſome confidence ſay in behalf of the moſt ſerious <hi>Non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi>
of our <hi>Church</hi>) have been <hi>as a ſword in there bones</hi> even beyond their own
perſonall ſufferrings <hi>becauſe of the voice of him who reproacheth,</hi> yet ſince many are thus
ready to <hi>stumble</hi> and knows not, what a ſore woe and judgment, <hi>offences are</hi> to
ſuch as make ſo ſad an uſe thereof: yea which may be feared this day, are glad of
any advantage herein: and that where ſuch a <hi>poiſenous cloud of prejudice</hi> interveens,
and a <hi>prejudicat impreſſion of the truth,</hi> and <hi>of ſerious godlineſs,</hi> is the <hi>glaſſe,</hi> there
cannot but be very ſad <hi>reflections</hi> thereon: I muſt yet crave leave in a few words,
as a witneſs to the <hi>truth of our profeſſion,</hi> and for a <hi>juſt vindication</hi> offer theſe things to
be conſidered, by the conſcience of our greateſt Adverſaries herein. 1. That we
ſhould ſeek no greater favour, but that upon cleareſt evidence, from the tryall and
judgment of the <hi>Scriptures of truth, (which we are ready to render, to all that ask)</hi>
there might be ſuch free acceſs to a <hi>publict,</hi> and ſerious reaſoning herein, as that the
<hi>truth might be heard for it ſelf,</hi> judging it no leſs our concerne to <hi>convince mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
for commending the way of the Lord to their conſcience, then to <hi>engadge
the affections.</hi> 2. That it is, in no <hi>new, or ſtrainge caice,</hi> we are now ſtated; and
do own no other judgment and <hi>principles</hi> this day, then what are expreſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the moſt <hi>purely Reformed Churches of Chriſt,</hi> ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and is
that good and old way, and the ſame truth for which our worthy <hi>pred<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ceſſours</hi> did
by their wreſtling prayers and ſufferings ſo vigourouſly contend yea wherein ſo
innumerable a company of moſt ſerious ſolid and tender Chriſtians have been <hi>ſealed</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65578:24"/>
and found ſuch abounding comforts of the ſpirit of truth upon their ſuffering
and teſtimony upon the ſame. 3. That it is no <hi>privat intereſt, or, for our own things</hi>
no temporall honour greatneſs or riches in this world that ſuch ſore wreſtlings by
the godly in our Church hath been, which I hope may now have ſome conviction
and witneſs on the conſcience of our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> and how ſuch have not wanted
an very obvious and <hi>alluring baite</hi> this way, may be eaſy to judge if ſome <hi>greater
intereſt</hi> did not preponder at of being to dear a purchaſe at ſo ſad a rate of <hi>unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs,
to our bleſſed Lord and Maſter</hi> in his truth. 4. That it hath been no matter
<hi>of indifference, or any ſmall and triviall intereſt,</hi> ſuch have been concerned in theſe late
tryalls to appear for, bot for the <hi>lawes, and intereſt, of Chriſt, and the rights and
liberties his Kingdom,</hi> which after ſome bleſt and confortable poſſeſſion ſo long yea

meaſure of the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of our <hi>fathers</hi> thereto, againſt ſuch invaſion on ſo great an

own no <hi>doctrine, or principles</hi> but what tends to give all <hi>due reſpect and obedience to the
Magiſtrate,</hi> without detracting from his juſt rights and power, bot <hi>to gave unto Ceſar
the things that are Ceſars</hi> yea without the leaſt denying to the Chriſtian Magiſtrat,
whatever with any Scripture warrant, we may allow, of an <hi>externall objectively, eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick

is ſo incompatible with the order and Governement eſtabliſhed by him, who is the
alone <hi>head</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver</hi> to his own <hi>houſe, whoſe Kingdom is not of this world.</hi> 6. We
may ſay with a humble appeal to their conſcience w<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o do moſt reproach, that it is
for no <hi>preheminence</hi> or to <hi>be Lords over Gods heritage</hi> or owning any power bot what is

the <hi>inward man</hi> for its proper <hi>object</hi> and the true <hi>edification</hi> of the body of Chriſt for
its <hi>peculiar end,</hi> wherein we own a ſpeciall regard to be had in the whole exerciſe
and application thereof, and in dealing with the conſcience of <hi>gainſayers,</hi> that it be

before a <hi>publict, and judicial procedour.</hi> And if any juſt ground of offence hath been
given in the <hi>exceſs</hi> of ſome this way let it cauſe no reflection on that bleſt and <hi>beautiful
order</hi> in the houſe of the Lord our God appointed by himſelf, yea which with
grief upon any convincing evident thereof we ſhould to the furtheſt diſſown. 7. It
is evident that theſe <hi>ſacred tyes of our oath</hi> and <hi>covenant with God,</hi> we are ſo ſolemnly
engadged in, containe no other <hi>duties</hi> or obligations, then what the Scripture indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſibly
obleidges to, and are ſtated on theſe great concerns of <hi>truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>
8. We can alſo witneſs with ſome quiet and aſſurance that the great anne
and concerne of the <hi>moſt ſerious Non-conforme Miniſters of Chriſt, in our Church,</hi> in
their adventuring to <hi>preach the Goſpel</hi> not withſtanding of any prohibitions by the
preſent <hi>Law</hi> hath been upon no <hi>ſactious</hi> or <hi>privat deſigne,</hi> bot under conſtraint
of duty, upon ſo preſſing a call and neceſſity of the people, as theſe unto whom
the diſpenſation, of <hi>the Goſpel and ordinances, is commit,</hi> and a <hi>neceſſity</hi> thus laide
upon them with ſome ſerious aime, and deſire, I hope, to purſne this end, and
to sheu the indiſpenſible nead of imbracing that bleſt offer of <hi>reconciliation by Chriſt:</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65578:24"/>
as alſo to preſſe <hi>holineſs,</hi> and give warning of any ſhare when it is evident the people
might be in hazard thereby. Nor dare our reſpect to the <hi>perſons</hi> of any in the leaſt,
ballance with the intereſt of <hi>truth</hi> here, for a publick diſowning with grief what ever
in their way have given juſt cauſe of <hi>offence,</hi> and <hi>ſtumbling</hi> in ſuch a time.
9. It is the <hi>revealed truth of the Scripture,</hi> which we do expreſly own as the alone
<hi>formal object of our Faith;</hi> and that it is there each ſhould come to <hi>prove his work,</hi>
bot a that it be <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

no ſecurity could be from the greateſt confuſion and irregularity among men. 10.
That <hi>extraordinare motions, or impulſes,</hi> muſt be no rule or warrand of duty, nor for
any going beyond theſe expreſs bounds, ſet to us in the word, by which they muſt
be known and tryed; for God hath aſſigned to each their ſtation, and <hi>calling,</hi> and
that a ſerious and tender regard ſhould be againſt all exorbitance in the <hi>exceſs</hi> als well

there cannot want ſome teſtimony thereto even on the conſcience of our
greateſt adverſaries.</p>
            <p>8. I muſt nere yet add on ſtrange ground of quarrell and <hi>prejudice; that a ſerious
adherence to the Government and Kingdom of Chriſt over his Church, for which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of his Lawes and inſtitution is ſo unanſwerably clear, should be judged incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
with the civill intereſt, and ſecurity of the ſtate.</hi> For <hi>ANSW.</hi> if men ſhut their
own eyes, where the Scripture is ſo clear; and hath thus ſhewed us, <hi>not only what
is juſt, but what is good,</hi> and how aſſuredly this is the greateſt concerne of a Nation
to have the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>rights</hi> thereof eſtabliſht; and kept up,

               </gap>y expreſs intent and tendence thereof is to promote and tranſmit both
the purity and power of godlineſs to the preſent and ſucceeding ages, I confeſſe
there can be no reaſoning, then in ſuch a caice, but if principles of <hi>ſelf love,</hi> to our
temporall advantage and ſuch pretended reſpect to the <hi>publick intereſt of the Land,</hi>
bear any weight; I would but plead a little, with a ſerious appeal to theſe <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
which our adverſaries do yet own, and aſſent to; if the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>ſerious
practice of godlineſs</hi> and theſe means which are neceſſarily directing thereto, be not
viſibly the great intereſt and ſafety of a <hi>Nation,</hi> and to have the furtheſt awe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
thereof kept up; upon theſe grounds. 1. Becauſe thus is the greateſt inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>civill duties,</hi> by a religious tye, and on principles of conſcience. 2. That
this tends to the furtheſt advance and improvement of <hi>human nature;</hi> both to
make human ſociety ſweet and deſireable, and for a more vigou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ous and true im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of mens naturall abilities, for the publick good intereſt of that place.
3. And can this be a publick grievance, which brings the greateſt inforcements to
<hi>ſincerity, candor, and truth;</hi> which as it is eſſentially neceſſar for the eſtabliſhment
of <hi>juſtice,</hi> and <hi>moral righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo tends to beget true mutuall aſſurance both in
words, and actings amongſt men? and how poſſibly can a Nation be ſafe; or any
true intercourſe and ſecurity in our perſonall concerns, where <hi>truth, and godlineſs</hi> hath
no due reſpect there. 4. Is it not thus the duties of our ſeverall <hi>relations</hi> are moſt
promote, yea which gives the greateſt ſecurity to <hi>civill Government,</hi> and ſets home
on mens hearts their obligations to <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> as the Ordinance of God; <hi>not from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65578:25"/>
fear, but for conſcience ſake,</hi> and it is little known, what hid pledges, ſuch as are truly
godly are of the peace and ſafty of the Land they are in. 5. Can the bleſt tendencie of
truth and godlineſs, be under deba<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

raiſed too viſibly, moſt of theſe ſtorms, and tempeſts which are in the world, and
cauſeth ſo dreadfull diſorders amongſt men. 6. It is ſure alſo the way of truth, muſt

<hi>to work with their own hands</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5: 11. and to <hi>abide in that calling, in which
the Lord hath placed them;</hi> and to painfulneſs and induſtry therein, to be no <hi>buſy

muſt demonſtratively witneſs this like wayes, what a publick bleſſing, <hi>truth
and godlineſs,</hi> is to the Land wherein it is kept up; I ſhall only add this more, what

<hi>the love of our neighbour,</hi> and to <hi>do unto others, as we would be dealt with,</hi> by

an after reckoning with their own conſcience as to their way, in this winnowing time</hi> when
ſuch hot contendings hes been in the <hi>Church,</hi> for which I would humbly offer theſe.
1. what ſweet peace will then be in having been kept cloſs at <hi>home</hi> with a tender and

where the ſtrength of theſe ſtrange <hi>paroxiſmes, of heat, and bitterneſs,</hi> amongſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the truth does now moſt lye, that it is from theſe jarring <hi>corruptions</hi> upon
the heart, more then from any <hi>differences of light and judgement</hi> and which no eager

cure, &amp; then we might both hope for a bleſt healing compoſure under theſe different
meaſures of light amongſt Chriſtian, and for a tender and humble reaſoning in things
wherein they differ, when thus a <hi>more near conformity to the Spirit, and rule of the Goſpell,</hi>
is once reached, which muſt needs ſubject the Soul, to account it our greateſt
honour, to be overcome by the truth. 2. That they have been kept from any ſuch

               <hi>precipitant judgment of others,</hi> as uſually follow on ſuch debates; and their ſpirit

prevaile with mens conſcience, even of known and publict adverſaries</hi> now in a time of ſo
great reproach; and it is ſure theſe ſhould be ſpecial advantages for ſuch ane end.
1. When the truth of <hi>holineſs,</hi> in convincing and viſible realities of a Chriſtians
<hi>practiſe,</hi> as are preſent before mens eyes does appear, which was the <hi>glory</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> in the primitive times, who were then the firſt fruits of the Goſpel among the
gentiles, that it was ſaid, <hi>they did not ſpeak great things, but live them;</hi> and which
was then ſpecially noted by adverſaries: <hi>ſee how the Chriſtians love, one another;</hi> for
then did the love of Chriſt bear rule in his peoples heart; but how ſad an account is
recorded in ſome ages after, <hi>that no times had been more fertile of religions;</hi> than theſe
and of great conteſts this way, but none more <hi>barren of religion;</hi> in the truth and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
thereof; whilſt it ſeemed rather the <hi>notion</hi> of religion, moſt converſed with
in ſuch a Day, then with the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf. 2. When this doth appear, under great
<hi>tribulation;</hi> for it is then both <hi>religion,</hi> and <hi>theſe who profeſse it,</hi> are at once proved;
and is aſſuredly one of the choiceſt opportunities of a Chriſtians life to convince the
world; but oh it ſeems ſuch a proſpect of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is now rare, as the ſaints have
had in former times or; or ſuch a <hi>conjunction,</hi> as this when they <hi>received the word under
great affliction,</hi> but with a <hi>greater joy, and comfort of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 3. When a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65578:26"/>
and tender way, is followed by chriſtians, to gaine more upon mens <hi>judgment,</hi>
by a <hi>humble, and rational account from the Scripture of their hope,</hi> and practiſe, then by
a more confident, and <hi>ſevere impoſing, upon their faith</hi> ſince it is ſure, the <hi>premiſſes,</hi>
and <hi>concluſion</hi> muſt be ſtill relative, and the truth much more hurt then helped
when it is not in a convincing way, commended to the conſcience even of adverſaries.
It is not <hi>ſufferings;</hi> but the <hi>cauſe</hi> that makes the <hi>martyre;</hi> that it be indeed for the
<hi>truth,</hi> and no juſt ground of offence, be by any given to darken the credit thereof,
and here there muſt be no redeming of the perſonall repute of any, at ſo high a
rate, as a publick daſh, and prejudice to the honour, and credit of the way of the
Lord, in this day. 4. This alſo were a ſpeciall advantage, for gaining reſpect to
the truth, when in the room of ſore and bitter compleanings; the <hi>voice of joy,</hi> and
<hi>thanksgiving,</hi> may be heard, amongſt ſuch as own the way of the Lord this day;
even under all their <hi>griefs and preſſures</hi> other wayes. I write this under ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
how rare ſuch a <hi>ſtudy,</hi> ſeems now to adorne the profeſſion of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi>
though it is ſure, none ever ſought to finde the comfort, and mercy of their <hi>lot,</hi> for
an excitement to this bleſt excerciſe of <hi>praiſe;</hi> but found cauſe for it, and how to be
faithfull, in a leſſer meaſure, but they found more added; and how great a want
this is, and <hi>hinderance to the prayers of the Church,</hi> this day is more then we ſeem to lay
to heart; yea how much thus the world is tempted, to judge <hi>religion, only a dead
forme;</hi> and that Chriſtians do not in truth beleeve, what they beleeve, yea that they
are few, if any, on the earth, who walk ſuteably to ſuch a <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> of
the glory, which is to come. I am ſure, as no ſerious and wiſe obſerver, but
might finde their being under ſome <hi>ſingular engadgments</hi> from what hath been the
way of the Lords dealing with them; ſo it is ſad when theſe are more <hi>buried</hi> almoſt
and <hi>forgot,</hi> then <hi>ſearchd</hi> out under preſent and new trouble. <hi>Some would judge a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teable
acceſſe, to give in their mite, to this treaſure, a ſpecial enlargement; and to own
a peculiar debt, to ſo great a duty, for putting their ſeal, to the truth, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God this day, and to bear a honourable witneſs to his way, amidſt all the changes, and
remarkably ſearching tryals, have occurred, in the courſe of their pilgrimage. He is the
rock his work is perfect, and all his wayes are judgment, a God of truth, juſt, and true,
is he. Deut.</hi> 23. 3. <hi>O that men would praiſe him, and that one generation, would declare
his works, to another, and tranſmit the memory of his goodneſs;</hi> yea that ſuch a bleſt
conformity to the doctrin of Chriſt in humility, love, meekneſs, bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
and overcoming evill with good, might this day more appear; as the world
thus, might be both judged, and condemned in their own conſcience thereby:</p>
            <p>3. This alſo might be a ſuteable and edifiing ſtudy for Chriſtians in ſuch a time,
for <hi>getting a clear ſight, of the way of the Lord,</hi> amidſt all theſe ſtrange and amazing
things, which are before us, both for their own <hi>ſtrengthening,</hi> and to <hi>juſtifie his holy
and unſpotted righteouſneſſe,</hi> and thus to conſider, that what ever, we now ſee yet
it is ſo clear. 1. That the <hi>glory of the Church militant,</hi> and greateſt <hi>triumph,</hi> which the
Goſpel hath had ſince its firſt dawning in the world, was yet never by any outward
<hi>clam,</hi> or proſperous ſtate here, but under <hi>tribulation,</hi> and <hi>diſtreſſe,</hi> in <hi>ignominy, and
contempt,</hi> els I muſt confeſſe, I have miſtaken the Scripture; and that thus the moſt
<hi>Lucide intervals,</hi> and ſunshine hath been moſt uſually ſhort, and not only a dark
cloud but a ſeen neceſſity thereof, hath ſtill followed. 2. And how ſweet, and
confirming might ſuch a clear proſpect be, now to a ſhaken Chriſtian, of the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar
<hi>congruity, of ſuch a providence, both to the revealed truth,</hi> and <hi>infinit wiſdom of God,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65578:26"/>
in his dealing with his people; that <hi>ſo ſtraite, and wearyſome away,</hi> ſhould be here
to an <hi>eternity of glory,</hi> in that life; which is to come; and no getting there but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
ſome <hi>degrees, of ſore breaking,</hi> and <hi>anguish,</hi> and going through a <hi>ſtate of
tryall,</hi> befor that of <hi>enjoyment;</hi> when they conſider, how unconceiveably great
and excellent, that <hi>ſtate</hi> which is <hi>above,</hi> is; and their being trained in ſo ſharp a
a <hi>ſchool of tribulation</hi> here, ſhall at length tend to an unexpreſſible joy, and comfort,
that ever they had ſuch an occaſion to prove their love and adherence to Jeſus Chriſt
and of crediting his truth againſt all viſible grounds, and in having with patience and
hope got through ſuch a throng of temptations, when they thus ſee, the moſt bitter
grieving, and difficult part of their warfare, was but to make the victory more full,
and triumphant. 3. Thus we might have a more <hi>clear, and confirming look of the
holy judgment of the Lord,</hi> in the <hi>product</hi> of theſe ſad <hi>breakings,</hi> in our Church that
when ſo ſtrange a ſpirit, hath been aloft, and a ſtrong affection in ſome, without a
humble and deliberat judgment, it ſhould at laſt reſolve in a <hi>fervor of error and deluſion,</hi>
yea to come that length of <hi>breaking down what they ſuppoſed to be bulding up, and to</hi>
adventure with greateſt confidence <hi>for engadging the Holy God,</hi> to a concurrance in
theſe wayes which his word doth expreſſly teſtify againſt, whilſt ſo impatient to be
touched herein, as they have been ready to turne again and tear ſuch, who hath
with tenderneſs, ſought their recovery. But tho ſuch ſad things ſhould deeply
affect us yet, there is no cauſe for <hi>ſtumbling</hi> to any; <hi>pure religion and undefiled</hi> is the ſame
this day that ever it was; and the redeemed of the Lord, <hi>are a broken,</hi> and <hi>diſeaſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi>
whielſt here by the way full <hi>of ſores and Diſtempers,</hi> but all under <hi>cure,</hi> which
will ere long be perfyted, and I hope through grace, there is a generation of <hi>tender,
ſolid,</hi> and <hi>humble Chriſtians</hi> yet in <hi>our land</hi> (who ſhall be owned and accepted at the
appearance of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> as this day I know on the earth; and many much hid
there; but what is too viſible the <hi>temper and complexion of this age,</hi> may cauſe much
fear, upon theſe peculiar <hi>hazards,</hi> profeſſors now ſeem to be expoſed to; beyond
former times, when a <hi>forme of knowledge,</hi> and the <hi>theory of practical religion</hi> hath ſo
farr outgone <hi>tenderneſs and practice,</hi> and become ſo much a matter of art, and <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
whilſt Chriſtians formerly with a ſmaller meaſure of light and in a plainer dreſſe,
walked in the love and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the truth; <hi>a bold and profeſſing age,</hi> where a too
eaſy <hi>and ſuddain growth to a forward appearance</hi> amongſt many, hath ſo viſibly out run a
ſolid rooting in the truth, and that fear and ſerious exerciſe on their own ſoul, about
their ſpiritual ſtate and the ſoundneſs of <hi>converſion</hi> as hath ſometimes been; <hi>an age</hi>
where it may be feared that not at a common rate many are like to adventure on
the furtheſt hazard of periſhing amidſt theſe ſtrange diſtempers in our <hi>Church,</hi> but
with <hi>higheſt pretences</hi> ſeem to out darre all means of <hi>conviction;</hi> even while with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
tenderneſs and love to their ſouls followed, yea <hi>an age</hi> when that dreadful engine
of Sathan is now ſo diſcernibly on foot and in ſuch different <hi>formes</hi> and <hi>shape,</hi> by <hi>the
ſpirit of error and deluſion,</hi> to turne men off all ſetled perſuaſion of the truth and give
the credit and intereſt of the Goſpel a ſorer wound, then the open violence and <hi>rage</hi>
of others, hath yet ever done; and is not here one ſad influencing cauſe of ſo deplorable
a State of the <hi>Church</hi> this day, that many profeſſing godlineſſe in this <hi>age</hi> are not more
taken up with the <hi>great and weighty things thereof,</hi> and in theſe retired exerciſes which
hath the cloſſeſt communication with the <hi>vitals of Chriſtianity;</hi> and ſo indiſpenſibly
neceſſar to a honourable appearance for the Lord, in any publict duty and ſervice of
the time.</p>

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65578:27"/>
4. What a choiſe ſtudy in ſo extreme an exigence now of the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould this be
to know, and bring near, by ſome more deep reflection thereon, <hi>how great theſe
things are, which a humble and ſerious Chriſtian hath to converſe with, and to oppoſe all his
griefs and fears this day, even when they ſeem to preſſe above meaſure;</hi> which this might
not only confirme but overcome the heart with unexpreſſible joy, when he but thus
alone reaſons with himſelf. 1. What ever ſhaking winds now blow, almoſt from
evry airth, yet hath he firme and <hi>ſureſt, principles of truſt</hi> for a ſafe founding the reſt
and peace of his ſoul, and his <hi>ſecurity here is full</hi> though not his <hi>enjoyment,</hi> yea what
ever want now be of the <hi>certainty of adherence</hi> in reſting on the truth with ſuch full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and quiet of minde he is called to: yet he knowes thereis no want, of furtheſt
<hi>certainty of evidence.</hi> 2. That not in a dream, but in the moſt ſerious compoſure of
ſpirit, he can retire into the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> and there ſee how unexpreſſiblie bleſſed
poor loſt man is made by <hi>a redeemer:</hi> on whom he hath choiced to have the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
riches of his grace ſhewed forth to all eternity, yea this in ſo marvelous a way
when no poſſible help could be found in us, that the <hi>Holy God, would take ſatisfaction
to himſelf by himſelf,</hi> not only to <hi>ſave</hi> his people but to preſerve the <hi>rights of juſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable:</hi>
yea hath thus brought us under a <hi>Law to come and be bleſſed in his Son,</hi> to
whom he bears record that in him is <hi>life,</hi> and an eternall ſalvation made ſure. 3. That
the clear intent of this <hi>aſtonishing miſtery</hi> is not only to <hi>ſave his people from wrath,</hi> but
to <hi>make them meet</hi> by the <hi>ſpirit of holyneſs,</hi> for that <hi>ſtate,</hi> which is above: ſince it is
not <hi>pardon</hi> alone, or <hi>a heaven without us,</hi> can make any bleſſed untill the ſoul once
be framed for it, and this firſt begun and wrought there, and now, what hath a
Chriſtian this day to converſe when amidſt the multitude of his ſaddeſt thoughts, he
can with ſuch aſſurance retire into <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> and thence look up to an <hi>eternity of glory</hi>
as that which ere long he ſhall know and enjoy. 4. That this is ſo ſure, for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
that ſuch a <hi>ſignature and Impreſs of the Goſpel,</hi> in the truth and reality of <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
is to be ſeen this day in the earth, I hope yet in innumereable inſtances even in theſe
declining times with ſo viſible an aſſimilation and likneſs to a <hi>higher ſtate</hi> herein, that
if men but exerce reaſon, they might ſee, it is Sure a marvelous <hi>transforming power,</hi>
could ever make ſuch a change, and that <hi>miracles</hi> (if rightly conſidered) does not
this day ceaſe in the <hi>Church,</hi> whilſt ſo great a witneſs to the power and truth of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
is continued. 5. He thus ſees that tho no <hi>reſemblance of our bleſſed head</hi> hath
been left to the Church, of his <hi>human appearance</hi> whilſt he was in the earth; yet is
his undoubted <hi>Image and portraiture</hi> drawne to the <hi>life,</hi> to be ſeen here, in the <hi>truth
and reality of holyneſs;</hi> and how much ſhould this commend and indear truth, in the
inward parts, and tender walking with God unto chriſtians, that thus not only the
<hi>reflection of his image on ſuch</hi> may be convincing to the world in whom as ſo many <hi>mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>
he hath choiſed to ſhine forth, and appear; but that in this ſtate of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
whilſt <hi>they ſee him not whom their ſoul loves,</hi> they may yet ſtill <hi>wear his bleſſed
portrature within on their heart,</hi> and thus diſcerinbly ſee him there, until they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up to himſelf for ever. 6. Thus he can intertaine his ſoul in ſo diſmall an hower,
that he knowes aſſuredly, there are <hi>comforts here,</hi> which have no <hi>riſe</hi> or <hi>affinity with
the flesh,</hi> unexpreſſibly above all the <hi>griefs of time,</hi> and ſeeks no credit from any on
report but to be found upon ſureſt tryall, ſuch as no <hi>grief, paine or preſſure</hi> was yet
ever at that hight in the lot of any of the ſaints, which the <hi>ſpirit of the Lord</hi> cannot
make ſweet and eaſy to endure, yea hath oft looked them out of <hi>paine</hi> with a preſent
ſenſible outgate on their ſoul before any outward deliverance broke up. 7. He kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65578:27"/>
alſo that the greateſt comforts within time are aſſuredly in the <hi>life and exerciſe of
godlineſs;</hi> when thus a ſincere reſignation, is reached, and a feeling of themſelfs to
<hi>offer freely</hi> yea with joy their <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and moſt indeared indeared intereſts to the Lord;
in having credit his truth againſt <hi>viſible grounds of hope,</hi> and their being helped to croſſe
ſome preſent deſireable <hi>intereſt of ſenſe,</hi> on the alone incouragement of <hi>faith</hi> and when
ſome remarkable ſharp <hi>triall</hi> hath been thus got well through; upon this ſweat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
alſo of having gained a <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> for the Lord, that may be for
ſome <hi>fruit</hi> to his praiſe, and of a ſtreight and ſerious aime to pleaſe him, when the
viſible diſpleaſure of men, hath come in competition therewith, O what <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
and an abundant entry to a chriſtians peace will be then felt. 8. He hath this to
be confirming, what unexpreſſible delight and pleaſure is found on diſpleaſing the
<hi>flesh,</hi> even in its moſt <hi>impetuous,</hi> and <hi>violent motions,</hi> in tryall of their obedience,
and love to Chriſt (what ever paine may be for a little in that conflict) as lets him ſee,
<hi>reſistance to ſin</hi> is the moſt gainefull, and rationall act of his life; whilſt with any
ſinfull delight, which in a moment is gone, an imbittering <hi>ſting</hi> and inward <hi>shame</hi>
upon the guilt thereof, does then only abide, yea is ſo tried that <hi>the way of ſin,</hi> can
never ceaſe to be a way of <hi>paine,</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> if the <hi>ſtrenght</hi> and <hi>malignity of the diſeaſe</hi>
did not take of all ſenſe thereof, which as a <hi>bone out of joint,</hi> hath no eaſe, nor does
ſuffer the whol body to be at reſt; whilſt on the other hand in cloſſe following the
rule, and reſiſting a preſent temptation, what <hi>ſweet peace, humble confidence,</hi> and
<hi>comfortable acceſſe to God,</hi> with <hi>inward rejoycing</hi> is moſt ſenſibly then found, and how
here only is the way of his relief; and a great ſeal thus to the truth, when he ſees
ſo firme and indiſſoluble a tie betwixt <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> as the worſt of times
can never break of. 9. He knowes that if no ſearching <hi>tryal,</hi> there could be no
<hi>triumph</hi> and in ſo farre ſhould be ſhut out from the <hi>overcomers joy,</hi> to which the foreſt
wreſtling of a chriſtian when ſanctifiingly exerciſing muſt ſtill make way. 10. And
what thoughts might theſe be on a more deep reflection, upon the truth, and <hi>reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of prayer,</hi> that here is no conjecturall thing but ſuch a <hi>paſſage,</hi> is ſure, knowne,
and tryed, betwixt heaven, and a Chriſtians ſoul; which hath had ſo wonderfull
<hi>effects,</hi> and <hi>certain returns,</hi> in the greateſſ exigence and ſtrait; and is not only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<hi>dutie,</hi> but <hi>mean</hi> of their reliefe, yea not only the ſweeteſt way of converſe
with God here on the earth; but is the moſt effectual to prevaile and obtaine.</p>
            <p>I ſhall but add, a few words more, now in the cloſe, and deteane the <hi>reader</hi> no
further; that it would have been judged, the appearance of the <hi>time,</hi> in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
exigence, with what may be ſeen of the <hi>deplorable ſtate of the Church of Chriſt,</hi>
not only in <hi>Brittain,</hi> but almoſt univerſally, might ere now have allayed theſe high
<hi>diſtempers,</hi> hath been of late, when <hi>popery</hi> is on ſo preſent and dreadfull an approach
as threatens to ſwallow up all, and when that <hi>mine,</hi> which hath been ſo long in the
dark, and digging under the ground, ſeems ſo near to <hi>ſpring,</hi> yea hath got too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
advantage, to enter at ſuch a breach (as hath been of late) and gain ground this
way. It is true, it may ſeem not eaſy to comprehend and is ſurely one of the greateſt
<hi>dephts</hi> of the judgment of God this day, how in one and the <hi>ſame age</hi> where the
truth hath ſo brightly ſhined, both in <hi>purity,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> there can be a ſubjecting
of ſo many with their own conſent, to ſo viſible and notour an <hi>Impoſtur, as popery is,</hi>
and after all we have ſeen, this Surpriſing darkneſſe, ſhould now-come to ſuch a
hight, as men are turned thus cruel againſt themſelves, and the <hi>Poſterity,</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up all that ſhould be deareſt to them, to ſuch a party: yea engadge in a way
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65578:28"/>
that ſo clearly enervats the whole intent of the Goſpel, and where there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable
acceſs for <hi>ſeduction,</hi> by any <hi>arguments to mens reaſon, and judgment;</hi> or on
other termes then to ſhut their eyes firſt on the <hi>Bible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ever length this <hi>tryal,</hi> may now come, and tho it ſhould yet once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
againſt all viſible profeſſion of the truth in the Church of <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
we ſhould adore the ſpotleſs righteouſneſs of God herein in delivering mens reaſon
and judgment up to ſo <hi>ſtrong deluſion,</hi> ſince as the greateſt of bleſſings which ever
came to the world is the <hi>pure light of the Goſpel;</hi> it needs not be ſtrange that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
of <hi>judgments</hi> follow on a peoples <hi>contempt,</hi> and <hi>rejecting thereof,</hi> ſo as nothing is
ſo abſurd and irrationally groſſe which theſe will not drink in who have once rejected
the truth. But ſince the proſpect and impreſſion of this <hi>time,</hi> is like to be more
<hi>fainting,</hi> then to <hi>confirme,</hi> or awake to duty, I would but touch this a little, though
there can be no poſſible ſtumbling, for want of light, when the truth and doctrine
of the <hi>reformed religion</hi> is ſo fully cleared; and tho this might ſeem <hi>incongruous</hi> with
the forgoeing <hi>ſubject,</hi> yet I am ſure not unſuteable to the time when ſuch hazard is
now of much ſtumbling, and men do unſenſibly weare at a diſtance from under theſe
former <hi>impreſſions</hi> of the <hi>truth,</hi> and the way of the Lord, which they once had; yea
that a few dayes may come the Churches way more remarkable for <hi>tryal,</hi> then all
hath yet ever been in this <hi>age;</hi> I ſhall but offer ſome ſpecial <hi>reflexions</hi> now ſutable to
ſuch a day, and of ſo known publick, and unqueſtionable evidence, to the <hi>Church</hi>
that when brought near to our thoughts, may let us ſee how farre the <hi>advantage,</hi>
and <hi>meaſure</hi> of theſe <hi>confirmations</hi> of the <hi>truth,</hi> given in to this <hi>generation,</hi> does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
that of <hi>former times;</hi> and I ſhould hop ſuch an <hi>exerciſe,</hi> might be of uſe and bleſſed
through the Lords gracious concurrence for Chriſtians furtheſt <hi>confirming,</hi> thus but
to reaſon with themſelf, and have more deep <hi>reflectings</hi> thereon.</p>
            <p>1. What ever hight this preſent aſſault from <hi>popery,</hi> may come to yet we
know how ſolemne a <hi>triumph,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> hes had, and that ſurly it is the <hi>ſame truth,
and cauſe of the reformed Church;</hi> for which ſo <hi>great</hi> things, hath the Lord wrought,
when that <hi>bleſt revolution</hi> once came, after Antichriſtian darkneſs had overſpread the
face of the World for many ages; ſo as the <hi>full ſtroak,</hi> and <hi>down fall of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
ſeems not more <hi>marvelous,</hi> and above all humane appearances, when now
at a diſtance; then what <hi>we have already ſeen.</hi> 2. That it is clear, how <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare
a power</hi> did attend this bleſt <hi>work of the Churches riſing</hi> and that aſtoniſhing <hi>ſwift
progreſs</hi> thereof, as <hi>nations ſeemed to be borne at once, and the earth to bring forth in one
day; Churches</hi> was then both <hi>planted,</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> betwixt the <hi>Year</hi> 1521. <hi>and</hi> 70.
like a <hi>new Chriſtian World,</hi> thus brought forth and ſetled, yea how farre this was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
viſible means and how little intereſt <hi>inſtruments</hi> had therein as it may be ſtill
ſaid, let none fear or <hi>ſtager at the promiſe of God,</hi> though difficulties in an ordinare
way, ſeem inſuperable; after we have now ſeen what the Lord hath don theſe
laſt ages. 3. That it is ſo evident, how with the firſt ſhining forth of the <hi>truth,</hi>
and <hi>doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> in the <hi>purity</hi> thereof, the <hi>life and power of Chriſtianity</hi> came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
therewith to the world, and how this bleſt light, did lead in, to greateſt <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
in <hi>the walk,</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> of Chriſtians, which we might ſee yet as ſtill preſent
before us, how extraordinare an <hi>effuſion of the ſpirit of God,</hi> this was, which cauſed
then ſo marvelous a <hi>change,</hi> and luſtre on the Church. 4. Have we not ſeen to confirme
us of the truth, theſe <hi>prodigies of cruelty</hi> hath been acted, by the <hi>popish</hi> party ſuch as
ſome immediat power and incitement of the <hi>Divell,</hi> can only anſwer and hath ſo
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65578:28"/>
farre outgone the ordinare rate of <hi>humane cruelty,</hi> as if <hi>Infernall ſpirits,</hi> had then come
and aſſumed human ſhape, to act this way; yea is evident that no ſuch meaſures can
be found under the <hi>heathenish</hi> perſecution againſt the Chriſtian Church and in that
ſtrange way and manner followed as the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Irish maſſacre,</hi> hath been.
5. That ſuch horrid <hi>practiſes</hi> alſo, hath been conſequentiall to their <hi>doctrine,</hi> and
<hi>principles,</hi> ſo as this hath not only been diſpenſed with <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               </gap> by that <hi>Church,</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

               </gap> fury ſhould but

                  </gap> ſecurity,</hi> from ſuch

make their greateſt aſſault, yea whoſe very religion, does ſo evidently ſubvert all
<hi>truth,</hi> and mutuall confidence amongſt men. 7. But have we not alſo ſeen, amore
<hi>excellent ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>invicible power,</hi> hath been, to bear up againſt all this cruelty,
and rage, and how great a <hi>ſeal,</hi> thus hath been to the <hi>Proteſtant <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2+ letters">
                     <desc>••…</desc>
                  </gap>ſe,</hi> and doctrine
in theſe late times, by innumerable witneſſes, who even in their extreameſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
did ſo convincingly evidence, <hi>a joy unſpeakable, and undoubted ſealing of the
comforts, of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> on their ſoul. 8. That theſe likewiſe were rare <hi>examples,</hi>
of the truth, and reality, <hi>of holyneſs</hi> in their day; and of <hi>humility,</hi> and <hi>ſubduedneſs to
the flesh,</hi> yea of <hi>tenderneſs,</hi> and bowels of compaſſion to their perſecutors whom
the Lord did thus call and prepare for ſuch a <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> 9. That no <hi>precipitancy, or
ſtubbornneſs,</hi> in the leaſt was in their way, but as with great aſſurance of minde; ſo
with a tender, humble and deliberat acting, their ſtudy then was by <hi>rationall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi>
to deall with the conſcience of adverſaries, in a willing rendering, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering,</hi> with all <hi>meekneſs,</hi> from the <hi>ſcripture,</hi> with a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
thereto before the world, to be tryed and ſearched out in what any could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
10. Have we not ſeen the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom of God,</hi> moſt brightly ſhine
forth, in that day, in the <hi>weakneſs of means,</hi> and that no ſpeciall peice of ſervice,
was then called for, but a moſt ſurpriſing and diſcernible <hi>call,</hi> and <hi>excitement of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi>
thereto, who in the <hi>ſame ſpirit,</hi> by which others were helped to ſuffer,
was remarkably then carried out to act in defence of the Goſpel much above them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their ordinare reach. 11. Have we not ſeen alſo, that no <hi>great thing</hi> was
by the Lord, then brought forth for his <hi>Church,</hi> but ſome remarkable hight of
<hi>trouble,</hi> went before, and how every ſtep of her <hi>riſe,</hi> and prevailling over <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi>
hath been ſtill uſhered in with ſome ſore <hi>conflict,</hi> and down caſting lyke the
<hi>Pangs,</hi> and throwes, of the <hi>birth</hi> before <hi>a delivery.</hi> 12. Have we not clearly ſeen,
that no <hi>humane power</hi> ſince the breaking forth of this bleſt light of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> could yet
ever reach its end, againſt the <hi>reformed Church;</hi> though no poſſible way, and
chainge of weapons, have been left untried, but how moſt viſibly the <hi>work of
their own hands,</hi> hath <hi>enſnared</hi> them herein, and tended more to <hi>the furtherance of the
goſpel.</hi> 13. And might it not be confirming what hath been ſo clear to ſee, the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Church of France,</hi> get ſo ſweet a clam, yea fixt in a ſetled ſtate, with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace, and legal ſecurity, by the <hi>Catholick league there,</hi> andby ſuch a formidable
<hi>conjunction</hi> as was therein of perſons and intereſts for her utter ruine. 14. To ſee
<hi>four Kings of France,</hi> ſucceſſively taken away in 30 <hi>Years,</hi> all upon the ſame deſigne;
and in a vigorous purſuite to deſtroy the <hi>Proteſtant intereſt</hi> there, and in them that
<hi>race</hi> of the <hi>houſe of Valois wholy extinct</hi> of whom <hi>two,</hi> were by a <hi>violent death Henry
the ſecond,</hi> and <hi>third,</hi> and this laſt ſo remarkably from that very airt with whom he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65578:29"/>
had moſt concurred and joyned in counſell, as particularly with the <hi>Duke of Guiſe,</hi>
for the <hi>maſſacre</hi> but both falling and deſtroyed by other in a ſhort time. 15. To ſee
the <hi>Netherlands</hi> fixt both in a <hi>ſetled ſtate,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> by that bloody engine of the
<hi>Spanish inquiſition,</hi> ſet up there and ſevere cruelty of <hi>Philip the</hi> II., as the very mean
made moſt ſubſervient thereto. 16. To ſee the <hi>Proteſtant doctrine,</hi> more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
promot and rooted in <hi>England,</hi> by the <hi>bloody dayes of Queen Mary,</hi> then the <hi>peace
full calme of King Eduard</hi> who had gone before. 17. To ſee the violence and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of <hi>Queen Douager,</hi> and inbringing, of the <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to bear down
and deſtroy the <hi>Proteſtant intereſt</hi> there, ſuch an effectual mean and advantage for its
riſe and further eſtabliſhment. 18. To ſee the blood, and cruelty by <hi>Ferdinand
the</hi> II. <hi>in Bohemia,</hi> in ſo very ſhort a time moſt viſibly returned on himſelf, to a
making <hi>Germany</hi> almoſt deſolate, and for many years, to ſume in its own <hi>blood,</hi> by
the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and their confederats. 19. To ſee that horrid <hi>late Irish maſſacre,</hi> in
a few years after reſolved in an utter rooting out almoſt of that cruel party, who had
moved therein with ſuch a diſcernible ſunſhine of the liberty of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as did
follow after in that land. 20. I muſt here add which may be clear and confirming
this day how ſo ſtrange a falling in with popery hath been now theſe 20. <hi>Years</hi> paſt in
<hi>Brittaine,</hi> and what ground that intereſt hath gained there, hath ſo viſibly had its
ſtrength from that airt of <hi>atheiſme, ignorance,</hi> and the getting up of a <hi>prophane Spirit,</hi>
which as a <hi>prodigie,</hi> and <hi>deluge</hi> hath thus broke forth in theſe lands, once bleſt both
with the <hi>purity,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> beyond moſt of the Churches; and how
ſuch hath indeed found it eaſy to quite the truth, who yet never knew it, beſides
the influence, and ſuting of ſuch a <hi>baite,</hi> as this way is to the <hi>temper</hi> of ſo licentious
a time, and for ſome private intereſt, when that hath been under ſo favourable
an <hi>aſpect.</hi>
