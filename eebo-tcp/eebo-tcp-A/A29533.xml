         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

passed through the first fifteene verses,
it pleased his providence so to dispose, as
that the sixteenth came to hand upon that
verie day, on which some, and (as I since

together for the <hi>Ordaining</hi> of certaine
<hi>Candidates for the Ministery.</hi> Being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
parallel to the <hi>Starres</hi> in my Text,
(however one of them, as it happeneth
sometimes to the Starres,) appeared not.)
With this providential <hi>Syncronisme</hi> I was

who were as so many <hi>stars.</hi> Such were they, and
such are their successors; all the true <hi>Ministers</hi>
of Jesus Christ. <hi>Gospel Ministers,</hi> they are as
<hi>stars.</hi> So called and represented in regard of the
<hi>resemblances</hi> betwixt the one and the other,<note place="margin">Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</note>
which are divers. I shall onely single out some
of the chief and principal, which as I conceive
to be most plain, proper and genuine.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Stars are set by God in the firmament of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ministers set by God in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of his Church.</note>
So we find it <hi>Gen. 1. 16, 17. He made the
stars also; And God set them in the firmament of
heaven.]</hi> And even so hath he set the <hi>Ministers
of the Gospel</hi> in the firmament of the <hi>Church,</hi>
(which is often called by the name of <hi>Heaven.</hi>)
So the Apostle setteth forth their original, <hi>1 Cor.
12. 28. God set some in the Church]</hi> speaking of
Gospel Ministers. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Constituit;</hi> he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
and appointed them to their places in
the Church, the <hi>Church Catholick visible</hi> (for so
it must be there understood.) So then <hi>a Gospel
Ministry is a Divine Institution,</hi> not a humane
Invention. He that set the <hi>stars</hi> in the <hi>firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
hath set his <hi>Ministers</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> And
he hath set them there as <hi>stars;</hi> fixing and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them by a perpetual ordinance. That is the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104496:7"/>
difference betwixt <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Comets. Comets</hi>
though they blaze for a time, yet it is but for
a time, and that a short time; but <hi>Stars</hi> are for
perpetuity, to continue to the end of the world.
Such <hi>Stars</hi> are the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel.
How else saith our Saviour what he doth, that
he will <hi>be with them to the end of the world,</hi> Mat.
28. 20.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Stars</hi> though they be set in the same firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">They have their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Orbs.</note>
yet they have their <hi>several Orbs</hi> to move
in. And so is it with the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
though they be set in the same firmament
of the Church, being all Ministers of the same
<hi>Church Catholick visible,</hi> yet they have their
several <hi>Orbs,</hi> their several <hi>Charges</hi> committed
and assigned to them for their inspection and
oversight. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> willeth the <hi>Elders,</hi> (the
<hi>Ministers</hi>) of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to <hi>feed the flock over
which the holy Ghost had made them overseers,
Acts 20. 28.</hi> And thus those <hi>seven stars</hi> in the
Text, the Ministers of the <hi>seven Churches</hi> of
<hi>Asia,</hi> had their several <hi>Charges,</hi> which were as
their several <hi>Orbs.</hi> And so it is with <hi>ordinary
Ministers.</hi> That being one difference betwixt
them and the <hi>Apostles.</hi> The Apostles were
<hi>universal Pastors,</hi> having the care of all the
Churches committed unto them. This was
Pauls <hi>daily cumbrance,</hi> as he tels his <hi>Corinthians,
2 Cor. 11. 28.</hi> Even <hi>the care of all the Churches.</hi>
Thus were they <hi>universal Bishops.</hi> But so are
not their successors. That of the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi>
is but a groundless usurpation. Ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104496:8"/>
have their severall charges.</p>
                  <p>3. Stars have their different <hi>Altitudes</hi> and
<hi>Magnitudes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</note> Some above, others; and some
greater then others. <hi>One star differeth from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
star in glory.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 41. And so is it in
the <hi>Gospell Ministerie.</hi> In the firmament of the
Church there are such different <hi>stars.</hi> Ministers
of different <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Dignities.</hi> So much we
may learne from the <hi>Apostle</hi> in that place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
1. Cor. 12. 28. <hi>God hath set some in the
Church</hi> (saith he) <hi>first Apostles, secondarily Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
thirdly Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. Severall <hi>Orders,</hi>
and <hi>Degrees. So</hi> there were then. And still
there are severall <hi>Magnitudes</hi> even among
<hi>Ordinarie Ministers.</hi> Who differ in respect of
theire gifts and ministeriall abilities, even as one
Star differeth from another in Glory.</p>
                  <p>Thus are these <hi>Stars set in the firmameut of
the Church,</hi> having their sevearll <hi>Orbes, Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi>
and <hi>Magnitudes.</hi> But wherefore are they
thus set? That is a fourth particular, which I
conceive to be here principally eyed and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Stars are set up for Lightes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Set up for Lights, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> like so many
<hi>Tapers</hi> in the firmament of heaven, to give
light to this inferiour world in the night season.
So you have the end of their first Creation set
down Gen. 1. 16. <hi>God made the stars also, and he
set them in the firmament of heaven to give light
unto the earth:]</hi> This is the office, as of the <hi>Sun</hi>
and the <hi>Moon,</hi> so of the <hi>Stars,</hi> to give light unto
the earth, and that in the night season. And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104496:8"/>
such is the office of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel-God
hath set them up in the firmament of the
Church to a like end, that they should be <hi>Lights.</hi>
So it is said of <hi>Iohn the Baptist, He was a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and a shining light</hi> Ioh. 5. 35. And such all
the Ministers of the Gospel either are, or ought
to be. <hi>Ye are the light of the world</hi> (saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to his Apostles) Mat 5. 14. True it is,
such all <hi>private Christians</hi> in their measure
ought to be. This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> saith of
his <hi>Philippians</hi> Phil. 2 15. <hi>Yee doe shine</hi>) or <hi>shine
yee,</hi> for so the word may be and is read either
<hi>Indicatively,</hi> or <hi>Imparatively,</hi>

                     </gap>.)
This they did, or should have done. But this
the <hi>ministers</hi> of the Gospell ought to doe in a
speciall manner. They being <hi>Lights by office,</hi>
which requireth this at their hands, that they
should give light to others. Which they are to
doe two wayes; By <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and by <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. By <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. By Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> Holding forth to others the
word of truth, the word of Life; that so those

light.</hi> This was <hi>Paules</hi> errand whereupon he
was sent to the Gentiles, <hi>viz. to open their eyes,
and so turne them from darkness to light</hi> Act 26.
18. Which he was to doe by <hi>preaching of the
Gospell</hi> unto them, whereby they might have
their eyes opened to see the <hi>sinfulness</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie</hi>
of their natural condition; and so might be
brought to the light of <hi>Grace</hi> here, and <hi>glory</hi>
hereafter. And such is the office of all the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:104496:9"/>
of Jesus Christ. Which the same Apostle sets
forth 2 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>God hath shined into our hearts,</hi>
(speaking of himself and other Gospel Ministers)
<hi>that we should give the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Iesus Christ,</hi> that being
our selves effectually illuminated, we might be
instrumentall in the inlightning of others. This
are the Ministers of Christ to doe by <hi>word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. And as by <hi>word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. By Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> so by <hi>worke.</hi> As by <hi>Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
so by <hi>Example.</hi> Thus are they to shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others in an Exemplarie Conversation.
So indeede ought all <hi>Christians</hi> to doe. It is
the Commendation which the Apostle giveth of
his <hi>Thessalonians</hi> 1 Thes. 1. 7. They <hi>were ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to all that beleeved in Macedonia and Achaia.</hi>
But the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Christ in a special manner.
They beeing by their office <hi>shepheards,</hi> they
should (as shepheards anciently were wont to
doe) go before their flocks. Or (to hold to the
<hi>Emblem</hi> in the Text, from which I would devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
as little as may be) as that <hi>Star</hi> did which was
given for a guide to the <hi>wise men,</hi> to direct
them to the place of Christs nativity, <hi>It
went before them</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>until it
came and stood over where the young child was,</hi>
Matth 2. 9. Such <hi>Stars</hi> should the <hi>Ministers</hi>
of God be unto the people. Being given them
for <hi>Guides,</hi> they should not onely shew them
light (which that star also did to them) but
they should go before them, till they bring
them to heaven; being <hi>Ensamples</hi> to them.
So was <hi>Paul</hi> to the believers of his time. <hi>Marke

them</hi> (saith he to his <hi>Philippians) which so walk,
as ye have us for an ensample,</hi> Phil. 3. 17.]
Whereupon he there propounds himself unto
them as a pattern for their Imitation. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
be followers together of me.]</hi> And such
all <hi>Gospel Ministers</hi> either are, or ought to be.
This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> requires from <hi>Timothy.</hi>
1 Tim. 4. 14. <hi>Be thou an example to the believers
in word, in conversation,</hi> &amp;c. And the like from
<hi>Titus,</hi> Tit. 2. 7. <hi>In all things shew thy self a
pattern of good works.]</hi> And it is Saint <hi>Peters</hi>
charge to all of that Tribe. <hi>Neither as being
Lords over Gods heritage, but being ensamples to
the flock,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 3. The Ministers of Christ
though they be as <hi>stars,</hi> set over others by God,
yet they may not (as <hi>Astrologers</hi> tell us some of
the stars do) Lord it over their Brethren. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

an imperious obtruding of their own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
instead of Gods Commandements (as the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> did) or by carrying themselves <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially</hi>
towards any under their charge. But
<hi>Patterns</hi> they should be; teaching the people
as by <hi>Doctrine</hi> so by <hi>Example.</hi> Here is a fourth
resemblance, to which add a fifth.</p>
                  <p>5. Stars have light and give light, but it is a
<hi>borrowed light.</hi> In that differing from the light
of the <hi>Sun,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">5. Their light is borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> whis is originally in the body of it.
The Sun being the fountain of light, it hath
light in, and from it self. But so have not the
<hi>stars.</hi> Their light is a borrowed light which they
receive from the <hi>Sun.</hi> And such is the light
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104496:10"/>
which the Ministers of Christ communicate unto
others, it is but a <hi>borrowed light.</hi> Therein differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from that light, which is in <hi>Christ;</hi> who is
the <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> (as he is called, <hi>Mal.
4. 2.</hi>) the fountain of all spiritual light. <hi>That
was that true light,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> speaking
of Christ, <hi>Iohn 1. 9.</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, light it self;
Original light. So was not <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> (as
the verse foregoing hath it) <hi>[He was not that
light.]</hi> A light he was, and that a <hi>shining,</hi> an
eniment one, but not <hi>that light,</hi> that Original
light. This was onely <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> He is the
<hi>Sun.</hi> As for his <hi>Ministers</hi> they are but <hi>stars,</hi>
receiving their light from him. <hi>I have received
from the Lord that which also I delivered unto
you,</hi> saith the Apostle to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
touching the <hi>Doctrine of the Sacrament.</hi> And
the like may be said of the whole <hi>doctrine of the
Gospel.</hi> This the Ministers of Christ receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can deliver it: Being themselves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
before they can enlighten others.
<hi>God who commanded the light to shine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
hath shined into our hearts</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
<hi>that we should give the light</hi> &amp;c. (in that
place fore-named, <hi>2 Cor. 4. 6.</hi>) Hence is it that
sometimes they are compared to <hi>Candl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> or
<hi>Lamps. Ye are the light of the world</hi> (saith our
Saviour to his Apostles) <hi>Matth. 5. 14.</hi> But
what light? why, not <hi>Sun-light,</hi> but <hi>Candle-light.</hi>
So the verse following explains it. <hi>[Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do men light a Candle, and put it under a
bushel:]</hi> meaning that he had not communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104496:10"/>
unto them that light, to the end that they
should hide it. And thus it is said of <hi>Iohn the
Baptist,</hi> that he was a <hi>shining light,</hi> John 5. 35.
But what light? why, a <hi>Lamp,</hi> or a <hi>Candle;</hi>
for so the word there properly signifieth, <gap reason="foreign">

or <hi>Lamp,</hi> how great soever the light be that it
giveth, yet it is but a borrowed light. And so
is it with the Ministers of the Gospel; Their
light is but a borrowed light. Here is a fifth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance.
Take one more.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Stars are Influentiall.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">They are Influential.</note> As they all give
light, and the same light, so they have their
severall Influences. What those <hi>Influences</hi> are,
it is in a great measure a Mysterie, a secret to us.
But that they have such <hi>Influences,</hi> it is not to be
questioned. So much we may learne from God
himselfe, who Putteth the Question to <hi>Iob,</hi> (Cap.
38. 31.) <hi>Canst thou binde the sweete Influences of
Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Pleiades</hi>
and <hi>Orion,</hi> two of the Constellations of heaven.
<hi>Pleiades,</hi> the <hi>seven stars,</hi> which rising in the
spring bring warme showres for the moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and refreshing of the earth. <hi>Orion,</hi> a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Star, which brings with it hard frosts, which
are there called <hi>the Bands of Orion,</hi> because the
earth is as it were bound with them. Thus are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104496:11"/>
they both <hi>Influentiall;</hi> changing and altering
the <hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>Ayre.</hi> And like Influences
have these <hi>Stars,</hi> the Ministers of the Gospell,
upon the Persons and places over which they
are set; working upon them, as by their <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
so by their <hi>Examples.</hi> Both which are very
Influentiall, and operative for the changing and
altering of the people, either for the better, or
the worse. Hence is it that they are compared to
<hi>salt,</hi> Mat. 5. 3. <hi>Ye are the salt of the earth.]
Salt</hi> being layed upon a peice of flesh, it hath in
a little time a great influence upon it, in altering
the taste of it, seasoning it and making it savorie.
And thus the Ministers of Christ, by their whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and savorie doctrine and holy example
they season others; changing and altering them
for the better. And on the other hand, being
bad themselves, they infect others. So as what
the Lord speaks of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>
in another sense. Hos. 4. 9. We may use it in
this, <hi>Like Preist, Like people.</hi> Surely it was
not without cause that the Lord sending his
<hi>destroying Angell</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he orders him
to <hi>begin at the Sanctuarie</hi> Ezek. 9. 6. From
thence came the rise of all those <hi>Abominations,
that were done in the midest of that Citie</hi> (of
which he speakes verse. 4.) they began at the
<hi>Preists;</hi> who if they had not been first cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
themselves, the people had not been
what then they were. Thus are the Ministers of
God like <hi>Stars,</hi> for those <hi>Influences</hi> which they
have upon the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:104496:11"/>
To which I might add (did I not feare the
straining of this string) as an enlargment,<note place="margin">They have a power of Binding and Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</note> or
further improvement of this Resemblance. <hi>Stars</hi>
having such an Influence upon the earth, they
have also <hi>a power of Binding and Loosing.</hi> Such
are the properties of those two a foresayd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations.
<hi>Pleiades</hi> and <hi>Orion.</hi> The one bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the earth with the hard frost, the other
looseth it by the warme ayre and showres. And
such a power hath Jesus Christ given to these
<hi>Stars,</hi> the Ministers of his Gospel, a <hi>Binding</hi> and
a <hi>Loosing</hi> power. This power he gave to <hi>Peter</hi>
Mat. 16. 19. <hi>I will give unto thee the keyes of
the Kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou
shalt bind upon earth shall be bound in heaven;
whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, shall be loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in heaven.]</hi> But not to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>est of the Apostles and Disciples as well as
to him. So you shall finde it Ioh. 20. 23. Where
explaining what he meant by <hi>binding,</hi> and <hi>loosing,</hi>
with their solemn <hi>Mission</hi> he giveth them this
<hi>Commission, [Whosoever sinnes ye remit, they are
remitted unto them, and whosoever sins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne,
they are retayned.</hi> This power did Jesus
Christ give unto them, and their successors;
putting the <hi>Keyes of the Kingdom of heaven</hi> into
their handes, the Keye of <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and the
Keye of <hi>Discipline;</hi> whereby they <hi>open</hi> and
<hi>shut, binde</hi> and <hi>loose;</hi> binde the <hi>Obstinate,</hi> loose
the <hi>Penitent;</hi> both which they doe in a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall</hi>
and <hi>declarative</hi> way. Even as it may
be conceived of those two foresayd <hi>Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104496:12"/>
Orion</hi> and <hi>Pleiades;</hi> the one bindeth the
earth, the other looseth it. But how? Not
meerely by their owne influence, as being the
sole, or yet principall Cause of that Change, for
that is to be attributed to the <hi>Sun,</hi> which by
his Recess, and returne maketh that alteration;
but they by their rising notifie those changes.
Even so is it with these <hi>Stars</hi> the <hi>Ministers</hi> of
Christ, what herein they doe, they doe it not
<hi>by their owne power or vertue</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> said of
his healing the Cripple Act. 3. 12.) but by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
from Jesus Christ, in his name declaring
what his will and pleasure is. Here is a sixth
<hi>Resemblance.</hi> To which I might yet add some
other, which are reached unto me by other
handes. But I would not seeme to straine the
<hi>Allegorie,</hi> by drawing that from it which it will
not naturally and voluntarily yield. And I
shall have occasion to touch upon some; and
diverse other in the <hi>Application.</hi> Which let it

to excite and admonish those whome God hath,
or shall set over you, in case they shall be found
remiss or negligent in their Ministerial duty and
service. Upon this account I shall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to you, of what more properly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
my selfe and others of my Brethren. To
whome the sum of what I have to say is onely
thus much; that seeing they are set by God as
<hi>Stars</hi> in the firmament of his Church,<note place="margin">Ministers are to do office of Stars.</note> they
would performe the like offices to those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their charge, as the <hi>Stars</hi> doe to this
Inferiour world.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to prosecute this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
let me first premise one or two Premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions.<note place="margin">Provided first that they be Stars.</note>
Let them first see that they be <hi>Stars,</hi>
such as are so placed by God in the firmament

from <hi>Comets.</hi> The one is fixed by God, the

of themselves; thrusting themselves whether
upon the Ministeriall <hi>function,</hi> or yet particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Charge;</hi> without a regular and warrantable
mission. So did those false Prophets in Ieremies
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104496:13"/>
time, of whome the Lord complayns Ier. 23. 21.
<hi>I have not sent these Prophets, yet they ran; I have
not spoken unto them, yet they prophesied.]</hi> Thus
did they all on their owne heades, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Mission,</hi> nor <hi>Message</hi> from God. Let it
not be so with <hi>Gospell Ministers.</hi> They who take
that office upon them, let them looke to their
<hi>calling. Noe man taketh this honour to himselfe,
but he that is called of God, as Aaron was,</hi> saith
the Apostle, of the Priesthood Heb. 5. 4. speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not <hi>de facto,</hi> but <hi>de jure;</hi> not what men doe,
but what they ought to doe. <hi>Uzziah</hi> though
a <hi>King,</hi> must not take upon him the office of a
<hi>Preist</hi> 2 Chron. 26. 16. No more ought any
to usurpe upon a Gospell ministerie; taking
upon them to dispence Ordinances in a ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
way, without a warrantable calling from God.
Let them see that they be <hi>Stars,</hi> not <hi>Comets:</hi>
that they be set by God in the firmament of his
Church.</p>
                  <p>2. And being thus set,<note place="margin">Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> let them now seeke
after <hi>Illumination,</hi> that they themselves may be
inlightened. So are the <hi>stars,</hi> being set in the
firmament they are inlightned, without which
they would be of no use. And this let these
<hi>mysticall stars</hi> seeke after; even a supernaturall
illumination. <hi>God hath shined into our hearts</hi>
(saith the Apostle) <hi>that we should give the light,</hi>
&amp;c. Ministers, that they may inlighten others
they must first be enlightned themselves. And
this let them seeke after. And where shall they
have it? Why, where have the <hi>stars</hi> their light,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104496:13"/>
but from the Sun? And where should Gospel
Ministers have their light, but from <hi>Iesus Christ.
He was the true light which lightens every man
that cometh into the world, it is spoken</hi> of Christ
Ioh. 1. 9. Who ever it is that is inlightned,
whether with a <hi>naturall</hi> or <hi>supernaturall</hi> light,
they receive it from Christ. And to him let his
Ministers looke; and that not onely for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but the latter of these; that they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
with a <hi>supernaturall Illumination;</hi>
having not onely their <hi>heads</hi> but <hi>hearts</hi> enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
that they may be indued with a cleare
sound and affectionable knowledg of divine and
heavenly Mysteries. And being thus <hi>seated,</hi> and
thus <hi>qualified,</hi> then</p>
                  <p>(In a third place) Let them doe the office of
<hi>stars,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Then shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before others.</note> holding forth that light which they have,

                  <p>1. <hi>Voluntarily and freely.</hi> Soe doe the <hi>stars</hi>
give forth their light.<note place="margin">Voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; freely,</note> And so should Ministers

theirs. <hi>Freely you have received, Freely give</hi> (saith
our Saviour to his Apostles, willing them to

the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospell theirs. Not doing
what they doe by constraint, nor yet out of
Covetousness, or any other by and sinister
respect, but willingly, freely. So Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
giveth it them in charg 1 Pet. 5. 2. <hi>Feede the

not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy

Four words which I could wish all the Ministers of
Jesus Christ had them written upon their hearts;
that remembring them they might practise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                  <p>2. Doing this freely,<note place="margin">Faithfully and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely.</note> let them also do it
<hi>faithfully</hi> and <hi>sincerely. In doctrine shewing sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi>
(as <hi>Paul</hi> willeth <hi>Titus</hi> Chap. 2. verse 7.
First, holding forth <hi>no other light</hi> then what
they have received. Not their <hi>owne light.</hi> Herein
again true <hi>Stars</hi> differ from <hi>Comets. Comets</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
set on fire, hold forth their own light; so
doe not the <hi>Stars;</hi> they hold forth no other
light then what they have received from the <hi>Sun.</hi>
So ought the Ministers of Christ to doe; not
like those <hi>false prophets</hi> of whome the Lord
complains Ier. 23. 16. that <hi>They spake a vision of
their owne heart, and not out of the mouth of the
Lord.] Comet-like,</hi> being set on fire with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104496:14"/>
or vaineglory, or some other by and

So ought not the Ministers of Christ to doe.
<hi>Star-like,</hi> they are to hold forth no other
light then what they receive from the <hi>Sun;</hi>
no other doctrine then what they receive from
<hi>Christ. I have received of the Lord that which
also I delivered unto you</hi> (saith the Apostle.) And
then (secondly) <hi>all that light.</hi> So doe the <hi>Stars;</hi>
they doe not hide, or hold back any of that
light which they have received. No more may
the Ministers of God any of the light of divine
truth. Such was <hi>Pauls</hi> faithfulness in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie,
that he did not <hi>shun to declare unto the
Churches all the Counsell of God;</hi> so he tels the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at Miletum</hi> Act. 20. 27. <hi>All the Counsell,
viz. What was profitable for them</hi> (he explains it
verse. 20.) And such should the faithfulness of
Gods Ministers be. They are not to hide or hold
back any part of that light which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
That which <hi>Balaam</hi> once spake against
his will. Numb. 24. 13. <hi>Ministers</hi> should freely
and conscientiously resolve upon, and practise.
<hi>What the Lord saith unto them, that to speake.</hi>

of the Gospell, who should be thus unwearied

particular charges over which God hath set his

They should be assiduous in seeking of their
good; unwearied in their Gospell Ministration,
in the worke and services of their God. This
is that which <hi>Paul</hi> requires from all Christians 1.
Cor. 15. last. <hi>Finally my brethren, be ye steadfast

And again Chap. 5. 22. <hi>Keep thy self pure:</hi>
And herein should all the Ministers of Christ be
exemplary to others. In <hi>purity of Conversation;</hi>
keeping themselves unspotted of the world; free
from the evils of the times and places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they live: that their lives be not spotted

the <hi>Moon,</hi> as a <hi>Diamond</hi> doth from a <hi>Christal.</hi>

And such should all the Ministers of God be;

Spirit requires from one of these seven <hi>Angels,</hi>
the Minister, or Ministers of the <hi>Laodicean</hi>
Church, <hi>Rev. 3. 19. Be zealous.</hi> And so should
all the Ministers of Christ be; zealous for God,
for his truth, for his worship and service; zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
against Errours, Heresies, all kind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal
or practical wickedness. Such were <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and <hi>Phineas,</hi> whose zeal standeth upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
to their eternal honour. And such was
<hi>Paul,</hi> of whom the story tels us, <hi>Acts 13. 9.</hi>
that when he saw <hi>Elimas the Sorcerer</hi> opposing
him as he did, not so much his <hi>Person</hi> as his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Being filled with the Holy Ghost</hi> (saith
the Text) <hi>he set his eyes upon him.</hi> His eyes even
sparkled with a holy indignation against him.
And so, when he came to <hi>Athens,</hi> and there
saw the City so wholly given to Idolatry, <hi>his
spirit was stirred within him</hi> (saith the Text,
<hi>Acts 17. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <gap reason="foreign">

ejus,</hi> his spirit was sharpned, it had an edge set
upon it; it was so stirred that he could not but
break forth into an open and tart reproof. And
so was it with our blessed Lord and Master, the
<hi>Lord Iesus.</hi> However in his own personal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
none more patient <hi>[that Lamb of
God,]</hi> yet in the cause of his father none more

It is spoken of Christ, <hi>Iohn 2. 17.</hi> Such was his
holy zeal for the service and honour of God his
Father, that it was as a fire in his Breast, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
feeding upon his spirits, so busying and
taking up his thoughts that it made him even
regardless of himself. And such should be the
zeal of his servants, his <hi>Ministers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Onely let them see that it be a <hi>well tempered</hi>
zeal.<note place="margin">Their zeal must be well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered.</note> Not <hi>fiery,</hi> not <hi>furious.</hi> In this do <hi>Stars</hi>

but the one in a temperate, the other in a

ware of. When <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> having had

by the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> wo refused to receive them,
propound to him this course of proceeding

makes answer to them with a Check, <hi>ye

54, 55. Giving them to know, that their
<hi>counsel</hi> did not suit with their <hi>calling;</hi> neither
did it favour of a truly <hi>Ministerial spirit;</hi> which

<hi>Zealous</hi> the Ministers of God may be, ought to
be. But let it be for <hi>God,</hi> and not for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And then let their fervour be tempered

Thirdly,<note place="margin">In Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> As in <hi>Puritie</hi> and <hi>Zeale,</hi> so in <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi>
Hereof the <hi>Stars</hi> are very proper Emblems
(as <hi>Lapide</hi> hints it upon the Text.) Which
though they be vaste bodyes, most of them far
bigger then the Earth, yet how little doe they
seem to be. And such should the <hi>Ministers</hi>
of the Gospel be; what euer they be for place,
for partes, for gifts, yet they should be little in
their owne eyes· So was <hi>Paul;</hi> however not
Inferiour in place or gifts to any of the Apostles,
(which being thereunto provoked by his emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Adversaries he sometimes asserts and stands
upon. 2 Cor. 11. 5. <hi>I suppose I was not any whit
behind the cheifest of the Apostles.</hi> And againe in
the Chapter following verse. 11. he inculcates
the same. <hi>In nothing am I behind the very cheifest
Apostles,]</hi> Yet in his owne eyes how low was
he? Even the least of them. So much we may
heare him elswhere acknowledging; 1 Cor. 15.
9. <hi>I am the least of the Apostles.]</hi> Yea the <hi>least of
Saints.</hi> So he tels his <hi>Ephesians,</hi> cap. 3. verse. 8
<hi>Vnto me who am least, then the least of all Saints
is this grace given.]</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a double dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive
<hi>Less then the Least, i.e.</hi> for the least. So
little was this great Apostle to himself. Even as
<hi>nothing.</hi> That is his Expression elswhere, in that
place forenamed, 2. Cor. 12, 11. <hi>In nothing am
I behind the very cheifest Apostles, though I be
nothing.</hi> Thus whilst he tooke notice of the
abundant grace of God to him in bestowing such
gifts, as he had done, upon him, yet with all he
acknowledgeth his owne <hi>nothingness.</hi> How in,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104496:18"/>
and of himself he was <hi>nothing,</hi> nothing without
<hi>Christ;</hi> even as the <hi>stars</hi> are nothing without
the <hi>Sun,</hi> of no use, good for nothing. Such was
<hi>Paul</hi> in his own eyes, And he would not seeme
over great in the eyes of others. It is the reason
which he giveth why he did forbeare to speake
somewhat of himself which otherwise he might
justly and truely have done 2. Cor. 12. 6. <hi>Now
I forbeare</hi> (saith he) <hi>lest any should thinke of me
aboue that which he seeth me to be.]</hi> So would he
have those his <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and others to looke
upon him, as men doe upon the <hi>Stars.</hi> which
though great in themselves, yet make but a little
shew. And such should the humility of Gods
<hi>Ministers</hi> be, the more eminent they are in place
and gifts, the more humble should they be (Even
as the <hi>stars</hi> the higher they are, the lesser they
seeme.) <hi>So serving their God in all humility of
minde</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself that he did Act.
20. 19.) A grace which is no small Ornament
to <hi>private Christians:</hi> Whome therefore the
Apostle presseth to seeke after it. Eph. 4. 2. Phil.
2. 3. But specially to <hi>Ministers;</hi> who of all
other sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld be most humble. Not thinking
highly of themselves; not seeking after popular
applause, nor yet affecting any worldly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur.
Let them leave this to the men of this world,
(whereof the <hi>Moone</hi> is an <hi>Emblem,</hi> which
though less then any of the Stars, yet being near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the earth, seemeth far greater:) Let them,
such as minde earthly things, let them seeke after
an earthly greatness. But let it not be so with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104496:18"/>
the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Christ. That is the interdict
which our Saviour giveth to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> Mat.
23. Where he forbids them to doe as the <hi>Scribs</hi>
and <hi>Pharisees</hi> did. <hi>Be not ye called Rabbi,</hi> verse 8.
<hi>Neither be ye called masters</hi> verse 10. He would
not have them ambitiously to affect high and
swelling titles of honour and preeminence. And
afterwards when his Apostles were contesting
about a supremacy; <hi>reasoning among themselves
which of them should be greatest</hi> (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi>
hath it, <hi>Luke 9. 46.) greatest in the kingdom of
heaven</hi> (as Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> explains it, <hi>Mat. 18.
1.</hi>) that is, in that temporal Kingdom of Christ,
which they then dreamed of, our Saviour instead
of answering that Question which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to him, (which they did in a covert
and reserved way, as Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> there sets
it down, <hi>At the same time came the Disciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Iesus, saying; who is the greatest in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven?</hi> Thus they propose the Question
in a general way, afar off, as being ashamed to
speak out, to speak what they meant, and to let
their Master know what it was that they had
been parling about) <hi>he perceiving the thought of
their heart</hi> (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> there hath it <hi>vers. 47.</hi>)
taking notice of their Ambition, he <hi>taketh a
Childe, and set him by him</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Luke)
set him in the midst of them</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>)
so presenting him to them as an <hi>Emblem,</hi>
and Pattern of that which he would have them
to learn, <hi>viz.</hi> true <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>kowliness.</hi>
Not to think highly of themselves, nor to seek
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104496:19"/>
great matters for themselves; not to affect
earthly greatness, temporal honours and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and promotions. So he there explaineth
his own meaning in the verses following, <hi>Matth.
18. Except ye become as little children,</hi> verse 3.
<hi>whosoever shall humble himself as this little childe,
the same is greatest in the Kingdome of God,</hi> vers.
4. Thus doth he point them out the way to true
greatness; to be great in the eyes of God and
his Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> to be little in their own. And
so it is. As pride maketh way for a downfal, so
humility is the way to preeminence. And in
this grace let all the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Jesus Christ be
exemplary to others. <hi>Patternes of Humility.</hi>

Thus should the Ministers of Christ in evill times,
in the darke night of Persecution stand by the
people committed to their charge. And standing
by them, they are then to shew themselves, then

them be <hi>vigilant, watchful.</hi> Hereof also (as

And so vigilant should <hi>Gospel-Ministers</hi> be
over their <hi>Flocks.</hi> Even as the story tels us of
those <hi>shepheards,</hi> to whom the Angel appeared
with those joyful tidings, <hi>Luke 2. 8.</hi> They

And such <hi>watchmen</hi> should these spiritual <hi>shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards</hi>

them. <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

of danger, when <hi>Foxes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Wolves,</hi> false Teachers,
Heretical seducers walk abroad, seeking to make
a prey of the flock. Such was that time when
<hi>Paul</hi> gave that <hi>watch-word</hi> to those <hi>Elders,</hi> as
we may learn from the verses foregoing, (<hi>verse
29, 30.) I know this</hi> saith he) <hi>that after my
departure grievous wolves (wolves in sheeps-cloathing,</hi>
false teachers) <hi>shall enter in among

<hi>to draw away Disciples after them. Therefore
Watch.</hi> Ministers should be vigilant at all
times, knowing that that <hi>Roaring Lion</hi> is still
walking about. But when such <hi>Wolves</hi> and
<hi>Foxes,</hi> subtile and dangerous Seducers are
abroad, they had need then to look out sharp,
as the STARS (heavens sentinels) do in the

I done with the former of these particulars here
held forth in the Text, which informs us, that
<hi>Gospel Ministers are Stars.</hi> Come we now to
the second.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obser. 2. Gospel Ministers are in the right
hand of Iesus Christ.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gospell Ministers in the right hand of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</note> So were these <hi>seven Stars,</hi>
the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>seven Churches,</hi> they were in
the <hi>right hand</hi> of this <hi>son of Man;</hi> in the hand of
<hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> And so are all other <hi>Ministers of the
Gospel.</hi> Where let our enquiry again be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Mystery,</hi> what was hereby signified.
To which take the Resolution in three or four
particulars.<note place="margin">The My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Hereby we may conceive to be intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Propertie</hi> which the Lord <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
hath in the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospell.<note place="margin">Christs properties and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in his Ministers.</note> They
are <hi>his Ministers.</hi> Though Ministers <hi>to</hi> the
Church, yet not properly <hi>of</hi> the Church. But
the Ministers of Christ. <hi>Let a man so account of
us as of the Ministers of Christ</hi> (saith the Apostle
1, Cor. 4. 1.) And so they may be called upon
a threefold Account. In as much as they have
their <hi>Office, Mission, Commission,</hi> all from him
from his <hi>hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is from him.</note> Their <hi>Office</hi> is from him; their <hi>Ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
function.</hi> Which was given by Christ unto
his Church <hi>When he ascended upon high</hi> (saith
the Apostle speaking of Christ Ephe. 11. 8.)
<hi>he led Captivitie Captive, and he gave gifts unto
men.</hi> Even as <hi>Kings</hi> somtimes upon the day of
their <hi>Coronation</hi> and solemn installment use to
scatter their <hi>donaria,</hi> giving gifts unto their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104496:28"/>
Even thus the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> upon this day of
his Coronation, entring upon his Kingdom, he
gave <hi>gifts</hi> unto his Church. But what Gifts?
why, among other a <hi>Gospell Ministerie.</hi> So the
11. verse there informs us. <hi>He gave some Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and some Prophets, and some Evangelists
and some Pastours and Teachers.</hi> All Ministers
offices, the three former <hi>Extraordinarie</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie,</hi>
to continue but for a time, during the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie
of the Church; the two latter (if they
be two) <hi>Ordinarie</hi> and <hi>perpetuall,</hi> to continue to
the end of the world. Thus did the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Ministeriall function as a Gift from the
<hi>hand</hi> of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>And that from his <hi>Right hand.</hi> There were
these <hi>Stars,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Right hand Blessings speciall blessings.</note> in the <hi>Right hand</hi> of this <hi>Son of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
Now <hi>Right hand blessings are the twice blessings.</hi>
The <hi>wise man</hi> speaking of the Gifts and blessings
which <hi>Wisdome</hi> as a Queene bestoweth upon
her servants and followers, saith, <hi>Length of days
is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and
honour,</hi> Prov. 3. 16. <hi>Length of days,</hi> a long life,
being of more value then riches or honour, is
placed in <hi>wisdomes</hi> right hand. And such is this
gift which Christ hath given to his Church, the
<hi>Gospell Ministery,</hi> a <hi>right hand gift,</hi> a choice
blessing.</p>
                  <p>And so it may well be looked upon,<note place="margin">Gospell Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie a great Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the Church.</note> if we doe
but consider the <hi>end,</hi> wherefore it was given,
and for which it serveth; which the Apostle also
there sets down in the following verse, Eph. 4.
12. <hi>He gave some Apostles</hi> &amp;c. But wherefore?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104496:28"/>
                     <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the
Ministerie, for the edifying of the Bodie of Christ]</hi>
This is the proper <hi>worke of the Ministerie,</hi> even
the compleating and <hi>perfecting of the Saints,</hi> and
<hi>edifying of the Bodie,</hi> the Mysticall bodie of
Christ, building up of the Church in Knowledg,
faith, and Holyness, untill it be made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and perfect Bodie, perfect both with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Degrees,</hi> as it there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
verse. 13. <hi>Till we all come in the vnitie of the
faith of the Son of God, unto a perfect man</hi> &amp;c.
Now considering this worke, and the high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of it, well may this be looked upon as no
common, no ordinarie <hi>Gift,</hi> that Christ should
give unto his Church those who may be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
in this service. The <hi>Gospell Ministerie is
a right-hand-blessing.</hi> To pass on.</p>
                  <p>2. In the second place.<note place="margin">Their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from him.</note> Gospell Ministers, as
they have their <hi>function</hi> from Christ, so also
their <hi>Mission.</hi> As their <hi>Office</hi> is instituted and
appointed by him, so their <hi>Persons</hi> are designed
and <hi>sent</hi> by him for the executing of this Office.
So were his <hi>Apostles. As my father hath sent me,
even so send I you,</hi> (saith he to them) Ioh. 20.
21. Thence was it that they were called <hi>Apostles,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Messengers</hi> persons sent by Christ as
<hi>Extraordinarie Embassadours.</hi> Such were the
twelue. And such was <hi>Paul, Am I not an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle?</hi>
1 Cor. 9. 1. Being sent by Christ. <hi>Christ
sent me,</hi> (saith he) <hi>not to Baptize, but to preach
the Gospell.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 17. Understand it <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rtively,</hi>
not so much to intend the one, as the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104496:29"/>
other, cheifly to apply himselfe to that which he
looked at as the principall part of the Ministerial
service, to preach the Gospel. And thus are
other <hi>Ordinarie Ministers</hi> sent. Though not in
such an immediate way as they were, yet sent by
Christ; as by his <hi>Ordinance,</hi> so by his speciall
<hi>Providence.</hi> He is that <hi>Lord of the harvest,</hi> which
sendeth forth <hi>Labourers into his Harvest,</hi> Ministers
into his Church. Mat. 9. last. These are of
Christs sending, have their <hi>Mission</hi> from
him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him.</note> And as their <hi>Mission,</hi> so their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</hi>
Hence tearmed his <hi>Ambassadours. Now
then we are Ambassadours for Christ</hi> (saith the
Apostle, speaking of himselfe, and other Gospell
Ministers) 2 Cor. 5. 20. And elswhere he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
himselfe an <hi>Ambassadour in bonds,</hi> Eph. 6.
20. <hi>Ambassadours</hi> are speciall Messengers sent
with <hi>Commission</hi> from their Masters to act in
their names. And such Messengers are the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
of Jesus Christ, they are sent by him with
a <hi>Commission,</hi> with <hi>Authoritie</hi> from him to act in
his name. <hi>As though God did beseech you by us,
we pray you in Christs stead be ye reconciled unto
God</hi> (so it there followeth. 2 Cor. 5. 20.) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>Christi nomine,</hi> in the name of Christ, as
being deputed and authorized by him. So are all
true <hi>Gospell Ministers;</hi> being sent by Christ,
they are also <hi>impowred</hi> by him; having the <hi>Keys</hi>
put into their hands. Even as <hi>Eliakim</hi> who was
made <hi>High-Steward</hi> of the Royall family, is
said to have the <hi>Key of the house of David laid
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104496:29"/>
upon his shoulder.</hi> Isaiah 22. 22. Importing that
power and authoritie which should be given to
him for the executing of his Office. Even so the
<hi>Ministers</hi> of Christ are said to have the Keyes
put into their hands: <hi>I give unto thee the Keyes
of the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> (saith our Saviour to
<hi>Peter</hi>) Matth. 16. 19. that is, a Ministerial power
and authoritie. And this he gave not onely to
him (as <hi>Romanists</hi> would have it) but to other
his <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Disciples,</hi> and in them to their
<hi>Successours,</hi> even to all the Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
(as I touched before:) Into whose hands
he hath put a <hi>double Key.</hi> The Key of <hi>Doctrine</hi>
and <hi>discipline</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> giving them not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave, or allowance, but power to preach the
Gospel, <hi>Go teach all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28. 19. <hi>Go
preach the Gospel to every creature,</hi> Mark 16. 15.
And that (in measure) as himself is said to have
done, <hi>Matthew 7.</hi> last, with <hi>Authoritie. These
things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,</hi>
(saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus.</hi> Tit. 2. last. And
as the Key of <hi>Doctrine</hi> (which is elsewhere cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the Key of Knowledge,</hi> Luke 11. 52. because
it openeth the door, and letteth men into the
saving knowledge of God in Christ) so of <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
and <hi>Government.</hi> Jesus Christ having given
a Ministerial power to them, partly by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of that <hi>Doctrine</hi> to the consciences of
men, and partly by the censures of the Church,
as it were to open and shut the <hi>Kingdome of
Heaven,</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glorie,</hi> to
open it to <hi>penitent believers,</hi> to shut it against
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104496:30"/>
                     <hi>obstinate sinners. Whatsover ye bind on earth,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Whose sins ye remit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus have <hi>Gospel Ministers</hi> their Office from
Christ, their persons also being sent by him, with
<hi>Authoritie</hi> from him. And upon this account are
these stars here placed in the hand of this <hi>Son of
Man,</hi> to intimate the interest and propertie that
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath in the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the
Churches; who are <hi>his Ministers.</hi> Here is a first
thing hereby signified; Pass we to a second.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Gospel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and governed by Iesus Christ.</note> As they are Ministers, his Officers,
so they are ordered and governed by him. And
upon this account again they may be said to be
in his <hi>hand,</hi> in as much as they are disposed of,
and directed by him: As are <hi>Ambassadours</hi> by
their <hi>Masters</hi> that send them, together with
their Commission they receive particular <hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
and <hi>instructions,</hi> both whither they are to
go, and what they are to say and do. Even so
it is with the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Christ, being sent by
him, they are also directed by him. As whither
to go, so were the <hi>Apostles,</hi> whose Commission
was first restrained to one particular Nation, <hi>viz.</hi>
to the Jewes; <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles,</hi>
Matth. 10. 15. afterwards inlarged, <hi>Goe teach all
Nations,</hi> Matth. 28. 19. And so was S. <hi>Paul,</hi> sent
to the Gentiles by Christ who appeared to him,
<hi>Acts 26. 18.</hi> And so are <hi>ordinarie Ministers;</hi>
though not in so immediate a way, yet still they
are directed by <hi>Christ, viz.</hi> by his special <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
whither to goe, where they are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.
It is this <hi>hand</hi> that fixeth these <hi>Stars</hi> in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104496:30"/>
their several <hi>Orbes,</hi> that placeth Ministers in their
particular charges; where also he continues them
during his good pleasure; disposing of them
both for <hi>life</hi> and <hi>libertie</hi> as he seeth fitting. So
also, what it is that they are to speak in his
Name. To which end he as it were <hi>putteth his
word into their mouths.</hi> So the Lord is said to
have done into that fals Prophet <hi>Balams,</hi> Numb.
23. 16. <hi>The Lord met</hi> Balaam <hi>and put a word
in his mouth:</hi> And so he did in the mouths of his
true Prophets; <hi>Behold I have put my word into
thy mouth,</hi> (saith the Lord to the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
Jer. 1. 9.) And the like doth the Lord Jesus into
the mouthes of his <hi>Ministers,</hi> he putteth his word
into their mouthes, sending them to preach, he
ordereth them what they are to preach; <hi>Goe
preach the Gospel.</hi> Thus he giveth them directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and instructions from his <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
whereby the <hi>Man of God</hi> cometh to be
<hi>perfect,</hi> (as the Apostle telleth <hi>Timothie,</hi>) 2 Tim.
3. last.</p>
                  <p>And with his word he giveth them his <hi>Spirit.</hi>
This is that which our Saviour maketh promise
to his <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Disciples,</hi> John 14. 16. 17.
<hi>I will pray the Father, and he shall give you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth,</hi> which
<hi>Spirit</hi> he afterwards tells them should <hi>guide
them into all Truth,</hi> chap. 16. 13. And this <hi>Spirit</hi>
Christ giveth in measure to all their Successours
the true and faithfull <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel,
whereby their <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> come to be
enlightned with those saving and usefull truths,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104496:31"/>
which they are to hold forth uuto others. <hi>God
hath shined into our hearts</hi> (saith the Apostle in
that place forenamed.) Thus are they in their
ministerial work and service disposed of, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
governed by Christ. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
again may be said to be in his <hi>hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, They are in his <hi>hand,</hi> his <hi>right hand,</hi>
being powerfully <hi>supported</hi> and <hi>upheld,<note place="margin">Supported and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him.</note> defended</hi>
and <hi>maintained</hi> by him. In this sense all the

his custody and protection. But so are his
<hi>Ministers</hi> after a special manner. They are in
his <hi>right hand,</hi> under his powerful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
protection and support. So the Psalmist of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
useth this phrase. <hi>Thy right hand upholdeth
me,</hi> Psal. 18. 35. v. 63. 8. <hi>O thou that savest by

Psal. 17 7. The <hi>right hand</hi> is a member strong
and active, whereby a man sheweth, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
forth the whole strength of his body. And
thence is it that Gods power manifested in the
protection or deliverance of his people is called
the <hi>strength of his right hand. The Lord saveth
his anointed with the saving strength of his right
hand</hi> (saith the Church speaking of <hi>David</hi> her
king) <hi>Psal. 20. 6.</hi> And such is the salvation
which the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> sheweth unto his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
his faithful <hi>Ministers.</hi> First, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>office:</hi> which he will do in despite of
all opposition to the end of the world. <hi>I am
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104496:31"/>
with you alwaies to the end of the world.</hi> And then,
so far as he seeth it expedient, defending their
<hi>persons</hi> continuing their <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>liberties.</hi> Thus
was this <hi>Son of man</hi> with those <hi>stars,</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches. He held them in
his <hi>right hand,</hi> protectiug them, keeping them
either <hi>from</hi> or in the hour of Temptation. That
is the promise which he maketh to the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian
Angel,</hi> Revel. 3. 10. <hi>I will keep thee
from the hour of temptation, which shall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the world.</hi> Such was the state of the
Church then under the reign of that cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
the Emperour <hi>Domitian,</hi> it lay under a
general persecution. yet the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to the <hi>Church,</hi> and in particular to the
<hi>Ministers</hi> thereof an exemption and immunitie.
And thus doth <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hide his Ministers
sometimes as it were in the <hi>hollow,</hi> or <hi>shadow of
his hand.</hi> Thus was he himself hid by his <hi>Father</hi>
as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith of him, <hi>Isai. 49. 21. In</hi>
(or with) <hi>the shadow of his hand hath he hid me.</hi>
So protecting him against all the might and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of his capital enemies, that they could not
lay hold upon him, or do ought unto him, before
the time that God fore-designed was come, as
St. <hi>John</hi> observes it, <hi>Joh. 7. 30.</hi> &amp; 8. 20. Thus did
his Father still uphold him in the work of his
Ministery in despite of all opposition. <hi>Behold
my servant whom I uphold</hi> (it is spoken of Christ)
<hi>Isai. 42. 1.</hi> And thus is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> pleased
sometimes to uphold his Ministers; being with
them as he was with those <hi>three worthies</hi> in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104496:32"/>
midst of the <hi>fiery furnace,</hi> keeping them from
persecution in the midst of it, so as whilest they
see or hear of it, yet they feel not of it. Or if
they do, yet even then standing by them, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting,
strengthning, delivering them. So was
he with his servant <hi>Paul.</hi> At his first appearing
before <hi>Nero</hi> (as he tels <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 16,
17.) <hi>No man stood by me, but all forsook me, yet
notwithstanding</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Lord stood by me,
and strengthened me, and I was delivered out of
the mouth of the Lyon.</hi> Thus did his Lord and
Master then stand by him, holding him in his
<hi>right hand,</hi> preserving and delivering him from
the hand of that cruel tyrant, still continuing
both his life and libertie. And the like hath he
done for other of his servants. This is that the
Lord telleth his servant <hi>Ieremy,</hi> chap. 1. vers. 18,
19. <hi>Behold I have made thee this day, a defenced

they are designed. This is that which the Lord
promiseth to the <hi>Philadelphian Angel,</hi> Rev. 3. 8.
<hi>Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no
man shall shut it.</hi> Though your adversaries at
that time were many, and those both potent and
violent, yet they should not be able to hinder
the passage of the Gospel, but the Ministers of
the Church should have both <hi>liberty,</hi> and great
<hi>successe</hi> in their Ministry. This is also the work
of Christ, to set open such a door (as <hi>Paul</hi>
saith was opened to him at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.

upon that foundation, watering what he had
planted, but is was God that gave the blessing
to both their endeavours. Thus are <hi>Ministers</hi>
(as I said) no other but instruments in the hand
of Christ: the efficacy of their ministerie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
wholly upon his Cooperation. Not
able to do any thing of themselves. But through
the hand of Christ assisting of them they are
made instrumental for great services. So are
weak <hi>instruments</hi> sometimes in the haud of a

wrought by them. And even so are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ, being acted by his hand, though
weak and impotent of themselves, yet their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
is made powerful for the effecting of
great things. Even their <hi>foolishnesse of preaching</hi>

the Ministers of Christ, in their whole Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
let them not seek themselves, but him. It
is a foul imputation which the Apostle chargeth
upon most of the Ministers of his time, that they
were <hi>self seekers. All seek their own things, not
the things which were Iesus Christs,</hi> Phil. 2. 21.
<hi>All,</hi> that is the greatst part preferred their own
profit and honour, before the glory of their

Lord and Master. Let is not be so with us. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
shall the ministers of Christ approve and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

by doing his work with an eye to him, seeking

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Thus approving themselves unto
Christ,<note place="margin">Commit themselves to him.</note> let them then <hi>Commit themselves unto
him:</hi> commending themselves into this hand of
his. So did their Master dying, he commended
his Spirit into his Fathers hand. <hi>Into thy hand
I commend my Spirit,</hi> Luk. 23. 46 And so let
his servants do both living and dying, commend
themselves, their lives, their liberties, their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
their <hi>all,</hi> into the hand of this their Lord

notice that they are in his <hi>hand,</hi> let them yeeld
up themselves unto him, to be disposed of by
him according to his good will and pleasure. So
did the blessed Apostle St. <hi>Paul.</hi> So long as his
Lord and Master Christ might be glorified in him
and by him, he did not much weigh in what
way it was, whether by <hi>life</hi> or by <hi>death,</hi> (as
he tells his <hi>Philippians</hi>) Phil. 1. 20. And let their
be the like minde in all the Ministers of Jesus
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104496:34"/>
Christ. In all things let them comply with his
mind and will, Being willing to <hi>go</hi> whether he

he goeth, and to another come, and he cometh,</hi> &amp;c.
And to <hi>do</hi> what he will have them. <hi>Peter</hi> though
he had fished all night and caught nothing, yet

<hi>let down the net,</hi> Luk. 5. 5. And as doing, so <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>

Iesus</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to the Disciples) Act. 21.

                  <p>And thus committing and submitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

in him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Encourage themselves in him.</note> So did <hi>David</hi> in that great distresse of
his, when he knew not what to do, he then
<hi>Encouraged himself in the Lord his God,</hi> 1 Sam.
30. 6. And this let all the faithful <hi>Ministers</hi>
of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> do, Remembring that they are in
his <hi>hand,</hi> yea in his <hi>right hand;</hi> which may serve
as a grand Encouragement, to bear up their
hearts and spirits.</p>
                  <p>First, Against the <hi>contempt</hi> of the world, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
mean estimation which the men of this world
have of them, and of their calling.<note place="margin">Against the contempt of the world.</note> Let the world
judge and think, and speak of them as it will. It
is not this judgement which they are much to
regard; <hi>with me</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>It is a very
small thing to be judged of you, or of mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
1 Cor. 4. 3. Whose judgement then was it
that he regarded? Why, the judgement of his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104496:35"/>
Lord and Master Christ; so it followeth in the
next verse, <hi>He that judgeth me, is the Lord.</hi> What
then, though the world have a low, a meane
base estimation of the Persons and calling of the
Ministers of Christ? So it had of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the
rest of the Apostles, as he setteth it forth in the
sequel of that Chapter; <hi>We are made a spectacle
unto the world, and unto Angels, and unto Men;</hi>
verse 9. <hi>We are made the filth of the world, and
are the off-scouring of all things,</hi> v 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
the very sweepage and dross,
the off all and shreds of the world. Such a mean
and base esteem had many in those times of <hi>Paul</hi>
and his <hi>Collegues,</hi> the blessed Apostles, and
other Primitive Ministers. And it is but too
apparent, that such and no better is the esteem
which many even among our selves have of them
at this day; whose tongues and pens speak what
their thoughts are. But let not this be regarded
by the faithfull Mininisters of Christ. It is enough
that their Lord and Master Christ thinks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of them. Let the world (as it doth) set
them upon the left hand; He hath taken them
into his right hand, and there he holdeth them;
thereby declaring both how <hi>near</hi> and <hi>dear</hi> they
are to him; near in <hi>Relation,</hi> dear in <hi>Affection;</hi>
Euen as the <hi>Signet upon his right hand,</hi> (as the
Lord saith of <hi>Eliakim, Ier. 22. 24.</hi>) or as <hi>the men
of his right hand;</hi> (as the Psalmist saith of <hi>David,</hi>
Psalm. 80. 17.) his <hi>Benjamins,</hi> the <hi>sons of his right
hand,</hi> (as that word signiefith.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:104496:35"/>
And secondly, as against the contempt, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
against the <hi>Opposition</hi> which they meet withall,<note place="margin">Against Opposition in and from the world.</note>
in and from the world, which oft time is not lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
<hi>Paul</hi> met with affronts more then a few:
Being to preach to the Deputie <hi>Sergius Paulus,
Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer withstood him, <hi>Acts 13. 8.</hi>
And elsewhere he tells us of his <hi>fighting with
beasts at Ephesus,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 32. which some,
and not a few, understand of bruitish, bestiall, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
and cruel bloody minded adversaries. And
such he sometimes conflicted with, as appeareth
from that request of his, which he maketh to his
<hi>Thessalonians;</hi> 2 Thes. 3. 2. Where he desireth
them to pray for him, that (among other things)
he might be <hi>delivered from unreasonable and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And such conflicts the rest of the Apostles had
frequent experience of; finding that to be true,
which their Lord and Master had foretold them,
<hi>Matth. 10.</hi> that they were <hi>sent forth as sheep
among Wolves,</hi> verse 16. and that they should be
<hi>hated of all men for his Names sake,</hi> verse 22.
because they were his servants, his Ministers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in his service. And what if the Ministers
of Christ shall meet with the like at this day?
Which at not a few hands they already doe:
There being many who are desperately ingaged,
not onely against their <hi>Persons,</hi> but against their
<hi>Profession,</hi> their <hi>Calling,</hi> crying that down as
useless and unnecessarie, nay destructive and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious;
seeking by all wayes they can to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
and root it out. But let not all this discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104496:36"/>
the faithfull Ministers of Jesus Christ;
knowing that they are in his <hi>hand,</hi> not in the
<hi>hand of man.</hi> If so there were just cause to
fear their standing. But in the <hi>hand of Iesus
Christ;</hi> and that in his <hi>Right hand,</hi> which is both
a gracious and a powerfull, a sure and safe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie
and Protection. And who is it then that
shall take them out of his hand? <hi>Neither shall
any man pluck them out of my hand</hi> (saith our
Saviour concerning his <hi>sheep,</hi> John 18. 20.) And
if not the <hi>sheep,</hi> surely then not the <hi>shepherds;</hi> He
that hath such a vigilant eye over the one; will
not be regardlesse of the other. <hi>Pan curatoves
oviumque Magistros.</hi> Yea then let men and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
do their worst, yet let not them fear. That
was <hi>Davids</hi> resolution, which he took up upon
this very ground; Psalme 56. 6, 4. <hi>In God have
I put my trust, I will not fear what flesh can doe
unto me.</hi> Such is the Arme of man, how long,
how strong, how potent soever it be, yet it is but
an <hi>Arm of flesh</hi> (as the Prophet tells it, Jer. 17. 5.)
<hi>Flesh, not Spirit,</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith of
the <hi>Egyptian horses, Isaiah 31. 3.</hi>) a weak Arme.
But such is not this <hi>hand,</hi> the <hi>right hand</hi> of Iesus
Christ. This is a powerfull, a mightie hand:
<hi>Thou hast a mightie Arme, strong is thy hand, and
high is thy right hand</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>Psalme
89. 13.</hi> Such is the <hi>hand</hi> of this <hi>Sonne of Man,</hi>
whom the Prophet describing calleth <hi>El Gibbor,
the mightie God,</hi> Isai. 9. 6. His <hi>hand,</hi> his <hi>right hand</hi>
is a mightie hand. And therefore let not those
his Ministers, whose desire is to be found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104496:36"/>
in their ministration, in any thing fear their
adversaries.</p>
                  <p>I might go on putting them in mind,<note place="margin">Looking for success unto Jesus Christ.</note> whither
it is that they are to <hi>look for successe</hi> in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.
Even to that <hi>hand</hi> which sendeth them
forth, <hi>Vna eademque manus,</hi> The same hand that
giveth <hi>gifts</hi> to them, and them to the Church,
must give successe to their labours. these <hi>stars</hi>
receive their <hi>influence</hi> from this <hi>hand</hi> wherein
they are.</p>
                  <p>Withall,<note place="margin">Going on cheerfully and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously in their work.</note> I might excite them to <hi>go on cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and couragiously in that work</hi> which their

that his <hi>hand</hi> shall be with them. This is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and incitement which the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
unto his servant <hi>Ioshua,</hi> Josh. 1. <hi>As I was
with Moses, so will I be with thee; I will not
fail thee, nor forsake thee, be strong and of a good
courage,</hi> vers. 5, 6. And again, vers. 9. <hi>Have
not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good
courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed,
for the Lord thy God is with thee,</hi> &amp;c. And in a
like way that good King <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> bespeaks the
<hi>Iudges of Iudah,</hi> Chron. 19. last. <hi>Deal couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and the Lord shall be with the good.</hi> And let
the like be said to all the Ministers of Christ in
this Nation. Let them be couragious, being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured

                  </p>
                  <p>Onely let them take heed of <hi>provoking him
to displeasure</hi> against them, which if they shall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104496:37"/>
dare to do, then let them know they are in his
<hi>hand</hi> to correct and punish them. As <hi>Aora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
said unto his wife <hi>Sarah</hi> concerning her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<hi>Hagar, Behold thy maid is in thy hand to do to
her as it pleaseth thee,</hi> Gen. 16. 6. So let these ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Christ know, that they are <hi>in his hand,</hi>
to do to them as it pleaseth him. And therefore
let them take heed of offending, of displeasing
him; As by any sinful <hi>impietie</hi> in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
(this <hi>hand</hi> is too pure to hold any impure
thing in it) so by remisnesse and negligence in
their calling, or by neutrality and indifferencie
not appearing, not standing for Christ as they
ought to do. He that threatens the <hi>Laodicean
Angel</hi> that for his <hi>lukewarmnesse,</hi> his Neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and indifferency in the businesse of Religion,
neither appearing against it, nor much for it,
neither being a professed enemy; nor yet by a
zealous professour, but complying with the
times upon politick reports, he would therefore
<hi>spue him out of his mouth</hi> (which he doth, <hi>Rev.
3. 16.</hi>) he will not hold those in his <hi>hand</hi> whom
he shall find to be of the like temper. But I
passe to the second head, that which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note>
                  </p>

So indeed many at this day do look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, who use them accordingly. And in

Ministers of Christ should be thus honoured,
seeing <hi>Christ himself hath honoured them.</hi> So it
was proclaimed before <hi>Mordecay,</hi> Hest. 6. 9.
<hi>Thus shall it be done to the man, whom the King

honour also. And so let it be done to the men
whom the <hi>King of Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
to honour, his faithfull Ministers, whom
he holdeth as <hi>Stars</hi> in his <hi>right hand.</hi> The <hi>right
hand</hi> is a place of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Dignitie.</hi> Hence it
was that <hi>Solomon</hi> placed his <hi>Mother</hi> there,
1 King. 2. 19. <hi>She sate on the right hand.</hi> And his
<hi>Queen: Vpon thy right hand did stand the Queen,</hi>
Psal. 45. 9. And this is the honour which Christ
will give to his <hi>sheep,</hi> his <hi>Elect</hi> at the last day,
to <hi>set them on his right hand,</hi> Matth. 25. 33. Now
such is the honour which this <hi>Sonne of man</hi> here
giveth the <hi>Stars,</hi> he placeth them in his <hi>right
hand.</hi> And seeing their Lord and Master thus
honoured them, to afford them his <hi>right hand,</hi> let
not his servants set them on the <hi>left,</hi> thinking
too meanly of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Nor yet, on the other hand, <hi>too
highly:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Not estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming too highly of them.</note> not above that which is meete. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring

worketh. Is it so then that their Ministry
is made effectuall for the good of any, let them
see whither to give the glory. Not to <hi>them:
Who is Paul? who is Apollos, but Ministers?</hi> &amp;c.
But unto <hi>Christ,</hi> in whose hand they are, and
who is pleased thus to put forth his power in
them and by them.</p>
                  <p>Thus when we see a curious piece of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
we admire not the <hi>tool,</hi> but the <hi>hand</hi>
that wrought it. Such are the Ministers, Tooles,
Instruments in the hand of Christ; what work is
done by them give the honour of it not to them,
but him. S. <hi>Peter</hi> directed the people; <hi>Act. 3. 12.</hi>
when they stood gazing upon him, as ready to
adore him for that great <hi>Cure</hi> which he had
wrought upon the lame man. <hi>When he saw it</hi>
(saith the Text) <hi>he answered unto the people: Ye
men of Israel, why look ye so earnestly on us, as if
by our own power or holiness we had made this man
whole.</hi> By what power then? why the power
of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> So much he declareth to the
<hi>Rulers,</hi> being by them interrogated concerning
it in the Chapter following; v. 10. <hi>Be it known
unto you, that by the Name of Iesus Christ, doth
this man stand here before you whole. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </hi>
Through the power of <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> And so
much all the <hi>faithfull Ministers of Christ</hi> will
readily acknowledge concerning the successe of

And therefore, whilest any shall think

Eph. 6. 17. And I am rather induced here so
to look upon it in the Text, in regard that this

with a sword in their hands, as an Ensigne of

                     <hi>the rod</hi> (or <hi>scepter) of his mouth,</hi> Isai, 11. 4. both
to shew, that his Authority, his <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi>

Exercised rather upon the <hi>souls</hi> of men,
then upon their <hi>Bodies.</hi> His <hi>sword</hi> is his
<hi>Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And not unfitly may it be so represented and
set forth.<note place="margin">The word a cutting and killing Instrument</note> The <hi>sword</hi> is not onely a cutting but

And so the sword in the Text properly
signifieth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a kind of dart, a deadly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

cutting and wounding the <hi>heads,</hi> but the <hi>hearts</hi>
of his enemies, killing, slaying them. So the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> setteth it forth in that place
even now named, <hi>Isai. 11. 4.</hi> where speaking of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> he saith, <hi>He shall

Spiritual executions upon them. In this way
and by this means it is foretold that Christ shall

2 Thes. 2. 8. <hi>And then shall that wicked

revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the
Spirit of his mouth]</hi> that is, by his <hi>word,</hi> the
pure and powerful preaching of the Gospel;
thereby giving him a deadly and incurable
wound. Such use doth <hi>Jesus</hi> make of his word;
he useth it as his <hi>sword</hi> to destroy his enemies
with. With this <hi>sword</hi> it is that he goeth forth
against those grand enemies of his Kingdome,
<hi>Sin and Satan,</hi> as also against all other his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
This is the <hi>Bow</hi> wherewith he that <hi>sate
upon the white horse went forth conquering, and to
conquer,</hi> Rev. 6. 2. even the powerful preaching
of the Gospel; which is elsewhere called his
<hi>Arrows.</hi> Psal. 45. 5. (as both those places are by
many expounded). And this is the <hi>axe</hi> and
<hi>sword,</hi> wherewith he heweth and slayeth obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
sinners, as the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> hath it, <hi>Hos.
6. 5. Therefore have I hewed them by my Prophets,
and slain them by the word of my mouth. Hewed</hi>
them by sharpe reprehensions, which are as the
stroakes of the Axe to a crookd or knotty peece
of timber. And slain them by terrible denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations
of judgement and vengeance; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104496:45"/>
them with death, Temporal, and Eternal.
Thus doth <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> slay his enemies, first by
the <hi>sword of his mouth,</hi> before he do it by the
<hi>sword of his hand;</hi> first threatning and denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
judgement, before he execute it. Thus is the
<hi>word</hi> a <hi>sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And secondly, a <hi>sharpe sword,</hi>

in the person of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of his being

operation of his Spirit he hath made my word
effectual. And such is the efficacy of the word
when it is thus accompanied, now it is like a
<hi>sharpe sword.</hi> That is the Apostles comparison,
<hi>Heb. 4. 12. For the Word of God is quick and
powerful, and sharper then a two edged sword.</hi> And
wherein so? The next words explain it. <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joynts and marrow,</hi> &amp;c. This
doth the <hi>Word of God,</hi> not onely <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who is sometimes so called, <hi>Ioh. 1. 1.</hi> his <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential</hi>

                     </gap>, the <hi>word written and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
This is also of such a penetrating nature,
like a <hi>sharpe sword,</hi> it goeth thorow a man:
pierceth the heart, entreth into the soul, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
a man to himself, shewing him what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lay hid. So the Apostle saith of it in that
known place, <hi>1 Cor. 14. 25.</hi> where speaking of
<hi>prophecying,</hi> preaching, and the efficacy thereof,
he saith, that thereby the <hi>unbeleever</hi> cometh to
be <hi>convinced, judged,</hi> so as <hi>the secrets of his heart
are made manifest.</hi> Those wicked lusts, and
false perswasions which before lodged and lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the secrets of his heart, unespyed of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and undiscerned of himself, by this means
they come to be discovered. Thus doth this
<hi>sword</hi> (likewise as the <hi>souldiers speare</hi> did to our
Saviour) it enters the <hi>pericardium,</hi> the <hi>Call of
the heart,</hi> nay, the heart it self, piercing it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
As <hi>Simon</hi> told the blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense, that <hi>a sword should pierce thorow her
soul,</hi> meaning that sharpe sorrow and heart
grief which she should suffer for her <hi>Sons</hi> suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 35. Even so may it be said of this
<hi>sword,</hi> the word being accompanied by the
Spirit, now it pierceth thorow the soul, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compunction, and contrition in the hearts
of poor penitent sinners. Such effect it had upon
those <hi>converts,</hi> of whom the story tels that at
<hi>Peters</hi> Sermon they were <hi>Pricked at their
hearts,</hi> Act. 2. 37. This doth the <hi>word.</hi> Which
also it doth with great <hi>facility</hi> and <hi>ease.</hi> Even
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104496:46"/>
as a <hi>sharpe</hi> sword, though there be but a weak
hand to manage it, it enters with ease. So doth
this <hi>word</hi> though it be dispenced by the hands
of weak <hi>instruments;</hi> (which are the Ministers
of the Gospel) yet through the power of the
Spirit it setting an edge upon it, it now becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>mighty through God</hi> (as the Apostle saith of
it <hi>2 Cor. 10. 4.</hi>) mighty to do great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
executions. Thus it is a <hi>sharpe sword.</hi>
                  </p>

as the sharpest sword, penetrating more easily

it <hi>reacheth unto the soul,</hi> denouncing judgement

                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The word having a double and contrary operation.</note> A <hi>two edged sword</hi> (as our juditious

is it to Gods <hi>Elect,</hi> to whom, believing it, it

<hi>A savour of life unto life;</hi> quickening them up

A deadly savour; Not that the <hi>Gospel</hi> is so of
it self, being in its own nature (as I said even
now) <hi>the word of life;</hi> but accidentally it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
so to them, through their rejecting of
it. Now it is to them not onely an <hi>occasion,</hi> but
a <hi>cause</hi> of their just and greater condemnation.
Even as it is with the <hi>Proclamation</hi> of a Prince
which he maketh to his rebellious subjects,

themselves loyal and obedient; but on the

the <hi>Evangelicall Proclamation,</hi> the Doctrine of
the Gospel, it preacheth <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> after the

the different and contrary operation of the <hi>word</hi>

him to see himself a <hi>dead man,</hi> in a state of sinne

This is the able work of Jesus Christ, who is the

he had unadvisedly drawn upon the <hi>high Priests</hi>

Ministers of Christ, who are to fight his battels
against those spiritual enemies, Sin, Satan, the
World, make choice of no other <hi>sword</hi> but this.
Other <hi>Doctrines</hi> like <hi>whiflers swords,</hi> may serve
to make a shew and flourish with. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

meddle with these, or any other doctrines
which they have no warrant for from the word,

contented with that <hi>simplicity that is in Christ,</hi>
(as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

And thus let all the Ministers of Christ use that
<hi>sword</hi> which he hath committed unto them; <hi>use
it for him,</hi> not against him, as too many at this
day do; who snatching this <hi>sword</hi> out of the

and setting up of the Kingdome of Christ. This

I could wish that they would but take notice
what kind of <hi>sword</hi> this is, which they thus med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with; a <hi>sharpe,</hi> and a <hi>two edged</hi> sword: and
therefore not fit to be put into every hand, to
use in such a way. It was not for nothing, that
the Apostle giveth that charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which
he doth, <hi>2 Tim. 2. 2. The things which thou
hastheard of me</hi> (even that <hi>form of sound words,</hi>
which he had spoke of in the chapter foregoing)
<hi>the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall
be able to teach others also.</hi> The <hi>word</hi> being a
<hi>two edged sword</hi> he would not have it put into
every hand, nor left loose for every one that
would to take it up; but he would have it put
into choice hands, such as might have some skill
how to welde and use it. It is not for every
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104496:54"/>
one to make use of this <hi>sword</hi> in a <hi>publick</hi>
way.</p>
                  <p>But in a <hi>private</hi> way they both may,<note place="margin">But in a private</note> and
ought: This is that which the Apostle not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allowes, but injoynes in that place even now
named, <hi>Ephes. 6. 17.</hi> where he willeth private
Christians to <hi>take the sword of the Spirt</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
This is one and a principal piece of that
Christian panoplie, that compleat <hi>Armour,</hi>
wherewith every <hi>private souldier</hi> of Jesus Christ
ought to be furnished; <hi>The word of God:</hi> which
all Christians are to make use of as a <hi>sword,</hi> to
defend themselves with against all their Spiritual
enemies. And such use do you all make of it.
Seeing Christ hath provided this <hi>sword</hi> for

make use of it for the killing of your own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
the wounding and mortifying of your
own sinful and inordinate lusts; therewith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
all the assaults, the temptations of your
grand adversarie <hi>Satan.</hi> This was the <hi>sword</hi>
which <hi>Christ</hi> himself made use of in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
with this enemy of his in the wildernesse.
He maketh use of no other weapon, but a <hi>scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est, It is written, It is written,</hi> Matth. 4. And
with this sword did he foil that enemy. Such
a tryed <hi>sword</hi> is this, never did it fail any that
made right use of it. And therefore let it in
this way be useful unto you. First girding this
sword about you. In dangerous places, which
use to be haunted with Theeves and Robbers,
travellers will not ride without their swords.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104496:54"/>
Much lesse will the <hi>Souldier</hi> go into the field
without his sword by his side. Truly such is
this world, whilest you are here; you are in the
midst of enemies, I mean those spiritual enemies,
the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>flesh,</hi> and the <hi>divel;</hi> whereby
you are in danger of being assaulted every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And therefore do not go without this
sword. Get the <hi>word</hi> into your hearts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
promises, threatnings thereof. And
then draw it forth, and make use of it as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is offered. Which if you do, going out
against your enemies under the conduct of this
your Commander, in the Name and strength
of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> fear not the successe. This is a
<hi>sharpe two edged sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Divers other <hi>duties</hi> yet there are which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

<hi>David</hi> speaking of himself, saith; <hi>My heart

sheweth himself in the midst of the <hi>Candlesticks</hi>

stand in awe of him. This will men do of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate;
seeing the <hi>sword</hi> in his <hi>hand,</hi> or the
hand of his officer, they will stand in awe of
him, not daring to trangresse the Law in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
And this respect let all both Ministers

So saith the Apostle of the civil Magistrate, <hi>Rom.

find him herein deserted by his fellows; who

&amp; <hi>Dicipline,</hi> as made those Churches (at least
some of them) truly glorious. There did the <hi>face
of Iesus Christ shine</hi> (saith he). So the <hi>worship</hi> of
God (saith he) is somtimes called; <hi>his face.</hi>
Instancing in that of the Psalmist, Psal. 105. 4.
<hi>Seeke his face evermore.</hi> To which that other
Text answereth, Psal. 27. 8. <hi>when thou saidest
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104496:59"/>
seeke yee my face, my heart sayed unto thee, thy face,
Lord I will seeke.</hi> Where, by the <hi>face</hi> of God is
understood by divers Expositors the <hi>Arke;</hi>
where God manifested his presence in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And The like he doth still in his <hi>ordinances.</hi>
which where they cease, God may be sayd to
<hi>with draw his face.</hi> And where any are excluded
from them, they may be sayd to be <hi>banished

expounded Gen 4. 14. where he complaineth
that he was <hi>driven from the face of the earth, and

the place of his habitation; where he had
kept his former residence, or the societie of men,
the inhabitants of the earth, who would now be
afraid of his company; By the latter the presence
of God in his Ordinances, from which he was
now secluded, beiug under the sentence of exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mmunication,
cast out of the Church, But I shall
also let that pass, though having somewhat more
colour then the former.</p>
                  <p>4. Some others (in the fourth place) looke
upon this as a representation of the <hi>glorie of the
Church under the Gospel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Church.</note> which is a transcendent,
a surpassing glory, for exceeding that under the
<hi>Lawe.</hi> A mysterie not unfitly represented by
this <hi>shining of the face of this Son of man</hi> here
after this manner, which is sayed to shine as the
<hi>Sun.</hi> Under the <hi>Law</hi> we reade of the <hi>shining of
Moses</hi>'s <hi>face,</hi> Exod. 34. 40. <hi>Moses his face shone.</hi>
A passage which the Latine Enterpreters by a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104496:59"/>
mistake of the word in the Originall (<hi>Karan</hi> for
<hi>Keren,</hi>) renders, <hi>Cornuta erat Facies, his face
was horned.</hi> From whence some infer that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s
<hi>face</hi> at that time was like the <hi>Moone,</hi> which
in the increase and decrease appeares in that
forme and fashion. But here the <hi>face of Iesus
Christ</hi> (saith one) was like the Sun. Leting that
gloss pass, as grounded upon a false bottom. In
the mean time for the maine it is true. <hi>Moses</hi>'s
<hi>face</hi> at that time did <hi>shine,</hi> and that gloriously,
insomuch as the <hi>children of Israel could not stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
behold him for the glory of his countenance,</hi>
(as the Apostle clearly expounds it 2 Cor. 3. 7. yet
did it not shine like the face of this <hi>Son of man</hi>
the <hi>Lord Iesus;</hi> whose face shone as the <hi>Sun,</hi>
yea as the Sun <hi>in his strength,</hi> at noon day. So
far doth the glory of the <hi>Gospell</hi> excell that of
the <hi>Lawe.</hi> There was a glory in that <hi>Legall</hi>
ministration, but not like the <hi>Evangelicall.</hi> So
the Apostle setteth forth the difference most
fully by comparing one with the other, in that
place last named 2 Cor 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. under
the <hi>Gospell</hi> there is a far more glorious <hi>light</hi>
broke forth, then that was under the <hi>Lawe.</hi>
The one as the <hi>Moone,</hi> the other as the <hi>Sun.</hi> So
the Prophet <hi>Isaiah.</hi> expresseth that surpassing
glorie that should come upon the Church in
Gospel times (as it is contained) Isai. 30. 26. <hi>The
light of the Moone shall be as the light of the Sun.</hi>
Such is the glorie of the Church under the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi>
far exceeding that which was under the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104496:60"/>
                     <hi>Lawe.</hi> So not a few expound that of the Prophet

Thus in the <hi>firmament of the Church</hi> there are
many <hi>Stars,</hi> of severall, magnitudes, many

And in the Church upon earth there are some of

Thus, though there be never so many eniment

                  <p>In the <hi>Church,</hi> I say. In the <hi>common-wealth</hi>

Even as the <hi>Sun,</hi> whilest the <hi>Body</hi> of it is in

<hi>Light.</hi> This <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> coming into the world
<hi>inlightneth every man, viz.</hi> that is inlightned.
Communicating the light of divine and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall

the <hi>Sun</hi> doth his light unto the earth, which in a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104496:64"/>
little time, in the space of twentie-foure howers,
inlightneth, the whole world. So the Psalmist
setteth forth both the swift motion and vigorous
operation of it, Psal. 19. 5. <hi>In the heavens God
hath set a Tabernacle for the Sun, which is as a
Bridgroome coming out of his Chamber, and rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
as a strong man to run a race. His going forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is from the end of the heavens, and his circuit unto
the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the
heat therof.</hi> Even thus the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> coming
out of the <hi>womb of the virgin (his Bride-chamber</hi>)
in a little space, by himself and by his Apostles,
caused the light of his gospel to shine forth
through the world, in so much as the Apostle
saith, that in his time it was and had beene <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to every creature under heaven,</hi> Col. 1. 23.
So as in this he was like unto the <hi>Sun.</hi> So the
<hi>Apostle</hi> applyeth that of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> concerning
the <hi>Sun</hi> unto him, Rom. 10. 18. Thus doth the
light of <hi>grace</hi> come from <hi>Iesus Christ, in whome</hi>
(as the Apostle saith) are <hi>hid all the Treasures of
wisdom and knowledg.</hi> Col. 2. 3. And that as of
Common, so specially of <hi>saving grace.</hi> This
light cometh from the <hi>face</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beheld by faith: So much we may learn
from that Text of the Apostle. 2. Cor. 4. 6. <hi>God
hath shined into our hearts, that we should give the
light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face
of Iesus Christ.]</hi> The glory of God shineth in
the <hi>face</hi> of Iesus Christ, which being held forth
unto Gods elect in the <hi>Glass of the Gospel,</hi> and
there beheld by them by faith, they come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104496:65"/>
to be <hi>changed into the same Image from glorie
to glory,</hi> (as the same Apostle hath it 2 Cor. 3. last)
By thus beholding of the face of Christ they
come to be made like unto him in the glory of
holiness, which work is still in progress here,
untill it come to perfection in heaven. Thus is
the light of <hi>Grace</hi> derived from Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>And so is the Misticall <hi>Glory.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of Glory.</note> Which is but,
as it were, a reflex from that glory which is in
the <hi>face of Iesus Christ,</hi> which being beheld by
the Saints of God in that beatificall vision, they
thereby are made partakers of the same glory.
Even as so many <hi>looking glasses</hi> being set before
the <hi>Sun,</hi> by the reflex of the Beames thereof,
every one is changed into the same Image, and
made like unto it. Even so shall it be with the
Saints in heaven. <hi>We know</hi> (saith Saint Iohn)
<hi>that when he shall appeare, we shall be like him,
for we shall see him as he is.</hi> 1 Ioh. 3. 2. Like him
in <hi>Glory. When Christ who is our life shall appeare,
then shall yee also appeare with him in glory.</hi> Col.
3. 4. Thus is <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> fitly resembled by the

<hi>fons luminis</hi> the fountaine of all light; inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                  <p>2: And inlightning,<note place="margin">Inliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> hee also <hi>enliveneth,</hi>

it quickneth vegetables, hearbs and plantes and
trees, and some other creatures, which seeme
dead in the winter; yet by the returne of the <hi>Sun</hi>
they are quickned in the spring. And the like
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104496:65"/>
doth <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in a <hi>supernaturall</hi> way. Hee
quickneth men. Thence called <hi>their life</hi> in that
place last mentioned. <hi>When Christ who is our life
shall appeare,</hi> Col. 3. 4. Quickning them, and that
both in their <hi>soules</hi> and <hi>Bodies.</hi> Their <hi>soules:
The Son quickneth whome he will</hi> Ioh. 5. 21.
This doth he here to the <hi>soules</hi> of men. Finding
them <hi>dead in trespasses and sins</hi> Chap. 2. 1.) hee
quickneth them. Which he doth by sending his
<hi>spirit</hi> into their hearts; as the <hi>Sun</hi> quickneth
the hearbs and plants by sending his warme
beames into the bosome of the earth. And as
the soules, so the <hi>Bodies</hi> of men. Having quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the <hi>soules</hi> of his elect here, he shall quicken
their <hi>Bodies</hi> hereafter. <hi>This is the Fathers will
who hath sent me,</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>that of all
that he hath given me I should loose nothing, but
should raise it up againe at the last day.</hi> Ioh 6. 39.
And this shall he doe by the same <hi>spirit.</hi> So
the Apostle tels his <hi>Romanes,</hi> C. 8. 11. <hi>If the
spirit of him that raised up Iesus from the dead
dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead,
shall also quicken your mortall bodyes by his spirit
that dwelleth in you.</hi> That spirit of Christ, which

those beasts of prey. Psal. 104. 20, 21, 22. <hi>Thou
makest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the
beasts of the forrest doe creepe forth, The young

desire him.]</hi> So the Prophet sets forth the state
and condition of this <hi>Son of man</hi> upon the earth,
<hi>Isaiah 53. 2.</hi> which was so mean and despicable,
as that there was nothing sightly, much less
glorious to be seen in him.</p>
                  <p>Such it was in his <hi>life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In his death Eclipsed.</note> much more in his <hi>death.</hi>
Then was this <hi>Sun</hi> under a sad and almost total
<hi>Eclipse.</hi> Then was this <hi>Son of man</hi> no other, but
a ruful spectacle of deformity and misery. His
<hi>face,</hi> his <hi>countenance,</hi> was then <hi>marred.</hi> So the
same Prophet in the Chapter foregoing expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the sadness of his condition. <hi>Many were
astonished at him</hi> (saith he speaking of <hi>Christ)
his visage was so marred more then any man, and
his form more then the sons of men,</hi> Isaiah 52, 14.
So was it with him in his <hi>Passion;</hi> wherein the
person of Christ was subjected to the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
that could be cast upon it. His <hi>face</hi> was
then far from <hi>shining.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now, behold, <hi>this Sun is broke forth.</hi> Christ
being risen from the dead,<note place="margin">In his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection breaking forth.</note> and ascended into
heaven, now his <hi>face shineth.</hi> So it did in his
<hi>Transfiguration</hi> upon the Mount, <hi>Matth. 17. 2.
His face did shine as the Sun.</hi> A preludium of
that <hi>Glory,</hi> which he was to enter into after his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104496:69"/>
Passion was over. Of which he tels those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
travelling to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> Luke 24. 26. <hi>Ought
not Christ to have suffered these things, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into his glory.</hi> And what he therefore telleth
them was to be done; here he sheweth unto his
servant <hi>Iohn</hi> that it was done; making him an
eye-witness of it, shewing him his <hi>face,</hi> which was
as the <hi>Sun shining.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such was the change of his condition.</hi> In his
state of <hi>Humiliation</hi> mean, and despicable, none
more; in his state of <hi>Exaltation,</hi> glorious,
none so much. His <hi>Humanity,</hi> his flesh being
cloathed with a singular and admirable clarity
and brightness, so burnished that it <hi>shines like the
Sun.</hi>
                  </p>

that word signifieth.) And so shall it be with all
other <hi>erroneous doctrines</hi> It may be for a time

And such operation hath the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> upon
the hearts of poor sinners. Though frozen (as
it were) and congealed in sin, yet he arising,
and coming upon them by the powerfull work
of his Spirit, he thaweth, melteth, resolveth
them, bringing them into a relenting temper.
Such operation had the <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> upon the
<hi>heart</hi> of <hi>Peter.</hi> After he had denied his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and was grown <hi>stiff</hi> in his denial, standing
to it, though pressed again and again (like the
water, which being hard frozen, bears who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
treads upon it) adding <hi>Abjuration</hi> to his
<hi>Abnegation,</hi> forswearing to his denying, yet no
sooner doth his <hi>Master</hi> turn and look upon
him, but presently his heart forgave. So Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> expresly notes it, <hi>Luke 22. 61. 62. And
the Lord turned and looked upon Peter, &amp;c.</hi> (look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon him <gap reason="foreign">

upon the frozen earth) <hi>and Peter went out and
wept bitterly.</hi> Such a suddain <hi>thaw,</hi> there was
upon the appearing of this <hi>Sun,</hi> his heart melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And so did the heart of that <hi>Mary,</hi> whom
the same <hi>Evangelist</hi> denominates <hi>a sinner, Luke
7. 37.</hi> a sinner <gap reason="foreign">

those that touched him, <hi>Lu. 6. 19.</hi>) her heart also
<hi>melted,</hi> melted into <hi>tears,</hi> wherwith she washed
her Saviours feet. Such operation hath the spirit
of Christ upon the most obdurate and obstinate
sinners. Though before through long custome
and continuance in sin their hearts were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
even frozen in their wickedness, yet he
coming to them in the power and strength of
his spirit, meleth and softneth them, making
them pliable and tractable, fit and ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the impressions of his grace; so setting
them at liberty from those <hi>bonds of sin,</hi> wherein
before they were bound. This is the proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as the Prophet sets it forth,
Isaiah 61. 1. <hi>The spirit of the Lord God is upon
me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the

talked with them opening to them the Scriptures,
their hearts (as they say) burned within them.</hi>
They felt a holy fervour in their spirits, kindled
there, by that <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> which accompanied
his word. And such effect hath the Spirit of
Christ, where he is pleased gratiously to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate

a holy fervour in thier hearts; Warming
them with inward Ioy; which is the immediate
fruit and effect of the <hi>face of Iesus Christ</hi> shining

countenance upon us,</hi> (saith the Psalmist,)
adding, <hi>Thou hast put gladness in my heart more
then in the time that their corne, and their mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.</hi>
Psal. 4, 6, 7. No warmth so kindly as
the warmth of the Sun. No joy like that which
is caused by the light of Gods countenance, the
shining of the <hi>face of Iesus Christ</hi> upon the
soul. And breeding Joy, it also produceth <hi>Love</hi>

and <hi>Zeale.</hi> Love to Christ; Zeale for Christ.
The aforesaid <hi>Mary,</hi> having had experience of
the great love of Christ in forgiving her so many

affection, <hi>she loved much,</hi> Luk. 7, 47. And <hi>Paul</hi>
after he had seene that <hi>great light shining round
about him from heaven,</hi> and heard the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi>
speake unto him, how Zealous was he ever after
for Christ? Not more Zealous against him before,
then now for him. Now he calleth out, <hi>Lord
what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> Act. 9, 3, 6. And
not only do, but <hi>suffer. I am readie not only to be

in diverse other. But I shall harken to the
Counsell which <hi>Aretius,</hi> writing upon the Text,
giving to those that handle it; which is, that
whilst they prosecute this <hi>Allegorie</hi> betwixt <hi>Christ</hi>

many very apt resemblances to be found, yet,
<hi>ne modum excedant, they take heed of following it

Seeke the face of Iesus Christ.</hi> This is that which

And thus behold we this <hi>Mysticall Sun,</hi> the

partakers of them; so setting before us the whole
<hi>mysterie of Christ,</hi> which it doth most clearly

Now is it so that any of you are as yet strangers
to this light, (which it is to be feared too many

This is the watchword which the Apostle Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> (having received it from some of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets)
the prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> (as it is conceved) giveth
to such as were in that dead sleep of sin, Eph. 5.

are thus asleepe. Awake you, and stand up from
the dead that Christ may give you light. Be you
awakened and roused out of that bed of sinfull
securitie, wherein you have beene sleeping, and
beeing convinced of your owne ignorance and
blindness looke out for that light of knowledg,
without which the heart cannot be good. <hi>That
the soule be without knowledge, it is not good</hi> (saith
the <hi>wiseman</hi>) Prov. 19. 2. Or (as the former
Translation, not without the consent of the
Originall readeth it,) <hi>without knowledg, the minde
is not good.</hi> Of what use is a dungeon? fit for
nothing but to make a prison of. And such is a
soule without knowledg. And therefore in the
fear of God now awake, open your eys. Behold,
the Sun is up, the <hi>Sun of righteousness</hi> is risen,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104496:77"/>
the Lord Jesus sheweth himselfe to you in the
preaching of the Gospel; doe not now shut
your eyes against the light. Men will not doe so
by the light of the <hi>Sun.</hi> When that ariseth they
will not shut their doores and windowes against
it to keepe it out, but rather set them open to let
it in, that they may receive the comfort and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of it. And so doe you by that light, the
light of the Gospell, which now shineth forth to
you. Let it not be said of you, what our Saviour
chargeth upon the Jewes, Ioh. 3. 19. That <hi>Light
is come into the world. and men loved darkness
rather then light.</hi> This if you shall doe, it will be
unto you, (as our Saviour there saith it was unto
them,) a just Condemnation. <hi>This is the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.]</hi>
Were it for heathens, who never heard
of the name of Christ to be ignorant and blinde,
as to what concerneth their eternal happines and
salvation, this would be some extenuation, as of
their sin, so of their punishment: But for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
such as are borne in times and places of
light, having the <hi>Sun</hi> (as it were) standing over

and were there nothing else to be layed to their
charg, this is to them a matter and ground of a
just Condemnation. That it may not be so to
any of you, be you perswaded to set open the
doores and windowes of your soules, and to let
in the beames of this <hi>Sun of righteousness</hi> into

And the like doe you. Having received light

<hi>Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light

the seede, it maintaineth that life, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
it, untill it come to full maturitie and
perfection. And for both these looke we unto
this <hi>Sun of righteousness</hi> the <hi>Lord Iesus;</hi> that
having received such a principle of Spiritual life
from him, we may through the continued efflux
of that Spirit of his, have that life preserved and
maintained in us, which otherwise of it self is
ready to dye. And not only maintained but
<hi>increased. I am come that they might have life,
and that they might have it more abundantly</hi> (saith
our Saviour speaking of his Elect, all true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.)
Ioh. 10. 10. that is, that that spiritual
life, which they have received from me, may
alwayes increase in them, untill it come to its
perfection, till grace be swallowed up of glory.
This benefit have beleevers by Christ. He being
the <hi>Authour,</hi> he is also <hi>the finisher of their faith</hi>
(as the Apostle describeth him. Heb. 12. 2.)
And so of all other graces. And therefore looke
we up unto him for this: every day (as it were)
<hi>fetching new life from Iesus Christ.</hi> This doth
the <hi>plant.</hi> Drooping in the evening, in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it receiveth a new life from the <hi>Sun,</hi> to
which lifting up the head, it looketh. And thus,
doe we feele any decaying or weakness of grace.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104496:79"/>
looke we up unto the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> who is <hi>full of
grace</hi> (as Saint Iohn saith of him Ioh. 1. 14. As
full of <hi>grace</hi> as the <hi>Sun</hi> is of <hi>light.</hi> To him lift
we up our heads, looking unto him by faith,
that so of that <hi>his fulness we may receive grace for
grace,</hi> (which the same Apostle there saith all
true beleevers do, verse. 16.) One grace after
another, and one degree of grace after another,
until we shal have <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Graces an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable,
and in some measure proportionable
to those graces that are in Christ, and in the end
for the grace of free <hi>Iustification</hi> receive the
grace of Eternal <hi>Glorification</hi> (as that Text is by
some expounded) Here is the second of these
Operations.</p>
                  <p>3. The third is <hi>Chearing,<note place="margin">Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Refreshing.</hi> This
operation hath the <hi>Sun</hi> upon hearbes and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
And the like hath <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> upon the
hearts of his people. He is their <hi>Comforter.</hi>
And here seeke we our Consolations. Not from
<hi>Creatures;</hi> which what ever they be, are but
like the <hi>Stars,</hi> which though they be many yet
they give but a dim light. Such and no better
is the Comfort which the Creatures are able to
yield. Though a man be surrounded with never
so great a conflvence of them, yet is it but a
poore comfort which they are able to afford
him. If the <hi>Sun</hi> be absent, it is night for all the
<hi>Stars.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">True com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort not to be found in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> And so is it with the soule; what ever
other comforts it enjoyeth without Christ, it is
but in a sad condition; And so it will be found,
when God cometh to open the eye of it, so as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104496:80"/>
to make a man truly apprehensive of it, Now,
for all those sparkes, he seeth himselfe in the
darke. And therefore thinke not to derive true
comfort from them.</p>
                  <p>Nor yet from any thing in <hi>our selves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nor in a mans self.</note> our
owne <hi>Righteousness,</hi> our owne graces or works,
what ever we have done or can doe. The Lord
speaking by the prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> to the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their false-confidences, Isai. 50. last. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
(saith he) <hi>all ye that kindle a fire, that compass
your selves about with sparkes, walke ye in the
light of your fire, and in the sparkes that ye have
kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand, ye shall
lye downe in sorrow.</hi> They hearing the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God denounced against them by the
Prophets, comforted themselves with their vaine
apprehensions that they should escape those evils
by their own wit and policie, their Artes and
Inventions. These were the <hi>sparkes</hi> which they
compassed themselves about with; seeking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from them. Even as men in a cold wet win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
season gather sticks, and make a fire of them
to warme themselves with. But what saith the
Lord? <hi>This shall ye have at my hand; ye shall
lye down in sorrow.</hi> What ever they fondly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
themselves with, they should find this in
the end, that notwithstanding all those false fires,
they should wander in the darke, meeting with
nothing but perplexity and confusion in the end.
And no better may they expect and looke for,
who seeke for comfort from any thing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
from their own good workes, workes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104496:80"/>
of righteousness, or holiness which they have
done, trusting in them and resting upon them,
let them looke to <hi>lye down in sorrow</hi> in the end.
They who shall make a fire of these sticks to
warme themselves by, may well expect the like
event to that which happened to <hi>Paul,</hi> from
that fire which he, having gathered a bundle of
sticks, made to warme himselfe withall after his
shipwrack, out of which <hi>there came a Viper and
seazed upon him.</hi> Act. 28. 3. Such will be the issue
of those false confidences which men place in,
and comfortes which they take up from their
owne workes without Christ, they will prove
dangerous, and if not shaken off, deadly to
them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore renouncing our selves,<note place="margin">All true comfort to be sought from Christ</note> with all
sublunary comfortes, as to any trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in them, seeke we the warmth of comfort
from this <hi>Sun,</hi> from the <hi>face of Iesus Christ.</hi>
Here is the fountaine of all true Consolation.
<hi>If there be any consolation in Christ</hi> (saith Paul
to his Philippians) Phil. 2. 1. Supposing that to be
the choicest, cheefest consolation. And so it is.
Even as the warmth of the <hi>Sun</hi> excelleth the
warmth of what ever fire; which of what ever
materials it be made, yet is it not so kindly, so
chearly, so comfortable, as that warmth which
cometh from the <hi>Sun.</hi> Nor yet is it so <hi>durable.</hi>
The warmth which a man receiveth from the
fire in the winter season it is presently gone, so
as he returnes to his former temper againe, nay
is the colder after it, and for it. Truly so is it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104496:81"/>
with the <hi>Consolations of this world,</hi> they are
fading, vanishing; though the heart may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be cheared for a time, yet they afterwards
leave it sad, yea sadder then before, especially
where there hath beene any inordinacie in the
use of them. A truth which needeth no other
proofe but the experience of those, who solace
and drown themselves in carnall pleasures;
when they have spent the day in them, their
hearts are often sad and melancolie in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the cause whereof is, because they finde
themselves gulled and deceived by them, not
meeting with what they expected, finding onely
a shadow, where they looked for a substance.
But it is otherwise with the warmth of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
That, as it is a kindly and comfortable, so it is a
lasting and durable warmth. And such is that
<hi>Consolation</hi> which a Christian hath in and from
<hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> It is a sweete, a substantiall, a dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
lasting, everlasting, Consolation. That is
Pauls Epithite, <hi>2 Thes. 2. 16. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
Everlasting Consolation!</hi> O let every of us seeke
after this Consolation; that we may but see the
<hi>face of Iesus Christ</hi> shining upon us through the
promises of the Gospell, so as we may have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our interest in him, and his love to us,
being able upon good grounds to say with the
blessed Apostle, that, <hi>We live by the faith of the
Son of God, who hath loved us, and given himself
for us.</hi> Gal. 2. 20. this will be to us a spring of
Consolation, a comfort both in life and death.
I pass to the fourth and fifth particulars, of
which breifly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:104496:81"/>

                     <note place="margin">Fructifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
And this benefit also seeke we from this <hi>Sun,</hi>
the <hi>Lord Iesus;</hi> that by and through his spirit
we may be made fruitfull in every good worke
(as the Apostle prayeth for his <hi>Colossians.</hi> Col.
1. 10.) This it is to <hi>walk worthy of the Lord</hi> (as
he there speaketh.) And hereby shall we evidence
our union with Christ, and interest in him; our
being in him, and his being in us. <hi>He that abideth
in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much
fruit</hi> (saith our Saviour) Ioh. 15. 5. This God
expecteth at the hands of all those upon whome
the name of Christ is called; specially from
those (to whom Christ is more clearly revealed,
upon whome his <hi>face shineth</hi> in the preaching of
the Gospel.) And that is our condition. This
<hi>Sun</hi> standeth over our heads. See that our fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification

O that we may all of us finde this blessed Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
That we may feele Jesus Christ thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us by <hi>water.</hi> Which he doth wherever
he cometh by <hi>blood. This is he that cometh by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

taketh away the <hi>guilt</hi> of it by his <hi>blood.</hi> Every
of us who would be assured of the one, labour
to finde and feele the other.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>seeke we the face of Iesus Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Christ to be felt, as the Sun in his strength.</note> that we
may not onely <hi>see</hi> him, but <hi>feele</hi> him; feele him
to us as the <hi>Sun,</hi> as the Sun shining, yea (which
is yet behind) as the Sun shining <hi>in his strength.</hi>
Exercising those other Powerfull Operations
upon us. Of which breifly.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Dissipating</hi> and dispelling of what ever
<hi>mists</hi> of Ignorance,<note place="margin">Dispelling mists of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance infidelity.</note> or Infidelitie, or inordinate
feares which lye upon our soules. Such mists
the best of Gods Saints are here subject to.
Being somtimes exercised with feares and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
touching their spiritual and eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Such a conflict we finde the holy Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
(<hi>David</hi> or <hi>Asaph,</hi> uncertaine whether)
under; Psal. 77. Where we may hear him sadly
complaining of Gods <hi>casting him off</hi> verse 7. and
of the <hi>failing of his promise</hi> verse. 8. of his <hi>forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be gratious unto him,</hi> and <hi>shutting up his
tender mercies in anger against him</hi> verse 9.
And <hi>Heman</hi> the like, Psal. 88. 14. Where we
may heare him after the like manner expostulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the matter with God, <hi>Lord, why castest thou
off my soule? why hidest thou thy face from me?</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:104496:82"/>
A good man under a sad desertion. And such
temptations are the dearest of Gods Saints sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to, which lye as <hi>mists</hi> upon their soules,
clouding and darkning of them, bringing them
into, and holding them in a disconsolate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Now for the dissipating and dispelling of
these, look we up unto Jesus Christ by faith,
earnestly begging that he would shew us his face,
causing it to shine forth to us as the <hi>Sun in its
strength;</hi> clearing up unto us the evidences of
his love and favour towards us, Confirming
in us our <hi>faith.</hi> This is the boon which the
<hi>father</hi> of that <hi>Demoniack</hi> beggeth from our
<hi>Saviour</hi> Mark. 9. 24, <hi>Lord I beleeve, helpe mine
unbeleife.</hi> And the Disciples put up the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
Luk. 17. 5. <hi>Lord increase our faith.</hi> And thus
feeling the infirmitie and weakness of that grace
in our selves, seeke we the Confirmation and
Augmentation of it from <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that by
the cleare revealing and manifesting himself to
us he would dispell all mists of Infidelitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly.<note place="margin">Thawing and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart.</note> 
                     <hi>Thawing</hi> and <hi>melting our frozen

obduracie, but bringing them to, and keepe
them in a melting, relenting frame and temper;
making them truly <hi>tender</hi> (as <hi>Iosia's</hi> heart is
sayed to be 2 Chro. 34. 27.) So as they may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

make upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly.<note place="margin">Warming and heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</note> And lastly, <hi>warming and heating of

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104496:83"/>
so as (with <hi>Mary</hi>) we may feele our spirits
<hi>rejoycing in God our Saviour;</hi> joying in him in
all estates and conditions; doing what the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Habakkuk</hi> resolves upon, Hab. 3. 17, 18.
<hi>Although the figtree shall not blossome, neither shall
fruit be in the vines,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet will I rejoyce in the
Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</hi> In all
conditions, when all other comforts faile, yet
there is matter enough of <hi>Ioy</hi> in the Lord <hi>Christ;</hi>
as when the <hi>Candles</hi> are all blowne out there is
light enough in the <hi>Sun:</hi> Rejoice we in him.
Seeking how to make answerable returnes unto
him. Answering his love with <hi>love,</hi> loving him
above all; which who so doth not, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
hath denounced an <hi>Anathema Maranatha</hi> upon
him, <hi>If any man love not the Lord Iesus let him
be had in execration even unto the death.</hi> 1 Cor. 16.
22. And loving him, be <hi>Zealous</hi> for him. Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for his truth, Zealous for his worship and

labour we to find and feel these and the like,

                  <p>Which whilst we doe, now feare not the <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of this Sun,</hi> the coming and appearing of the
<hi>Lord Iesus</hi> at the last day. Which indeede unto
all his enemies (as I shewed you,) both open and
secret, shall be a terrible appearing, in so much
as they shall not be able to abide it. So saith the
prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> concerning his first coming,
Mal. 3. 2. <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming?<note place="margin">Which to others will be terrible.</note>
and who shall stand when he appeareth?</hi> Such was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104496:83"/>
the day of his <hi>first coming,</hi> his coming in the
flesh, a dreadfull day to obstinate and obdurate
sinners, for whome it had been better he had
never come. How much more the day of his
<hi>second coming,</hi> his second appearing, when he
shall come like the <hi>Sun in his strength,</hi> in the
glory of his power and Majesty; come purposely
to render vengeance to them that would not
knowe and acknowledg him, nor obey his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
<hi>Then shall all the kindreds of the earth wail
because of him</hi> (as you have it verse. 7. of this
Chapter. Rev. 1.) <hi>Then shall the sinners in
Sion be afraid, fearefullness shall surprize the
Hypocrites</hi> (as the prophet speakes) Isaiah 33. 14.
And why? Because then they shall be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
That shall be a <hi>day of Revelation,</hi> when
<hi>God shall bring to light the hidden things of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and make manifest the counsels of the hearts
of men</hi> (as the Apostle hath it, 1. Cor. 4. 5.)
Then shall all masks and vizardes be pulled off.
And then shall they, who have here stood out
against the Government of Jesus Christ, would
not stoope to his scepter, to be guided by his
word, they shall be dragged before his dreadful

be to all his Enemies. But to others, who
have here owned him in the Relations of <hi>a

was his <hi>first coming</hi> to these that beleeved on

afar off, by faith in the promise; <hi>your father
Abraham rejoyced to see my day,</hi> (so our Saviour
tels the Jewes) Ioh. 8. 56. And so it was to <hi>Iohn
the Baptist,</hi> who being then in his mothers womb
yet <hi>leaps for joy at the salvation of Marie,</hi> Luk.
1. 41, 44. by a secret sympathie exulting in the
Incarnation of Christ. And the <hi>Angell</hi> bringing
the tidings of the <hi>Nativity</hi> unto the <hi>shepherds,</hi>
telleth them. <hi>Behold I bring you tidings of great
joy which shall be to all people,</hi> Luk. 2. 10. The
greatest Ioy that ever sounded in the eares of
men or Angels. Such was his first coming to all
beleevers. And such shall his <hi>second coming</hi>
much more be unto them. When they shall see
their <hi>King</hi> coming to them, not as he did to
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> in that meane and despicable garbe,
but in his <hi>glory, coming with clouds</hi> (as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
verse of this Chapter hath it,) sitting upon
them as on a throne of glory, his <hi>face shining
like the Sun in his strength,</hi> this shall be a joyfull
and a happie day to them; all them, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been in their measure made comformable
to him here, shall then be transformed into his
Image. <hi>When he shall appeare, we shall be like him,
for we shall see him as he is,</hi> 1 Ioh. 3. 2. Having
beene like unto him in grace, we shall be like
him in glory. <hi>When Christ who is our life shall
appeare, then shall we also appeare with him in glory</hi>
Col. 3. 4.</p>
                  <p>And so have I now done with this verse.

there be cause for

you, whom God hath in any measure
made sensible of the present state of the
<pb facs="tcp:104496:88"/>
                     <hi>land of your Nativity,</hi> and specially of the
<hi>Church</hi> therein. When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heard
that sad report concerning <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that
the <hi>remnant which were left</hi> therein were
in <hi>great affliction and reproach,</hi> and that
<hi>the Wall thereof was broken down,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It
came to passe</hi> (saith he) <hi>when I heard these
words, that I sate down and wept, and
mourned,</hi> Neh. 1. 4. And is not this the
Condition of the poor <hi>Church</hi> of God
among us in this <hi>Nation</hi> at this day? Is
not the <hi>Wall</hi> thereof broken down? All
<hi>Church-Government</hi> levelled? By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whereof all kind of dangerous and
damnable <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Heresies,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormious
practises, with unbrotherly
and unchristian divisions, have broke
in upon us, to the rendring of us a
scorn and derision to the Nations round
about. Thus doth <hi>Englands sore run</hi>
in this night of her Affliction, <hi>and ceaseth
not,</hi> her calamity every day increasing.
And yet (which is no small addition
to her misery,) how few are there who
so lay it to heart, as to seek out for
cure and remedy? Nay, how many
who refuse it being offered? not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to hear of any such thing as <hi>Church-Government.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104496:88"/>
Insomuch as the <hi>servants
of God,</hi> some and many of them, may
take up the like complaint concerning
this Nation, that <hi>Babylons</hi> friends once
did concerning her <hi>(Ier. 51. 9.) We would
have healed her, but shee is not healed.</hi>
Nay, that which is far worse, shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
so to be. So deplorable, and almost
desperate, is her condition now become.
Now in this case what shall <hi>Sions friends,</hi>
do? What? desert and forsake her?
This indeed is the resolve of <hi>Babylons
friends</hi> there. <hi>Let us forsake her</hi> (say they,)
<hi>and let us goe every man into his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
for her Iudgment reacheth unto heaven,
and is lifted up unto the skies;</hi> They will
give her over, and every one shifteth for
himselfe. But far be such thoughts from
all the servants of God in this Nation.
How ever (it must be acknowledged) they
have cause enough to feare the event,
having so many sad symptomes before
their eyes, yet (not knowing but that
there may be <hi>hope in Israel concerning
this thing</hi>) let them not in the day of her
adversity forsake their <hi>Mother,</hi> in whose
womb they were conceived, and whose
breasts have given them suck; But let
<pb facs="tcp:104496:89"/>
them with faith and patience, yet looke
out, look <hi>up</hi> (for from thence must come
<hi>Englands</hi> cure,) being importunate with
the <hi>God of Israel,</hi> that he who hath in
his just judgment for our unfruitfulnesse,
broken down the hedge of his Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, so as the <hi>Boar out of the wood
doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field
doth devour it,</hi> would in his free grace and
mercy, <hi>return and look down from heaven,
and visit this vine, and the vineyard which
his own right hand hath planted.</hi> Which
that all may be excited to do, is the design
of this small Treatise. To which end if it
may be in any degree serviceable to any.
I have that I aimed at. In the hopes
whereof I rest,</p>

                  <p>First, the <hi>occasion</hi> of that lamentation; his
approaching and beholding of the City
[<hi>And when he was come near, and beheld</hi> the
<hi>City.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>expression</hi> of it, by tears <hi>[He

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>ground</hi> or <hi>cause</hi> of it; the sad
state of the City in regard of a two-fold <hi>evil,</hi> the
one of <hi>sin,</hi> the other of <hi>punishment:</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> the
<hi>stupidity</hi> and <hi>blindnesse</hi> of the inhabitants of that
City in not laying hold upon the offers and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

declared <hi>[But now they are hid from thine

verses following. These are the severals,
some of which I have now to deal with. Begin
with the first. The <hi>occasion</hi> of this lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when he was come near,<note place="margin">Part 1. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> he beheld the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty]</hi>
So he did, and that <hi>Oculis tam animi
quam corporis,</hi> with the eye both of his <hi>body</hi> and
<hi>mind.</hi> With the eye of his <hi>body</hi> he beheld the
<hi>place.</hi> And beholding it <hi>wept</hi> over it. Thus is
the <hi>eye</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> oftimes as a window to let in
<hi>affection</hi> and <hi>passion</hi> into the <hi>soul.<note place="margin">The eye lets in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the heart.</note> Love</hi> and <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
joy</hi> and <hi>grief,</hi> they often enter at this door.
Among other; in this way is <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>compassion</hi>
often let into the heart. The <hi>good Samaritane,</hi>
he <hi>saw the man that was fallen among theeves;</hi>
And <hi>when he saw him</hi> (saith the text) <hi>he had
compassion on him,</hi> Luk. 10. 33. And thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
here <hi>saw</hi> the City of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and
when he saw it, he was thus affected with it.
Seeing it, as with his bodily eye, so with the <hi>eye</hi>
of his <hi>mind,</hi> considering the state and condition
of it.</p>
                  <p>Q. But what was it that he
there saw,<note place="margin">What Christ looked upon in Jerusalem, that so affected him.</note> or looked upon that
did so affect, and move him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Why, first with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

he beheld as goodly a prospect as the earth could
afford. A magnificent City, beautiful for <hi>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104496:91"/>
Beautiful for scituation, the joy of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whole earth, is mount Sion,</hi> Psal. 48. 2. Beautiful
for edifices and structures, which were rich and
stately. Among which the <hi>Temple</hi> rebuilt by
<hi>King Herod</hi> was the most sumptuous and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
pile; that then the world was owner of.
So as had there been nothing else, this alone
had been enough to move compassion; to think
that so goodly a <hi>City</hi> as that, should within a
short time be ruined: such stately edifices laid
level with the grou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d. This is conceived to
have affected the Disciples of Christ, as the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sets it forth, <hi>Matth. 24. 1. His Disciples
came</hi> (saith the text) <hi>to shew him the buildings
of the Temple.</hi> This they did, as by way of <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,</hi>
being much taken with the rich mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of the structure, so also out of <hi>pity</hi> and
commiseration, in as much as their master had
but a little before given them a hint of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
thereof; cap. 23. 38. <hi>[Behold, your
house is left unto you desolate]</hi> intimating that
both the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> should be destroyed.
Hereupon they now shewed him the buildings
thereof, as pittying that sad fate, that so stately
a fabrick should be ruined. This moved them;
And I will not say but it might also at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
affect their master, when he had this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prospect in his eye: to think what after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he speaks verse 44. that the enemy
should <hi>lay</hi> that <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple even with the
ground, not leaving one stone upon another.</hi> This
possibly might move some compassion in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104496:91"/>
But this was but the least grain in the ballance:
There were divers other considerations besides
this of greater importance, which our Saviour

<hi>exile,</hi> or else miserable <hi>slavery.</hi> And this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse,
could not but much affect him. So it
did in another case, as the <hi>Evangelist</hi> reports
the story once and again, <hi>Matth. 9. 36. When he
saw the multitude he was moved with compassion
in them because they fainted, and were scattered
abroad as sheep having no shepheard.</hi> And again,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ap. 15. vers. 32. he tells his Disciples: <hi>I have
compassion on the multitude, because they continue
with me now three dayes and have nothing to eat.</hi>
Thus did he pity the condition of the people,
having compassion both on their <hi>souls</hi> and <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi>
the one because they wanted <hi>instruction,</hi>
the other because they wanted <hi>refreshment.</hi> How
much more then might this stir the like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in him, when looking upon this populous
City, he considered how many were like to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in that desolation which hung over the
head of it. As it is reported of that great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<hi>Xerxes,</hi> that from a hill beholding his

of thousands of able fighting men, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

years, not a man of them should be left alive,
he could not refrain from weeping. And even
alike consideration might here draw tears from
the eyes of our blessed Saviour; Which also
himself gives a hint of in that 44. verse after the
Text, where speaking how the City should be
laid level with the ground, he adds, <hi>and thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
within thee.]</hi> meaning that they also should
perish, the very <hi>little ones</hi> being (as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
saith of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> Psal. 137.) <hi>dashed
against the stones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the people: Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> To this (in the third place) add the

it could not but prove fatal to that

the <hi>City of God.</hi> So our Saviour meaneth

the Psalmist explains himself in the 8. verse of

have we seen in the City of the Lord of Hosts, in
the City of God.</hi> As also in the first verse, <hi>God is
greatly to be praised in the City of our God.</hi> So was
<hi>Hierusalem,</hi> There God <hi>dwelt. The Lord hath
chosen Sion, he hath desired it for his habitation;

132. 13, 14. This was the place, the onely place
upon earth, where God manifested his presence
in a fixed and constant way. Here formerly
was the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> the pledge and
token of Gods presence; <hi>The glory of Israel,</hi>
and of the world, and therefore called, <hi>The

God dwelt betwixt the <hi>Cherubins,</hi> and from
whence the light of salvation went forth unto all
the world. This was <hi>urbs sacris dicata</hi> (as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>

and service of God, a place which God had
chosen to put his name there; the place <hi>whither
the tribes came up to worship,</hi> Psal. 122. 4. where
the Ordinances of God were set up in their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

                  <p>And this it was (as <hi>Gualter</hi> and

which above all other things our

But without any just cause. To hear
of Christs <hi>weeping,</hi> is not such a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that any should boggle at it.
Four several times (saith one Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the Text) we read hereof. The first
at his <hi>Nativity,</hi> his <hi>Birth.</hi> For this he citeth
that Apochryphal Text, <hi>Wisd. 7. 3.</hi> Where <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
(whereby he understandeth <hi>Christ,</hi> who is
so called, <hi>Prov. 8.</hi>) saith, that she was <hi>Borne
crying and weeping, as all other do.</hi> Thus <hi>Infants</hi>
are commonly born, <hi>crying;</hi> whether <hi>weeping</hi>
or no, I will not say. And thus that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Solomon</hi> is conceived to set forth the birth of
<hi>Christ,</hi> who was therein conformed to the rest
of the sons of men. But that (being <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal</hi>)
I leave it, as I find it, uncertain, so as it
may be believed or rejected without any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to the faith. The three other are clear.
The first, at the raising up of <hi>Lazarus;</hi> where
we read, <hi>Joh. 11. 53. And Iesus wept.</hi> The
second here, in this his <hi>Procession</hi> to <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
(as he calleth it) <hi>He wept over it,]</hi> The third
and last in his <hi>Passion</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104496:94"/>
which the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tels us,
that <hi>he offered up prayers and supplications, with
strong cryings and tears,</hi> Heb. 5. 7. Thus (saith
he) did our blessed Saviour, who was the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of life,</hi> water the world with his tears,
which he compareth to the <hi>four Rivers,</hi> which
went out of <hi>Paradise</hi> to water the earth. But
letting that passe, as more witty then weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
                  <p>Weeping (we see) was no new or strange
thing with our Saviour. That ever he <hi>laughed,</hi>
that we read not; that he <hi>wept</hi> we meet with it
more then once.</p>
                  <p>Q. But it may be said;<note place="margin">Why Christ lamenteth what he could have remedied.</note> Wherefore should our
Saviour here <hi>weep over Hierusalem?</hi> what ever
calamities he saw impending, hanging over the
head of it, he could have prevented them, if he
had pleased. And why then doth he lament
that, which with a word he was able to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To this it is answered:<note place="margin">To shew the truth of his humanity.</note> First,
This he did, to <hi>shew the truth of his
humanity:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Carne humanacircunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, vere humanos induit affectus, Cal. ad loc.</note> Taking upon him our
<hi>nature,</hi> he took upon him also all
<hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> common
to that nature. Being made like unto us in
<hi>all things,</hi> sin onely excepted, (as the Apostle
hath it, <hi>Heb. 4. 15.</hi>) subjected to all our not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
infirmities. Thus he <hi>slept, eat,</hi> and <hi>drank,</hi>
which the nature of man requireth. And thus
we read that he was <hi>weary, hungry, thirsty;</hi> and
thus he <hi>wept.</hi> All to shew himself truly <hi>man;</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:104496:95"/>
and that, together with our nature, he had also
taken our <hi>Infirmities</hi> (as the Evangelist Saint
<hi>Mathew</hi> hath it, <hi>Matth. 8. 17.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>But secondly, Hereby he testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his <hi>affection</hi> towards those for
whom he was made man,<note place="margin">To testifie his affection to the Iews.</note> and for
whose sake he came into the world.<note place="margin">Hoc fletu testatus est fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne se diligere eos in quorum gratiam fuerat homo factus, Calvin ad Text.

tells the <hi>woman of Canaan</hi>) Matth.
15. 24. His arrand was first to the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> to seek and save them. And
hereby he expressed his indeared affection unto
them. This was the contrition which the
Jewes made of his weeping over <hi>Lazarus</hi> his
grave. <hi>Behold, how he loved him</hi> (say they) <hi>Ioh.
11. 36.</hi> And the same construction may we make
of this his weeping over <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> Hereby
he shewed that tender affection which he bare
unto them, and the desire which he had of their
welfare and happinesse.</p>
                  <p>Q. But if he loved them so,<note place="margin">Why did he not then help and save them.</note> why did he not
help them? Why did he not divert those inpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
evils? This had been a greater expression
of love to them, to save them, then to weep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> True, as <hi>God</hi> he could have helped
them.<note place="margin">Christ here in acteth as man.</note> He could have prevented all those evils
and miseries. But we must here look upon him
as acting the part of a <hi>Mediator.</hi> In the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of which office the <hi>Divine nature</hi> often
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104496:95"/>
rested, and hid it, not putting forth that
power which otherwise it could. Thus in his
<hi>Passion</hi> the <hi>Godhead</hi> slept, while the <hi>Manhood</hi>
suffered. And thus here, the <hi>Divine</hi> nature
rested, while the <hi>humane</hi> acted. And he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     </gap> people, which in respect of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power, as <hi>God,</hi> he could have prevented.
He <hi>could</hi> have done it, but he <hi>would</hi> not. And
why? Because he came not to do his own will,
but the will of him that sent him. As he came
to preach his <hi>Word,</hi> not his own, <hi>My doctrine
is not mine own, but his that sent me,</hi> Joh. 7. 16.
So he came to do his <hi>work,</hi> his <hi>will,</hi> not his own.
<hi>I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which hath sent me,</hi> Joh. 5. 30. Now this was
the will of the Father, that that ungrateful
people refusing and rejecting his <hi>Son,</hi> and the
offer of grace and mercy through him, should
smart for that their ingratitude. And this he,
as <hi>man,</hi> here lamenteth and bewaileth, weeping
over them. <hi>[When he saw the City, he wept over

Let the same mind be in you, which also

was in him we see. He was affected not onely

                  </p>

the <hi>late Rebukes,</hi> (those I suppose received

And truly if rightly looked upon, as we
see a reality in every of them, so we shall
find that there is never a one of them but giveth
the people of God to do over this <hi>Nation,</hi>
what their blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> here did over <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>

studied and resolved blasphemies. Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies

denying the <hi>satisfaction of Christ;</hi> blasphemies
against <hi>Scriptures, Ordinances, Ministery;</hi>

manner was to <hi>rend their garments,</hi> 2 King. 18.
37. 19. 1. Matth. 26. 65. Act. 14. 14.) O what
cause have Christians then to rend their hearts at

<hi>Reformation</hi> being turned to <hi>Deformation:</hi> the
<hi>wals of Ierusalem</hi> being broken down, and no
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> as yet undertaking the rebuilding
of them. And are not these just grounds of
mourning? A sufficient cause why they who
wish well to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to the Church of God
in this Nation should with their Saviour here,
<hi>weep over it?</hi> Such is the present state there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

<hi>Cor divisum mors est;</hi> If the <hi>heart</hi> be divided the

                  <p>Now then having thus approached to and
looked upon this <hi>Nation,</hi> what remains but that
our eyes should move our hearts to pity and
compassionate it, to mourn over it. Little else
it is that private persons can do. And this let
them do. <hi>Preces &amp; Lachrymae, Prayers and tears
are the Churches weapons,</hi> which every one both
may, and ought to make use of. And this let
us, as at other times, so this day do. All of us
powring forth our souls before the Lord in an
humble confession of our <hi>own sins,</hi> and the <hi>sins
of the Nation</hi> which have justly deserved, what
ever we either feel or fear begging it from him,
that he would graciously return unto us, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the <hi>Cure</hi> of this <hi>Sin-sick nation, healing

When he seeth the bowels of his father

What, was the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> so affected towards

of that evil. The evil bewailed is their
<hi>stupidity,</hi> their not knowing of <hi>what belonged

two, the one taken from the <hi>persons,</hi> the other
from the <hi>time.</hi> The <hi>persons</hi> who were thus stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid

                  <p>Here,<note place="margin">Expli. Three things.</note> by way of explication three things are

we <hi>prosperity, felicity.</hi> So the word was fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
used among the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> In as much as
<hi>Peace</hi> is a comprehensive blessing, they set forth
all blessings under this. Thus in their <hi>ordinary
salutations</hi> they were wont to wish <hi>Peace.
Peace be unto thee, and peace be unto thy house,
and peace be unto all that thou hast.</hi> It is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation
which <hi>David</hi> sends to <hi>Nabal, 1</hi> Sam.
25. 6. And thus our Saviour sending forth his
<hi>Apostles,</hi> he puts this word into their mouthes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104496:104"/>
directing them to salute the families where they
came after that manner, with an apprecation of
peace. <hi>Into whatsoever house ye enter, ye shall
first say, Peace be to this hous,</hi> Luk. 10. 5. <hi>i.e.</hi> all
kind of happinesse. And so look we upon the
word here in the text. By <hi>peace</hi> understanding
here all kind of felicitie; <hi>Omnes foelicitatis par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
(as <hi>Calvin</hi> hath it) all the parts, and kinds
of happinesse. Happinesse both present and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
temporal and eternal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 2.</hi> But what were the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed

why, in one word, <hi>Christ</hi> himself, and the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of salvation</hi> by and through him <hi>Christ</hi>
and his <hi>Gospel.</hi> These were the things which
conduced to their peace, to the making of them
a happy people, and that both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Other things there were, which in a
<hi>Political</hi> and civil way might have tended to the
outward peace, the temporal prosperity of that
place. But none like this, none like <hi>Christ</hi> who
is the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> Isai. 9. 6. And <hi>our peace,</hi>
Ephes. 2. 14. In him is the salvation of a people
bound up. This it is which maketh a people
truly happy: <hi>The knowledge of Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this knowledge the inhabitants of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
were destitute of. They neither did, nor
would know this their <hi>Peace-maker. Moses</hi>
they knew, he being <hi>read in their Synagogues
every Sabbath day,</hi> Act. 15. 21. But <hi>Christ</hi> they
knew not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. 3.</hi> But what did not they <hi>know</hi> him? had
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104496:104"/>
they not heard of him?<note place="margin">How they are said not to know these things, viz. in not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ.</note> Nay had they not
both heard and seen him? heard his <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
seen his <hi>Miracles?</hi> A. True, but they did
not receive him. <hi>He came unto his own, and
his own recived him not,</hi> Joh. 1. 11. He came
unto his own, to <hi>Israel</hi> his own peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> his own Countrey,
he being of the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
his own City, he being the Son of <hi>David,</hi>
but they <hi>received</hi> him not, they would not own
him, they would not acknowledge him to be
their <hi>Messias;</hi> they would neither believe on
him, nor submit unto him. This it is truly to
know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ,<note place="margin">To know God and Christ, what.</note> to know them in an
affectionate way. Not barely to know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that there is a <hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>Christ;</hi> no nor

But to know them affectionately with a <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Novv in this sense the inhabitants of Jerusalem

                  <p>A. To this it is answered,<note place="margin">By whom it was.</note> True, Christ was
thus acknowledged by some and many at this
time. But by whom was it? Probably by some
of the <hi>neighbouring villages</hi> not by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> So much seems to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
in the tenth verse, where it is said,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104496:105"/>
                     <hi>when he came into Jerusalem, all the City was

At that time when those <hi>Queristers</hi> sung that

their heads. But they <hi>would not.</hi> They reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the offers of grace made unto them. And
this is the matter of our Saviours, <hi>lamentation,</hi>
the thing which drew these tears from his eyes.
And indeed there is nothing more to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then this.</p>
                  <p>And will you have the <hi>Reason</hi> of it, take it
from the Text.<note place="margin">This is that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto the peace of a people.</note> 
                     <hi>This is the thing which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unto their peace.</hi> Upon this it is that the woe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104496:106"/>
or welfare, the felicity or misery of a people
doth depend. This is their making or marring;
the receiving or rejecting the Gospel of peace.
This being entertained brings peace along with
it. It was the commission and direction which
our <hi>Saviour</hi> gave to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> when he sent
them forth, <hi>Matth. 10. 12, 13. When ye enter
into a house, salute it, and if the house be worthy</hi>
(that is, such persons as are willing and ready
to entertain you and your message) <hi>now let
your peace come upon it.</hi> Now preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of peace to them, and therewith wish all
good and happinesse unto them: which also
accordingly shall come and <hi>rest</hi> upon them. So
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> expresseth it, <hi>Luk. 10. 6. If the sonne
of peace be there,</hi> (meaning such persons as were
readily disposed to receive the doctrine of
peace; the Gospel) <hi>your peace shall rest upon it,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, God will bring upon that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
all the good that you wish unto it; your
apprecation of peace shall be as effectual as
your preaching of it. Thus is it with a <hi>family,</hi>
And thus is it with a <hi>City,</hi> and thus is it with a
<hi>Nation.</hi> The receiving of the Gospel is the
happinesse of it.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand,<note place="margin">The reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel the undoing of a people.</note> the <hi>rejecting of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
is the <hi>undoing</hi> of a people. So it there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<hi>Matth. 10. 14. Whosoever shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you, nor hear your words, when ye depart
out of that house, or City, shake of the dust of your
feet.</hi> This were the Apostles to do as a token of
Gods shaking them off. Even as we read of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104496:107"/>
                     <hi>Nehemiah</hi> shaking his lap, <hi>Nehem. 5. 13. Also I
shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every
man from his house, from his labour, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
not this promise, even thus be he shaken out
and emptied.</hi> Thus were the Apostles to shake
off the dust of their feet against those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
them: Or to <hi>shake their garments</hi> at
them. So did <hi>Paul</hi> against the Jews, Act. 18. 5,
6. He preaching Christ unto them, <hi>when they
opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook his
raiment,</hi> &amp;c. Thereby intimating not onely his
deserting, but Gods rejecting of them. Of
such sad consequence is it for a people not to
give entertainment to the Gospel, and the
messengers thereof. This layeth them under
a curse; rendring them justly obnoxious to the
vengeance of God. I shall not dwell any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
upon <hi>Confirmation,</hi> or <hi>Illustration.</hi> Bring
we it home to our selves by way of <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

have found such sleight and slender entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as generally they have done, and yet do. A
long time it is that the Gospel hath been held
forth among us. Christ hath sent unto us his
messengers, the <hi>Ministers of reconciliation,</hi>
offering peace unto us upon Gospel tearms,
upon our receiving him as our <hi>Saviour</hi> and
<hi>Lord.</hi> But vvhat is the reception, vvhat is the
entertainment that for the most part he hath
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104496:107"/>
met with? Is it any more then a formal recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a formal profession of his name? This
indeed hath generally obtained. <hi>The name of
Christ is called upon us.</hi> But is not this all?
What is there more to be found among the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part, but a naked profession without any
power? How few are there that have received
Christ into their hearts? Truth is, our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of Christ hath been, and is generally
more in <hi>Ceremony</hi> then in <hi>reality.</hi> Not unlike that
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> many of which at his entrance here
in to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were full of Ceremony and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
expressions; They <hi>spread their garments</hi>
in the way, as a <hi>Carpet</hi> for him to ride upon.
They <hi>cut down branches of trees,</hi> and strowed
the way with them, as tokens of festivity and
solemnity. And they cry <hi>Hosanna;</hi> saluting him
by the name of a <hi>Saviour.</hi> But yet they were
far from taking him to be their <hi>King.</hi> No; when
he was propounded to them under that notion,
as he was by <hi>Pilate,</hi> John 19. 14. the <hi>chief
Priests</hi> make answer for the rest, <hi>we have no King
but Caesar,</hi> vers. 15. And they who had even
now cried out <hi>Hosanna,</hi> now change their note,
crying out as loud <hi>Crucifige, Away with him,
away with him, Crucifie him.</hi> And is it not so
with the greatest part of this Nation? In a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
way they have acknowledged Christ for a
<hi>Saviour,</hi> complementing him with some <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
observances</hi> (such and no better have
been the services which they have performed
unto him, meer shadows without any substance)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104496:108"/>
but as for taking him to be their <hi>King,</hi> how are
the greatest part resolved with those <hi>Citizens</hi>
in the Parable, <hi>Luke 19. 14.</hi> Nolumus regnare,
<hi>we will not have this man to reign over us.</hi>

this!<note place="margin">Calling for deep la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</note> what cause have we to sit down and weep
over <hi>England</hi> upon this account? This was the
thing which <hi>belonged to our peace.</hi> Had we thus
received <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Gospel,</hi> had we yielded
up our selvs to be governed and regulated by
his Laws, how happy a people might we then
have been? Then might we have hoped that
<hi>God would have subdued our enemies, and turned
his hand against our adversaries:</hi> Then <hi>had our
race been as a river, and our righteousness as the
waves of the Sea</hi> (as the divine <hi>Psalmist</hi> and
<hi>Prophet</hi> have it in the places forecited, <hi>Psal.
81. 13. Isaiah 48. 18.</hi>) Then had there been
<hi>peace within our wals, and prosperity within our

submitting to his <hi>Government;</hi> not to his <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                  <p>In the fear of God let this be seriously laid to
heart by every of us this day. We see how our

<hi>England!</hi> if thou hadst known in this thy day
the things which belong unto thy peace, O how
happy, how blessed hadst thou been! But now,
what God intends towards thee, who knoweth?
Should he <hi>remove thy Candlestick,</hi> take away
the Gospel from thee, (which is cause enough
to fear;) should he bring the like evils upon
thee, as our blessed Saviour here threatens
against <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> should he make our <hi>Houses,</hi>
Cities, Temples, desolate; should he bring ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
desolation both upon <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi>
should he give a near and larger Commission to

it with those ordinary attendants (which
through a wonderful providence we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

so sweeping us as dung off from the face of the
earth, yet must we acknowledg the Lord to be
just and righteous.</p>
                  <p>In the humble acknowledgment whereof,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> let

to give such entertainment to him and it

well to our <hi>own souls</hi> in particular, and to this

hereunto. As yet through riches of grace the

indeavouring to profit by them; to finde the

express that power in the course of our lives and

Exprobration against those Cities which he had
honoured with his presence and doctrine, as
here he doth against <hi>Ierusalem. Then</hi> (saith the
Text) <hi>began he to upbraid the Cities wherein most
of his mighty works were done, because they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

had taxed the general morosity and frowardness
of that people, upon whom no means could

this he doth <hi>vers. 16, 17, 18, 19.</hi> But
now he cometh more specially to deal with
those particular places, where he had been most
conversant, taxing them as being most faulty of
all the rest. Their sin was greater, and so should
their punishment be. So it followeth, <hi>vers. 21.
Woe unto thee Chorazin, woe unto thee Bethsaida,
for if the mighty works which were done in you,
had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have

of <hi>Gennezareth,</hi> where Christ conversed much,
taught often, wrought many miracles; yet
they <hi>repented</hi> not, they were not thereby
wrought upon to imbrace the Gospel. What
followeth? you have it in the next verse, <hi>v. 22.
I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre
and Sidon at the day of judgment then for you.]</hi>
At the day of general Judgment, there shall be

accordingly afterwards came to pass in the days
of the <hi>Emperour Vespasian,</hi> who over-ran the
whole Countrey of <hi>Galilee,</hi> spoiling that place
amongst others. And what was the cause of
this so sad a change? why, her not answering
the means afforded her; so it there followeth,
<hi>verse 24. For if the mighty works which have been
done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104496:112"/>

which were therein, it being a sink of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,
insomuch that God made it a specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of vengeance to all posterity, destroying it
with <hi>fire and brimstone from heaven.</hi> Yet <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaums</hi>
portion of judgment at that day
should be greater then hers. And why so? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as she enjoyed those meanes which
<hi>Sodom</hi> did not. True, there was a righteous <hi>Lot</hi>
in <hi>Sodom,</hi> whose Example might have had some
influence upon them; But in <hi>Capernaum</hi> was
<hi>Christ</hi> himself preaching unto them, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
his doctrine by miracles. And this it
was which aggravated <hi>Capernaums</hi> sin, and so

                  <p>Thus the more light,<note place="margin">The more light the greater sin.</note> the more means a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

that our <hi>Saviour</hi> saith of the <hi>Iews,</hi> John 15. 22.
<hi>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had
not had sin;</hi> that is, comparatively, their sin
had been nothing in comparison of what now
it is. Express to this purpose are those two
known Texts of the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi>

to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us by them that heard him,]</hi> that is, the doctrine
of salvation, the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which is <gap reason="foreign">

bringing so <hi>great salvation</hi> as no other way can,
even <hi>eternal salvation;</hi> which was preached
and published first by <hi>Christ</hi> himself, then by
his <hi>Apostles.</hi> This doctrine being of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,

the sin of those who shall not hearken to it to be
more heinous then of those under the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
which they must expect an answerable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Consonant hereunto is that other place,
<hi>Heb. 10. 28, 29. He that despised Moses his
Law died without mercy</hi> (the crime being Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
and so declared by the Law, it was not in
the power whether of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Senate</hi> to pardon
it;) <hi>Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall
be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot
the son of God, &amp;c. and hath done despite to the

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:104496:113"/>
are greater and more heinous then those

a heinous addition to all former sins and

favour of his <hi>Prince,</hi> as to reject his <hi>pardon</hi>
being tendred to him, casting it away, and
trampling it under his feete, so not accepting
the benefit of it, who but would looke upon
this as a high aggravation of his former offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and adjudging him most worthy to die
and perish in that his wilfull contempt, and
refusall of mercy. Thus standeth the case.
All the sonnes of men standing guilty before
God by reason of Adams sin, and their own,
and so obnoxious unto eternall death, it hath
pleased God out of his abundant grace and
mercy to grant a pardon to all those who

repenting of their sinns shall beleive on the
name of his <hi>Son.</hi> This <hi>pardon</hi> he holdeth forth
in the preaching of the Gospel. Now for any
to sleight this <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the offer of grace
and mercie in it, how can this be looked upon
but as the highest contempt, and greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
against the Majestie of God, and
as a dreadful addition to all other offences, so
calling for a proportionable weight of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

of them, we do not give God just cause to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
us with them. Considering that in this
case every of these mercies will be as so many
several aggravations of our ingratitude. This
is that which the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi>
tels King <hi>David, 2 Sam. 12. 7, 8.</hi> Where recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up the many favours he had done, and
was ready to do for him; how he had delivered
him out of the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> how be had set
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104496:117"/>
him upon the Throne of <hi>Israel,</hi> giving him his
Masters House and Wives, and the House of
<hi>Israel</hi> and of <hi>Iudah.</hi> And (saith he) <hi>if that had
been too little, I would moreover have given unto
thee such and such things;</hi> then he cometh to
expostulate the matter with him, why he should
so deal by his God as had done. <hi>Wherefore
hast thou despised the Commandement of the Lord,
to do evil in his sight?</hi> Thus God taketh the
sins of his favourites more unkindly then the
sins of any other. And therefore, is it so that
God hath indeared any of us to himself by any
special favours, wherein he hath preferred us
before others, let us be so much the more
watchful &amp; careful over our walkings, that so he
may never take up the like complaint against us,
as our <hi>Saviour</hi> here doth against <hi>Ierusalem; O
that thou, even thou</hi> shouldest do thus and thus!
This it was that <hi>David</hi> took most heinously,
that his favourites and familiars should prove
treacherous to him, <hi>Psal. 41. 9. Yea, mine own
familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat
of my bread, hath lift up his heel against me.]</hi>
Some of his Courtiers &amp; friends. Which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
applieth unto <hi>Iudas</hi>'s dealing with himself.
<hi>Ioh. 13. 18. He that eateth bread with me hath lift
up his heel against me.]</hi> This did exceedingly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
<hi>Iudas</hi>'s sin. Had some of the <hi>Scribes</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Pharisees</hi> done what he did, it had been no
strange thing. But that <hi>Iudas</hi> should do it; one
whom Christ had so far honoured as to admit
him to so near an attendance upon his person, to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104496:118"/>
make him one of his <hi>Privy Counsel</hi> (as it were)
this highly aggravated his offence. O take heed
lest the like aggravation lie against any of us.
And therefore, the more gracious God hath been
or shall be to any of us, let us be the more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the more watchful, the more careful to walk
worthy of his mercies. I have done with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of these Circumstances, these Aggravations.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the latter,<note place="margin">Second Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, from the time.</note> which is taken
from the <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>Season, [In this thy day.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> And what is here meant by <hi>Ierusalems
day?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. Day</hi> in Scripture it hath divers senses and
significations.<note place="margin">The word (Day) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> Literally and properly we meet
with a <hi>Natural</hi> day, and an <hi>Artificial</hi> day. The
one consisting of twenty four hours, the Suns
Revolution; the other of the time of light,
from morning to evening. Both which we finde
in that one verse, <hi>Gen. 1. 5. And God called the
light day, and the darkness he called night. And
the evening and the morning were the first day.</hi>
By the first understanding the <hi>Artificial day,</hi> by
the latter the <hi>Natural.</hi> But to let these pass as
nothing to our purpose.</p>
                  <p>Tropically and improperly the word is divers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used.</p>
                  <p>1. Sometimes for the <hi>time of mans life,</hi> that
space which he liveth upon earth. <hi>Your father
Abraham rejoyced to see my day</hi> (saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to the Jews) <hi>Iohn 8. 56.</hi> the time of my
manifestation in the flesh, and abode upon earth.
<hi>I must work the work of him that sent me whilest
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104496:118"/>
is day,</hi> John 9. 4. that is, whilest I live here
upon earth.</p>
                  <p>2. Sometimes it denotes the <hi>time of grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel.</hi> So the Apostle is conceived to
use the world <hi>Rom. 13. 12.</hi> where he saith, <hi>The
night is far spent, the day is at hand.]</hi> The <hi>night,</hi>
the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> which was a time of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Ignorance, wherein spiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
mysteries were all clouded and vailed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
shadows and figures. In opposition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the time of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is called, the <hi>Day,</hi>
in regard of the clear manifestation of the grace
of God, and of the mysterie of salvation to all
sorts, not onely to <hi>Iews</hi> but <hi>Gentiles,</hi> And so
that other Text of the same Apostle is looked
upon, <hi>1 Thes. 5. 5. Ye are the children of the day;</hi>
living in Gospel times. As also that other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
Text, <hi>Heb. 4. 7. To day if ye will hear
his voice,</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi> speaking of the time of
the Gospel, as it is there expounded.)</p>
                  <p>3. Sometimes it denotes any special <hi>opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
apt and proper <hi>season</hi> for any transaction.
So that forenamed Text may be understood,
<hi>Iohn 9. 4. I must work whilest it is day;</hi> that is,
whilest I have opportunity. And so that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>To day if ye will hear his voice;</hi> whilest
the time and season of grace lasteth, whilest sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is offered.</p>
                  <p>4. And lastly, by <hi>Day</hi> sometimes we are to
understand a <hi>set time</hi> determined and appointed
by God for some special purpose. In this sense we
find the word frequently used by the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:104496:119"/>
And in these two last senses understand we the
word here in the Text.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ierusalems</hi> Day, what, the time of special grace.</note> 
                     <hi>Ierusalems Day</hi> was the
time destinated and foreappointed by God,
and foretold by the Prophets, wherein the light
of the Gospel should shine forth unto her, and
that more clearly then ever heretofore, and the
offer of grace and mercy should be held forth
unto her after a special manner. Of this <hi>day,</hi>
this time, the Prophets make frequent mention.
As the Prophet <hi>Isai.</hi> Chap. 60. 1. <hi>Arise, shine</hi>
(or <hi>be enlightned) for thy light is come, and the
glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.</hi> So Zachary
<hi>9. 9. Rejoyce greatly O daughter of Sion, for thy
King cometh unto thee.</hi> Both which had their
accomplishment in the coming of Christ in the
flesh; and particularly in his coming to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
at this time, in this manner, presenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to it as a <hi>King.</hi> So he himself applies the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of these Texts, <hi>Matth. 21. 4, 5.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
is this here called <hi>Ierusalems day;</hi> the day
that had been so often foretold; the time
wherein God did offer grace and mercy to her
after a more special manner then ever he had
done heretofore. Before he had often made of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of that kind unto her (as to the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jews) by sending his <hi>Prophets</hi> to
her. But now he doeth it by his <hi>Son.</hi> So our
Saviour sets it forth in that known parable of
the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> Matth. 21. 33, &amp;c. <hi>A certain man
planted a vineyard.]</hi> This <hi>vineyard</hi> was the
<hi>Church of the Iews</hi> (Isaiah 5. 1.) whom God
took to be a peculiar people to himself, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104496:119"/>
like offices thereunto that the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
would do to his vineyard. Being thus
planted he <hi>let it forth to husbandmen, and went
himself into a far Countrey;]</hi> God seemed to
leave that Church wholly to the care of the
<hi>Priests.</hi> In process of time he <hi>sends his servants
to the husbandmen, that they might receive the
fruits thereof,</hi> verse 34.] God sends his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
to this Church, whom (by the Parable
goeth on) <hi>they beat and slew,</hi> vers. 35. So they
did the former Prophets many of them. <hi>Againe
he sent other servants, moe then the first, and they
did unto them likewise,</hi> verse 36. Before the
Captivity he sent more Prophets to them then
formerly, who found no better entertainment
then the former. <hi>But last of all he sent unto
them his son,</hi> verse 37. God the Father sends
his Son <hi>Christ</hi> into the world, with a special
messuage unto the Jews, to require from them
the fruits of all that grace and favour which
had been shewen to them. And this was <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salems
day.</hi> The time of special grace and
mercy offered unto them after a special manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that by Christ himself, wherein she had a
special opportunity tendered unto her, if she
had but had the wisdome to accept it, to lay
hold of it, <hi>and</hi> make use of it accordingly. Even
the <hi>time of her visitation,</hi> as the 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse after
the Text explains it.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>hinc illae lachrymae,</hi> this was a matter of
just lamentation. The <hi>day</hi> was come, and
even now spent, but <hi>Hierusalem</hi> had not an eye
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104496:120"/>
to see it, a heart to make use of it. And this it
is which our Saviour here bewailes in them, and
exprobrates to them; pities them for, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids
them with. <hi>O if thou, even thou hadst
known, at least in this thy day, the things which
belong unto thy peace.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

journey that ever I shall make unto thee, the
last time of asking, now at the day of grace and
salvation as to thee is expiring. If now at last
thou mightest yet know &amp;c. Thus our Saviour
here maketh use of this circumstance as a further
<hi>aggravation</hi> both of his <hi>sorrow,</hi> and their <hi>sin,</hi>
their <hi>stupidity</hi> and <hi>obstinacy;</hi> that in this <hi>day of
grace,</hi> wherein God was pleased to make such
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104496:120"/>
a gracious offer of mercy to them, they should
yet stand it out to the last, so neglecting and
letting slip the present opportunity, (as they
had done many other) by the imbracing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they might yet have been happy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So sad a thing it is for a people not to take notice
of the seasons of grace and mercy vouchsafed unto
them,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> for their spiritual and temporal felicity and
welfare,<note place="margin">Not to take notice of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of grace, a sad thing.</note> so as to make a wise use and improvement
of them.</hi> This our Saviour here so sadly lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And this we shall finde the
Lord elsewhere sadly complaining of in this
people, the people of the Jews. As <hi>Ieremy 8.
7. Yea the storke in the heavens knoweth her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
times, and the turtle, and the crane, and
the swallow observes the time of their coming, but
my people know not the judgments of the Lord.]</hi>
Those poor creatures, (with many other) meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a natural instinct, they observe the times
and seasons of the year, and so order their going
and coming accordingly; but that people <hi>knew
not the judgment of the Lord,</hi> they tooke no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the seasons of mercy and judgment; they
saw not the judgements of God hovering over
their heads, that so they might use timely
means for the diverting of them. And this the
Lord there chargeth upon them as gross stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And the like regardlesness of seasons and
opportunities, and the workings and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Providence, he elsewhere complains of
against them, for by the same Prophet, <hi>Ier. 5. 4.
Surely these are poor, they are foolish, for they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104496:121"/>
know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of
of their God.</hi> And by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> the
like, <hi>Isai. 5. 11, 12.</hi> Where he denounceth a
<hi>woe</hi> upon that people for not <hi>regarding the work
of the Lord; not considering the operation of his
hands;</hi> they had no regard of providential dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations;
no regard of times and seasons,
whether of mercy or judgment. This is a gross
and deplorable stupidity; a just ground both
of <hi>Lamentation</hi> and <hi>Exprobration.</hi> This is the
thing which our Saviour upbraideth the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi>
and <hi>Sadduces</hi> with. They were curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
of times and seasons in natural things,
but in spiritual and heavenly they were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stupid. So he telleth them, <hi>Matth. 16. 2, 3.
When it is evening ye say it will be fair weather,
because the skie is red, &amp;c.]</hi> They were very
observant of the usual prognosticks of fair or
foul weather, they could <hi>discern the face of the
skie. But</hi> (saith he) <hi>can ye not discern the signs
of the times.]</hi> They were not so wise as to take
notice of the choisest times and seasons, such as
that then was, being the time of the <hi>Messias</hi>
his comming unto them. So Saint <hi>Luke</hi> hath it
(as the <hi>Syriack</hi> also rendreth that of Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>)
Luke 12. 56. <hi>How is it that ye do not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
this time?]</hi> This time of grace, wherein
the promised <hi>Messia</hi> cometh unto you, whom
you profest to have so long looked and waited
for; and which the <hi>Prophets</hi> have so clearly
pointed out to you, and is now evidenced unto
you by so many manifest signs and tokens, as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104496:121"/>
were you not wilfully blinde, you could not
but see this to be that time. This he chargeth
them with, as grosse stupiditie. And so indeed
it is, when men shall not take notice of the
<hi>accepted time,</hi> the <hi>day of salvation;</hi> not see what
belongeth to their peace in <hi>their day,</hi> in the
times and seasons of Grace which God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
unto them.</p>
                  <p>Especially when God is pleased to manifest
and make known his minde and will to them
after a more clear and evident manner.<note place="margin">Especially when more clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ere in the Text. God had
made known to them the things belonging to
their peace formerly; he had sent his <hi>Prophets</hi>
to them from time to time for that purpose;
but now he did it more clearly, by send<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng his
<hi>Son</hi> to speak to them, to tender himself to
them in person. Now this rendred their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and contempt a great deal more heinous
and inexcusable; that <hi>even in this their day</hi>
they should not know, &amp;c. For them to have
been ignorant hereof at any time heretofore
under the <hi>Law,</hi> had been inexcusable, but
much more under the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Even as for men
to stumble in the <hi>twilight,</hi> it argueth heedles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
but much more to stumble at <hi>noon-day</hi>
(as the Prophet speaketh of <hi>Israel</hi> in another
sense, <hi>Isa. 59. 10).</hi> Thus where God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to afford men but a little light, (such as
that was under the <hi>Law,</hi> which Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
compareth to a <hi>Candle,</hi> a <hi>Light shining in a
dark place</hi> (as that place is by some expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104496:122"/>
                     <hi>2 Pet. 1. 19.</hi>) for men not to give heed
unto that light, and take notice of the minde
of God which is held forth by it, is a great
neglect; but when the <hi>day-star ariseth,</hi> a clear
light breaketh forth, such as <hi>Gospel-light</hi> is;
now for men to shut their eies against the
light, or not to make use of it by walking an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably
to it, this is an high contempt, of
which <hi>Calvin</hi> here saith rightly, <hi>Contemptum
manet severior vindicta;</hi> it hath a greater ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
waiting upon it, then if it were a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
neglect. That it is so, I presume, it will not
be questioned. Bring we it home by way of
<hi>Application,</hi> which I shall direct (as formerly)
onely by way of <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Exhortation.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>First by way of <hi>Conviction,</hi> how many are

They have not known,<note place="margin">A just Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to many.</note> they do not know,
even in <hi>this their day,</hi> the things that belong
to their peace. Not to speak of others; bring
we it home to our selves, and see whether the
charge do not lie too justly against many of
us. None of us but have had our <hi>Day,</hi> a day
of grace and salvation, a time which God
hath allotted unto us to look out for our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and eternal welfare; which to some of
us hath been a <hi>Summers-day,</hi> a long day. And
not onely a long, but a <hi>clear</hi> day wherein God
hath vouchsafed to us the means of grace and
salvation in a comfortable manner, causing
the light of his truth to shine forth most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto us. And yet how many of us are there
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104496:122"/>
of whom it may bee too truly said, That yet
<hi>even in this our day we have not known the things
which belong unto our peace,</hi> to our eternal
peace and happinesse. But still we remain in
our natural blindnesse, and ignorance, and
unbelief having made little or no improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of these precious times and means.</p>
                  <p>Nay, notwithstanding God hath come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some of us after a more special manner,
come near unto us in a more clear manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Will to us by some special provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
visiting us with special <hi>mercies,</hi> or
special <hi>chastisements,</hi> thereby calling us unto
Repentance, yet have we not <hi>known the time of
our visitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what stupiditie, what blindnesse, what
regardlesnesse, what wretchlesnesse is this?
A heavie aggravation of our <hi>sin</hi> for present,
and (if not timously prevented) of our <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
for future. So doth many a soul in hell
at this day finde and feel it; over whom (if it
would any waies profit or advantage them)
we might justly weep and lament, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
doth here in the Text; <hi>O! if they had
known in their day the things which belonged unto
their peace,</hi> how happie, how blessed might
they have been? But now how wretched, how
miserable? these things being now for ever
hid from their eies. Time was when they had
their <hi>Day,</hi> they had their time of grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they injoied the means of salvation, so as
had they but had the wisedom to have made
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104496:123"/>
use of them; happie, happie had they been to
all eternitie. But letting slip that time, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
those means, trifling away, that <hi>Day,</hi>
now the <hi>night</hi> is come upon them, even a
night of blacknesse and darknesse, an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
night, so as the <hi>Sun</hi> shall never rise
unto them again; they are put into a hopeless,
helpless and remediless condition. Not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
use of the <hi>light</hi> whilest they injoied it, they
are now (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith of the <hi>Apostate
Angels, 2 Pet. 2 4. Cast down to Hell, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

Now unto all such be it spoken in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

that they <hi>did</hi> not see, and through the latter

                  <p>1. This was hid from their eies, through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
their <hi>own wilfulnesse.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their own wilfulness.</note> They would not see
what belonged to their peace, their temporal
and eternal happinesse. Notwithstanding that
it had been clearly revealed and held forth
unto them, yet they shut their eies against the
Light. This is that which our Saviour char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
upon this people, the people of the Jews
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104496:129"/>
in that known place, <hi>Ioh. 3. 19. Light is come
into the world, but men loved darknesse rather
then light.</hi> So was it with the generalitie of
that Nation. <hi>Christ,</hi> who was the <hi>light of the
world,</hi> he was come into the world, and in
particular come unto them, declaring and
making known to them what belonged to
their peace. But they <hi>loved darknesse,</hi> the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>ignorance,</hi> preferring it before
the heavenly light of Divine Truth, which
shone forth unto them. Such was their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie,
that they even closed their eies, and
would not see. So our Saviour himself sets it
forth, <hi>Mat. 13. 14.</hi> where citing the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> he sheweth how it
was verified in that people of the <hi>Iews</hi> in his
time. <hi>In them</hi> (saith he) <hi>is fulfilled the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
of the prophet Isaias, which saith, Behold,
hearing yee shall hear, and shall not understand;
and seeing yee shall see, and shall not perceive.</hi>
(though they daily heard the Word, &amp; saw the
Works of Christ with their bodily ears &amp; eies,
yet they did not believe him, or in him). How
so? The reason followeth in the next verse.
<hi>For this peoples heart is waxed gross, and their
ears are dull of hearing, and their eies they have
closed; left they should at any time see with their
eies, and hear with their ears, and understand
with their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Such was the wilful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie
of that people, that they even stopped
their ears against the <hi>Word</hi> of Christ, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their eies against his <hi>Works,</hi> they would
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104496:129"/>
not see what belonged to their peace; and in
this way it came to be <hi>hid from their eies.</hi> And
this our Saviour here taketh up as a iust mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Lamentation</hi> to him, and <hi>Exprobration</hi> to
them; bewailing them for it, and upbraiding
them with it.</p>
                  <p>And so it is,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> 
                     <hi>Wilful ignorance is a matter of
just Lamentation,<note place="margin">Wilful ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sad and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing.</note> and Exprobration to a people.</hi> So
our Saviour here taketh notice of it in <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
But now these things are hid from thine eye.
Hoc non dicitur ad levandam Hierosolymae cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam</hi>
(saith <hi>Calvin</hi> upon it.) our Saviour doth
not speake this any wayes to <hi>excuse,</hi> or <hi>exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
Ierusalem</hi>'s <hi>fault,</hi> but to aggravate and
highten it. Such is <hi>wilfull</hi> and <hi>affected igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
True indeed, as for <hi>simple</hi> ignorance,
where men are ignorant through the want of
the meanes of knowledge, that excuseth a <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tô,</hi>
in part. <hi>The servant which not knowing
his Masters will, did commit things worthy of
stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes</hi> (saith our
Saviour in the Parable) <hi>Luke 12. 48.</hi> In as
much as he should have known it, and might
have known it, had he enquired after it,
(which he ought to have done,) therefore his
ignorance doth not wholly excuse him, yet
being an extenuation of his fault, it is so also
of his punishment. <hi>Simple ignorance</hi> of the
minde and wil of God as concerning what we
do or beleive, is no just plea for any, no just

And by reason hereof these things were now

yet for all that they walk in darkness; the

Mark it. This is the Observation which this
passage naturally yieldeth us: <hi>Daies of Grace
have their dates.</hi> Times and seasons, wherein
the Grace and Mercie of GOD is offered and
tendered to the Sons of men for their acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance;
they are limited, they have their
terms and boundaries, beyond which they
shall not extend. Hence is it that they are
called by the name of <hi>Daies. If thou hadst
known in this thy day].</hi> Now a <hi>Day</hi> is a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
time. However there are <hi>Winter-daies</hi>
and <hi>Summer-daies,</hi> some shorter, others long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
yet each is limited and measured by the
motion of the Sun. And so are the <hi>Seasons of
Grace</hi> which God vouchsafeth unto the Sons
of men upon earth: though some are longer
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104496:134"/>
then others, yet all limited, all determined by
God. What the Prophet <hi>Habakuk</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aith of
<hi>Prophetical Vision, Hab. 2. 3. The Vision is for
an appointed time,</hi> the same may be said of
these gracious dispensations, the offers and
tenders of grace and mercie; they are for an
appointed time. <hi>Daies of Grace have their
dates,</hi> their limits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> So have both <hi>National</hi> and <hi>Personal</hi> daies
1. <hi>National daies,</hi> wherein God offers mercie
to communities of men,<note place="margin">Nationall days.</note> these are limited. So it
was we know with the <hi>old world,</hi> concerning
which we may hear God declaring his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>Gen. 6. 3. My spirit shall not ever strive
with man, for that he also is flesh, yet his dates
shall be an hundred and twentie years.</hi> A long
time God had striven with the men of that
generation. He had so done, and that both
<hi>outwardly</hi> and <hi>inwardly. Outwardly,</hi> as by his
<hi>Works,</hi> so by his <hi>Word,</hi> which was preached to
them by <hi>Noah,</hi> whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a <hi>Preacher,</hi> or publisher of
<hi>Righteousnesse;</hi> of the righteous judgments of
God in case they should not repent, to which
in the name of God he perswaded them. By
him it was that <hi>Christ went and preached to the
spirits in prison</hi> (as the same Apostle hath it)
1 <hi>Pet. 3. 19.</hi> This he did by the Ministerie of
<hi>Noah,</hi> or some others, who were inspired by
him; In and by them he preached to the men
of that generation, who were then alive, but
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104496:134"/>
at this time, when <hi>Peter</hi> wrote that Epistle,
<hi>dead,</hi> and their <hi>spirits,</hi> their souls (many of
them) in the prison of Hell. And besides
this Outward striving by his Word, he did
also strive with them <hi>Inwardly</hi> by the inward
motions and operations of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and urging their consciences to Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Repentance. Thus he had striven
with them, and that long, but he will not
ever so do. <hi>My Spirit shall not ever strive with
Man].</hi> And thereupon hee limits them a
time for their Repentance: <hi>The daies of Man
shall be an hundred and twentie years].</hi> Not that
the time of man's life should not afterwards
exceed that number of years, for we finde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
after the Flood living much longer; but
so long should their day of grace and mercie
last. So long a time out of his gracious indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
God would yet allow to that generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to bethink themselvs, to reform their
hearts and lives in; which if once past and
not improved for the end to which it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
them, then they must look for no more
mercie, but a deluge of vengeance should
sweep them off from the face of the earth. To
this I might subjoin that of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> which
had her <hi>fortie daies,</hi> and no more allowed
unto her for the same end. <hi>Fortie daies and
Nineveh shall be destroied, Ion. 3. 4. viz.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
within that time they repented, which
condition God reserved to himself. Thus there
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104496:135"/>
is a time appointed and determined by God,
which though he do not declare to others, yet
he hath set down with himself, how long hee
will strive with a Nation, a people, how long
he will wait for their Repentance; which
time being past, then the date of mercie is out.
So it was with <hi>Ierusalem</hi> here; she had had
her <hi>Day,</hi> a day of grace, and that a long day;
wherein she might have seen what belonged
to her peace, but that day being now spent,
<hi>Now these things are hid from her eies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. And as Nationall so <hi>Personall</hi> dayes.
The times and seasons allotted unto particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
persons,<note place="margin">Personall days.</note> for their accepting the offers of
grace and mercie held forth unto them, these
also are limited. So is not onely the <hi>Common</hi>
and <hi>Generall</hi> day; The time of this life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which the tenders of mercie do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.
<hi>Now is the accepted time,<note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall day, the time of this life.</note> now is the day of
salvation</hi> (saith the <hi>Apostle, 2 Cor. 6. 2.</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as he is conceived) of the time of this
life). This is the <hi>day of grace.</hi> If this day be
gone, mercy is gone. As for those who have
here abused the patience and long sufferance
of God, not considering that it should have
led them to repentance; so fleighting the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of Mercie, let them look for nothing but
Justice hereafter. That rich <hi>Glutton</hi> who
would not out of his abundance spare poor
<hi>Lazarus</hi> a crum of bread, being in hell may
call and crie for a drop of water to cool his
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104496:135"/>
tongue with, and yet go without it. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of Grace and Mercie are onely so long
as this day of grace lasteth, during this life.
If this be gone, then <hi>as the tree falleth</hi> (towards
heaven or hell) <hi>so it lieth.</hi> Death closing up
the eies of impenitent sinners, then are the
things which belong to their peace, their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
for ever hid from them.</p>
                  <p>But also <hi>Particular daies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Particular days.</note> particular times
and seasons, and that during this life. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
such times and seasons there are: As
there are appointed times for all other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>To every thing there is a season, and a time
to every pupose under heaven,</hi> (saith the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher)
<hi>Eccl. 3. 1.</hi> So it is to things <hi>Natural;</hi>
however to us they may be <hi>Casual,</hi> and in
themselvs <hi>Contingent,</hi> or it may be <hi>Voluntarie,</hi>
left to the will of man; yet they are all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
as for other circumstances, so for
the <hi>time,</hi> and that by God, who doth by his
Providence order and limit them for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining,
duration, ending. And surely so it is
in things <hi>supernatural;</hi> he who hath thus
bounded and limited all other things upon
earth, hath not left his own gracious dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
<hi>sine die,</hi> at an uncertaintie; but hee
hath also set down with himself a day, a time
for them, beyond which they shall not extend;
so as if that be expired, there is no more room
for mercie. The truth of this we may see in
those <hi>Rebellious murmurers</hi> amongst the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites.</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:104496:136"/>
A long time God striveth with them.
<hi>Fortie years long was</hi> I <hi>grieved with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
(as the Psalmist hath it) <hi>Psal. 95. 10.</hi>
All that time they <hi>tempted God, and proved him,
and saw his works</hi> (as the Apostle goeth on)
<hi>Heb. 3. 9.</hi> So long experience they had of
the gracious presence of God in the midst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, manifesting his power and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in delivering, protecting of them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for them, yet they tempted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, not believing what he had said unto
them, nor yet so considering what he had done
for them, as to trust in him, and rest upon his
Providence. Thus did they <hi>err in their hearts,
not knowing the waies</hi> of their God (as it there
followeth, <hi>ver. 10.</hi>) Now herewith the Lord
was (as well he might be) <hi>grieved,</hi> offended,
provoked, yet bearing with them; but so hee
would not ever do. Having born it so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

years, then he will bear it no longer; [<hi>So I
sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into my
rest,</hi> ver. 11.] They should never come into
the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land which he had
promised unto <hi>Abraham</hi> as a resting place for
his Posteritie. Which sentence was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
executed upon those <hi>murmurers,</hi> whose
<hi>carkases fell in the wildernesse</hi> (as it followeth

<hi>Ioshua,</hi> (as you have it foretold <hi>Numb. 14.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104496:136"/>
29, 30.).</hi> So was it with them as to the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Canaan,</hi> and so shall it be with all obstinate
and obdurate sinners as to the <hi>Heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
that eternal rest (whereof the earthly

                  <p>Which he doth,<note place="margin">The door of mercy sometimes shut in this life.</note> and that (as I said) often
<hi>in this life.</hi> We know how it was with <hi>Esau,</hi>
that <hi>profane Esau,</hi> so stigmatized and branded
by the Apostle, <hi>Heb. 12. 16.</hi> for his so far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
of that high privilege of his <hi>primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture,</hi>
his <hi>Birthright,</hi> to which was anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as to sell it for a <hi>morsel of

he came to make suit for it, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
So you have it in the verse following,
<hi>ver. 17. For yee know</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>how
that afterwards when he would have inherited
the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place
for repentance, though he sought it carefully
with tears.</hi> Thus however before he sleightly
esteemed that privilege, yet being better advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
upon second thoughts, he seeketh it, &amp; that
earnestly, but all in vain, <hi>For he found no place
for repentance; viz.</hi> in his Father <hi>Isaac,</hi> who
had conferred that blessing upon his other
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104496:137"/>
Son <hi>Iacob;</hi> he could not with all his tears
move him to repent of what he had done, so
as to recall his grant, and confer the blessing
upon him. Herein was he a <hi>Type</hi> of profane
obstinate sinners, who sleight and despise the
grace of God when it is offered and tendered
unto them. Afterwards it may be, when
God cometh to open their eies, to awaken
their consciences, and to convince them of
what they have done, and to discover to them
the miserie of that state wherein they are, then
they seek and crie for mercie, and yet go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; the <hi>Decree</hi> then (as it were) falling
in travel, and begining to <hi>bring forth</hi> (as the
Prophet speaketh, <hi>Zeph. 2. 2.</hi>) the door of
mercie is shut against them:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R.</hi> Which God doth (as I sayd) in his <hi>most

have refused to hear him. So <hi>wisdom</hi> sets it

<hi>Prov. 1. 24. Because I have called and ye have

When your fear cometh as desolation, and your

they shall seek me early, but shall not find me.</hi>
ver. 28. 29. A just retaliation and requital,
that whilest men shall let <hi>Iesus Christ stand

tells the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> that he did
<hi>Rev. 3. 20</hi>) and yet not let him in, that he
should shut the door against them, so as
though they knock, yet they shall finde no

                  <p>Obj. 1. <hi>But is not this directly contrary

                     <hi>viz.</hi> to his <hi>Disciples,</hi>
such as had received him, and believed on

audience and acceptance at all times. Being
<hi>favorites of heaven</hi> they have alwaies free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
to the <hi>Throne of grace,</hi> so as they
may come thither at all times with <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
and <hi>boldness</hi> (as the Appostle exhorts

privilege purchased for them by the <hi>blood of
Christ</hi> (as the same Apostle sheweth,
<hi>Heb. 10. 19.</hi>) But not so others. Not so
rebellious and obstinate sinners. What have
they to do to take the name of God into
their mouthes, by invocating of him? seeing
they are such as hate to be reformed. What
have they to do to presse upon the throne of
grace, who are despisers of it, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> But (Secondly) this <hi>Promise</hi> must be
looked upon not as <hi>Absolute,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> but as <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">God must be sought in due time.</note>
admitting of many restrictions and
limitations. Among other, of <hi>time.</hi> They
who would seek God so as he may be
found, they must seek him <hi>timely,</hi> whilest he
may be found. So the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
directs <hi>the Iewes. Seek ye the Lord whilest
he may be found.</hi> Isai. 55. 6. with which
agrees that of the <hi>Psalmist, Psalm. 32. 6.
For this shall every one pray unto thee, in a
time when thou maiest be found:</hi> Tempore
inveniendi, <hi>in a time of Finding.</hi> Clearly
intimating, that there may be a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God, though he be sought, yet will not
be found. This is that he tells the <hi>Iews,
Isai. 1. 15. When ye spread forth your hands,
I will hide mine eyes from you, and when ye
make many prayers, I will not hear.</hi> Not
hear them when they pray; no, nor yet
hear others praying for them. So the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104496:138"/>
Lord telleth his Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> upon
that account willing him to surcease his
intercession, on their behalfe. <hi>Therefore
pray not for this people, neither lift up crie, nor
praier for them, neither make intercession to
me, for I will not hear thee,</hi> Jer. 7. 16. And
elsewhere he tells the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that Land, <hi>Though these three men,
Noah, Daniel, and Iob were in it, they should
deliver but their own souls,</hi> Ezek. 14. 14, 20.
So irrevocable is the sentence which God
somtimes passeth upon obstinate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
sinners, such as have despised his
grace and mercie, that all means used for
the procuring and gaining his favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

<hi>Vineyard,</hi> the people of the <hi>Iews,</hi> Isaiah 5.
ver. 6. <hi>I will also command the cloudes,
that they rain no rain upon it.</hi> That
is, (as some safely, if not somewhat
too curiously, expound it), the means
of grace and salvation should not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
unto that people as formerly. He
would be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

take away their <hi>Teachers.</hi> Which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he did; as may be collected from
that <hi>Promise</hi> which the same <hi>Prophet</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to the Church, <hi>Isaiah, 30. 20. Though
the Lord give you the bread of adversitie, and
the water of affliction, yet shall not thy tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
be removed into a corner any more, but
thine eyes shall see thy teachers.</hi> So it had
been with that people. <hi>Prophets</hi> had been
very scarce among them. So much we may
take notice of from that of the <hi>Psalmist,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104496:140"/>
Psal. 74. 9.</hi> where the Church lying
under a sad desolation, is brought
in complaining; <hi>We see not our signes,
there is no more any Prophet, neither
is there a-mong us any that knoweth
how long.</hi> They wanted their <hi>Seers</hi>
(as the Prophets sometimes are
called). And by this meanes were
the things which belonged to their
peace hid from their eyes.</p>
                  <p>And by a like means came they
here to be hid from <hi>Ierusalems;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Means of grace with-drawn from Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</note> by
withdrawing those means of grace
from them which formerly they had
injoied. Christ himself being taken
away, he also ordered his Apostles
after a while to withdraw from them.
So much is insinuated in that Parable
of the <hi>Mariage feast,</hi> where the first guests
that were invited, though sollicited
by messenger after messenger, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to come, the servants are then
ordered by the Master of the Feast
to go into the <hi>High-waies,</hi> and
<hi>Hedges,</hi> and <hi>By-lanes,</hi> and to bid
new guests, as the <hi>Evangelists</hi> have it,
<hi>Mat. 22. 9. Luke. 14. 21. 23.</hi> The
meaning of the Parable seems to
be obvious. This <hi>Marriage</hi> is the
marriage betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104496:141"/>
                     <hi>Church.</hi> The first invited guests were
the <hi>Iews;</hi> to whom God sends his
servants one after another; first
the <hi>Prophets,</hi> then <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi>
with the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Disciples</hi> of
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> who perswaded them to
come and receive <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
and to have Communion with him:
but they refusing, the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
with their <hi>Successors,</hi> are afterwards
sent to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
sometimes after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Ascension, came to passe.
For however at the first, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Masters direction, they
applied themselves onely to the
Jewes, yet afterwards finding them
<hi>unworthie,</hi> and being rejected by
them, they <hi>shook off the dust of
their feet against them,</hi> turning to
the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
expresly tell them, <hi>Act. 13. 46.</hi>
When they heard the Jewes <hi>contradicting</hi>
them, and <hi>blaspheming</hi> their doctrine,
<hi>Then they waxed bold</hi> (saith the Text)
<hi>and said, It was necessarie that the Word
of God should first have been spoken unto
you; but seeing you put it from you, and
judge your selves unworthie of eternal life,
lo wee turn to the Gentiles, for so hath
the Lord commanded us.</hi> Thus when
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104496:141"/>
men do abuse the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
Christ often <hi>removeth the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick,</hi>
(as hee threatens the Church
of <hi>Ephesus, Revel. 2. 5.</hi>) taketh
away that light, taketh away his
<hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and so
leaveth them in the darke, by
which meanes the things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their peace are hid from their
eies, and that through the want of
<hi>means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. But (<hi>Secondly</hi>) sometimes the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
means are injoyed, but <hi>the Spirit is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">With-holding the Spirit.</note>
not accompanying, not going along
with the meanes. Even as the <hi>Church</hi>
complaineth <hi>Psal. 44. 9.</hi> that <hi>God
did not go forth with her Armies.</hi> Her
Armies went forth; but God did not
go forth with them, as formerly, to
direct, assist, blesse, and prosper them,
to make them victorious. Thus God
sometimes sends forth his <hi>Ministers,</hi>
but hee doth not go forth with them;
hee doth not accompany his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
with his Spirit. This is that
which the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> complaineth
of; hee lift up his voice like a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
hee spared not to his dutie, <hi>But
who hath believed our report, to whom
is the arme of the Lord revealed,</hi> Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104496:142"/>
53. 1. His Ministerie was for the
most part ineffectual; few there were
that were wrought upon by it, <hi>Hee
had</hi> (as elswhere hee bemoans it, <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah
49. 4.) even laboured in vain, and
spent his strength for nought:</hi> Now
whence was this? Why God did not
concurr with him by the efficacious
work of his Spirit; hee did not put
forth his power, <hi>reveal his Arme,</hi>
hence was it that his indeavours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
so ineffectual to the greatest
part. And thus God is pleased some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to enervate his Ordinances, by
withdrawing his presence from them.
Even as it was in <hi>Ezekiels Vision,</hi> hee
saw the <hi>Glorie of the God of Israel go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up from the Cherub to the threshold
of the house,</hi> Ezekiel 9. <hi>Verse 3.</hi>
The <hi>Cherub</hi> stood still in his place,
but the <hi>glorie</hi> was departed, God had
withdrawn his presence from it. Thus
<hi>Ordinances</hi> may bee continued, and
yet the <hi>Spirit</hi> withdrawn, whereby
they become ineffectual. So as though
the light shine forth unto men, yet
wanting that <hi>Spirit of Illumination</hi>
which should open their eies, and let
that light into their hearts, they still
remain in the dark. So fared it with
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104496:142"/>
the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees;</hi> though the
mysterie of Salvation was as clearly
held forth unto them as unto others,
yet whilest others saw it, it was hid
from them. How so? Why this was
God's work, to put a differencee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the one and the other. So
much our Saviour taketh notice of,
and acknowledgeth, <hi>Matth. 11. 25.
I thank thee Father, Lord of heaven and
earth</hi> (or, <hi>I confesse unto thee,</hi> or, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
before thee, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
(or that) <hi>thou hast hid these
things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them unto Babes.</hi> The
same <hi>Word</hi> was preached by the same
persons unto both, but it had not
the same effect in both. To the
simpler sort of persons, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of weak apprehensions, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unlearned and ignorant, very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in understanding, the mysteries
of eternall Salvation were clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by the Ministerie of Christ and
his Apostles; but not so to the <hi>wise</hi> and
<hi>prudent,</hi> great and learned Clerks, men
wise in their own and others opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi>
were. To them were these things hid.
Now whence was this? Why God
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104496:143"/>
did not co-operate with the <hi>Word</hi> as
to them; hee did not work upon
their mindes by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> by which
means the Word became ineffectual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Again (in the Third place), God
coucurreth in hiding these things from
the eies of men,<note place="margin">Blinding the eye and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heart.</note> not onely in <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
or <hi>Privative,</hi> but also after a sort
in a <hi>Positive</hi> way. Not onely by not
opening their eies and hearts, but by
<hi>blinding</hi> and <hi>hardning</hi> them. So it was
with this people, the people of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> as our Saviour also taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, giving this as a reason why
they did not believe, <hi>Iohn 12. 39, 40.
Therefore they could not believe,</hi> (saith
hee) <hi>because Isaias said again, He hath
blinded their eies, and hardned their
hearts, that they should not see with their
eies, and understand with their hearts,
and bee converted, and I should heal
them.</hi> Thus dealt God with that
people, justly punishing their wilful
obstinacie, by giving them up unto a
reprobate sence, to a spiritual blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and obduracie. In as much as
they had first blinded themselves, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their own eies against the light
<hi>[Their eies they have closed]</hi> (so
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104496:143"/>
Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it, <hi>Matth, 13, 5.</hi>
As also the Apostle, <hi>Act. 28. 27.</hi>) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God in his just judgment blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them. They blinded themselves
first, they would not see, therefore
God in his justice blindeth them, that
they should not see: So giving them
up to spiritual blindnesse; which (as
that Apostle tells us) still resteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that people untill this day. <hi>I
would not, brethren, that yee should bee
ignorant, that blindnesse in part is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to Israel, untill the fulnesse of the
Gentiles be come in,</hi> Rom 11. 25. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>Blindnesse,</hi> or <hi>Hardnesse</hi> (for the
word signifieth both) is happened <hi>[in
part],</hi> unto the greatest part, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie
of that Nation; insomuch
that they do not, nay, till the time
appointed be come, they shall not see
the things which belong to their peace.
This is the reason which the same
Apostle giveth, why those of that
Nation did not see what was so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
held forth unto them in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospel, 2. <hi>Cor. 3. 14. Their
mindes were blinded, there was a veil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their hearts</hi> (as the next <hi>ver.</hi> hath it).
God hath given them up in his just
judgment for their contempt of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104496:144"/>
means of grace to a fearful excera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and obduration, blinding their
eies, and hardning their hearts. Thus
the Lord is said to have done <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs,
Exod. 4. 21.</hi> And the like is
said of <hi>Sihon</hi> King of <hi>Heshbon,</hi> that
refused to let <hi>Israel</hi> passe by him,
<hi>Deuteronom. 2. 30. The Lord thy God
hardned his spirit, and made his heart
obstinate, that he might deliver him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy hand.</hi> This hee did, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by with-holding his grace from
them, but by delivering them up
unto the perversnesse of their own
spirits, and to Satan, to bee acted
by him unto their ruine and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And after the like manner
may God bee said to have hardned
the hearts of this people, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> not onely by
with-holding his <hi>Spirit</hi> from them,
but also giving them up unto their
own <hi>hearts lusts</hi> (as the Psalmist)
hath it, <hi>Psal. 81. 11, 12. My people
would not hearken unto my voice, and
Israel would none of mee, So I gave
them up to their own hearts lusts;</hi> (or,
as the margin readeth it, to the
<hi>hardnesse of their hearts) and they
walked in their own counsels),</hi> and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104496:144"/>
to the power of <hi>Satan</hi> to bee acted
by him, to bee blinded and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by him. Yea, even giving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to his <hi>Word</hi> to have such an
accidental effect upon them; even
as the <hi>Sun</hi> hath upon the <hi>Clay,</hi> to
harden it. So much wee may learn
from that Text of the Prophet <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
cited by our Saviour, <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah
6. ver. 9, 10.</hi> Where the Lord
giving him his Commission to go
unto that people, hee bids him
(or rather foretelleth him what
hee should do) that hee should
make their heart fat. <hi>Make thou
the heart of this people fat, and
make their ears heavie, and shut their
eies, &amp;c.</hi> Now how should hee do
this? Why onely by preaching the
Word to them. But what then,
had the Word any such proper O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of it self? Not so: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had the Prophet any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
in the preaching of it; but
through their obstinate tempers it
become so to them, an occasion of
their further blinding and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
God in his just judgment <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>
and <hi>ordering</hi> that his Word
should have such a direfull effect
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104496:145"/>
upon them, as that they should
grow worse and worse by it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they should attain to that
height of impenitencie, as should
bee irrecoverable. This it is, The
<hi>Word</hi> will have it work, one way
or other, beeing (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith) <hi>the savour of life, or
of death, 2 Corinth. 2, 16.</hi> Where
it doth not open and clear the
eye, it will close and blinde
it: Where it doth not soften
the heart, it will harden it. And
in this way, and by this means
doth God in his most righteous
Judgment, <hi>hide from the eyes of
men the things which belong to
their peace,</hi> which they have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to see.</p>
                  <p>To these I might adde,<note place="margin">Sending false teachers.</note> his
sending of <hi>False Teachers</hi> among

as my prayers have been and shall be, so my

yet let me shew you what two just causes of fear

hath had, and some of them within our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorie,
seasons and opportunities, which had

content my self with generalities. Onely taking
notice of that long <hi>day of grace</hi> and mercy which
this Nation hath had; during which the light
of the Gospel hath shone forth to it, and that in
so clear and glorious a manner as (I suppose
without flatterie I may speak it) it hath not done
to any other nation under heaven. Now, have

some that cryed <hi>Hosanna to the Sonne of David,
Hosanna in the highest,</hi> Matth. 21. 9, 15. But
how is it with the greatest part? do not they

                  </p>
                  <p>Specially if it be considered to what a height
this disaffection is at this day improved,<note place="margin">Disaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the persons and Calling of Ministers a sad prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostick.</note> and risen
even to the disclaiming and crying down of the
<hi>Ministery</hi> it self. So is it with some, and not a
few. They are growen disaffected, not onely to
the <hi>persons</hi> of Ministers, but even to their <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
and <hi>calling,</hi> disclaiming that as <hi>Antichristian.</hi>
Thus are the <hi>feet</hi> of them who <hi>bring glad tidings
of peace,</hi> which sometimes were, and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are <hi>beautifull,</hi> now become in the eyes of
many black and deformed. A sad symptome.
So it was in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> of which we read, 2 <hi>Chr.
36. 16. The Lord God of their fathers sent to them
by his Messengers rising up betimes, and sending
them, because he had compassion on his people, on his
dwelling place; But they mocked the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of God, and despised his words, and misused
his Prophets, untill the wrath of the Lord rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his people, till there was no remedy,</hi> (no
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104496:147"/>
                     <hi>Healing.</hi>) This made their disease incurable,
and the wrath of God implacable. When sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
being distracted, shall flye in the faces of
their Physitians, and there be none to bind them,
what hope of Cure can there be? This was <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalems</hi>
case, as the Parable sets it forth,
<hi>Matth. 21. 33. God</hi> the great <hi>Householder,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>planted a Vineyard,</hi> (the <hi>Jewish Church</hi>) and
let it forth to <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> (so the <hi>Priests</hi>) he
sends his <hi>servants,</hi> some after other, to <hi>receive
the fruites thereof,</hi> (his <hi>Prophets</hi> former and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to require that people to bring forth fruits
meet for repentance) but they <hi>beat one, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
another, and stoned another,</hi> (so did they use
the Prophets) Hereupon he sendeth his <hi>sonne</hi>
(Christ himself) who met with the like usage.
Now what followeth hereupon? That you may
hear first from the mouthes of the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to whom our Saviour here propoundeth
this Parable, making them judges in the cause,
that so he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demn them out of their own
mouthes, <hi>They say unto him he will miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
these wicked men, and will let out his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
to other husbandmen, which shall render him
the fruites in their season,</hi> v. 41. which afterwards
you find explained and applyed by our Saviour
to themselves, <hi>v. 43. Therefore I say unto you the
Kingdome of God shall be taken from you, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to a Nation bringing forth the fruit thereof.</hi>
When the Ministers of God come to meet with
such intertainment, and that for doing their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
it is a sad presage that the Kingdome of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104496:147"/>
God, the Gospel shall not long continue there,
and that Judgment is not far from such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Upon this account our Saviour looketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Jerusalems</hi> condition as desperate. <hi>O Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and
stonest them which are sent unto thee; How often
would I have gathered thy children together,
as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings, and ye would not. Behold your house
is left unto you desolate.</hi> Matthew 23. 37, 38.
Here is a first <hi>Prognostick</hi> and that a sad
one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. Let a second be that which I have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
named and touched upon already.<note place="margin">Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mean taking away his Ministers, who are said to
be <hi>the light of the world.</hi> Thus was it done to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
And whether this be in any degree ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to this Nation or no, I shall leave it to
those who are privie to the present state of it,
to judge. Of late how many able and faithfull
Ministers taken away? Now when a Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to call away his <hi>Ambassadours,</hi> it is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
looked upon as a <hi>Passing-bell</hi> to the peace of
that Nation.</p>
                  <p>Repl. But howsoever (it may be said) some
be by <hi>Providence</hi> taken away, yet others by
the like providence are substituted in their
roomes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> True it may be in some places,<note place="margin">Many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of true Gospel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> but not
so in all. Some <hi>Candlesticks</hi> there are at this day,
(and I suppose not a few,) destitute of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles;</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:104496:148"/>
not well knowing where to find a supply.</p>
                  <p>Again, as for those which are thus substituted
by the <hi>providence</hi> of God, are they also all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by his Ordinance? Are there not some
(and not a few) <hi>Ambassadours without their
commission?</hi> men running before they are sent;
not called nor impowred to do any Ministeriall
act, which yet (<hi>Vzziah</hi> like) they attempt to
do; that not onely to preach, (which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
will tell us none can do except they be <hi>sent,</hi>
Rom. 10. 15. <hi>speak</hi> they may, but not <hi>Preach,</hi>
which is an <hi>act of office</hi>) but also (some of them)
to administer the <hi>Seales,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> And
by this means the Church in many places co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be deprived of an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> upon which
all other publick Ordinances have a dependance;
I mean of a true <hi>Gospell Ministerie,</hi> with which
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath promised his special counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. To this add (in the third place) that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> where means are continued, yet is not the <hi>Spirit
withdrawen?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Spirit with draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the means.</note> So was it with <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> they
injoyed Ordinances, but there was no life in
them; the <hi>Glorie of the Lord was gone up from the
Cherub.</hi> And is it not so in many parts of this
Nation at this day. <hi>Ordinances</hi> remain, but is
not the <hi>glorie</hi> of the Lord departed from them?
where is that life, where is that power, which
heretofore appeared in them? God hath yet his
<hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>Prophets,</hi> many faithfull and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Ministers, who may be looked upon as the
<hi>Chariots and Horsemen of Israel,</hi> but he doth not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104496:148"/>
go forth with these his Armies as formerly, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such successe unto the labours of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
as heretofore he hath done. How is it that
in many places where the word is purely and
powerfully preached, there are such thin Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as there are (specially upon the week daies)
in comparison of what they have been, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to come, not willing to lend an eare to
any but their own; others neglecting to come
out of an irreligious prophanesse: and among
those that do come, yet how few constant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
attendants upon this Ordinance? A
plain evidence that this ordinance hath lost much
of that respect, as also of that power that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it hath had.</p>
                  <p>And what I say of the word, I may also apply
it to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords
Supper.</hi> Which though held forth in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and most comfortable way of Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
according to <hi>Christs Institution,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
primitive practise,</hi> yet how is it by many
fleighted and neglected? So as those who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
were wont to come (as it now seemeth)
for <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>fashion,</hi> being now left to themselves,
will not come for <hi>love.</hi> The <hi>feast</hi> is prepared, and
the <hi>Guests</hi> invited, but they find some <hi>excuse</hi> or
other to keep them away. A thing which I wish
there were not too just cause to complain of
even in this place. Now surely, among other,
this is also a sad token.</p>
                  <p>4. To which let me add those other which I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
have also made mention of.<note place="margin">The eyes of many blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> Gods <hi>blinding the

delusions</hi> amongst us, giving up many to the
believing of them. All sadly remarkable in this
Nation at this day; I think never more in any.
And what may we conceive these to portend?
Surely, sad Omens they are; giving us too just
cause to fear, lest God should be about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
to take away his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> his <hi>Gospel</hi> from
us, which meeteth not only with such sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but such affronts and oppositions as it
doth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. To which let me yet subjoyn, that which

                     <hi>our not profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

by them. This is that which the Lord
complaines of against <hi>Israel,</hi> Isai. 1. 5. <hi>why
should ye be stricken any more, ye will revolt more
and more.</hi> Gods judgments had a contrary effect
upon them to what they were intended. He
corrected them for their amendment, thereby
to bring them home to himself, but they took
occasion thereby to go further away from him;
so as his <hi>Corrections</hi> were <hi>in vain</hi> to them, (as
elswhere he complains) <hi>Ier. 2. 30. In vaine

correction.] viz.</hi> so as to be bettered by it, but
rather waxed worse &amp; worse. And would to God
that this did not lie as too just a charge against
this sad Land and Nation wherein we live! That
God hath stricken us, I suppose there are few
but are in some kinde or other sensible. But
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104496:149"/>
what effect have these <hi>Rods,</hi> these Judgments
had upon us? Are we better by them? Are we
thereby reclaimed, reformed, brought home
to God? Are we made the more humble, the
more careful, the more watchful, the more
fruitful? O that these effects were to be found
amongst us, But is it not clean contrary? Are
we not grown more <hi>proud</hi> (a sin I think never
so visible in this Nation as at this day) more
remiss, more loose, more barren and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
then ever? And if so, what just cause have
we to fear lest the Lord in his most righteous
judgment do unto us, as there he threatens unto
<hi>Israel;</hi> give us over, striving no longer with us,
but leaving us to our selves, <hi>letting us alone</hi> (as
elswhere he threatens unto <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hos. 4. 17.)
to go on in our sinful provocations, until there
be <hi>no remedy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are some of those grounds upon which
we may build our too just fears. To which I
might yet have added some other. But I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
any further charge: Coming rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Do what our Saviour here doth for
<hi>Ierusalem; Mourn over it, weep over it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mourn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it.</note> with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
compassionate and affectionate tears, laying to
heart the sad state and condition thereof. This
doth he, knowing how it was with that City,
that the things belonging to her peace were now
hid from her. And this do we over <hi>England,</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:104496:150"/>
fearing lest it should be so with it.</p>
                  <p>2. But tears alone will not help. When

the discomfiture which had happened unto <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
Iosh. 7. 10.</hi> the Lord takes him up with these
words, <hi>Get thee up wherefore lyest thou upon thy
face?</hi> Intimating unto him, that it was not his
humbling and afflicting himself, without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
else, that would heal that breach, which
Israels sinne, their violating and <hi>transgressing the
Covenant of their God,</hi> had made upon them (as
it followeth in the next verse.) There must be
some other course taken for the reconciling of
them unto God, and making their peace with
him. And what was that? Why the people
must be <hi>sanctified,</hi> and the <hi>Accursed thing must
be taken from among them,</hi> (as the 13. verse hath
it.) And O that <hi>England</hi> might take the like
course? It is not all our falling upon our faces
before the Lord, all our daies of <hi>publick Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
(though that be a sacrifice acceptable unto
God) that will serve to appease his wrath, and
to procure his favour; that alone will not do it,
unlesse also the people be <hi>sanctified,</hi> and the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
thing</hi> removed from among us. This then
let every of us in our several places, indeavour.
Beginning first with our selves. Every one
<hi>searching and trying our own waies,</hi> that we may
find out the <hi>Action</hi> in our own hearts and lives,
our own personal sinns. Which having found
out, now take them away, <hi>putting away the evill
of our doings from before the eyes of our God</hi> by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104496:150"/>
and unfeined repentance and reformation;
renewing our Covenant with our God, cleaving
unto him with full purpose of heart. Then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
we the like for others; every of us in
our places (as I said,) <hi>Magistrates</hi> in their
places, <hi>Ministers</hi> in theirs, <hi>Masters of families</hi>
in theirs, <hi>private Christians</hi> in theirs contributing
what we may towards a <hi>reall and National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi>
that so the <hi>Accursed thing,</hi> even all
kind of wrath, provoking abominatious, may
be taken away from the midst of us, and that we
may be a people sanctified, dedicated and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>So doing,<note place="margin">God not willing to cast off a people in Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> now know we for our Comfort,
that we have to deal with a <hi>God gracious and
mercifull, slow to anger, and of great kindnesse,
ready to repent of what ever evill he</hi> intendeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a people; Especially his <hi>own people;</hi> not
willing to reject and cast off a people that are in
<hi>Covenant</hi> with him. So much he expressed to
this people, the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> before the
Captivity, by making so many <hi>removes</hi> before
his final departure from them, so the Prophet
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw it in his Visions; in which the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Lord</hi> removed not lesse then five several
times before it took its leave; First, from the
<hi>Cherub</hi> to the <hi>threshold of the house</hi> (the <hi>Temple</hi>)
Ezek. 9. 3. 2. It removed higher standing <hi>over
the door;</hi> cap. 10. 4. 3. From the threshold
it returned and stood <hi>over the Cherubins,</hi> which
were <hi>mounted up from the Earth</hi> as ready to take
their flight, v. 18, 19. 4. From thence to the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104496:151"/>
                     <hi>midst of the City,</hi> and 5ly. From thence to the
<hi>Mountain on the East side of the City,</hi> the
<hi>Mount of Olives,</hi> Cap. 11. v. 23. Now what
did these frequent removes import? Surely a
great unwillingnesse in God to depart from that
people. And so it is, so long as there is any
remedy; God is not willing to forsake a people,
whom once he hath taken into Covenant with
himself. So much we may hear him passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
declaring concerning <hi>Israel,</hi> Hos. 11. 7, 8.
<hi>My people</hi> (saith he) <hi>are bent to back sliding from
me,</hi> (So was <hi>Israel,</hi> yet mark what followes.)
<hi>How shall I give thee up O Ephraim? how shall I
deliver thee O Israel? How shall I make thee as
Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? Myne
heart is turned within me, my repentings are
kindled together.]</hi> So loath is God (as it were)
to cast off a people whom once he hath struck a
Covenant with, if there be any hope of tetur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
unto him, and demeaning themselves as
becommeth his people. And who knoweth what
his thoughts may yet be towards this sinful and
most unworthy Nation? Onely turn we unto
him with all our hearts and soules. And then (as
the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> goeth on, <hi>Ioel 2. 14.) Who
knoweth if he will return, and leave a blessing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus have I done with the first branch of
the <hi>Application,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Application in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note> as is directed to the <hi>Nation</hi> in

                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:104496:151"/>
And this I shall do (in the first place) by way

have their dates?</hi> what terrour may this strike
into the hearts of all <hi>obstinate</hi> and <hi>obdurate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</hi>
of which kind. I wish there were none
before me this day;) <hi>Despisers of Grace;</hi> such as
have had their <hi>Day,</hi> their day of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
wherein God hath shewen unto them the
things belonging to their peace; but they have
not known them, they would not know them;
they have done what the <hi>Iewes</hi> did, stopped
their eares, closed their eies, hardned their hearts,
refusing to hearken to the counsel which <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
gave them, to hearken to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
speaking to them in and by his Ministers, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
the counsel which the word held forth
to them, sleighting those offers of grace and
mercie, tendred to them in the <hi>Gospell</hi> upon their
receiving of <hi>Christ,</hi> but still going on in their
wonted Rebellions. Now to all such be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
how do you know but that the date of your
day may be out? the time of grace and mercy
may be past, and the dreadful doom passed upon
you in heaven, which our Saviour here denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
against <hi>Ierusalem</hi> upon earth, that, <hi>Now
the things belonging to your peace are hid from
your eyes;</hi> so as you shall never see what you
have refused to see. Certainly so it hath been
with some others. And why not so with you
for ought that you, or others know? How e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
a just and righteous thing it is with God
God that it should be so; that seeing you have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104496:152"/>
closed your eyes, and would not see, that he
should seal them, so as you should not see.
And if so, how deplorable, how miserable is
your condition? So we loook upon a poor blind
man whose bodily eyes are put out, past hope of
ever recovering his sight again. What is it then
to have the eye of the soul blinded? So as it shall
never see, never se what belongeth to its peace &amp;
hapines, but is shut up under an everlasting dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Miserable and deplorable is the condition of
every such a soul, in as much as it is now despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
helplesse, hopelesse. So is it with a person
upon whom this doom is once passed. Now he
may call and cry for mercy, with <hi>Esau</hi> seeking
blessing with tears, but all in vain. Neither his
own, nor yet the prayers of any other shall be
available on his behalf. Though <hi>Noah, Iob,</hi> and
<hi>Daniel,</hi> the chiefest favourites of heaven, should
undertake to intercede for such a one, yet shall
they not be able to procure a revocation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versement
of that sentence which is past upon
him. Such was <hi>Sauls</hi> case upon whom <hi>Samuel</hi>
denounceth that irrevocable sentence from the
Lord, 1 <hi>Sam. 15. 26. Thou hast rejected the word
of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee.</hi> A sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
not to be reversed. So he tels him, <hi>v. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Also the strength of Israel will not lye, nor repent,
for he is not as man that he should repent.</hi> No,
though <hi>Saul</hi> himself sought God, by confessing
and bewailing of his sinne (as he doth, <hi>v. 24.</hi>)
begging pardon for it, desiring <hi>Samuel</hi> to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him that he might <hi>worship God,</hi> (as it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104496:152"/>
followeth, <hi>v, 25.</hi>) which accordingly he did
(<hi>v. 31</hi>) Yet would not all this avail. No nor
yet though <hi>Samuel</hi> was an intercessour for him,
praying, and mourning for him (as we find him,
<hi>v.</hi> last.) So irreversible was that sentence which
the Lord had passed upon <hi>Saul,</hi> that what ever
he did, or <hi>Samuel</hi> could do, all could not change
the purpose of God concerning him. Rejected

what is good in your own eies, fear ye and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(I say) least the Lord should have passed or
should passe the like sentence upon you; which

peremptory concerning any particular person
here upon earth, that what ever means shall be

not be able to reverse it? It was not so with that
barren <hi>Figtree</hi> in the Gospel, upon which the
owner had passed his doom, that it should be
cut down, giving order to the dresser of his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
that he should execute what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
<hi>Cut it down, why cumbreth it the ground?</hi>
Yet notwithstanding at that his servants request
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104496:153"/>
it was reprived, and spared one year longer,
<hi>Luk. 13. 7, 8, 9.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> True, thus God is pleased to deal some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with some; to exercise great long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and forbearance towards them:<note place="margin">Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling not alike with all.</note> Yea
sometimes reverting the sentence which is past
upon them. Thence it is that he is said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to <hi>Repent</hi> of what he hath done, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to do.<note place="margin">Sometimes he is said to Repent.</note> So he did concerning the <hi>Ninevites,</hi>
which <hi>Ionah</hi> supecting, taketh up as his excuse
for his not going to the City according to Gods
direction, to denounce that sentence against
them, but rather fleeing to <hi>Tarshish,</hi> Jon. 4. 2.
<hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>I fled before unto Tarshish,
for I knew that thou art a gracious God, slow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and of great kindnesse, and repentest thee of the
evill;</hi> the evil intended and threatned, which
accordingly he did, reversing that sentence
which was passed upon them. And the like he
did to <hi>Israel,</hi> at <hi>Moses</hi>'s intercession, <hi>the Lord
repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his
people,</hi> Exod 32. 14. But it will not hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,<note place="margin">But not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</note>
that because God dealeth thus with some
therefore he will do so to all. However that
<hi>Figtree</hi> was spared for a year, yet the other Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
which we read of was not spared an hour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
So the Storie tels you, <hi>Matth. 21. 19. Iesus</hi>
passing by the way and espying a figtree or
which he found no fruit, however (as St. <hi>Mark</hi>
notes it, <hi>Mark 11. 13.) the time of Figs was not

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104496:153"/>
for ever.</hi> which sentence was accordingly
executed, and that forthwith. So it followeth,
<hi>And presently the figtree withered away.</hi> Thus
though God may for time spare some, and seem
to repent of what he hath threatened concerning
them, yet as he will not ever do so to any so
neither will he doe so to all. He that spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at that time, yet afterwards <hi>sware in his

he who spared <hi>Aaron</hi> at <hi>Moses</hi> request, when <hi>he
was angrie with him to have destroyed him</hi> (as
you have it, Deut. 9. 20.) would not spare
<hi>Korah,</hi> and his Companie of whom you reade
Numb. 16. Upon their Rebellion against <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> there was a suddain and dreadful exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
done upon them, <hi>The ground clave a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

her mouth, and swallowed them up,</hi> &amp;c. So as
<hi>They went alive into the pit v. 31. 32. 33.</hi> And so
for those others who at the same time usurped
the Priests Office, taking upon them to offer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
presently, <hi>There came out a fire from the

they daring to offer <hi>strange fire</hi> before the Lord,
presently <hi>there went out</hi> a strange <hi>fire from the

however God belong suffering towards some,

you.</hi> And what he promised them, he likewise
assureth unto others, all others in the like case:
Cap. 18. 7, 8 Where the promise is indefinite,
<hi>At what instant I shal speak concerning a Nation,
and concerning a Kingdome, to pluck up, and to

                  <p>A: To this I answere as before.<note place="margin">Repentance not in mans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> True, it is so,
vpon mans repentance God will also repent. But
how knowst thou (as before I sayd) whether
ever God will give thee that grace or space to
repent? How knowest thou but that in his just
judgment he either already hath, or suddainly
may give thee up to that impenitent heart, that
shall not, that cannot repent; Not repent truely
and sincerely, Possibly in an <hi>hypocriticall</hi> or

of what they had brought upon themselves, they
bewailed their condition, yet were far from true

<hi>True Repentance,</hi> Repentance unto life and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

let it now be mine to you, all and every of you,
who heare me this day. I, as a poore Minister of
Christ, working together with him as his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Instrument, exhort and beseech you that you
receive not the grace of God in vain, this <hi>Gospel
grace,</hi> the offer of grace &amp; mercy held forth u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to
you in the Ministerie of the word; see that you do
not receive it in vaine, by onely giving it the
hearing, and so letting it dye and perish in the
eare, not having any such affect in, and upon you,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104496:155"/>
as is intended by it, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring you home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God and Jesus Christ, to receive and embrace
him as your Saviour and Lord, to beleive on him,
to submit unto him. This is the end of all our
preaching, thus to some this <hi>good seede</hi> (as the
doctrine of truth is called Math. 13. 24.) the
seede of the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the begetting of faith and
obedience in the hearts of those that hear us.
Now see you to it, that this <hi>seede</hi> doe not fall,
like that in the <hi>Parable,</hi> which fell by the <hi>high
way side,</hi> Math. 13. 4. where the ground being
hardned by the feere of the Passengers, the seede
cannot enter, but lyeth above ground, and so is
sowen in vaine, being spilt and lost. Take heede
that the word be not so spilt upon any of you;
that your hearts be not hardened against it, that
you should not receive it into them. This is that
which the Apostle presseth upon his <hi>Hebrewes,</hi>
Heb. 3. 7. 8 <hi>wherefore as the Holy-ghost saith. To<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day
if ye will heare his voice, harden not your
hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> And let me press the same upon you. To<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day
if you will heare the voice of the <hi>Sonne of
man</hi> the voice of Jesus Christ, so heare it as that
you may live, doe not harden your hearts, doe
not oppose, doe not resist the call of God, by
shutting the word out of your hearts. This did
the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wildernesse. When God
spake unto them by his servant <hi>Moses,</hi> they
hardened their hearts, not regarding what was
sayd to them. But what was the issue? Hereby
they exceedingly provoked God against them.
This was a day of <hi>Provocation,</hi> as the Apostle
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104496:155"/>
there calleth it. <hi>Harden not your hearts, as in
the Provocation,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Such
was that <hi>day of Temptation in the wilderness,</hi> the
time where in the Israelites tempted their God,
by not hearkning to his voice, it was a day of
<hi>Exacerbation,</hi> and <hi>Exasperation.</hi> So it was not
onely <hi>to Moses,</hi> betwixt whome and the people
there was a sharpe contention, (as we find it
Exod. 17. 2.) But also unto God, who by that
their not harkning to his voice was exceedingly
<hi>greived</hi> (as it there followeth Heb. 3. 10,) yea
so provoked and exasperated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>he sware in
his wrath that they should never enter into his
rest. v. 11.</hi> Now take you heede that it be
not so with you, that you doe not thus provoke
God by hardning your hearts, not receiving
his word, not imbracing his Gospel. Which if
you shall doe, know that this will be a <hi>greater
Provocation</hi> then that of theirs was, So much
you may learne from the Apostle, Heb. 12. 25.
Where upon this ground he exhorteth his
<hi>Hebrewes</hi> to give eare to the Gospel. <hi>See</hi> (saith
he) <hi>that ye refuse not him that speaketh, (viz.</hi>
Christ speaketh to you his word,) <hi>For if they
escaped not who refused him that spake on earth,</hi>
(the <hi>Israelites</hi> who hearkened not unto <hi>Moses)
much more shall not we escape, if we turn from
him that speaketh from heaven; viz,</hi> from <hi>Iesus
Christ</hi> who came from heaven, and now speakes
in and by his Gospel Ministeries. And upon
the same ground let me perswade you. Take
you heede how any of you turne away from
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104496:156"/>
                     <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> thus speaking unto you; turn away
your eares, turn away your hearts, so as not to
receive, not to imbrace the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
held forth unto you. This if you shall do,
how know you but that God may justly retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
and requite this contempt of yours, by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Not being of Gods counsel, not acquainted

some weak desires after grace, some slender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of conversion and faith. And so shall I
deal with all such.</p>
                  <p>1. Willing them (in the first place) to take
notice what is their <hi>Rule</hi> to walk by.<note place="margin">Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will the onely Rule to walk by.</note> Not the
<hi>secret</hi> but the <hi>revealed will</hi> of God. <hi>Secret things
belong unto the Lord, but those things which are
revealed, to us and to our children for ever,</hi> Deut.
29. 29. This is that which we are to look at,
and take notice of. And therefore let not any
upon this account disquiet and trouble their
own soules with such anxious disquisitions, as
neither they, nor any other for them, whether
man or Angel, is able to resolve. But <hi>apply
themselves to the use of means.</hi> This will men do
as concerning their <hi>temporall</hi> estates. They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104496:158"/>
stand prying into Gods decree, to enquire
what portion in his secret purpose he hath layed
out for them, but they set about the work of
their calling, applying themselves to the use of
means. And so do you touching your <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
and <hi>eternall</hi> estates. Stand not to enquire
how God hath disposed of you in his secret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
but go about the work of your general
calling, apply your selves to the use of such
means as God hath appointed to bring you
home to himself by, so waiting upon his good
will and pleasure. This is that which the Lord
requires you to do. And therefore in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his command, do it, with that Poor
impotent person <hi>(Iohn 5.) lying at the pool,</hi>
untill the Angell shall come down and stir the
waters; attending upon Ordinances, untill
God by his spirit concurring with them shall
please to work effectually by them, inclining
your hearts to look towards himself; giving
you a sight and sense of your own sinfulnesse
and miserie; making you to see and feel the
need you have of Jesus Christ, and heginning
to draw your hearts towards him. Which
when you find, let this be a comfortable
evidence unto you that your day is not yet
past.</p>
                  <p>Onely be not you now wanting to this grace
of God,<note place="margin">The moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit to be intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> in giving intertainment to these
motions of the spirit, in opening of the doore
of your hearts, that so the Lord Jesus, who is
now knocking at them, may enter in, Which, in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104496:159"/>
the feare of God, be ye <hi>now</hi> perswaded to do,
Not knowing but that this may be the last
knock; this the last sermon that ever we shall,
heare, or the last mention of the spirit that ever
you shall feele. Now therefore, even now
before you goe from this place, strike up the
<hi>Covenant</hi> betwixt <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and your <hi>soules,</hi>
accepting and receiving him in all those <hi>Gospell
Relations,</hi> not onely as a <hi>Saviour</hi> casting your
soules upon him, so as to rest upon the al suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
of his merit for the pardon of sin and
eternall salvation, but also as a <hi>Lord,</hi> a <hi>Husband,</hi>
a <hi>Head,</hi> giving your selves up unto him to be
guided and governed by him, by his word and
Spirit, so receiving him into your hearts, as that
he may dwell in you, and rule over you, and that
for ever.</p>
                  <p>This being done,<note place="margin">Where Christ is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the day of grace is not past.</note> now know you for your
comfort that you are through grace and mercie
exempted out of this black list, out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those from whose eies the things
belonging to their peace are hid. God having
thus revealed his Sonne <hi>Christ</hi> not onely to
you, but <hi>in you</hi> (as the Apostle saith of himself
Gal. 1. 16.) not onely revealed him to your
eares, but to your hearts, as by his word so by
his spirit, inclining your hearts to close with
him, to receive him upon these Gospel tearms,
now he hath made you to know the things
which belong unto your peace. Which whilest
he hath hid from others, he hath revealed to
you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:104496:159"/>
For which differencing mercie (to close up
all in a word) blesse you God;<note place="margin">Vse.</note> giving unto
him the glorie of this his free grace,<note place="margin">Blesse God for his differenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy.</note> which hath
put such a difference betwixt you and others.
This doth our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the behalfe of his
<hi>Disciples,</hi> in the Text forecited. Math. 11. 25.
<hi>I thanke thei O father Lord of heaven and earth,
because thou hast hid these things from the wise
and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</hi>
The great misteries of this Kingdome God had
revealed them unto the poore and simpler sort
of people, the poore received the Gospell,
whilest in the meane time they were hid from
the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises,</hi> men worldly wise and
learned. And this our Saviour there acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be his work, an art of his meere good
will and pleasure. <hi>Even so father, for so it seemed
good in thy sight. v. 26.</hi> And the like doe you
for your selves. Seeing God hath now revealed
unto you those things, which he hath hid from
others, many others, who upon a Naturall, or
Civill account, are far your betters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before you, as in place and estate, so in
understanding and worldly wisedome. Give
ye unto him the glorie of this mercie, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
it to be an art of his free grace, a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
favour vouchsafed unto you. For which
let your soules for ever bless him; prasing and
magnifying him, who hath thus now made you
<hi>Children or light,</hi> whereas others, the greatest
part of the world, still <hi>sit in darknesse in the
shaddow of death;</hi> some of them having their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104496:160"/>
eies already closed up, so as they neither do,
nor ever shall see the things belonging unto
their peace, being already doomed and adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to everlasting darknesse. You are now
<hi>called into that marvellous light,</hi> (as Saint Peter
calleth the grace of the Gospell. 1 Pet. 2. 11)

great and admirable things of God.
Such are the ministers of the Gospell, wherein
those wonderfull acts and Counsels of God
touching the salvation of his Elect by Christ
are revealed and held forth. A misterie which
the <hi>Angels</hi> themselves do <hi>earnestly desire to looke
into</hi> (as Saint Peter telleth us. 1 Pet. 11. 2.)
Being much taken there with, when they sawe
it more clearly revealed under the Gospel then
it had been under the Lawe, they even <hi>stooped,
bowed down</hi> (as it were, for so the word there
used properly signifieth, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to prie and looke narrowly into it. Now
these are the things which God hath revealed
unto you, And for this do you praise and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
his name for ever.</p>
                  <p>Taking this as a pledge,<note place="margin">Faith an assurance of Vision.</note> and assurance of what
hereafter you shall see. Your eyes being thus
opened to see Christ by faith here, you shall see
him hereafter, when you shall have a full sight
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104496:160"/>
of him, see him as he is, see him in his glory;
Which when you shall do, then shall ye be
<hi>made like unto</hi> him, (as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> assureth you,
<hi>1 Ioh. 3. 2.</hi>) like him in glorie. <hi>When Christ
who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear
with him in glory.</hi> Col. 3. 4. Which <hi>beautifull
vision,</hi> the Lord of his free grace and mercie in
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> vouchsafe to everie soul of us;
<hi>Amen.</hi>
