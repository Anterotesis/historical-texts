         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>you saye you haue ben kept at schole, in soothe I thinke not longe.</l>
                  <l>Your master did but stroke your head, he did forbeare the rodde:</l>
                  <l>I dout he did not teache you well, howe you should feare your God.</l>

                  <l>Yf you might sitte and iudge my cause, I should soone feele your worst:</l>
                  <l>but God forbyd there were long hornes, on beastes that would be corst.</l>
                  <l>I call you beast because you sayde, here goeth the beast abrode:</l>

                  <l>We Iompe in leasse, ye gab syr beast, I am but one alone:</l>

                  <l>To serue the kyng and praie for hym, I learnde as well as you:</l>

                  <l>His councell eeke for to obaye, my duety learnes me too:</l>

                  <l>This lesson hetherto I kept, and shall here after kepe:</l>
                  <l>tyll I to earth retorne agayn, where fleshe and fell must sleepe.</l>
                  <l>What is the cause you answerde not, to that whiche I wrott last:</l>
                  <l>You do conclude muche lyke a thefe, whiche is condemnde and cast.</l>
                  <l>For at the barre he prateth long, and can no reason shew:</l>
                  <l>to clere hym selfe and saue his lyfe whan trueth doeth hym orethrow.</l>
                  <l>So you althoughe with matter now, I do you styll assault:</l>
                  <l>yet with great shame you are content, to yelde vnto your fault.</l>
                  <l>I wrate more thynges than one or two, yet reade them ons agayn:</l>

                  <l>yet euery iustice vnder him, is not so iust and pure.</l>
                  <l>Because there be knightes of the post, whiche wil them selues forswere,</l>
                  <l>and fained troeth will forge a tale, sometymes in iustice eare.</l>
                  <l>And worke suche wiles, iustice to blynde, and make him credit lies</l>
                  <l>suche crafty mistes these men can cast, before true iustice eies.</l>
                  <l>Thoughe iustice of him selfe is pure, and clean deuoide of crime,</l>
                  <l>yet false witnes may alter him, and chaunge his minde somtime.</l>
