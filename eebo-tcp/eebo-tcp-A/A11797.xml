            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROGRESSE OF THE Conqueſts of the King of SPAINE, and Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in <hi>Germany, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> the <hi>Griſons</hi> Countrie, <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> ſince the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Spaniards</hi> continually purſuing the advancement of their univerſall Monarchy, (the firſt foundation whereof were laid by <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, ſince which time that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne hath been ſtill eagerly proſecuted,) haue bin ſo happy in their endeavours in theſe laſt 10 or 12 yeares in diuers parts of <hi>Europe</hi>: and particularly neere to the borders of <hi>France,</hi> that there remaines very little for them to conquer; to encompaſſe it on all ſides, and ſo by little and little to make themſelves Majeſtrates and Arbiters of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>And to begin with the laſt and freſheſt of their Conqueſts; Beſides the <hi>Palatine</hi> Electoriall dignity, which they haue put into the hands of one of their confidents: they haue conquered by Armes all the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> both on this ſide and beyond the <hi>Rhine</hi>; and within, or neere it, many Citties and ſtrong places, whereof divers are Imperiall free Townes, as namely <hi>Wormbs, Spire, Landaw, Haguenau, Wiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, Fridberg, Gailhaſſen, Wetzlar,</hi> and others: together with a good part of the Countrey of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau,</hi> and of the Countrey of <hi>Wetteraw,</hi> wherein are
<pb facs="tcp:17490:3"/>
many Counts and Lords neighbours, and Allies to the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine:</hi> whoſe Brother and Coſens haue beene no more ſpared then the reſt, though not comprehended in the Imperiall Ban, their Lords and Lordſhips being ſeized on, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Iointures of the innocent widdow Princeſſes. This notable conqueſt, to take it from <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Haggenaw</hi> on the one ſide, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Trier</hi> and <hi>Lorraine</hi> one the other, and from <hi>Francfort</hi> almoſt cloſe to <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> containes in length more then 50 <hi>French</hi> leagues, and in breadth Fortie. And they ſtill continue to make ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe about the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> vnder colour of paſſages or other pretents: and proceede in their ſecret practiſes vpon diuers other Imperiall Townes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> (a great and ſtrong place, and of the ancient patrimony of our firſt Kings:) and likewiſe vpon the Towne of <hi>Beſanſon,</hi> to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Parliament there, or transferre thither that of <hi>Dole.</hi> As in the time of <hi>Phillip</hi> the ſecond, the Admirall of <hi>Arragon</hi> preſumed to aske the Vicariat of that Towne for the King his Maſter, but it was denied him by the Emperour <hi>Rodolph</hi> the ſecond. And of late the Miniſters of <hi>Spaine</hi> haue offered money for certaine places in the Biſhopricke of <hi>Liege,</hi> for no other end but that we euen now ſpeak of. But that which is moſt monſtrous, is the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell they make with the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an occaſion to make him likewiſe looſe his Electorat, although that Prince hath all this time remained neutriall, and kept intelligence with the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who at one time or other will
<pb facs="tcp:17490:3"/>
ſcape no better then the reſt, though he hath aſſiſted the Emperours with his Armes and Counſells, to the preiudice of his neere kindred, whom he dayly ſees to be turned naked to the world.</p>
            <p>All men know that not long before this, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had made themſelues Maſters of all that Countrie which lies betweene the Riuers of the <hi>Moſell</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> from the Townes of <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Cullen,</hi> to <hi>Numeguen</hi> in <hi>Guelderland</hi>: and eſpecially of the free and Imperiall Townes of <hi>Aix-la-Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell</hi> and <hi>Wezell</hi>: notwithſtanding the interceſſion of the King and Queene Mother then Regent, both by frequent Letters and Ambaſſadours ſent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that buſineſſe. And they haue ſince taken by compoſition the Townes and Fortreſſes of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and hold entirely the Dutches of <hi>Iuliers</hi> and <hi>Berg,</hi> together with all the Townes and places of the <hi>Grand Conte de la Marke,</hi> and the County of <hi>Rauenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> with two thirds of the Duchie of <hi>Cleues,</hi> on this ſide and beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the moſt part of it vnder the Duke of <hi>Newbourgs</hi> name. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hauing their garriſons there, the good Prince can neither inioy the places nor the reuinue, but in very ſmall proportion. And notwithſtanding all his endeauours and dilligence vſed at <hi>Bruxells,</hi> for freeing himſelfe from thoſe garriſons, yet cannot he hitherto obtaine or preuaile with them in any thing, though he be a Catholike, their friend, and Allie. This conqueſt is not much leſſe worth to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> then that of the lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for the approach which foote by foote they make towards <hi>Holland</hi>: as for the extent of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:17490:4"/>
Countries, which one with another, from the towne of <hi>Aix-la-Chapell</hi> to <hi>Lipſtat,</hi> the laſt place of the County <hi>De la Marke,</hi> and from thence to the Town of <hi>Cleues,</hi> amounts vnto aboue foureſcore <hi>French</hi> leagues in length, and about 50 in breadth. And this without accounting the Fort of <hi>Pappe-mutz,</hi> ſittuate in an Iſle of the <hi>Rhine</hi> on this ſide <hi>Cullen,</hi> lately conquered by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by them Chriſtened with the name of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> And in a word, either by aſſociation, or by the conuenience of the Electors of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Cologue</hi>: or by their proper conqueſts, they may call themſelues Maſters of the great Riuer of <hi>Rhine,</hi> from the Towne of <hi>Stratsbourg,</hi> yea euen from <hi>Briſacke</hi> and <hi>Basle,</hi> to <hi>Rees</hi> and <hi>Emericke,</hi> Townes in the Land of <hi>Cleue,</hi> not farre diſtant from the mouth of that River.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, who knowes not the deſignes of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> vpon the Countrie of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and how the Archduke <hi>Leopold</hi> on the one ſide, and the Gouernour of <hi>Millaine</hi> on the other, haue poſſeſt themſelues of the greateſt part of thoſe Countries, hauing put garriſons into <hi>Coyre, Mayenfeld, Preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gau,</hi> and all other places of the one and other <hi>Enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> euen cloſe to the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Zurich</hi>: where the Arch-duke intends to erect a Fort in a certaine place called <hi>Steig,</hi> thereby to bridle the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and keepe an entrance into the Countrey. And towards <hi>Millaine</hi> they haue ſeized vpon the Counties of <hi>Chiavenna</hi> and <hi>Pregaglia,</hi> and the long and fertile valley of the <hi>Val-telina,</hi> (the two ends whereof ioyne <hi>Millaine</hi> and <hi>Tirol</hi>) which is the ſubiect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent difference betweene the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> on the
<pb facs="tcp:17490:4"/>
on ſide, and the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> the States of <hi>Venice, Sauoy,</hi> and generally all <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Griſons</hi> on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>They haue alſo ſeized on the Counties of <hi>Bromio</hi> and <hi>Valmeſolcina,</hi> a faire and large valley neere <hi>Bellin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,</hi> towards the Frontiers of <hi>Italy</hi>: and now of late upon the County of <hi>Muſcco,</hi> under the title of of the Count of <hi>Triuulce</hi> his pretence: the foreſaid Conqueſts making altogether, to reckon from <hi>Mayenfield</hi> to <hi>Bormio,</hi> and from thence to the Fort <hi>Fuentes</hi> at the leaſt, 40 <hi>French</hi> leagues in length, and more the 30 in breadth, as it may euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by <hi>Cluverius</hi> his Map of <hi>Rhaetia.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the preſent Pope, being now depoſitary of the moſt parts of theſe Forts and places, labours with the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> for reſtoring all things vnto there former eſtate, according to the <hi>French</hi> Kings deſire, yet cannot he attaine vnto it.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Italy,</hi> it is true that the late King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in the yeare 1611, had made himſelfe Maſter of the Towne of <hi>Saſello,</hi> and placed a garriſon there: but vpon the complaint and requeſt of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of <hi>Genoa,</hi> reſtored it to the former State. Neuertheleſſe in <hi>Monaco,</hi> and the Towne and Caſtle of <hi>Correggio,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> keepe a ſtrong Garriſon. They haue alſo newly erected the Fort of <hi>Sandonal,</hi> vpon the Frontier of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> towards <hi>Vercel.</hi> And concerning the Sates of <hi>Milan, Final, Plumbin,</hi> and other <hi>Fiefs</hi> which the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> holds of the Empire, he hath vpon the inſtance of his Ambaſſador reſident at <hi>Vienna,</hi> receiued
<pb facs="tcp:17490:5"/>
ſolemne inveſtiture thereof by the Emperour 1621; And beſides, the States of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> are threatned by him, aſwell for the miſunderſtanding and differences paſt, as for this new diſpute and quarrell touching the <hi>Valteline,</hi> wherein the greateſt part of the Potentares of <hi>Italie,</hi> and the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe are alſo intereſſed.</p>
            <p>And to make his way by little and little amongſt the leagues of the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Grizons,</hi> (peoples formerly ſo obliged and affectionate to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> as they did in a maner reiect all other Alliances) the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath by money, promiſes and practiſes, divided them into Factions, thereby to weaken that body which ſubſiſts not but by their vnion, and to be able to bring them againſt <hi>France</hi> it ſelfe, and other neighbouring States. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue done aſmuch vnder divers pretents in the Countrie of <hi>Valey,</hi> and Biſhoprirke of <hi>Sion,</hi> having likewiſe poſſeſſed themſelues of the paſſages of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> thereby to haue the wayes free and cleere for their Armies to paſſe from <hi>Italie</hi> to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>: which before they were conſtrained to beg from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> or the leagues of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To returne to <hi>Germany,</hi> it is very conſiderable that the conqueſts made by the Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> aſwell in the upper <hi>Palatinate</hi> which he hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into his poſſeſſion, as in the lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> tend all of them to the advantage of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> this Prince being neere Allie, and obliged to that Houſe, by the tranſlation of the Electorate vpon his perſon, and other benefits lately received from
<pb facs="tcp:17490:5"/>
the Emperour. So that to fauour that Duke, in hope either to bring him into ſuſpition with the Emperour, or to draw profit from him againſt the haire, conſidering how ſtrictly they are all linked together in intereſt, and affection the one to the other: and in giuing ſuch a Councell, there muſt be want of integrity, or pure ignorance of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of the affaires of <hi>Germany.</hi> The like muſt be ſaid of the Children of the Marquis <hi>Edward For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,</hi> to whom the Marquiſat of <hi>Baden</hi> hath beene lately adiudged by the Emperour, againſt and in prejudice of their Coſen the Marquis of <hi>Douelach,</hi> who is now turned out of it, which is an extent of land ſomewhat conſiderably betweene the Townes of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> and <hi>Baſle,</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and Dutchie of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p>They haue likewiſe ſince a few Moneths poſſeſt themſelues of a good part of the <hi>Langrauiat</hi> of <hi>Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> vnder colour of a ſentence giuen by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, in fauour of the <hi>Langraue Louis</hi> of <hi>Darmſtat,</hi> againſt his Coſen the <hi>Langraue Maurice</hi> of <hi>Kaſsell,</hi> (an ancient Allie and confident of the Crowne of <hi>France</hi>) upon their difference touching the Towne of <hi>Marſpourg,</hi> and the countrey about it. And ſo by little and little they proceede, getting footing in the Prouinces of <hi>Germany,</hi> and oppreſſing the libertie of the Princes and Citties of the Empire: thereby to make it hereditary in their Houſe; as they doe the Kingdomes of <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> (which thoſe peoples haue euermore maintained to be meerely Electiue.) together with the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Moravia, Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Luſatia,</hi> incorporated to
<pb facs="tcp:17490:6"/>
the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and newly reconquered by Armes and other meanes, to the great increaſing of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and exceeding great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their deſignes.</p>
            <p>We will not ſpeake here of the Townes and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of <hi>Arache, Mamora,</hi> and others in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Fez,</hi> ſurpriſed or conquered by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> ſince a few yeares, becauſe they are far diſtant, and of leſſe conſideration to <hi>France.</hi> But touching the Fort of <hi>Grauelines,</hi> which they ſtill aduance, and will by ſnatches bring it to perfection: we muſt blame our ſelues if we ſuffer it. But it would be a farre worſe matter, if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould conclude the Treaty of Marriage with <hi>England,</hi> for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which euery man may vnderſtand; for if the onely Negotiation touching that Alliance, hath giuen the <hi>Spaniards</hi> time and meanes to ſubdue the beſt and greateſt part of all <hi>Germany:</hi> and to puſh their deſignes ſo forward; what other thing can be expected from the accompliſhment of the marriage, but that in the end we muſt receiue Law from the Conquerour, and ſo looſe the prerogatiue of this glorious title, anciently wonne by our Kings, of Protectors of the liberty of <hi>Germany,</hi> and which is more, of Arbiters of Chriſtendome: beſides the fruit which we ſee loſt before our eyes: of ſo many Millions employed ſince 100, or 120 yeares, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine our Allies the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Grizons,</hi> and other our friends and confederates; And of the expence made at the ſiege of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> to put it into the poſſeſſion of the lawfull heires of the Houſe of <hi>Cleue,</hi> whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> laboured to diſpoſſeſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:17490:6"/>
and to take it themſelues: as they haue now done 10 yeares afterwards. For which notwithſtanding, our ill-affected-Frenchmen haue profeſſed publike ioy, although this place was formerly deliuered to the late <hi>Mareſchall de la Chaſtre,</hi> generall of the Kings Army, being for the moſt part Catholicke.</p>
            <p>It muſt be alſo taken into conſideration, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who for 70 yeares hath by diuers writings continuall blamed our Treaties: which the <hi>Turke</hi> doth now himſelfe ſeeke that Alliance with much inſtance. The laſt from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> beare, that one <hi>Antonio Barili,</hi> a Dominican Frier, who had bin there ſecretly twice before, was againe returned thither, with two others in his company: and that he hath been zealouſly ſeconded and aſſiſted in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute of this peace, by the Emperours Miniſters that were then at the Port: and now lately by one <hi>Curtz,</hi> who for this end hath carried thither a good ſumme of money; of all which the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi> himſelfe, gaue aduertiſement to ſome Ambaſſadors reſident at the Port, and oppoſite to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Party, iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſigne of the Emperor and King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to be for no other end, then by this Peace <note n="a" place="margin">By a Peace with the Grand Signiour of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> would yearely ſaue the charge of 20 m. men kept in Garriſon, vpon the Coaſtes of <hi>Naples, Sicilie, Sardinia,</hi> and thoſe Iſlands, and of 60 Gallies, in which are of Souldiers and Slaues well nigh 20 m. more: All which great forces, the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> is forced with a vaſt expence, continually to maintaine for his owne ſafety and defence againſt the <hi>Turke.</hi> And it is conſiderable that this propoſition of Peace, is made in a time when the neceſſities of the Turkiſh affaires, in regard of the preſent Rebellions and diſordres in their Empire, threatning ruine, or at leaſt ſome notable alteration, might make the offer acceptable. And that for the ſaid reſpects, it could not for the preſent be either dangerous, or vnſafe for the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>; but would be of infinite aduantage to the progreſſe of his affaires in theſe parts, if ſo great forces as are now onely maintained for a meere defence, without attempting any thing, ſhould be drawne forth into an actiue employment.</note> to haue the better meanes and leaſure to go through with
<pb facs="tcp:17490:7"/>
their buſineſſe and conqueſts in <hi>Europe</hi>: and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees make themſelues ſtrong enough to vndertake the <hi>Turke,</hi> and then carrie their Armes into the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.</hi> And to this end it is their writers publiſh, that it is neceſſary there ſhould be but one vniuerſall and abſolute Monarch in Chriſtendome, and that it ſhould be the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who is the mighteſt, and who by their report hath the beſt mirited of the Apoſtolicke Sea, and of all Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>For their pretences, either vpon <hi>France</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, drawing a diſcent of the Princes of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in a direct line from Male to Male, from <hi>Meroue, Childeric,</hi> and other Kings of <hi>France</hi> of the firſt race called <hi>Merouingiens:</hi> thereby inferring that the Kingdome belongs to them. Or vpon the Prouinces of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Brittany</hi> in particular; Theſe falſehoods haue beene lately ſolidly refuted by one of our moſt excellent and learned Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And touching their pretences vnto other Kingdomes, and particularly to <hi>England,</hi> the care and refutation thereof is to be left to thoſe who haue moſt intereſt therein. The euidence of theſe pretences which haue been ſeconded by reall vnder takings and attemps, appeares ſufficiently in <hi>Hereras</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>Phillip</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Cabrera,</hi> and in <hi>Camille Borrell,</hi> his Booke touching the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue and dignity of the Catholicke King.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>France</hi> being therefore enuironed on all ſides with the Teritories and Dominions of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> either of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient domaine, or new conqueſts, (which hath bin made in ſo ſhort a time, as it ſeemes a thing prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous)
<pb facs="tcp:17490:7"/>
this State hauing thereby loſt all its outworkes and bulwarkes: that is, the beſt and moſt powerfull friends and Allies: it ſeemes to be more then high time to awake out of this deepe and fatall <hi>Lethargie,</hi> whereinto our <hi>France</hi> is fallen by the diſaſtrous death of our great <hi>Henry,</hi> and ſeriouſly to looke to our conuerſation, by taking it into due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould now picke a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with vs, and aſſaile vs againe: as in the time of the league, when <hi>Phillip</hi> the ſecond would haue had this Crowne put vpon his Daughters head, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of our <hi>Salique</hi> Law: the paſſages by Land would on all ſides be ſhut vp againſt vs, ſo as we could not be relieued either with men or money from <hi>Germany, Switzerland,</hi> or <hi>Italie:</hi> as was our late King in his great neceſſities. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, all the Princes and people ſubiect to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and thoſe whom he hath lately ſubdued vnto him, who were formerly our friends, and fauoured vs: will be conſtrained and bound to aſſiſt and and ſerue againſt vs, and many of them to their great griefe.</p>
            <p>Yet is it not meant that recourſe ſhould preſently be had vnto Armes, and the publique peace bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. as if ſo great a King in ſo powerfull a kingdome as this is, had no other meanes to protect the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The late King in the like caſe, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying thoſe violent remedies, hath by his wiſedome ſufficiently ſhewed the way; as when by a ſerious interpoſition of his credit and authority, he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated the difference betweene the Pope and the <hi>Venetians:</hi> or when by his liberallity he ſuccoured
<pb facs="tcp:17490:8"/>
thoſe who beſought his helpe: or when by mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he gaue cauſe of apprehenſion to thoſe that would oppreſſe his friends and Allies. And theſe are the meanes that ought to be vſed in the firſt place, before the way of open force be taken; all warres how iuſt ſo euer, being both ruinous and hazardous.</p>
            <p>True it is that the peace of this State, the vnion and concord of the people in a due obedience to our King, and the conduct of a wiſe Councell, that knowes how to reſume the wiſe Councells and Maximes of <hi>Henry</hi> the great: and the former ſtate of a good intelligence, with the moſt ſincere friends and ancient confederats of this Crowne, are the firſt and principall remedies of this euill: yea, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame way for reſtoring this puiſſant and once flouriſhing Kingdome, to its ancient ſplendor, ſtrength, and authoritie.</p>
