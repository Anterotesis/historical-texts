            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THat Monarchy, or the Supreme Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of one person, was primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended by God, when he created the World. That it is founded in nature. As consonant to the Divine Government. And of Divine Institution. Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by Heathens, as well as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.

That all Governments have a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to Monarchy. Their several Forms, and Rotations. Of Aristocracy. Democracy. Tyranny, to be rather wisht, than either. Examples, of <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>; the first Consulate. Their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, several Seditions. <hi>Marius,</hi> and <hi>Sylla.

What is here intended by a Supreme Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. The marks of Sovereignty; as, the Power of making Laws, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from any coactive obedience to them. The Power of Peace, and War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Kingdoms of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. are Supreme Imperial Monarchies. Those two marks of Sovereignty, and seven others, prov'd to be no other than what has ever been, the undoubted Right of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> The Kings Sovereignty by the Common Law. The like from the Statute Law. Power in Ecclesiasticks. And that they have justly used those Titles of King, and Emperor, and that from ancient times, and before the Conquest.

That the King is none of the Three Estates; in which, two preliminary Objections are examin'd by Reason; and answered by the manner of the Three Estates applying to him. What the Three Estates are. To presume him one of them were to make him but a Co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Power. The King cannot be said to Summon, or Supplicate himself. How will the Three Estates be made out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commons came in? With a short Series during the Saxons to the latter end of <hi>Henry III.</hi> in all which time they are not so much as nam'd as any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituent part of a Parliament, And the time when probably they first came in, to be as they are at this day, one of the three Estates. That the Lords Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were never doubted but to be an Estate. Four reasons offer'd, that the Lords Spiritual, are one other Estate, distinct from the Lords Temporal, and one Act of Parliament, in point: With other Authorities to prove the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

That notwithstanding the hard Law of the Kingdom, the Jews paid their Kings, an entire Obedience. Two Objections answered. The like, other Nations to their Kings. A third Objection answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Precept of Obedience is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restriction; Examples upon it: Nor is Idolatry any ground to resist; much less, things indifferent. The example from our Saviour in Instituting his last Supper. Least of all, is injury, with the practice of Holy men of old, in like cases. And that if any ground were to be admitted, that, would never be wanting.

The Arts of the late times in working the People from this Obedience. It was to be done piece-meal. The Kings Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, answered with Complaints. Plots discovered; Fears and Jealousies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. Religion cants its part. Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, some to make it Law, others, Gospel; The examples of <hi>Corah,</hi> &amp;c.

A Close from the whole by way of Enquiry, Whether an Exclusion of his Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York</hi> may be of more advantage or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. The advantage propos'd; and whether an Act for security of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,


<pb facs="tcp:43884:7"/>
may not be as safe, as a Bill of Exclusion. The moral impossibility of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the Romish Religion, tho the Prince were of that Persuasion. The reason why the Kingdom follow'd the Reformation under Edw. VI. Qu. <hi>Mary.</hi> Qu. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> That the case cannot be the same at this day. The Crown of <hi>England,</hi> an ancient Entail; with the danger of Innovations. Objection, That such things have been done. So has a King been murder'd. More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly answered, in <hi>Edw. IV.</hi> Qu. <hi>Mary,</hi> and Qu. <hi>Eliz.</hi> all three excluded by Parliament, yet came to the Crown. No man changes, but in hopes of better. The advantages of continuing as we are. It is a bar to Pretenders. The same, as to Competitors. Disorders avoided. No new Family to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for. The indignity of a Repulse avoided. Suppose <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be of another Opinion; the former of which has by Parliament asserted the Right of Succession of that Crown, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lastly, all occasions of Jealousie taken away. Objection, answer'd. Disadvantages

they got them to rebel, and not contented with a civil equality, but blinded by ambition, and taking upon them, by excluding some of the best by degrees, to grasp the Power into the hands of a few, and those, the least worthy, the Government was again changed, and from an Aristocracy, brought to an Oligarchy; so that the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude weary of both, and ready for another change, resolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store neither, and concluded on a Popular State wherein every man taking upon himself to have an equal right in the Government, it insensibly lost it self in the <hi>Mare mortuum</hi> of Anarchy, and upon the whole matter, finding that in all this rotation, they had rather lighted on some new Physician, than any remedy for the Disease, they return'd to Monarchy, and

A hard saying no doubt, whether we respect their persons, or their possessions, and yet he calls it <hi>Jus Regis qui imperaturus est vobis,</hi> thereby also implying, that such was the manner of all other

               <argument>
                  <p>That the King is none of the Three Estates; in which, two preliminary Objections are examin'd by Reason; and answered by the manner of the Three Estates applying to him. What the Three Estates are. To presume him one of them were to make him but a Co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Power. The King cannot be said to Summon, or Supplicate himself. How will the Three Estates be made out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commons came in? With a short Series during the Saxons to the latter end of <hi>Henry III.</hi> in all which time they are not so much as nam'd as any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituent part of a Parliament, And the


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43884:77"/>
time when probably they first came in, to be as they are at this day, one of the three Estates. That the Lords Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were never doubted but to be an Estate. Four reasons offer'd, that the Lords Spiritual, are one other Estate, distinct from the Lords Temporal, and one Act of Parliament, in point: With other Authorities to prove the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THose that would have the King one of the Three Estates, say, That our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a kind of mixt Monarchy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note> inasmuch, as in our Parliaments, the Lower House (as representing the Commons) bear a semblance of a Democracy; and the Lords, of Aristocracy: And others,<note place="margin">

Monarch, a Royal Monarch, and a Tyrannical Monarch, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth only to the Power, and Practice of the Monarch; yet the distinction of a Supreme, and mixt Monarchy, which designeth the manner of the Government, is a contradiction in <hi>Terminis</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Government which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it self to more than one, can never be a Monarchy; as is obvious to every one, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth the word Monarchy, and was never heard of in our Land, till the men of our late times, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of suppressing Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had fram'd a new Idol of their own, and having made it as gay as they could, set it up, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd by the Multitude, always prone to admire every thing, they least understand: And what must the consequence of it be? but that


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43884:79"/>
the Government, must be partly Monarchical, partly Aristocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and partly Democratical, which are in themselves contrary, and to be governed, by contrary Laws; and if it be impossible to make any good, out of two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes (as Monarchy, and Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy are) what then shall be made of three, confounded among themselves? or how can it be that Sovereignty (a thing indivisible) can at one and the same time, be divided, between one Prince, the Nobility,<note place="margin">

And as to the other,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 2.</note> That the King, Lords, and Commons as one Corporation (and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) are the Law-giver; here, I take the King to be in a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for, tho to the making of an Act, the concurrence of both Houses is necessary, yet of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if the King disapprove: yet, the Case of a Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses (or whatever other the stile of the Corporation be) is wholly different; for they, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together (by the Princes grant) in a kind of Democratical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council, for the better Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the place where they reside, order every thing, by most Voices, wherein the Mayor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, has but one, and is concluded by the greater number; but the King, having no Voice (nor any one to represent him) in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussive


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43884:80"/>
part of any Act, cannot be said to give his Royal Assent, as one of the Corporation, but by his inherent Legislative Prerogative: and how improper the contrary is; will further appear, in that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council, put what By-Laws they please, upon the Mayor, as long as they are not contrary to the Law of the Land, because he has no negative upon them. But in case of a Sovereign, the first mark of it (as I have shewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is the Power of making Laws; now, who should those Subjects be, that should yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that Law, if they also had the Power to make Laws? or who should that Prince be, that could give the Law, being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self constrain'd to receive it of his Subjects, unto whom also, he gave it?

That by all the States of Parliament there must be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily intended, more than two, if it were for no other reason, than mere propriety of Speech. 2. That the King could not make up, that other, or third Estate; because, he is desired to examin all the States

severally, which he could not do, if he had been one of them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: so in the 40th. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43884:96"/>
whom a Body Politick compact of all sorts, and degrees of People, divideth in Terms, and by names of Spiritualty, and Temporalty been bounden: and who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Authority of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, should utter any thing in Parables, or under double mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, contrary to the common sense of the express words, or that there was ever intended, by the words, (divided in Terms, and by names of Spiritualty and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty) so many mere words, and no more?
