            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O feede thy fancie with friuolous fables gentle Reader (as to tell thee of drowsie Endimion, who desired of Iupiter, to sleepe perpetuall: or Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides, who in seeking his fathers sheepe, tooke a nappe of fortie and seuen yeares long, or those seuen supposed Saintes, whom the golden Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend reporteth to haue slept two hundreth yeares and odde) is no part of my purpose. But rather as one in griefe of conscience, for the zeale of my God, what in me lyeth, to wake and stirre vp those wicked and sinfull sluggards, whom the cursed serpent in Paradice,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> aboue fiue thousand fiue hundreth sixtie and two yeares past, applying not the sinne of the sea calfe to their heades, but that inchaunted apple of perdition to their hartes, hath so venoumously infected with contagious poyson of iniquitie, and lulled so soundly a sleepe in the carelesse cradle of securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: that neither the golden belles of Aaron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the thundring trumpe of Esay, the well tuned Cimbals of Dauid, the pleasant harmonie of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists, nor the sweete comfortable pipe of Christ himselfe, could once as yet allure them to repentance and amendment of life: trusting that God by this my plaine rough Summons, penned without feare, or flatterie, shall now in the dawning of the day, ring such a peale at the dore of their conscience, as shall either moue them at length to loue him in his mercies, prouoke them to feare him in his iustice, or leaue them vnexcusable in the day of vengeance. But of all the sinfull crue of napping sleepers in generall, is lately reuealed vnto vs, one notable and pestiferous sect especiall: most odious to God, grieuous to his Church, dangerous to the State, and noysom to the common wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom the holy Ghost by the penne of the Apostles, hath most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly forewarned vs: decyphering them in their colours, with titles correspondent to their manners: as couetous bosters,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.3. 1. Tim. 4.2. Iud. 16.18.19. 2. Cor. 11.13.14. Apoc. 12.12.</note> disdainefull moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, false accusers, murmuring complainers, dissembling hipocrites, Authors of sectes, and despisers of authoritie: hauing a similitude of godlinesse, but haue denyed the power thereof, in whom Sathan hath transformed himselfe into an angel of light, whose restlesse rage doth manifestly shew the ruine of his kingdom at hand. These vnder a colour and shadow of religion, are so vehemently set on fire to shake off the yoke of obedience, and seeke innouation: as nothing is thought tollerable but what they like, and what they allow must onely stand for law: whereby the church is torne in peeces, authoritie contemned, vice aduanced, vertue neglected, and all men in opinion wonderfully distracted. Looke where they do loath, euerie mite is made a monster: euerie gnat, a cammell: and euerie trifle a trespasse, which must be curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously ripped vp, and made open to the view of the world. But where they like, mountaines are no moates, nor beames no blemishes: loue must couer the multitude of sinnes, and all thinges smothered vp with a shew of holinesse. Their pretence (as their Captaine saith) is to marre

They resemble in diuers points that notable and presumpteous crue, Iack Straw and his fellowes, who being diuelishly incensed with mutation, pretending a cause of libertie, stirred vp such trouble &amp; ciuil discention in this land, as nothing could appease, vnlesse the king would graunt to put downe all the nobles and prelates,<note place="margin">Richard the second.</note> reseruing onely a few to be of his counsell, and the rascall rable of begging Friers, to liue of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples deuotion: much like the prelacie which these new deuising church-founders are now so desirous to haue established: who must be no Bishops, to beare the state and title of honor, but superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents to controll Princes: no beneficed men, and why? because it bringeth a charge, as frutes, tenthes, and subsidies to her Maiesties co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, hospitalitie to their neighbors, and generall reliefe to the poore: but must liue popularly with their feete vnder other mens tables, and their tongues tyed to other mens purses. But Iack Straw was taught to know how horrible a thing it was,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 24. Psal. 105.15.</note> once to lift vp either hand, tongue or hart against the Lordes annointed, or doe his Prophets any harme, by sheathing the Maior of London his dagger in his bosom.

Tim. 5.1.17.</note> that the word of God doth teach, and our English lawes command, obediently to honour the Prince, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the Prelate. To conclude (gentle Reader) I craue only thy friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censor without partialitie, not forgetting the good Hermit, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing three of his friendes come to visit him, for want of better dainties to entertaine them, bestowed on euerie of them an olde apple, halfe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified with spots. The first friend, to shew his affection, deuoured his apple hartely, sound and rotten together as it was. The second, more nice then wise, because his was spotted in part, disdainefully threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the whole. The third, making choice of the best, reiected onely the rest. So doe I wish thee, not with the first friend, to deuoure the badde with the good: neither with the second, to cast away that is good because of some bad: but with the third, to accept and vse that is wholesom, and refuse that is lothsom. Vale in Christo.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that the Apostle Saint Paule had taught the Romanes many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table lessons and rules, touching the doctrine of christian faith, charitie, and obedience to Magistrates. In going on to exhort and perswade them to repentance and amendment of life, hee taketh occasion to speake of time, of sléepe, of light, and of darkenesse. And that considering the season (saith he) that it is now time, that we should wake from sleepe:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11.12.</note> for now is our saluation nearer then when we belieued. The night is past, and the day is at hand: let vs therefore cast away the workes of darkenesse, and put on the armour of light, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This worde <hi>dormire</hi> to sléepe, in some places of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scriptures, is taken for <hi>requiescere,</hi> to rest, as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ came to his Disciples and found them a sléepe: Christ himselfe slept in the sterne of the Ship, and Peter slept betwéene two souldiers. Againe in some places, it is taken to sléepe in <hi>sepulchro,</hi> the graue, as Dauid and Salomon slept with their Fathers: Behold saith Iob, I must sléepe in the dust, and Saint Paule saith, The faithfull that are dead, are fallen a sléepe in Christ: But that sléepe which the Apostle doth here speake of, is to sleepe in ignorance, darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sinne. The way of the vngodly is called darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and shadow of death. To wake vp this kinde of slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and rebuke the world of sinne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.15.</note> is my chiefe intent and purpose in this booke. Which is, no doubt, a thanklesse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and a verie vnthriftie occupation, <hi>veritas odium parit,</hi> truth neuer goeth without a scratcht face: he that will be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie with <hi>vae vobis,</hi> let him looke shortly for <hi>coram nobis.</hi> So long as Micheas prophecied victorie against the Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, he was a trim Prophet: but after when he tolde them the contrarie, they had him in great disdaine. When our Sauiour Christ fedde the people,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 8.</note> they woulde haue made

                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.</note> but after when he began to rebuke their naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie manners, they desired to haue him crucified: euen so in these dayes, our daintie eares can hardly abide to heare our vices touched: Much like the foolish Asse, that when he is a loading standeth stocke still, but in taking the load off his backe, doth yearke out behinde. It may aptly be saide vnto our people, as Martiall the Poet saide once to his friends, My friendes (saith he) you will imbolden me to speake the truth, and the truth is this, that you can not abide to heare the truth. He therefore that will boldly vtter his conscience without feare or flatterie, shall hardly escape without immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent daunger. Notwithstanding how odious and despised soeuer Gods Prophets shall séeme to the eyes of the world, they must not be afraid to speake the truth, &amp; to beate down the infection of sinne and wickednesse. How dangerous soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be for Lot to reproue the filthinesse of the Sodomites, yet must he not cease to say vnto them.<note place="margin">

And whosoeuer is infected with any of the saide vices, be sure he is possessed with a great captaine diuel, which must of necessitie be cast out, or els of force the man must perish.

The people so louingly linckt in league with the diuel, their eares are so deafe, their sences so dull, their willes so obstinate, and their harts so barren, as they haue neither sence to tast, stomackes to disgest, nor harts to credit, except it feede their filthie infected humors.

Hypocrisie and

In times past, he that held by violence that was not his owne, or conuerted other mens goodes to his owne vse, or sought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by fraudulent or violent meanes to take away their lands or liuings, was accounted a théefe, and the lawes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed seuerall punishments, and kindes of death, according to the qualitie of the offence.

            <p>Gods building is compared to a stone wall, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates &amp; ministers, vnto squared stones framed on each side, and the people vnto litle ones filling vp in the midst: and if any of the squared stones chaunce to slip down, a number of the litle ones will follow: euen so, if the Magistrate, or tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher chaunce to fall, the people will follow after by heapes, yea if the one do but limpe, the other will halte right down, and therefore they especially must haue their rough knobs of vices hewen away, and be closely ioyned together with the morter of vnitie and concord, not onely in respect of them selues, but also of the common people, whose affections euen by nature, do giue more credit to their eyes, then their eares, and be more aptly led by example then by perswasion: and therefore more auaileth déedes without wordes, then words without déedes. That good Emperour Alexander Seuerus, hauing sent for Origene to instruct him in Christs religion, would often say, that the concord, humilitie, patience and charitie which he saw amongst the christians did more moue and stirre him vp, to belieue that Christ was the Sonne of

The people do heare much, but the poore can not finde their old reliefe: saying Preachers are good, but doing Preachers are better, happy is that parish where both hitteth in one man. But whosoeuer will marke it, shall find that a meane learned Parson of an honest conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, keeping a good house in his parish, shall perswade and profit more in coming to one dinner, then the best Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of diuinitie which keepeth no house shall do by preaching a dozen solemn Sermons. And that Gentleman who kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a good house in the countrie, shall bee in better credit with the people for his liberalitie, then the best Orator or lawier in England for all his eloquence. We see by dayly experience, that the Commons are not so louing, trustie, nor obedient to their superiors, as they haue beene in times past: the chiefe cause whereof, (no doubt) is this: whereas heretofore they haue found good cheare to satisfie their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they find nothing now but faire houses, and faire words without either care of their cause, or filling of their mawes.

It is an old Prouerbe, the more foole the more impudent: ignorance hath alwayes the boldest face: emptie vessels make loudst sound, &amp; such as haue least to say, are commonly most bold to speake: none so forward as blinde bayard. Vnskilful Hipercian blushed not to trouble Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with his rusticall dances, before whom cunning Orpheus was ashamed to tune his harpe: such arrogancie (no doubt) hath bin a great hinderance vnto learning. Many might haue come to wisedome, if they had not thought themselues there already. There is a certaine foresight, vnto the which vnripe yéeres can neuer come, til age bring discretion. Our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are but weake, our appetites variable, our senses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuable. and our desires vnprofitable: the dayes of our life are short and euil, and the knowledge we learne in long time vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and ful of errors: for as it is proper to God onely not to erre, so it is naturally giuen vnto man, seldome to hit the truth. And therefore yong men cannot be déepe of iudgment, because wisedome is gotten by experience, and experience in long time.
