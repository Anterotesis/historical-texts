         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Now as Concerning Virgins,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am moved and commanded of the Lord from the word of the Lord, which yet lieth upon me to you-wards who have taken upon you that name, but know not the Virgin ſtate, to you I ſpeak from the Lord, and to you I clear my conſcience in the preſence of the Lord, to you who have had a light ſhining within you, and have had the propheſies opened in your minds by the light, the light I own which did open the things of God, and gave you a ſight of them, and in this light you have ſeen ſomething of a fire which ſhould ſhould burn up the man of Sin, and all the luſts of the fleſh, and all luſts of uncleanneſſe, but you did not abide in this light to have theſe things fulfilled in you; but your minds turned from the light, and ſo the filthy luſtfull nature got up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the earthly will got up again, and now the light is vei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in you, and now from the darke mind and earthly wiſdome you talk of being paſſed through the fire, and through the death, but the fire of the Lord is yet to be revealed from heaven upon you, to burn up and conſume your wiſdom and knowledge in which you are exalted, and from which you ſpeak high ſwelling words of vanity, beguiling unſtable ſouls, drawing them into lightneſſe and liberty, and a carnall joy, and ſo keeps them from the Croſſe, and from obedience to the light of Chriſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and by this light which you are diſobedient unto, by it you are judged and condemned, and all your actions from that nature which is turned from the light in the conſcience which did once let you ſee a ſight of thoſe things, and by the unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire muſt that nature that now ruleth in you ſuffer and be burned up, which is got up to boaſt of great things, promiſing to your ſelves and others liberty when as your ſelves are ſervants unto Sin, and bondſlaves to Corruption.</p>
            <p>And all you who in the light have had openings and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies opened in your minds of the virgin-ſtate and of purity, but not waiting in the light which let you ſee theſe things, which light is within, and ſhined in you for a ſeaſon, &amp; this eſtate you ſhould have waited for to have been fulfilled within you; but your minds going forth from the light, are turned into the imaginations and imitations, and now the adulterous mind is got up again, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luth

over the pure, and you have not kept your virgin, and you are the fooliſh virgins, who have onely the name, but your light is put out, and you want oyl in your lampi, and the adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous natur which is full of fornication now reigneth in you, and the Prophet is ſlain within you which propheſied of theſe things, and the light darkned which let you ſee ſuch a condition there was to be enjoyed, and now the imitation is got up in the place where the light ſhined, and the Inchanter, and now by your inventions and imaginations form to your ſelves a virgin eſtate, contrary to the light of Chriſt, and contrary to the Spirit of God, onely from imitation in your wills, and ſo being ſenſuall ſeparate your ſelves, and do act in your own wills, and now divide and ſeparate between the husband and the wife, and he that is bound to a wife amongſt you, ſeek, to be looſe, and then you ſay you are ſeparated from the beaſtly luſt, and ſo form a ſeparation which is but outward and carnal, but are full of luſts, uncleanneſſe in the heart, &amp; there is no ſeparation in you, for you are turned from the light of Chriſt, which ſhould ſeparate you from the luſts of the heart, for he that luſteth in the heart, hath committed adultery though he be not joyned to a woman: and here you are out of the Doctrine of Chriſt, and on of the light of Chriſt, which pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Now a Virgin is pure, and kept from all pollutions, and from all luſts of the fleſh, and luſts of uncleanneſs, is not defiled nor polluted, but is kept pure in the light of Chriſt, and they are not defiled with women, and they are virgins who are redeemed from the earth, who follow the Lamb, whoſe garments are undefiled; and the virgin ſtate we witneſs who love the light of Chriſt which is pure, &amp; doth keep our minds pure, &amp; the pure water we do witneſs which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of, by which we are waſhed from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and the light of Chriſt we walk in, which is our guide and teacher, which will not ſuffer luſts to reign in the heart, nor any adultery to be committed, for in the light it is all judged and condemned, and all who love the light and walk in it, they are led out of all adultery and fornication, and they come to witneſſe the virgin ſtate. Now if a virgin marry ſhe hath not ſinned, but to you this is a myſtery whoſe minds are without, turned from the light into a ſenſuall ſeparation onely in the will, forbidding to marry, which is honorable in its place, and the bed undefiled, but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 4.</p>

Now in the preſence of the Lord I ſpeak, and from the light of Chriſt, to you all who are marryed, and who are unmarryed, and to the light of Chriſt in you I ſpeak; and your minds being turned to it to be your teacher, loving it, and walking in it, it will teach you that have Wives, to be as though you had none, and to uſe the World as though you uſed it not, and them that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not, and will lead you into ſingleneſs of heart and mind, and out of carefulneſs: Now there is a difference between a Wife and a Virgin, but I ſpeak not to feed any mans comprehenſion, but that every one may wait upon the Lord in the light of Chriſt for a cleer diſtinction and to come out of the deſtraction of your mindes and out of your Imitations to mind the light of Chriſt within you which will draw your minds within to be tanght of the Lord, and out of all the Luſts of the fleſh, which all they live in who are turned from the light into the Imaginations and Imitations, and ſo are ignorant of the Scriptures and of the ſpirit which ſpoke them forth. Therefore I ſay unto you who through your vain Imaginations, ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and woman, and ſay that there ſhould be no begetting nor bringing forth after the fleſh, and ſo looks without being turned from the light into the Imaginations, and evill thoughts Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, to you, I ſay, have you not read that he which made both Man and Woman at the beginning, made them male and female, and they were no more twain but one fleſh, what therefore God hath joyned together let no man put a ſunder: now to the light of Chriſt in all your Conſciences, I ſpeak, which lightſhines in darknes but the darknes comprehends it not, but all who do love the light to be taught and guided by it will lead you out of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and out of your own wills from which your Imitations are formed, and will let you ſee that you are out of the Virgin eſtate for your Lamps are not trimed, neither are you obedient to the light in your Conſcience which leads unto Chriſt and gives enterance to the bridegroom, but you whoſe light is gone out and have not been obedient to it, which hath ſhined within you and you are they who are ſlumbering and dreaming in your Notions, thoughts and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, you filthy dreamers who hath defiled the fleſh, and the night is upon you and now is the Cry in the night, he that hath an Ear to hear let him hear, for now is the bridegroom coming, and they who wait in the light do hear the voice of Chriſt, and they come to witneſs his preſence and do enter into the bride chamber, but you, whoſe minds is turned from the light you are ſhut out as the fooliſh Virgins though you would be owned by them who walk in the light, but can have no fellowſhip with you who hate the light and walk in darkneſs, for light hath no fellowſhip with darkneſs, and here you are ſhut out from the children of light and from Virgins, for Virgins are chaſt and ſober minded, but you who have the name but not the power you are rude and wild and live in lightnes, and wantones, and folly which the ſaints was redeemed from, and ſo you are without in the world among the dogs and ſwine

ariſe in you, now you make merry and rejoice over the witneſs, and now you are at eaſe, and take liberty in the fleſh, and ſo feeds that which is for Judgment, and muſt now be judged by the Juſt, who have turned out of the way from the light of Chriſt in you, and ſo all that you have known or paſſed through is not accepted, for you muſt be brought back to the entrance to the light in your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that in it you might ſee where you turned out of the way, and ſo loſt your guide, and ſo are backſliders being turned back again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earthly nature, and now by the light of Chriſt which your minds are gone out from, which light ſhines into our hearts, by it we ſee you walking in darkneſs, and from your earthly wiſdom tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of old experiences which once in the light you ſaw; but this light will now condemn you for turning from it, and being diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to it, for now is the true light ariſing and riſen, by which the world ſhall be judged in righteouſneſs, which will bring you under Judgment; and a day of trouble ſhall come upon you, ſuch as never was from the beginning of the world, wherein all you muſt be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged who live without the fear of God, and are got into a carnal reſt and ſecurity, and into a fleſhly liberty, and ſay whatſoever you do, it is not ſin, and that you cannot ſee ſin, and ſo your eye is blinded, and you hate the light of Chriſt in you, which ſhould let you ſee your ſins, and ſo you are yet in your ſins, and cannot witneſs any redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, nor through obedience in the Croſs, and ſo whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you do profeſs in words, or what experience ſoever you have known or paſſed through, all your profeſſion I deny, and all your experiences who do not now experience the daily croſs of Chriſt, nor do not walk anſwerable to the light in your conſciences, for by it you muſt all be judged, and all your joy and carnall rejoycing in your fleſhly liberty, ſhall be turned into ſorrow and bitter lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Lord of Hoſt hath ſpoken it, who will perform his word.</p>
            <p>The word of the Lord to all you who do wait for, and expect to ſee a Chriſt come without you, with a carnal eye; and to ſee an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward power and outward ſignes and miracles to be wrought without you whereby the world ſhall be convinced, and gainſayers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and thoſe things you look for carnally to be fulfilled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you, and ſo are the adulterous generation, which ſeeks after a ſigne, and there ſhall be no ſigne given you but the ſigne of the Prophet Ionah; and as Ionah was 3 days and 3 nights in the whales belly, ſo ſhall the ſon of man be 3 days and 3 nights in the heart of the earth. Now you whoſe winds are without, looking for outward things, your waiting is in vain, for you never came to ſee the things fulfilled, nor brought to paſs which you wait for: Therefore to you I ſay, turn your minds within, to the light of Chriſt, to wait in it, that you may know the things fulfilled within you: for the comming of Chriſt is within, and that which convinceth of ſin is within, the light of Chriſt, in the conſcience, and this being hearkned unto and obeyed, it gives power againſt ſin, and this power we witneſs made

manifeſt within us, and this power we have received from Chriſt which doth convince the world of ſin, and by this power the gainſayers are convinced, and this is the ſame power as ever was, and the ſame Chriſt as ever was; and the ſame eternal words of God we do witneſs which was in the beginning, which word is Chriſt; and we do ſpeak it forth in his own power, as we have received it; and this word of power we have, which makes the Devils to tremble, and makes the Heathens to rage, and by it marveilous works are wrought; for now do the blind ſee, the deaf hear, and the lame walk; and they who many years have walked in darkneſs and trouble of mind, and terrour of conſcience, and under many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, who have ſpent their time and money upon Phyſitians and Pariſh Prieſts, and have not been healed or cured, are now reſtored and healed freely, without money and without price; and the Lepers are cured, and the Leproſie is taken away, and the poor receive the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this we witneſs to be fulfilled in us, and in the world where this Goſpel is, and where it hath been preached; and this is the everlaſting Goſpel which is now preached, which we are witneſſes of, and Miniſters of according to our meaſure; and this Goſpel is not the Letter, for many poor ſouls who have been many years in trouble, and found no peace nor ſatisfaction, have had the Letter and it hath adminiſtred no comfort unto them though they have applyed the promiſes to that which was wounded yet they have not been eaſed, but are ſtill in trouble til Jeſus Chriſts glad tidings did appear, who is the Goſpel, and the glad tidings; and they who witneſs him come and made manifeſt, they do witneſs a freedome and deliverance out of this condition, which they could not doe while their minds was without, looking for a Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and for a power without; and to find life from the Letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and this we witneſs to be but a dead Letter, and did give us no life at all, but we were kept in darkneſs and blindneſs while we called the Letter the light, and the Letter the word, and the letter the rule, but now the true light hath appeared, which lets us ſee that Chriſt is the light which lighteth every one that cometh into the world; and in this light we ſee that God is the word and not the Letter, for the word was in the beginning, but the letter was not in the beginning, and in this light we ſee that the Letter without us is not the rule, but the ſpirit which gave it forth, and this ſpirit is within which is our rule, and brings us to walk according to the Letter which was ſpoken forth from the Spirit, which was their guide &amp; rule which ſpake it forth, for the propheſie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt; and the ſame ſpeaks now in Sons and Daughters as they are moved, and do witneſſe the Scriptures to be fulfilled in us, and Chriſt to be in us which you look for without you, and this power which doth convince of ſin within, and the word is within in the heart; by which word we are ſanctified and
