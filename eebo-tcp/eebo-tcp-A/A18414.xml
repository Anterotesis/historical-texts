            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause in most opinions of transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a most asinine error hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eare and head, that men must attempt it as a mastery in rendring any originall into other language, to doe it in as few words, and the like order; I thought it not amisse in this pore portion of translation; to pick out (like the rotten out of Apples if you please so to repute it) apoore instance or two that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to demonstrate a right in the contrary. And the rather I take this course ocularily to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with example of what I esteeme fit to saue the liberty and dialect of mine owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; because there are many valetudinaries, that neuer know the goodnesse of their stomacke till they see meat afore them.</p>
            <p>Where therefore the most worthy Satyrist, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the differences of pages that attend the Lord and the guest at the table, and expresses the disdaine of the Lords page to attend his guest; he speakes for his pride thus;
<q>
                  <l>— sed forma sed aetas</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>digna supercilio</hi>— Which I take out with this bold one:</l>
               </q>
               <pb facs="tcp:5191:4"/>
               <hi>And to say truth, his forme and prime beside May well alow him some few grains of pride.</hi> To speake truth, is too much, you say; I confesse it, in policy; but not in free and honest poesie. In the other, the words are vtterly altered; it should be so, to avoid verball seruitude. But the sense, I might wish my betters could render no worse. It followes: where hee sets downe the difference betwixt the Lords bread and the guests; where he hath plaid vpon the coursenesse and mustinesse of the guests pantry; he differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his Lords thus;
<q>
                  <l>Sed tener &amp; niveus, mollique siligine factus,</l>
                  <l>Servatur domino. <hi>Which I thus</hi>;</l>
                  <l>But for his bread, the pride of appetite,</l>
                  <l>Tenderly soft, incomparably white,</l>
                  <l>The first flowre of fine meale subdu'd in paste</l>
                  <l>That's a peculiar for my Lords owne taste.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>O this you will say is a bold one; which I am too bashfull to answere otherwise then thus, that here the purest bread affects a full description; which I amplifying no more then is needfull for the full facture of it; if I be ouerflowing, my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is arid; but who would not greedily here haue falne vpon snowy? it lying so faire for him,
<pb facs="tcp:5191:5"/>
put soft faithfully in his proper place, and would euer haue dreamed of subdu'd in paste? because it was not put in his mouth. And I hope it will seem no ouer-broad bold one, to enter where the purest bread out of industry, should make his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected apparance. A number more out of this of no number, I could instance, that would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men made of greatest number to imitate. But all mastery hath his end, to get great men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. It is the outward not the inward vertue that preuailes. The candlestick more then the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, is the learning with which blind fortune useth to preferre her fauorites. And who but the spawnes of candlesticks (men of most lucubration for name) winne the day from such Dormise as wake sleeping; and rest onely in those vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and abhord knowledges, that no man either praises or acknowledges.</p>

they come to triall. In regard whereof, I will borrow so much of your patience, as that I may in a word or two examine the whole ground of this spectacle: Not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that I shall make it appeare to all vpright eares, that it is an action most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your wisedome (my gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne) and that this silly, this base, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible hayre on this Herse supported, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues no thought of honour, but what it well deserueth. <hi>Etiam capillus unus habet umbram suam,</hi> was the saying of your master <hi>Seneca</hi>; and may not your Highnesse goe one step further, and say, <hi>Etiam capillus unus habet urnam suam?</hi> To enter into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place of womens hayre, I list not; though it would afford scope enough for my pen to play in; that Theame hath beene already canvast, and worne halfe threed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare by Poets and their fellowes. My mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not to exceede the compasse of this hayre, which we haue here in hand. This sacred beame falne from that sunne of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Poppaea;</hi> whose very name is able to giue it honour, though otherwise base. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit

hayre were of it selfe the most abiect excrement that were, yet should <hi>Poppaeas</hi> hayre be reputed honourable. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that hayre is noted by many as an excrement, a fleeting commodity, subiect to spring, and fall; &amp; he whose whole head last day was not worth one hayre, it shall bee in as good estate the next day as it was euer before: And such as last yeare had as faire a crop of haire as euer fruitfull head afforded; if there come but a hot summer; it shall bee so smooth that a man may slur a Dye on't. An excrement, it is, I deny not; and yet are not all excrements to be vilified as things of no value: for Maske, Ciuet, Amber, are they not all excrements? yet what more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the daintiest sense wee haue? Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture giues many things with the left hand, which Art receiues with the right: Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and other drugges are by nature poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: yet Art turnes them to wholsome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; so hayre though by nature giuen vs as an excrement, yet by Art it is made our capitall ornament. For whereas the head is accounted the chiefe member of the body,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5191:7"/>
hayre is giuen vs as the chiefe ornament of the head; I meane of womens heads; for men haue other ornaments belonging to their heads, as shall hereafter appeare more largely. And howsoeuer hayre fals within the name of excrement; yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore the argument of a rancke or rich soyle where it growes, and of a barren where it failes; for I dare bouldly pronounce in despight of all paltry prouerbs, that a mans wit is euer rankest, when his hayre is at the fullest. I say not his wit is best, but ranckest; for I am not ignorant, that the ranckest flesh is not alwayes the soundest, as the ranckest breath is not alwaies the sweetest. And thus much more I will adde for the generall commendation of hayre, that nature in no part hath exprest such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and subtill skill as in this (as wee terme it) excrement; for what more excellent point of Art can there be, then to indurate and harden a thinne vapor into a dry and solid substance?

breathe and steame from the quintessence of the braine, through those subtill pores of the head in which they are fashioned and spunne by natures finger into so slender and delicate a thred; as if she intended to doe like the painter that came to see <hi>Apelles,</hi> drew that subtill lyne for a masterpeece of his workmanship. And besides the highest place giuen to the hayre, and singularity of workmanship exprest in it, Nature hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed it with this speciall priuiledge, and left therein so great an impression of her selfe, as it is the most certaine marke by which we may ayme at the complexion and condition of euery man; as red hayre on a man is a signe of trechery, what tis in a woman, let the sweet musique of rime inspire vs; a soft hayre chicken-hearted; a harsh hayre churlish natur'd; a flaxen hayre foolish brain'd; what a black-hayr'd man is aske the prouerbe; if ye beleeue not that, aske your wiues; if they will not tell you, looke in your glasses, and ye shall see it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on your foreheads. So that nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing honoured hayre with so great a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5191:8"/>
of her fauour, why should wee not thinke it worthy all honour in it selfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any addition of other circumstance. And if Nature hath grac't the whole Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with this honour, may not euery flower challenge his part? If any hayre, then this hayre (the argument of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent mourning) more then any: But wee must not thinke (Princes and Senators) that the vndanted heart of our Emperor, which neuer was knowne to shrinke at the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chering of his owne mother <hi>Agrippina</hi>; and could without any touch of remorse, heare (if not behold) the murther of his most deare wife <hi>Octavia</hi> after her diuorce; wee must not thinke (I say) this Adamantine heart of his could resolue into softnesse, for the losse of a common or ordinary hayre. But this was (alas why is it not) a hayre of such rare and matchlesse perfection, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yee take it by the colour or by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as it is impossible for nature in her whole shop to patterne it: So subtill and slender as it can scarce be seene, much lesse felt; and yet so strong as it is able to binde
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5191:9"/>
               <hi>Hercules</hi> hand and foot; and make it another of his labors to extricate himselfe. In a word it is such a flowre as growes in no garden but <hi>Poppaeas</hi>; borne to the wonder of men, the enuie of women, the glory of the Gods, &amp;c. A hayre of such matchlesse perfection, that if any where it should be found by chance, the most ignorant would esteeme it of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite value, as certaynely some hayres haue beene. The purple hayre of <hi>Nisus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his kingdome and life depended, may serue for an instance. And how many yong gallants doe I know my selfe, euery hayre of whose chin, is worth a thousand crowns; and others (but simple fornicators) that haue neuer a hayre on their crownes, but is worth a Kings ransome? At how much higher rate then shall we value this hayre, which if it were not <hi>Poppaeas,</hi> yet being such as it is, it deseru'd high estimation; but being <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paeas</hi> (if it were not such) it can bee worth no lesse. When therefore a hayre of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is fallen like an Apple from the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Tree, can the losse bee light?

Albeit I must adde this for the qualifying of your griefe (most sacred Emperour) that this diuine hayre is not vtterly lost; It is but sent as a Harbenger before, the rest must follow it: And in the meane time this remaines in bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed estate; it is at rest; it is free from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incombrance which her miserable fellowes that suruiue are dayly enforc't to endure.
