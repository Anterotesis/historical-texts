            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Secretary Declared in Parliament that he was obliged at <hi>London</hi> to reſtore the Originals of the Letters D. and E. but that he was ready to atteſt upon Oath that the Copies produced were true Copies of the Letters ſhowen to him as Originals, and which he indeed believed to be Originals. And for a confirmation of the Truth both of the Originals and Copies of the Letters D. E he offered to have the following matter of Fact verifyed upon Oath by the perſons concerned who had indeed been Examined by the Committy.</p>
            <p>The matter of Fact is this, upon Information given at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>December</hi> laſt that on Captain <hi>Maire</hi> who has lived for the moſt part in <hi>England</hi> was going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon ſome unaccountable Deſigne, four Officers were privatly ordered to catch him and ſearch him for Letters which they accordingly did, on the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> ſeiſing on him not far from the Borders: They found on him only one Letter which they read, and finding nothing in it but as they imagined about <hi>Trade,</hi> they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keeped him nor it. But its plain that this was the Anſwer which <hi>Gray</hi>'s expreſs was to bring from <hi>Balfour,</hi> and conſequently the Anſwer to my Lord <hi>Melfort</hi>'s Letter which <hi>Gray</hi> had received and ſent to <hi>Balfour,</hi> and which Anſwer <hi>Gray</hi> ſayes ſhould be ſent to <hi>Melfort</hi> with all imagineable care: For the Letter which the Officers read was ſigned <hi>Balfour,</hi> and directed to <hi>Gray,</hi> as they owned at their Return to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they or any other could know the import of their Error, and which they now owned again to the Committee. The Time too quadrats, <hi>Gray</hi> ſays on the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> that he had ſent an Expreſs to <hi>Balfour,</hi> which poſſibly he had ſent the day before or ſooner, or only the ſame day; but at which time ſoever he ſent the Expreſs its no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſayes expreſly in his Letter of the <hi>25th. I have now at this time a Meſſenger with</hi> James Balfour; ſo the Anſwer might well be found with a Bearer on the <hi>26th.</hi> which is confirmed too by the Character of <hi>Maire,</hi> who has now fled for it.</p>
            <p>To all this it is added that it can be made appear by other proofs than thoſe here mentioned that there was a Deſigne in the <hi>North</hi> this Winter. That one was ſent from the <hi>Late King</hi> to mannage and carry on that Deſign. That his <hi>Instructions</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted and concerted by thoſe about the <hi>Late King</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Miniſtry: That my Lord <hi>Melfoort</hi> was the Original Procurer of theſe <hi>Inſtructions.</hi> That the nature of the Deſign and the Character of the perſon employed were of a Peece that is <hi>equally bad,</hi> that the perſon employed did actually come to the <hi>North.</hi> That he is an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, That he returned to <hi>London</hi> in the Spring, and in all probability will be found where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
