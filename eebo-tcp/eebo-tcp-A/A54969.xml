         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Hope the care we have taken, in endeavouring to get the moſt correct Copies
of the following <hi>Songs,</hi> has rendred this Collection as perfect as any of thoſe
five Books already printed: However, if ſome ſmall Errors ſhall be found (tho'
we hope the contrary), as we dare not pretend to Infallibility, ſo we hope
you will not attribute them to our neglect, but rather to our unhappineſs, in not having
an opportunity of communicating ſeveral of theſe <hi>Songs</hi> to the Authors themſelves
before they were printed off, as well as to the common Infirmity of the Preſs. For,
tho' moſt of theſe were printed from the Authors own Copies, yet ſeveral of them
were only Tranſcriptions, but thoſe, ſuch as we thought likewiſe faithfully done. To
prevent the hazard for the future of printing a Song contrary to the Author's own
Compoſition, we become Petitioners to you (which we hope in juſtice to your ſelves
you will eaſily grant), That when you have made any new Songs, you will be pleaſed
to leave Copies of them under your own hands, either at Mr. <hi>John Playford</hi>'s Shop in
the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi> or at Mr. <hi>John Carr</hi>'s Shop at the <hi>Middle-Temple</hi> Gate, and then we
do faithfully promiſe forthwith to print them from ſuch Copies, whereby you may be
aſſured to have them perfect and exact. This, as it will prevent ſuch as daily abuſe you,
by publiſhing your Songs lame and imperfect, and ſinging them about the Streets
like ordinary Ballads; ſo it will particularly oblige,</p>

or, <hi>A New and Choice Collection of Songs and Dialogues,</hi>
will (I doubt not) be very acceptable to all
knowing Gentlemen in the Skill of <hi>Muſic,</hi> for
ſeveral Reaſons I here mention: Firſt, That moſt of
theſe <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Dialogues</hi> were Compoſed by the
Eminent Dr. <hi>John Blow,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henry Purcell,</hi> my
ever kind Friends, and ſeveral other able Maſters,
from whom I received true Copies, which were by them peruſed, before
they were put to the Preſs. Secondly, That here is added two excellent Songs
long ſince out of Print, <hi>viz. go Perjur'd Man,</hi> ſet by Dr. <hi>Blow;</hi> and that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
<hi>When Death ſhall part us from our Kids,</hi> ſet by Mr. <hi>Matthew Lock;</hi> which
two are here (with much Care) exactly true printed, by the Diligent
Pains of my Father Mr. <hi>John Playford,</hi> whoſe known <hi>Skill</hi> for printing of
<hi>Muſick,</hi> our Nation is not ignorant. And laſtly, This excellent Book
may be joyn'd and bound with the three former, will make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Volume: Notwithſtanding all this Care and Pains, I muſt expect
ſome of our <hi>New Pretenders</hi> to Publiſh and Print <hi>Muſic,</hi> will be diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
this Book, thereby to gain Credit and Cuſtom to their own: But I
paſs them over in Charity, with <hi>Go on and Proſper;</hi> not doubting, but this
(when it comes to the hands of Judicious Gentlemen, and Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Muſic)</hi> they will find the difference; to whoſe Judgments I ſubmit,
and ſhall always endeavour to expreſs my ſelf,</p>
