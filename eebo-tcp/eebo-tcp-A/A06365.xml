         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and moſt Faithfull
Subiects and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
the Dukes,
Peeres, ancient Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of your Crown,
and principal Lords
of your Kingdome; ſeeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which inviron you, and the euills
which threaten your State with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9294:9"/>
ſubuerſion, if ſpeedy order
be not taken, and that they are denied
all acceſſe vnto your Perſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they might freely, and ſecurely,
diſcouer the cauſes, and propound the
remedies thereof; doe in all humilitie
beſeech your Maieſtie to take in good
part, this their moſt humble <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance,</hi>
which cannot but well befit
their mouthes, ſithence it doth teſtifie
nothing but fidelitie and affection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your ſeruice, to the conſeruation of
your Sacred Perſon, and the good of
your States. And it is by ſo much the
more conuenient, becauſe they are
thereunto obliged, both by Diuine
and Humane Lawes, by the Oath
which they haue taken, and the dutie
which they owe vnto your Crowne.
We are not ignorant, that the euill is
diſguiſed by thoſe who doe it, and
who labour by all poſſible meanes to
couer it, as well as commit it, ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuouring
to make thoſe diſtaſtfull
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9294:9"/>
vnto your Maieſtie, who complaine
thereof. And the vnhappineſſe of
<hi>France</hi> is ſuch, that they hauing all the
power of your Eſtate in their hands,
they cauſe you to hold your faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
ſeruants for Enemies. But the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of their Tyrannicall carriage is
growne to that exceſſe, that it cannot
longer be indured; The complaints of
it are generall; euery one ſeeth it, and
feeles the miſerable effects; And their
Artifices can no longer hinder the
cryes, and publique griefe from ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
your Maieſties eares, and from
mouing your compaſſion to releeue
your People; and your iuſtice againſt
the Authours of ſo great miſeries;
which euery one knoweth, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deteſteth; And by a common vow
of your faithfull Subiects are deſtined
to iuſt puniſhment, according to their
demerits.</p>
            <p>The inſatiable ambition, and aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Anchre,</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9294:10"/>
his Wife is the only cauſe of the euils
we are ſenſible of; of the diſorders we
ſee, and of that wee feare moſt.</p>
            <p>This is the vlcer which hath feſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yea, ſpoyled the whole body of
your State. It is of him only that men
doe complaine, and of the Miniſters
and Executors of his violent and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
paſſions, and no other.</p>
            <p>This is the complaint of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part of your Subiects, who as yet
haue true French hearts: who ſeeing
themſelues compaſſed about with
feare and apprehenſions, and expoſed
to all manner of dangers, by the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
conſpiracies which ayme at the
ruine of your State, doe implore your
Iuſtice, to protect them from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
and ſeruitude, vnto which
thoſe perſons would make them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect;
and for to free your Crowne
from the many diſaſters, which now
increaſe to the ouerthrow of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The remedy <hi>(SIR)</hi> is in your own
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9294:10"/>
hands, and in your power, which if
you doe not make vſe of, the diſeaſe
will ſhortly grow incurable: And
therefore to ſhunne it, the cauſe muſt
be taken away, which being knowne
vnto you, there needeth now no other
thing then your word only; to giue
order that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Anchre,</hi>
with his Wife and Adherents, be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from your Sacred Perſon, and
from the Queene your Mother: And
to giue way vnto Iuſtice, that it may
duly puniſh them for thoſe crymes
whereof they are culpable touching
your State.</p>
            <p>Euery man well knoweth what
deceit hee hath vſed, ſince the death
of the laſt King of moſt happy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
to draw vnto himſelfe th' entire
and abſolute Adminiſtration of your
Kingdome; to make himſelfe Maſter
of your Councels, of your Treaſure,
of your Armes, and of your Fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to diſpoſe of your publique Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9294:11"/>
and Charges, your Fauours, and
Pardons; becauſe hee would bee the
ſole Iudge of Honours, and Dignities,
and diſpoſe of the life and death of
your Subiects. The courſes hee hath
taken to baniſh the Princes of the
Bloud from the Court, and to breed
diſcord betweene them, are not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne;
and likewiſe of the reſt of
the Princes, Officers of your Crowne,
and principall Lords of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
The practizes and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which he hath vsed to weaken and
depresse the authoritie of your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and violently to choke the
lawfull freedom of their <hi>Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
impriſon your chiefe Officers, and
make a diuision through all the orders
of your Kingdome; that hee might
haue the whole diſpoſing of them,
and raigne alone within the State, as
he doth now with an inſupportable
preſumption and inſolency, ſuppoſing
that nothing can reſiſt his ambitious
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9294:11"/>
Deſſignes, ſeeing that, through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
wrong and iniuſtice, hee hath
impriſoned the firſt Prince of your
Bloud; and by this audacious Action
violated the publike faith of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Loudun;</hi>' vpon the obſeruation
of which did depend the repoſe and
tranquillity of your State, which he
had rather plunge into the calamities
of a Warre, then to haue the maske
of your Royall Authority taken from
him; whereof hee makes his benefit,
and vſeth it as an Inſtrument, for the
deſtruction of your moſt faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſo manifeſt, &amp; his
proiects &amp; guile ſo plainly discouer'd,
that no doubt can bee made hereof.
And the ſtrange proceedings, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which he vſeth euery day vnder
your Maieſties name, againſt the
Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> vpon ſo notorious
pretexts, and forged imputations, that
euen the voice of the people ſerueth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9294:12"/>
for proofe enough to refute them; do
witnes ſufficiently, that the conſpiracy
is generall, againſt all the Princes and
Nobles of your Kingdome, who will
not ſtoupe to his tyranny, and can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
his plots, which he continually
puts in execution, thereby to ſubuert
the State.</p>
            <p>For what offence is the ſame Dukes,
ſauing only, that he is a Prince of the
moſt renowned Houſes of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
one that loues his Countrey,
ſeekes the peace of it, and who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
teſtified his zeale vnto your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
and acknowledgeth no other
Authority lawfull then your Maieſty?</p>
            <p>Hee complaineth of ſome iniurie
done him by one of his Tenants; and
that in contempt of the dignity of his
Office, he cannot freely exerciſe his
charge in his Gouernment.</p>
            <p>He hath proſecuted an execution
of ſome feodal rights within his owne
poſſeſſions, by the ordinary means of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9294:12"/>
Iuſtice, as vnwilling to loſe that which
his Predeceſſors left him: Perceiuing
ſome ſecret enterpiſes, ready to bee
executed vpon his Houſes, he proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as indeed he ought, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
defence and keeping of them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your Authority, and for your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
            <p>Theſe lawfull and neceſſary cauſes
are wreſted to his rebuke; nay, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him as a haynous crime and
Rebellion.</p>
            <p>We haue ſeen the Declaration that
hath bin publiſhed againſt him, vnder
your Maieſties name, and the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conditions vnto which hee doth
ſubmit himſelfe for his triall, and make
his innocencie appeare, which being
knowne vnto vs, we moſt humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
your Maieſty to be pleaſed to
protect the ſame, and not to ſuffer it to
be oppreſſed &amp; viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe
of <hi>Anchre,</hi> whoſe outrages and
offences we can no longer diſſemble,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9294:13"/>
becauſe our long patience hath not
hitherto ſerued for ought elſe, then for
to render it more audacious, and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
that we be no more vpbraided,
that our affection is ſo ſmall vnto your
Maieſty, that we are ſo ingratefull to
out Country, ſo diſloyal and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vnto our ſelues and to our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as to be ſilent, when we behold
the prodigious fauour of this Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
trampling thus inſolently on the
throate of your State, holding priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in his hands the firſt Prince of
your Bloud, treading vnder foot both
Lawes and Magiſtrates, emptying
your Coffers by his profuſions, conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
your people with exceſſiue
charges, and cauſing your Subiects to
be trecherouſly murthered, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
puniſhment at all. And for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of ſuch trechery and diſloyalty,
conferring vpon them the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of your places; depoſing and
diſcharging the chief Officers of your
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9294:13"/>
Councels and Parlements, bereauing
them of thoſe Titles &amp; Honors, which
their Age, their Vertue, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
haue purchaſed them; for to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
in their places his creatures, who
are perſons altogether vnworthy, and
vnexperienced for the manageing of
your State, being men borne in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and therefore enemies to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
men, and moſt proper to execute
his paſſions, what detrement ſoeuer
may enſue thereby to your ſeruice,
holding nothing vnlawful which may
aduance his paſſionate deſſignes.</p>
            <p>This is that which hath induced vs,
thus humbly to beſeech your Maieſty
to conſider the miſerable eſtate wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
your Kingdome is now brought,
and to apply, by your Wiſdome and
Authority, the neceſſary remedy,
which dependeth vpon your own wil,
and not to ſuffer either your name, or
your Armes to be employed to the
effuſion of your Subiects bloud, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9294:14"/>
oppreſſion of your Domeſticall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
for the maintaining of Strangers

and ſecurity in your Kingdom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire

bin broken, and ſet the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>

may be taken by conuenient meanes,
againſt the diſorders of your State; to
cauſe the Treaty of <hi>Loudun</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued;
call againe vnto you, and into

OF THE VICTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES
OBTAINED BY
the Prince of PIEMONT, from
<date>the 27. of Ianuary,</date> to the laſt of
the ſame Moneth.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the 27. of Ianuary at
night, the Prince of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
departed from <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerano,</hi>
with eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Foot, and foure hundred Horſe,
hauing left the reſt there, being as
many as made vp together, the
number of a thouſand Horſe, with
a thouſand Foote: and hee went
with a purpoſe to attempt <hi>Creuacore;</hi>
where being arriued before day, hee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9294:16"/>
cauſed thoſe ſtations and paſſages
of the Mountaines to be taken, which
border on the Valley of <hi>Seſia,</hi> ſpecially
thoſe of <hi>Guardabuzon</hi> and <hi>Guardella,</hi>
which are the moſt commodious for
the Spaniards ſending of fuccours; and
this was performed without the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of any loſſe, or hurt, from thoſe
of thé Towne and Caſtle. So ſoone
as it was day, our Men tooke a little
Hill fortified, which commaundeth
the Towne within Musket-ſhot, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
thoſe that held it, to flie and
retire into the Towne. The whole
day was ſpent in skirmiſhing, and they
within, being ſummoned by a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
that we might ſee whether they
would yeeld, returned Musket-ſhot
for anſwere, belike, to giue vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
thereby, that they ſtood in
little feare. In the euening before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
the Canon arriued, accompanied
by the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aldoſtans;</hi> two Regiments of
<hi>French,</hi> and foure Companies of <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins:</hi>
a thing almoſt incredible, that it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9294:16"/>
was brought in ſo ſhort a time, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the incommodious, hilly, and
difficult waies thorow which it paſſed.
All night long great diligence was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in planting a Battery, ſo that on the
29. day in the morning it was ready,
within halfe a Musket-ſhotte of the
Towne, and we began to batter a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Towre that flanked two cortines,
which within few houres was beaten
to the ground, and beſides, a breach
made in the wall. Whereupon our
Men aduanced couragiouſly to the
aſſault; whoſe reſolution being ſeene
by thoſe within, did ſo affright them,
that they retired, flying to the Caſtle;
though they could not be ſo quick of
foot, but that about threeſcore were
killed in the throng, as they ruſhed
out of the gate, and as many taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
            <p>The Prince not willing to loſe time,
the rather becauſe he knew, that there
were arriued in the Valley of <hi>Seſia</hi> two
thouſand Foote, and three hundred
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9294:17"/>
Horſe, ſent to the reſcue of this place;
diſpatched immediatly certaine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of <hi>Cuiraſsiers</hi> and <hi>Carabins,</hi> to
ſeize on a place, by which they who
were retired (as is touched before)
might haue fled, and gone to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,
cauſed the Canon to play on
them that withdrew themſelues to the
Caſtle, and whereas ſome part of them
made a ſtand on a little Hill, in the
mid-way from the Caſtle, which did
much annoy our Men, they were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thence, it being not yet noone,
when all this ſeruice was performed.
From the ſame place of the batterie,
we began, without loſing any time, to
beate the Caſtle, wherwith they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
being terrified, ſeeing themſelues
brought to ſuch a ſtreight, made a
ſigne that they would parlee, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the place; and to that purpoſe, the
Sergeant Maior <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertua,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
there, ſent his <hi>Ayndante</hi> to

with life and Armes: whereto hee was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9294:17"/>
anſwered, that his Highneſſe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to grant it, the ſaid <hi>Ayndante</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
firſt declared, that he was autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed
to make a compoſition, and that
they treated in their owne names, and
not in the name of the Princeſſe of
<hi>Maſſerano;</hi> to whom alſo his Highnes
was willing to ſhew fauour, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſhee ſhould haue no diſpleaſure
done her, but bee permitted to goe
whither ſhee would. With this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
the <hi>Ayndante</hi> returned, and in
the meane while his Highneſſe gaue
order for the appointing of thoſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who ſhould haue the guard of
the Caſtle; but the Sergeant Maior,
who hauing bin made acquainted by
the <hi>Ayndante,</hi> with that which he had
concluded, ſhewed himſelfe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
therewith, but that hee would
depart with match in cocke lighted,
though the <hi>Ayndante</hi> replied, that hee
had fully capitulated in the aforeſaid
manner, fell to ſhooting anew. Euery
one maruailed at this ſtrange courſe,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9294:18"/>
the newes of the Compoſition being
now ſpred through the Campe; and
his Highneſſe commanded the batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſhould bee continued, which was
done throughly till dark night; during
which, our Men wonne ground by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, and made themſelues
Maſters of certaine Houſes and Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes,
which they within held in the
Mountaines. His Highneſſe on the
other ſide, made foure Peeces of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
to be drawne in all diligence to
the toppe of a Hill that was neere,
which by breake of day were readie
planted, to gall and offend the enemie
more; hauing obſerued, that from the
place where they were before, they
could not worke that effect which was
neceſſarie for the giuing of an aſſault.
At which inſtant, they within did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
demand Parle; and although
his Highneſſe, in regard of the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant

            <p>As the Enemy was ready to depart
out of the Caſtle, becauſe ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
was made about their carrying
of powder in their Flaskes, contrary to
the agreement, ſome of them threw
downe their powder, others their
Flaskes, and one of them hauing by

powder that lay on the ground was
thereby fired, and that likewiſe gaue
fire to the powder in the Flaskes, and
to certain barrels, from whence it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Muskets and Harquebuſes,
which ſome of them carried charged;
whereupon followed very lamentable

downe from the wall.</p>
            <p>While the reſt marched away, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9294:20"/>
Horſe, which his Highneſſe had giuen
them for their conuoy, according to
the agreement, that they might not be
moleſted by our Men; there came
one of our Light-horſe, with a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Enemies, who was hurt,
and had beene taken priſoner by him.
The newes he brought, were, that a
a good number of the Enemies Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers,
with ſome three hundred
Horſe, comming from the Valley of
<hi>Seſia,</hi> by the way of <hi>Guardella,</hi> to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
<hi>Creuacore,</hi> and the Horſe being
paſt the water, our Horſe, who were
there in guard, charging them reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
did breake and put them to
flight, ſlew twenty, tooke priſoners the
like number, and hurt many; and it is
not vnlikely ſome Chiefe hath laid his
bones there, becauſe there were taken
two Cornets, one of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain
called <hi>Auila,</hi> another of the Marqueſſe
of <hi>Santa Lucida.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Princes hereupon marched
inſtantly that way, with a greater force

of Horſe, and Foote, to giue a greater
blow, if the occaſion had ſerued, but
they found the Enemie alreadie reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The next day the Prince going

            <p>There was found the Caſſocke of
