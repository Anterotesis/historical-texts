            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE are told by good Hiſtorians, that
before Phyſick was reduced into Art
and Method, the Cuſtom was to carry Sick
Perſons into Streets and Markets, and ſuch
places of publick Concourſe, that they might
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29716:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have Opportunity to inform thoſe that paſſed
by what their Complaints were: And alſo
to hear what experienced Remedies they
could communicate to them. And this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
with Gods Bleſſing hath proved Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
to the Relief of Multitudes.</p>
            <p>I'le now tell you an excellent Specifick
that I have found admirably uſeful againſt
the Gout, eaſing all ſorts of Pains both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and internal, it is that excellent Drug
called the <hi>Calumback Wood:</hi> It corrects thoſe fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulent
Acrimonious Humours which afflict not
only the Joynts, but alſo the <hi>Perioſtia</hi> of the
Bones, the Muſcles of the Body, and the
Membranes of the Stomach and Bowels, and
by its Alcalizate Quality it deſtroys thoſe Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
which put Nature upon the Rack; and
this it doth by cleanſing and ſtrengthening,
without creating any diſturbance to Nature,
but leaving the parts more firm and ſtrong,
and leſs ſubject to receive new Defluxions,
whereby the returns of the Diſtemper are
much prevented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29716:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> obſerves, that amongſt
all the Diſeaſes into which the intemperance
of this Age diſpoſeth it, he had taken Notice
of none to increaſe ſo much within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of his Memory and Converſation, as the
Gout, nor of any of worſe Conſequence to
Mankind, becauſe it falls generally upon Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
engag'd in Publick Affairs, upon whoſe
Thought and Care the Service of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
very much depends; and therefore he tells
the World, that whoever propoſeth a way
of Curing and Preventing it, would do great
Service to States and Kingdoms, as well as
to private Perſons.</p>
            <p>I knew a young Merchant who had been
at the Bath for Pains and Weakneſs in his
Limbs, and found no Relief, he took the
Tincture drawn out of this Wood with Spring-water,
and in two Months time was ſtrangely
recover'd, and can walk ten Miles in a day.</p>
            <p>A young Gentlewoman extreamly afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Rheumatick Diſtempers, and by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29716:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
often into Hot-houſes to ſweat, had
brought her ſelf into Hectick Feavers, and
yet could find no Eaſe of her Pains, until
ſhe uſed the Spirits and Extract drawn out
of this Arthritick Wood.</p>
            <p>An old Gouty Gentleman, about Seventy
five Years of Age, who was Confined to his
Bed many Months, with great Extremity of
Pains, yet found Eaſe by the uſe of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
which he took ſometimes in Milk, and
ſometimes in Wine and Water, but continued
it a Month.</p>
            <p>A Gentlewoman about Fifty, who was Let
Blood ſeven times in a Year for her acute
and violent Pains, her Blood very foul, yet
found no relief, but grew every Day weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and fainter. I alſo directed her a Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Balſam, which is a kind of Potential Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
for it cauſeth Tingling, and a little
Pain in the Part for the preſent, and draws
out a moiſt Humour, and ſometimes fetches
off the Skin; this gave her great Eaſe, but
did not totally help her, until ſhe took the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29716:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Medicines drawn out of this Specifick Wood,
which ſhe did in Water-gruel, and ſometimes
in Tea and Coffee, and now ſhe hath had
Health and Eaſe many Months.</p>
            <p>A Humorſome Gentleman, much afflicted
with the Gout, unto whom I had recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Use of this Wood, objected againſt it
that 'twas an Outlandiſh Plant, and we had
Herbs enough in our own Gardens to Cure
our Diſtempers. I told him that Plea would
never become him nor my ſelf, who took ſo
much Tobacco, and drank ſo much Coffee:
Upon that he fell to the uſe of it, and finds
much Relief by it, more than by the two
former Drugs.</p>
            <p>A Virtuoſo of my Acquaintance told me,
he had read ſuch an excellent Account given
of this Wood in Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> and other Authors,
that he reſolved to try it, and has found it
anſwer his Expectation, and give him help in
ſuch a Diſeaſe which is worſe than Death,
for that Eaſeth us of all Pain, and this keeps
us in continual Torment.</p>
