            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Play, which I here recommend to your Protection, either through the Calamity of the Time, which made People not care for Diversions, or through the Anger of a great many, who thought themselves concerned in the Satyr, or through the want of taste in others, met not with that Success from the generality of the Audience, which I hop'd for, and you thought, and still think, it deserved; and I have the Judgment of Men of the best Sense, besides the best of the Poets, on my side in this Point.</p>
            <p>But no Success what-ever, could have made me alter my Opinion of this Comedy, which had the benefit of your Correction and Alteration, and the honour of your Approbation: And I heartily wish, you had given your self the trouble, to have review'd all my Plays, as they came incorrectly and in hast from my hands; 'twould have been more to my advantage, than the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> was to <hi>Terence;</hi> and I should have thought it at least as much to my Honour, since by the effects, I find I cannot but esteem you to be as much above both of them in Wit, as either of them was above you in Place in the State.</p>
            <p>I shall not, according to the Custom of Dedications, make a Decla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ion upon your Wit, the common Theam of all that have any, at least of such as know you, who will acknowledge, they have heard more of it drop carelesly from your Mouth, than they have ever seen from the labouring Pen of any other. And my greatest satisfaction is, that I have the Honour of his Friendship, and my Comedies have had his Approbation, whom I have heard speak more Wit at a Supper, than all my Adversaries, with their Heads joyn'd together, can write in a year. Nor are your Writings unequal to any Man's of this Age, (not to speak of abundance of excellent Copies of Verses) you have in the <hi>Mulberry-Garden</hi> shown the true Wit, Humour, and Satyr of a Comedy; and in <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the true Spirit of a Tragedy, the only one (except two of <hi>Johnson's,</hi> and one of <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s) wherein
<pb facs="tcp:61846:3"/>
               <hi>Romans</hi> are made to speak and do like <hi>Romans:</hi> there are to be found the true Characters of <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as they were; whereas a <hi>French</hi> Author would have made the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> both become <hi>French</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his Pen. And even our <hi>English</hi> Authors are too much given to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> History (in their Plays) Romantick and impossible; but in this Play, the <hi>Romans</hi> are true <hi>Romans,</hi> and their Style is such: and I dare affirm, that there is not in any Play of this Age so much of the Spirit of the Classick Authors, as in your <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> This Opinion I have, unbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ass'd by my Friendship, and the Obligations which I owe to you, often decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and shall always persist in.</p>
            <p>After all this, since my Comedies are approved and commended by you, and Men of your sort, the rest of the Audience must forgive me, if I am much more ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lted by the praise of such as you, than I can ever be humbled by their censure.</p>
            <p>Satyr will be always unpleasant to those that des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rve it. It was not my design in this Play to please a Bawd of Quality, a vain <hi>Selfish,</hi> a sensless, noisie <hi>Prig,</hi> a methodical Blockhead, having only a form of Wisdom, or a Coxcomb that's run stark mad after Wit, which uses him very unkindly, and will never be won by him; nor did I think to please the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in the Name. The three first of these Characters are wholly new, not so much as touch'd upon before, and the following ones are new in the greatest part. And till I see more variety of new Humour, than I have produced in my Comedies, and more naturally drawn, I shall not despair of bearing up near my Contemporaries of the first rate, who write Comedy, and of always surmounting the little Poetasters of the fourth rate, who condemn me; such as hold, that Wit signifies nothing in a Comedy; but the putting out of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, kicking down of Tables, falling over Joynt-stools, impossible accidents, and unnatural mistakes, (which they most absurdly call Plot) are the poor things they rely upon: But'tis the Opinion of the best Poets, that the Story of a Play ought to be carried on, by working up of Scenes naturally: by design, not accidents. I have endeavour'd to do so in this Play, and I doubt not, but the Scene in the second Act, wherein <hi>La. Busy</hi> would perswade <hi>Isabella</hi> to be kept, will live, when the Stuff of such Scriblers (more fit for Drolls than Plays) shall be consumed in Grocery-ware, Tobacco, Band-boxes, and Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases, and be rased out of the memory of Men.</p>
            <p>I should not say so much in my own behalf, if I had not met with palpable injustice from some, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se design is to set up Quacks, and put down true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors; nor can I find any Reason, why a Man that is to live by his Wit, should not vindicate that, when 'tis traduced, as well as he, who is to live by his Reputation, may assert his Honesty, when 'tis aspersed especially since neither of 'em are q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>alities of a Man's own making. But I must ask your pardon,
<pb facs="tcp:61846:3"/>
for troubling you so long with my Resentments, when I should be boasting of the many Favours you have done me, and giving you my thanks for 'em; yet I know you look for no returns where you oblige; however I am too proud of your Kindness to conceal it, and therefore shall take all opportunities I can publickly to declare my self,</p>

            <p>MAny Faults in the Printing have escaped, by reason of my absence, while the third and fourth Acts were in the Press: I shall only give you an account of some notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Errours; as Page 44. for 5 s. read 50 l. p. 47. for <hi>in favour</hi> r. <hi>infamous.</hi> p. 48. instead of <hi>

               </gap> of promiscuous speaking; and I found by venturing upon that new Thing, I ran a great Risque: For some, I believe, wish'd all the Play like that part of a Farce in it; others knew not my intention in it, which was to expose the Style and Plot of Farce-Writers, to the utter confusion of damnable Farce, and all its wicked and soolish Adherents. But I had rather suffer, by venturing to bring new things upon the Stage, than go on like a Mill-Horse in the same Round.</p>

               <p>There is a respect due from a Countrey Gentleman to a new Suit and Peruque, they must not be hastily put on. And the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this Town, if you don't take care of your own outside, will never let you be acquainted with their insides.</p>

               <p>Why she had always the fashion a month before any of the Court-Ladies, never wore any thing made in <hi>England,</hi> scarce washt there, and had all the affected new Words sent her, before they were in print, which made her pass among Fops for a kind of <hi>French</hi> Wit.</p>

               <p>But if there be any stirring of what kind soever, our empty young fellows will be sure to fill themselves with it, and prefer it to all the sence and good breeding of their own Countrey: But now we talk of <hi>France,</hi> I wonder we see not <hi>Carlos,</hi> he was expected from thence two or three nights since.</p>

               <p>At home they are alwayes roaring out <hi>Te Deums</hi> for <hi>Stealing</hi> of some Town or other: War and Equipage is their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which by the way is so Pompous, that should they conquer <hi>Europe</hi> they should scarce be savers.</p>

               <p>Very choice ones, we'l bring you where you shall enjoy 'em: there is a Widow lately come to Town who sets up for a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, has taken a good House, and lives very splendidly, I suppose with intention to put off her self and two Daughters, who are very pretty, one of which <hi>Bellamour</hi> is in love with.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>I make love to her, I confess, but 'tis a harmless Lambent flame, and aimes but at fornication; but <hi>Stanmore</hi> is in love with the other, and Heaven knows what that may end in.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Stan.</speaker>
               <p>I nave no designs upon her fortune, I aim only at her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I yet run at the whole herd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Car.</speaker>
               <p>Come, you know your own tempers, no more in love then in play, where those who are very stingy at first, will bleed deeply at last.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>This Widow, by name the Lady <hi>Cheately,</hi> has made her House the Rendevouz of Fools, Knvaes, Whore-masters, Ladies of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61846:8"/>
all sorts, and young Heirs: Amongst the rest of Fops, there is <hi>Young Maggot,</hi> one whom his Uncle, whose Heir he is, bred at the Inns of Court, and intended for the Law, but he has left that, and is run Wit-mad; thinks of nothing, endeavours at nothing, but to be a Wit and a Lover, and both in spight of Nature.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Stan.</speaker>
               <p>And though he has made Love and Wit his whole business, he is gotten no farther yet than to be thought a Wit by the Fools, and an Ass by the Witty men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Car.</speaker>
               <p>This is a choice Spirit: Indeed 'tis a general Folly; for Wit is a common Idol that every Coxcomb worships in his heart, though some Blockheads of business dissemble it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>But there is another Coxcomb of that extream vanity, that Nature amongst all her variety of Fops, has not produced the like: He draws all lines of Discourse to the center of his own Person, and never was known to speak, but I did, or I said, was at the beginning or end of it.</p>

               <speaker>Stan.</speaker>
               <p>He is lean as a Skeleton, and yet sets up for shape; he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Taylor twice, because his Shoulder-Bone sticks out.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>He thinks all Women in love with him, and all Men his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friends; he will make <hi>doux oeux</hi> to a Judge upon the Bench, and not despair of getting a Widow at her Husband's Funeral; thinks himself very well bred, and welcome at all times to all People, though sober among Drunkards, and without a Penny in his Pocket to Men deep at Play.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Car.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! I remember this Coxcomb, he has no fortune, and yet is always talking of Equipage and Dressing: 'Tis <hi>Selfish;</hi> but do any Women favour that Fop?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Stan.</speaker>
               <p>Oh yes! There is no more account to be given of their Love before they know Man, than their longings after; but both are most commonly for nauseous nasty things.</p>

               <p>Dear Madam, Let us not omit any occasion; but take every opportunity by the hand, to improve those Amours, which have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred us so happy, to be elevated above the reach of Envy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Sir, I should not entertain a thought, that might in any wise be prejudicial to our Amours, or the improvement thereof, if I were not so extremely obnoxious to the great infelicity of being subject to a Husband, whose Jealousie has so much the Ascendant over him, that it renders him so vigilant, not seldom to interrupt our happiest hours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lover.</speaker>
               <p>That turbulent temper does too often disorder the fair quiet of his own mind, as well as discompose ours; and Jealous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e proves as often an obstruction to his own tranquillity, as it does an impediment to our fruition.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
               <p>It is a priviledge too absolutely imperious (which by a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61846:31"/>
Conjugal right) our Husbands claim over us, to make so subtil a scrutiny into all our enterprizes, since they, with too great a regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entertain the least motion of ours, whereby we would insinuate into their Affairs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lover.</speaker>
               <p>But since Fortune (by so many frequent Signalizations) has demonstrated how much she is a friend to us, in assisting us with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Subterfuges, when most we have needed them, it will be a hainous tergiversation from her, to abandon that trust we formerly have repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in her, and she may justly take a Picque at our infidelity, and, in that Caprice, may contrive a revenge sutable to our delinquency.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
               <p>Rather Fortune may be apt to believe us too audacious, in tempting her with so much importunity, that it must needs be more vexatious than agreeable; and while we make such vigorous addresses to another Deity, for ought we know, Love may wax jealous of our Applications to it: For though he's blind, he can descry, and will greatly resent our Dereliction; and, when he is incensed, his Nature is highly vindicative.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lover.</speaker>
               <p>When Fortune takes such pains to assist us in our Amours, Love will certainly be very sensible of our Omission; and when he is once provok'd, he seldom buries Injuries in the grave of Oblivion.</p>

               <l>IN troubled Times, like these—the Ancients chose</l>

               <l>By such Diversions t'allay men's Fears,</l>
               <l>Compose their Minds, and mollifie their Cares.</l>
               <l>If they did well then, now your Mirth to raise,</l>
               <l>Were of such merit, you th'attempt should praise.</l>
               <l>But 'tis a Task too hard for Comedy,</l>
               <l>Which ne'r agen expects good Days to see.</l>

               <l>If noted Knaves or Coxcombs be the Lading:</l>
               <l>But this Proceeding would be too severe,</l>
               <l>Whom the Town scorns sure we may laugh at here.</l>
               <l>All Prodigies to publick Marts should come,</l>
