            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ANOTHER WORD TO THE WISE, Shewing that the <hi>Delay of justice,</hi> is great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. By displaying heavier grievances in petitions from severall Counties to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and letters to PARLAMENT Men, from Mr. <hi>John Musgrave</hi> Gentleman, one of the Commissioners from <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland,</hi> for presenting their grievances to the Parliament. Who instead either of redressing those two Counties grievances, or prosecuting the charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in by him against Mr. <hi>Richard Barwis,</hi> a Parliament man, for betraying his trust, in placing Traytors and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant officers in chief places of command, to the apparant ruin thereof and landing of the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels there, did illegally commit the said Mr <hi>John Musgrave</hi> to the Fleet, where he hath lain these 4. moneths, without any justice, or tryall of his businesse. For refusing to answer Interrogatories, otherwise then according to law by writing, or to stoop unto the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and illegall proceedings of a Committee, who admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the parties accused, to sit with their hatts on, and committeth the accusers to prison, though they themselves doe offer to suffer, if they prove not their charge by sufficient witnesses.</p>
            <q>Though hand joyne in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished. The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour, but the way of the wicked will deceive them. He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even both these are abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord.</q>

            <p>Here is a word to the Wise indeed! a great noise of hue and cry for a man that like worthy <hi>Nehemiah</hi> never ran away. Jt is a wonder that those few men should thinke all other men blind but themselves. What Butcher is so idle and undiscreet, as to send his blood-hounds abroad, to drive home an Ox, which he knoweth is already in his own back shop. Only it may be, that some time he will make great search for his knife, whilest it sticks in his teeth. And is it not as great a wonder, that they doe offer thus to search abroad for the Printer and divulger of that booke, and not seeke their owne fleet prison at home for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Mr. <hi>Iohn Musgrave,</hi> and owner of the chiefe parts thereof, whose name is so eminent and often therein expressed? Jt is most certaine, that such dealing cannot long prosper, more then <hi>Zimri</hi> did, who killed his master. But be of good comfort, the same God who sent the Ravens to feed <hi>Eliah, Ebedmelech</hi> the black-more to comfort <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> &amp; King <hi>Pharoahs</hi> baker to deliver <hi>Ioseph:</hi> will have the like care of you, and all that stand in the gap either for religion or the just freedome of the nation: Great cause have we to be jealous of many whom we have trusted with all that is nearest and dearest unto us in this world, and in whose defence so many thousands of lives, and such abundance of treasures have been spent, and such multitudes of Widowes and Orphans left in distresse; and still though persecuters and oppressors be changed, yet both persecution and oppression remaines. For although the Counsell-table, Star-Chamber and High Commission be put down, yet all the free born of this kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am given to understand that my petitions and letters of late published by some of my wel-wishers under the title of A word to the Wise, were delivered unto you by Mr. <hi>Peters</hi>; there is nothing in any of these petitions and letters which are mine, but I am ready to owne and avow; and if <hi>I</hi> may have but common justice and an equall hearing, I doubt not but to make good the same, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to law and truth I am informed that you alone have taken upon you to be my judge, and have already condemned me, and cast many vile aspersions upon me giving forth how I comply with the <hi>Scotts,</hi> to drive on some wicked designe of theirs, tending to the prejudice of the State, and undoing of my Countrey, which if it were true, then are you blame-worthy to passe by the same, and not to bring me forth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne punishment: for already you have given out sentence and adjudged me guilty though you never heard me speak, and (<hi>I</hi> suppose) never knew me by face: but howsoever, though I were guilty of that wherein you condemne me, yet it doth not beseeme you, nor any in the place of iudicature (as you are) to condemne any man unheard, and who is absent, nor to have respect of persons in iudgement; And none but unrighteous iudges, will doe so, for it is good and agreeable to law what <hi>Seneca</hi> saith. <hi>Qui aliquid statuerit altera parte inauditu aequum licet statuerit haud aequus est,</hi> He that determineth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth any thing, the one partie being unheard, although he determine and order that which is right, yet is he uniust. And this your doing is the more grievous, in that you insult over a poore prisoner, whom you now have in bonds, and so not in place to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for himselfe.</p>
            <p>I complaine of Traytors whom you suffer to walke at libertie, I have given in charges against them unto you, yet cannot get them brought to answer, whiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am cast into prison before any charge be brought against me, put to answer interrogatories, and no accusers comming against me. Traitors whom I accuse are continued in their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet almost foure months have I laine in prison, and know not for what, but hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, neither by friends nor petitions could I ever obtaine that favour and right (which of dutie you owe me, and all the free borne of this Kingdome) to have audience and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as a free man to answer for my selfe: for as you can exact no obedience of us further then by the law, so may we boldly claime iustice according to the law, which to deny us, is iniustice in you by the law.</p>
            <p>I am blamed because I decline the Committee, how should I expect any good from them, when they dare not or will not suffer our cause to be publiquely heard and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but doe shut their doores against both our friends and also against strangers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to law, yet suffer they our adversaries whom we accuse, to sit with their hats on, as Iudges in the cause, both permitting them and they taking upon them to examine us. O England (saith one) well in the like case, what's become of thy liberties? For if Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> spake truth or knew the law, that iudge who ordereth and ruleth a cause in his chamber, though his order or rule be iust, yet offendeth he the law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he rendereth is, for that all causes ought to be heard, ordered and determined openly in the Kings Courts, whether all persons may resort, and not in chambers or other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate places. See <hi>Cooke</hi> 2. part instit. fol. 103.</p>
            <p>And how can I assent unto the Committees demands, to bring witnesses to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before such a Committee as cannot, or is not authorized to administer an oath, and so consequently cannot determine or give any iudgement for or against the partie accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for that all matters of fact and causes criminall are to be tryed and determined by
<pb facs="tcp:51181:4"/>
the verdict of 12. men, upon the solemne oaths and depositions of witnesses. See <hi>Cook</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. part instit. fol. 163. And how can I without incurring the haynous sin of periury, submit unto the arbitrary proceedings and determinations of any Committee, being bound by solemne oath and protestation, to maintaine the lawes and iust liberties of the people, and that the proceedings, orders, and results of the Committees be arbitrary, and not regulated by the law. I need no further proofe, then that exorbitant and unlimitted power they take upon them, and daily exercise in seizing on free mens goods, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning their bodies contrary to law, For which if they should as they ought pay 500. l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a peece &amp; treble damages to every party grieved according to the statute of 17. <hi>Car.</hi> made for the abolishing of the Starchamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I beleeve they would not adventure so boldly to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>sed impunitas continuum affectum tribuit delinquendi,</hi> but neglect of punishment, giveth boldnesse to transgresse. Nay, I am verily perswaded, the whole estates of many of them, would not give halfe satisfaction for the wrongs done by them. That this law were put in execution against such lawlesse men is my earnest desire, and daily expect the same.</p>
            <p>But it seemes you are much displeased that we should impeach a member of your house, why? have you any priviledge to transgresse? To be a Parliament man, is it a good plea in Bar? I ever thought this warre had been undertaken for the preservation and defence of our lawes and iust liberties, and not for sheltering nor protecting any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents or offenders? Can it stand with your honours, your oaths, your trusts, your protestations and declarations to refuse the delivering up your delinquent members to the law, to slight our iust complaints, and to cast us into prison for complaining? Can it stand with iustice and law, for the trustees of the law, to plead priviledge and exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the law? Were not this to iustifie transgression by a law? Doth not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the law generally without any limitation or exemption concerne all equaly and alike? Is not the practice and execution, the very life and soule of the law? And what saith learned <hi>Cooke</hi>? neither can a iudge punish extortion, who is corrupted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, neither any Magistrate punish any sin as he ought, that is knowne to be an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therein himselfe.</p>
            <p>Therefore (saith he in the same place) it is an incident inseparable to good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Magistrates to whom the execution of the lawes is committed, to be principall observers of the same themselves, <hi>Cooke</hi> lib. 4. pref. Have not you complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned often times expressing great griefe, for that the King would not deliver up his evill counsellors and bad servants to be tryed by the law? and can we expect lesse from you, then you exact of others, even of the King himself? For my part, I cannot deem them lesse then guilty to themselves, who under pretence or shadow of any priviledge, goe about to avoide the tryall of the law, and so thinke to escape with <hi>Ioab</hi> by flying to the hornes of the Altar.</p>
            <p>If Mr <hi>Lisle</hi> (Chair man of the Committee, where unto our cause was referred, and under whose bare report without any further ground I suffer) had been as truely zealous for the law, as he would be accounted knowing in the law, and had been as faithfull in discharging his trust, by doing good offices for the publique, as he hath been ready to procure by his publique place in the house, contrary to the selfe denying ordinance, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and profitable offices to himselfe, he would not have laid our papers and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aside, to the great damage and danger of our Countrey, nor so falne upon us as guiltie persons by propounding interrogatories to insnare us, even before he had any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the House so to do, he would have not misreported to the house, that <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously refused to answer, whereas only according to law, <hi>I</hi> required time to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. He would not have (so contrary to law) denyed to have given me and my fellow Commissioner the interrogatories, nor hindered us to write them from his mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:51181:5"/>
Neither would he have refused to give us a reasonable time, to have advised according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the law, for answer, so (that either he must to his shame being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For it appeareth by Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> 2. part instit. fol. 51. that <hi>I</hi> ought by law to have had time allowed me wherein to advise for answer, his words be these. If any one be suspected for any crime, be it treason, fellony, &amp;c. and the partie be to be examined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on interrogatories, he may take a reasonable time to answer the same with deliberation, and the examinate (if he will) may put his answer in writing, and keep a coppie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and so it was resolved in Parliament in the case of Justice <hi>Ric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d of <hi>Comberland</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland</hi> to the Parliament) beare witnesse.</p>
            <p>As touching our charge against Mr <hi>Barwis</hi> and the rest, it is evident that they are to be tryed at the Common law, and thus I prove it, the charge is for treasons committed by them against the state. And in Magna Charta cap. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is declared, that no free man shall be taken or imdrisoned, or disseised of his free-hold, or liberties, or free customes, or be out-lawed, neither will we passe upon him, neither will wee sit in judgement upon him, but by the lawfull judgement of his Peeres, or by the law of the land, and to no man will we sell, deny, or delay justice or right. And hereby that crooked coard (as saith <hi>Cooke</hi> in 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part instit. fol. 56) of that which is called discretion appeareth to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, unles you take it as it ought to be taken <hi>discretio est discernere, per legem, quid sit justum,</hi> discretion is to discerne by the law what is just. And (there he saith) it is called right, because it is the best birth-right that the subiect hath, for thereby his goods, lands, wife, children, his body, life, honour and estimation are protected from injury and wrong, adding the words of <hi>Citero, Maior hereditas venit, unicuique nostrum a iure et <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>egibus, quam a parentibus,</hi> A far greater and better inheritance discends unto each one of us from iustice and the lawes, then from our parents. And in his proeme to his 3. part instit He urgeth that ancient maxime of the law, <hi>Misera servitus est, ubi ius est vagum vel incognitum.</hi> It is a miserable bondage, where the law is uncertaine and unknown.</p>
            <p>And in the 24. page of the same booke: he telleth us how treasons are to be tryed saying, there is another excellent branch of a statute made 1. <hi>et.</hi> 2. <hi>Philip. et. Mar.</hi> cap, 10. in these words, Be it further inacted by authoritie aforesaid, that all tryalls to bee had, awarded, or made for any treason, shall be had and used only according to the due order and course of the common law, which Statute is yet still in as great force as first when it was made, the same never being repealed, for according thereunto yee tryed the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> since this present Parliament began, who had as good right to have challenged his priveledge and exemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion from the common law (if any such appeale had been) as ever Mr. <hi>Barwis</hi> had or any other who so ever, and which doubtlesse hee would have done, and you have granted. At whose tryall <hi>I</hi> was, and you made use of mee as a witnesse against him, where <hi>I</hi> was examined viva voce upon oath, the Earle himselfe
<pb facs="tcp:51181:5"/>
having first answered his charge according to law: Whereby you may perceive it is plain and evident, that this our cause and charge is not proper nor pertinent to be tryed by any Committee, who are not authorized to administer an oath, whereby to put an end to any controversie, but altogether such courts of iustice as are inabled to begin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and end in a iudiciall way, <hi>per legem et consuetudinem Angliae,</hi> by the law and custome of this realme. For no priveledge of Parliament can hold or be pleaded in cases of treason, fellony, and the peace, <hi>Cooke</hi> 4. part instit. fol. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Herein there only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines then to be done on your parts, ro give up your delinquent members to the law, and we on our parts according to the same law, to make good our charge by adue and legall prosecution.</p>
            <p>And whereas you say, that <hi>I</hi> have combined with the <hi>Scotts,</hi> and drive on their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked desigoe, give me leave to tell you that <hi>I</hi> being driven into exile through the crueltie of those unnaturall vipers and traytors of my owne countrey, who joyned with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish conspirators in this great rebellion, to ruine our state and countrey, they thirsting after my blood; and thinking to devoure me, profered large sums of money, to such as could apprehend me, <hi>I</hi> was forced to fly for my life, not being able of my selfe, to resist their fury. After these your Committee men with us, had shamefully desarted me and this iust cause of the kingdome, and adhered to the enemie, <hi>I</hi> having then no other way open nor apparent meanes to escape with much difficulty and more danger, got (by Gods good providence) into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where <hi>I</hi> indured no small tryalls and troubles through the malignancie of some of their Ministers and such as they sturred up against me, taking occasion upon my non conformitie and refusall to come to their assemblies and high places, unto which <hi>I</hi> could not submit nor ioyne my selfe.</p>
            <p>But after much and long strugling and contention with these Ministers, in the meane time labouring to walke inoffensively towards them and all others in all other things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the private meanes, and secret intelligence of some of my faithfull friends in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, then in bonds for the Parliaments cause, <hi>I</hi> discovered severall designes of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and our gentry against that state, for which <hi>I</hi> found such favour from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates there, that the governour of <hi>Drumfreis</hi> did take me under protection, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me from the persecution and violence of my adversaries there, wherein he shewed himselfe to be truly noble, and for which <hi>I</hi> cannot but acknowledge my selfe to be much bound unto him, yea and the more in that neither I nor any of my iudgement, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the like duty of love at home, notwithstanding the discoveries and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full services we have done, neither sparing our blood, nor regarding our estates for the good of the publique.</p>
            <p>After the reducement of <hi>Cumberland</hi> by the <hi>Scottish</hi> horse, upon my returne thither from <hi>Scotland</hi> (being in exile a yeare and a halfethere) some of Mr. <hi>Barwis</hi> favourers &amp; bosome friends (who knew me in <hi>Scotland</hi> and of the good service <hi>I</hi> had done there) threatned to root out me and all of my iudgement in our countrey. Neither did Mr. <hi>Barwis</hi> himselfe regard any honest man there, though here (as <hi>I</hi> am informed) he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be an Independant, but h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:51181:6"/>
prison, whiles <hi>I</hi> was at <hi>London</hi> soliciting this our countries cause, some of them being of the separation.</p>
            <p>Sir, I was the last Winter here in Town above 3. moneths, expecting that Mr. <hi>Blaxton</hi> one of the Burgesses for <hi>New-Castle,</hi> according to his undertaking, would have preferred my petitions and charges against Mr. <hi>Barwis</hi> and other enemies of our Countrey; which he did not; And upon my return to the Country, Mr. <hi>Blaxton</hi> promised, that in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with the first opportunitie, he would present to the honourable house of Commons those my petitions and countrey grievances, wishing me to encourage my Countrey men, to presse on our just complaints, and he would bee assisting unto us, and likewise I soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited some of the Committee of both Kingdomes at Goldsmiths Hall, namely Mr. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> (now a Parliament man) who also promising much, but after 5. weeks attendance upon them, by their owne direction, they performed nothing, Where (by the way) I desire you to take notice, that in all this time whiles I thus attended with great wearinesse, much discouragement and no small expences, I did not so much as interchange one word with any of the Scots Comissioners, neither was I known to any of them by face.</p>
            <p>But upon our returne againe from our Country, to present our grievances, with severall Letters to Mr. <hi>Blaxton</hi> to that purpose, we found him changed, and become our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which did not a little trouble us, in respect of the interest which we conceived we had in him. But afterwards, by means of one Mrs. <hi>Glancrosse,</hi> (a gentlewoman well known to many of our friends of the Separation) after we had beene in Town sundry weeks, were made known to the L. of <hi>Wariston,</hi> one of the Scottish Commissioners, who upon peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of our severall charges against those our adversaries, did promise, that he would use his endeavour to get the same presented to the House, which not many daies after hee did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, And thus as my ends and intentions herein were reall and honest, so I hope the means which I used to attaine thereunto, were no wise unlawfull nor indirect: But as I cannot flatter, neither give vaine titles to any, so <hi>I</hi> hold it ignoble and base to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, either by neglecting such persons or not acknowledging such favours, and the rather that they proceeded from strangers, when as my owne Country men, who both of duty and by oath were bound unto us, so unworthily, so long delayed, and at last refused, so that they both neglected us, and sleighted our cause and Country:</p>
            <p>Let others say and do what they please, as I am not ashamed to owne and acknowledge favours received from my noble friends, so for my part, (as Lieut. Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> speaking of the justice done to him by the House of Peers, saith in his book intituled, Innocency and truth justified, Pag. 75.) I am resolved to speake well of those that have done mee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and not to doubt they will deny it me, till such time as by experience I find they doe it. Sir if I had found the like timely justice from you, I would neither have had so much cause thus to complain, nor to have been so much beholden to strangers: whom the Parliament have still accounted friends: And if you for your own part, had beene as tender of your friends, to whom you professe kindnesse, and to your Country to whom you owe duty; as I have alwaies been, and still am ready to approve my selfe at all times in all faithfullnesse to my Country, and forwardnesse to promote their just cause wherewith I am intrusted, and which hath purchast no small envy of the great enemies of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, I do verily beleeve that some of your suffering friends in the like condition with me who have relyed so much upon you, had not been so frustrated in their expectation, and driven to so great straites as to seek that comfort which you professed, and might with ease have afforded.</p>
            <p>And you would have been more ready to have vouchsafed your assistance to have brought Traytors and enemies to the common wealth to condigne punishment, according to your severall oaths, protestations, and subscriptions, and would have beene ashamed that traitors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ould have walked at large in <hi>London</hi> streets, whilst your cordiall friends their prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb facs="tcp:51181:6"/>
are cast and kept by you in prison, for no other cause, wherewith they can be iustly charged, but for that they stand for the lawes and iust liberties of this kingdome, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would you have been so censorious to condemne that man whom the wel-affected of his countrey have thus intrusted, and on whom they doe still relye, and against whom you know nothing, but bare and groundlesse reports, and under hand calumniations, which no iudicious, generous, nor truly honest man will beleive: yet if you be not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against knowledge to act, or if there be any hope to recover and bring you to a right understanding of our countreys cause, my earnest desire is to undeceive you, if possibly <hi>I</hi> can, and have the more inlarged my selfe, the better to informe you of the true state thereof.</p>
            <p>And <hi>I</hi> doe assure you if <hi>I</hi> may have iustice done me by mine owne countrey men, <hi>I</hi> will never seeke unto strangers: for it was no small griefe unto me, that from none of mine owne nation, <hi>I</hi> could obtain so much favour, neither by intreaties, nor recommendations, as to present the iust complaints of two counties, which so much concerned the weal and safety of two kingdomes, but was driven to that extremitie, even to have returned home to our owne Countrey, (which is nigh 300. miles distant) without any hope of so much as getting a petition presented to the House of Commons, if by meanes (under God) of the Lord of <hi>Warriston</hi> (to whom before <hi>I</hi> was never known by face) those our grievances by petition and articles had not been put up to the House<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>By all which passages you may perceive how wickedly <hi>I</hi> am dealt with, and traduced by the friends and favorites of our and our Countries enemies, so that <hi>I</hi> may truly say, that the slanders of my adversaries, is more quicke then any martiall law, for by them <hi>I</hi> have been arraigned, condemned, and executed all in one instant, if in a mans good name doth consist his life and honour, your selfe being iudge.

            <p>And in the meane time, J would have my adversaries to understand, that I am nothing cast downe, though layed and kept by their meanes in prison, but still relying upon God and the strength and truth of my cause, and the iustice of the Parliament; am resolved, though freedom were made capitall, and truth accompted never so offensive, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish nor desert the iust cause of my countrey, but in all loyall obedience to authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, my endeavours shall be to performe that duty which <hi>I</hi> owe to my countrey, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that trust they have committed unto me. Yea, and to my utmost power (by all lawfull wayes and meanes) according to my oath and protestation, to set my selfe against the factions and attemps of the adversarie, in the defence of the lawes and our iust liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wherein I shall not spare to spend my selfe, and put to hazard whatsoever is nearest and dearest unto me, and so I wish you may account it to be your honour, whom we have honoured to chuse as our trusties, to sit at the helme of this our tossed ship, in such an oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of tempestuous waves, even to execute righteous iudgement, as yee wish to come to a faire haven, and as ye labour to destroy your cruell enemies, so to protect your trustie friends, who have in all assaults and extremiteis never relinquished you, nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause of this distressed kingdome: thus hoping yee will all unanimously use your best endeavours to deliver us, your selves and the posteritie from all the bondage and oppression which is now exercised over this bleeding nation, and restore us to our anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent liberties at least, which our ancestors by their blood so dearly purchast, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we may injoy peace and truth, with the administration of iustice, which is the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest sute and fervent desire of</p>

            <p>CVrteous Reader, thou maist very much wonder at the delatory and slow proceedings of the House of Commons, in doing justice and right; from whom the Commons of <hi>England</hi> may justly expect more then from any other Judicatory, being they are ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly chosen by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> no more but their stewards and servants for whose good and benefit all their actions ought to be extended, and ought in honesty and right to have but one and the same interest with them, but no distinct self-interest from them: Yet by their proceedings daily, we see it is in vaine to expect justice from them, so long as they are so linkt and glude in factions each to other by their private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, in their great places, which ties all such amongst them to maintain one another in all their unjust waies, and to oppresse and crush as much as they are able, all the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters of just and righteous things, and so to barre and stop justice that it shall have little or no progresse; divers of them, and their creatures, sons, brothers, unkles, and kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and allies, in the sub-committees, having already committed so much injustice, that they are undone in their blazed honour, and ill-gotten estates, if justice should run in its native lustre, and full current, and of necessity, they and their great places would quickly be destroyed.</p>
            <p>O therefore that the freemen of <hi>England</hi> had but their eyes open, to see the mischief of members of the House of Commons (men of their own election &amp; chusing to sit in the supream Court of <hi>England</hi>) to be intangled themselves, or intermeddle with any other place whatsoever, then that whereunto their Countrey have chosen them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what a shame is it to see the mercinary long gown-men of the House of Commons, to run up and down like so many hackney petty foggers, from bar to bar in <hi>Westminster hall</hi> &amp;c. to plead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inferiour Judges, and to ingrosse and monopolize, the greatest part of the practise of the law, from other poore lawyers, although divers of these Parliament grosses be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Corporations besides, who ought in Conscience and reason to give way to their Corporations, to chuse new Recorders in their places? for how is it possible that they
<pb facs="tcp:51181:8"/>
should serve the Parliament as members thereof, and their Corporations as Recorders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at so many miles distance, and at one and the same time?</p>
            <p>And besides, how can such great practisers chuse but mercinarily be ingaged to helpe their clyents over a stile, in case that ever they have to do with any of their owne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, and what is this else, but to sell justice for money? Besides, what a snare is it to the new Judges (who are placed in the room of those that have bought, sold, and betraid the lives, liberties, and estates of all the free denizons of <hi>England</hi>? witnes their judgement in ship mony &amp;c. to see 3. or 4. eminent lawyers, members of the House of Comons, come before them in an unjust cause; when they consider, that if they should displease them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it partly lies in their power to turn them out of their places, being they are (as it were) wholy made Judges by the House of Commons, and nominated by the Lawyers therein.</p>
            <p>We professe seriously, that to pull the gownes over these mercinary mens eares, and forever to throw them out of the House of Commons, as men unfit to sit there, or to plead at any barre in England, is too little a punishment for them, the scum of mankind, and the same (we conceive) do they deserve, that are members of that House, and take upon them to sit as judges in inferiour Courts, by means of which they rob the Freem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n of <hi>England</hi> of the benefit of an appeal, in case of injustice: because they have no where to appeal to, but the Parliament, where they sit as judges in their own cause, which is a most wicked, intolerable, and unjust thing in any judge whatsoever: We hope shortly that if these men be not ashamed of their evil herein, some honest and resolute hearted Englishman, will be so bold as publiquely to post up their names as destroyers of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And as great an evill is it to the Kingdom, for members of the House of Commons, to take upon them to be fingerers and treasurers of the publique money of the Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they are thereby in a condition to fill their own coffers, and do what wrong they please (or else how comes it to passe that so many of their children are so richly married of late, that were but mean before? and no man knowes how to call them to account, unlesse they deal with them as the <hi>Romans</hi> sometimes dealt with their Senators, or as the <hi>Switzers</hi> dealt with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>O that that gallant man, L.

            <p>For so long as parliament men can get into their hands the riches and treasures of the Kingdom, and live like Kings and Emperours, and like lawlesse men, none such being of Gods creation (for he never created a lawlesse man) there will never be an end of this Parliament, which by its everlasting continuance, by the abuses of lawlesse and rotten hearted men (<hi>Machiavels</hi> sons, whose principall it is, when he would destroy a State or Kingdom, and deliver them into the hands of their enemies; to put them upon acts of injustice, oppression, and invading of the peoples right, which is the only way to effect their ruine and destruction) will become the most absolute burthen, and greatest oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that ever was upon the people: when as in times by past, it used to be their onely remedy from their oppression, and oppressors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51181:9"/>The thing that we wash <hi>L.</hi> G. <hi>Cromwel</hi> to consider of, is this, that he was chosen a Burgesse for <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to sit in Parliament, and not to be Lieut. Gen. of an Army, both which places he ought not in conscience, nor cannot in equity, honesty, and honour hold, but either must come and sit in Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his proper place: or else he ought to advise and permit them to chuse another Burgesse to sit in his stead; which we conceive would be the greatest and best peece of service that ever he did the Parliament or Common-wealth in his life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (who both are in the high roade way of destruction, by these merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pluralists, great place men) for to be a member of the House of Commons is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to take up the whole and intire man, without deviding it, although he were five times wise then any man there appears to be: and if <hi>Cromwel</hi> would do his duty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, their vail and president were taken of, and laid down, which would be for his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding honour and glory, and the unspeakable good of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Wherefore dear and beloved friend Mr. <hi>Musgrave,</hi> seeing God hath given you the spirit of boldnes, wisdom, understanding, zeal, and courage, lay it out more fully for the good of your Countrey, and speedily present him with a home and plain Epistle for that end, and we also intreat you to make some observations to him, upon what you will find in the 19.20.21. pages of <hi>Englands birth-right,</hi> and presse them home to him.</p>
