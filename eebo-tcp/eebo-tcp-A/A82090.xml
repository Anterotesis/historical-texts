         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DECLARATION
FROM THE
Poor oppreſſed People of England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E whoſe names are ſubſcribed, do in the name of all the poor
oppreſſed people in <hi>England,</hi> declare unto you, that call your
ſelves Lords of Manors, and Lords of the Land, That in
regard the King of Righteouſneſs, our Maker, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
our hearts ſo far, as to ſee, That the earth was not
made purpoſely for you, to be Lords of it, and we to be
your Slaves, Servants, and Beggers; but it was made to be
a common Livelihood to all, without reſpect of perſons:
And that your buying and ſelling of Land, and the Fruits of it, one to another, is
<hi>The curſed thing,</hi> and was brought in by War; which hath, and ſtill does eſtabliſh
murder, and theft, in the hands of ſome branches of Mankinde over others, which
is the greateſt outward burden, and unrighteous power, that the Creation groans
under: For the power of incloſing Land, and owning Propriety, was brought into
the Creation by your Anceſtors by the Sword; which firſt did murther their fellow
Creatures, Men, and after plunder or ſteal away their Land, and left this Land
ſucceſſively to you, their Children. And therefore, though you did not kill or
theeve, yet you hold that curſed thing in your hand, by the power of the Sword;
and ſo you juſtifie the wicked deeds of your Fathers; and that ſin of your Fathers,
ſhall be viſited upon the Head of you, and your Children, to the third and fourth
Generation, and longer too, tell your bloody and theeving power be rooted out of
the Land.</p>
            <p>And further, in regard the King of Righteouſneſs hath made us ſenſible of our
burthens, and the cryes and groanings of our hearts are come before him: We take
it as a teſtimony of love from him, That our hearts begin to be freed from ſlaviſh
fear of men, ſuch as you are; and that we finde Reſolutions in us, grounded upon
the inward law of Love, one towards another, To Dig and Plough up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and waſte Lands through <hi>England;</hi> and that our converſation ſhall be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable,
That your Laws ſhall not reach to oppreſs us any longer, unleſs you
by your Laws will ſhed the innocent blood that runs in our veins.</p>
            <p>For though you and your Anceſtors got your Propriety by murther and theft,
and you keep it by the ſame power from us, that have an equal right to the Land
with you, by the righteous Law of Creation, yet we ſhall have no occaſion of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reling
(as you do) about that diſturbing devil, called <hi>Particular Propriety:</hi> For the
Earth, with all her Fruits of Corn, Cattle, and ſuch like, was made to be a common
Store-houſe of Livelihood to all Mankinde, friend, and foe, without exception.</p>
            <p>And to prevent all your ſcrupulous Objections, know this, That we muſt neither
<pb facs="tcp:165152:3"/>
buy nor ſell: Money muſt not any longer (after our work of the Earths commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is advanced) be the great god, that hedges in ſome, and hedges out others;
for Money is but part of the Earth: And ſurely, the Righteous Creator, who is
King, did never ordain, That unleſs ſome of Mankinde, do bring that Mineral
(Silver and Gold) in their hands, to others of their own kinde, that they ſhould
neither be fed, nor be clothed; no ſurely, For this was the project of Tyrant-fleſh
(which Land-lords are branches of) to ſet his Image upon Money. And they
make this unrighteous Law, That none ſhould buy or ſell, eat, or be clothed, or
have any comfortable Livelihood among men, unleſs they did bring his Image
ſtamped upon Gold or Silver in their hands.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Scriptures ſpeak, That the mark of the Beaſt is 666, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of a man; and that thoſe that do not bring that mark in their hands, or
in their foreheads, they ſhould neither buy nor ſell, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 16. And ſeeing the
numbering Letters round about the Engliſh money make 666, which is the
number of that Kingly Power and Glory, (called a <hi>Man.</hi>) And ſeeing the
age of the Creation is now come to the Image of the Beaſt, or Half day. And
ſeeing 666 is his mark, we expect this to be the laſt Tyrannical power that ſhall
raign; and that people ſhall live freely in the enioyment of the Earth, without
bringing the mark of the Beaſt in their hands, or in their promiſe; and that they
ſhall buy Wine and Milk, without Money, or without price, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>For after our work of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arthly community is advanced, we muſt make uſe of
Gold and Silver, as we do of other mettals, but not to buy and ſell withal; for
buying and ſelling is the great cheat, that robs and ſteals the Earth one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
It is that which makes ſome Lords, others Beggers, ſome Rulers, others to be
ruled; and makes great Murderers and Theeves to be impriſoners, and hangers of
little ones, or of ſincere-hearted men.</p>
            <p>And while we are made to labor the Earth together, with one conſent and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
minde; and while we are made free, that every one, friend and foe, ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the benefit of their Creation, that is, To have food and rayment from the
Earth, their Mother; and every one ſubiect to give accompt of his thoughts, words,
and actions to none, but to the one onely righteous Judg, and Prince of Peace;
the Spirit of Righteouſneſs that dwells, and that is now riſing up to rule in every
Creature, and in the whole Globe. We ſay, while we are made to hinder no man of
his Priviledges given him in his Creation, equal to one, as to another; what Law
then can you make, to take hold upon us, but Laws of Oppreſſion and Tyranny,
that ſhall enſlave or ſpill the blood of the Innocent? And ſo your Selves, your
Judges, Lawyers, and Juſtices, ſhall be found to be the greateſt Tranſgreſſors, in,
and over Mankinde.</p>
            <p>But to draw neerer to declare our meaning, what we would have, and what we
ſhall endevor to the uttermoſt to obtain, as moderate and righteous Reaſon directs
us; ſeeing we are made to ſee our Priviledges, given us in our Creation, which
have hitherto been denied to us, and our Fathers, ſince the power of the Sword be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to rule, And the ſecrets of the Creation have been locked up under the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
Parrat-like ſpeaking, from the Univerſities, and Colledges for Scholars,
And ſince the power of the murdering, and theeving Sword, formerly, as well as
now of late yeers, hath ſet up a Government, and maintains that Government;
for what are priſons, and putting others to death, but the power of the Sword, to
enforce people to that Government which was got by Conqueſt and Sword, and
<pb facs="tcp:165152:3"/>
cannot ſtand of it ſelf, but by the ſame murdering power? That Government that
is got over people by the Sword and kept by the Sword, is not ſet up by the King of
Righteouſneſs to be his Law, but by Coveteouſneſs, the great god of the world;
who hath been permitted to raign for a time, times, and dividing of time, and his
government draws to the period of the laſt term of his allotted time; and then
the Nations ſhall ſee the glory of that Government that ſhall rule in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
without either Sword or Spear,</p>
            <p>And ſeeing further, the power of Righteouſneſs in our hearts, ſeeking the Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
of others as well as our ſelves, hath drawn forth our bodies to begin to dig,
and plough, in the Commons and waſte Land, for the Reaſons already declared,</p>
            <p>And ſeeing and finding our ſelves poor, wanting Food to feed upon, while we
labor the Earth, to caſt in Seed, and to wait tell the firſt Crop comes up; and
wanting Ploughs, Carts, Corn, and ſuch materials to plant the Commons withal,
we are willing to declare our condition to you, and to all, that have the Treaſury of
the Earth, locked up in your Bags, Cheſts, and Barns, and will offer up nothing to
this publike Treaſury; but will rather ſee your fellow Creatures ſtarve for want of
Bread, that have an equal right to it with your ſelves, by the Law of Creation:
But this by the way we onely declare to you, and to all that follow the ſubtle art of
buying and ſelling the Earth, with her Fruits, meerly to get the Treaſury thereof
into their hands, to lock it up from them, to whom it belongs; that ſo, ſuch covete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
proud, unrighteous, ſelfiſh fleſh, may be left without excuſe in the day of
Judgment.</p>
            <p>And therefore, the main thing we aym at, and for which we declare our Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to go forth, and act, is this, To lay hold upon, and as we ſtand in need, to cut
and fell, and make the beſt advantage we can of the Woods and Trees, that grow
upon the Commons, To be a ſtock for our ſelves, and our poor Brethren, through
the Land of <hi>England,</hi> to plant the Commons withal; and to provide us bread to
eat, till the Fruit of our labors in the Earth bring forth increaſe; and we ſhall
meddle with none of your Proprieties (but what is called Commonage) till the
Spirit in you, make you caſt up your Lands and Goods, which were got, and ſtill
is kept in your hands by murder, and theft; and then we ſhall take it from the
Spirit, that hath conquered you, and not from our Swords, which is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and unrighteous power, and a deſtroyer of the Creation: But the Son of man
comes not to deſtroy, but to ſave.</p>
            <p>And we are moved to ſend forth this Declaration abroad, to give notice to every
one, whom it concerns, in regard we hear and ſee, that ſome of you, that have
been Lords of Manors, do cauſe the Trees and Woods that grow upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
which you pretend a Royalty unto, to be cut down and ſold, for your own
private uſe, whereby the Common Land, which your own mouths doe ſay belongs
to the poor, is impoveriſhed, and the poor oppreſſed people robbed of their Rights,
while you give them cheating words, by telling ſome of our poor oppreſſed Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
That thoſe of us that have begun to Dig and Plough up the Commons, will
hinder the poor; and ſo blinde their eyes, that they ſee not their Priviledge, while
you, and the rich Free-holders, make the moſt profit of the Commons, by your
over-ſtocking of them with Sheep and Cattle; and the poor that have the name to
own the Commons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have the leaſt ſhare therein; nay, they are checked by you, if
they cut Wood, Heath, Turf, or Furſeys, in places about the Common, where you
diſallow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165152:4"/>
Therefore we are reſolved to be cheated no longer, not be held under the ſlaviſh
fear of you no longer, ſeing the Earth was made for us, as well as for you: And if the
Common Land belongs to us who are the poor oppreſſed, ſurely the woods that grow
upon the Commons belong to us likewiſe: therefore we are reſolved to try the
uttermoſt in the light of reaſon, to know whether we ſhall be free men, or
ſlaves. If we lie ſtill, and let you ſteale away our birthrights, we periſh; and if we
Petition we periſh alſo, though we have paid taxes, given free quarter, and
ventured our lives to preſerve the Nations freedom as much as you, and therefore
by the law of contract with you, freedom in the land is our portion as well as yours,
equal with you: And if we ſtrive for freedom, and your murdering, governing
Laws deſtroy us, we can but periſh.</p>
            <p>Therefore we require, and we reſolve to take both Common Land, and Common
woods to be a livelihood for us, and look upon you as equal with us, not above us,
knowing very well, that <hi>England,</hi> the land of our Nativity, is to be a common Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
of livelihood to all, without reſpect of perſons.</p>
            <p>So then, we declare unto you, that do intend to cut our Common Woods and
Trees, that you ſhall not do it; unleſſe it be for a ſtock for us, as aforeſaid, and we
to know of it, by a publick declaration abroad, that the poor oppreſſed that live there
abouts, may take it, and employ it, for their publike uſe, therefore take notice we
have demanded it in the name of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and of all the Nations
of the world, it being the righteous freedom of the Creation.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe we declare to you that have begun to cut down our Common Woods
and Trees, and to ſell and carry away the ſame for your private uſe, that you ſhall
forbear, and go no farther, hoping, that none that are friends to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of England, will endeavour to buy any of thoſe Common Trees and Woods
of any of thoſe Lords of Mannors, ſo called, who have, by the murdering and cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
law of the ſword, ſtoln the Land from yonger brothers, who have by the law of
Creation, a ſtanding portion in the Land, as well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and equall with others. Therefore
we hope all Wood-mongers will diſown all ſuch private merchandize, as being
a robbing of the poor oppreſſed, and take notice, that they have been told our reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But if any of you that are VVood-mongers, will buy it of the poor, and for
their uſe, to ſtock the Commons, from ſuch as may be appointed by us to ſell it, you
ſhall have it quietly, without diminution; but if you will ſlight us in this thing,
blame us not, if we make ſtop of the Carts you ſend and convert the VVoods to our
own uſe, as need requires, it being our own, equal with him that calls himſelf the
Lord of the Mannor, and not his peculiar right, ſhutting us out, but he ſhall ſhare
with us as a fellow-creature.</p>
            <p>For we ſay our purpoſe is, to take thoſe Common Woods to fell them, now at firſt,
to be a ſtock for our ſelves, and our children after us, to plant and manure the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
land withall; for we ſhall endeavour by our righteous acting not to leave the
earth any longer intangled unto our children, by ſelf-ſeeking proprietors; But to
leave it a free ſtore-houſe, and common treaſury to all, without reſpect of perſons;
And this we count is our dutie, to endeavour to the uttermoſt, every man in his
place (according to the nationall Covenant which the Parliament ſet forth)
a Reformation to preſerve the peoples liberties, one as well as another: As
well thoſe as have paid taxes, and given free quarter, as thoſe that have either
born the ſword, or taken our moneys to diſpoſe of them for publike uſe: for if the
Reformation muſt be according to the word of God, then every one is to have the
<pb facs="tcp:165152:4"/>
benefit and freedom of his creation, without reſpect of perſons; we count this our
duty, we ſay, to endeavour to the uttermoſt, and ſo ſhall leave thoſe that riſe up to
oppoſe us without excuſe, in their day of Judgment; and our precious blood, we
hope, ſhall not be dear to us, to be willingly laid down at the door of a priſon, or
foot of a gallows, to juſtifie this righteous cauſe; if thoſe that have taken our money
from us, and promiſed to give us freedom for it, ſhould turn Tyrants againſt
us: for we muſt not fight, but ſuffer.</p>
            <p>And further we intend, that not one, two, or a few men of us ſhall ſell or exchange
the ſaid woods, but it ſhall be known publikly in Print or writing to all, how
much every ſuch, and ſuch parcell of wood is ſold for, and how it is laid out, either
in victualls, corn, ploughs, or other materialls neceſſary.</p>
            <p>And we hope we may not doubt (at leaſt we expect) that they that are called the
great Councel and powers of <hi>England,</hi> who ſo often have declared themſelves, by
promiſes and Covenants, and confirmed them by multitude of faſting daies, and
devout Proteſtations, to make <hi>England</hi> a free people, upon condition they would pay
moneys, and adventure their lives againſt the ſucceſſor of the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueror;
under whoſe oppreſſing power <hi>England</hi> was enſlaved; And we look upon that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
promiſed to be the inheritance of all, without reſpect of perſons; And this
cannot be, unleſs the Land of <hi>England</hi> be freely ſet at liberty from proprietors, and
become a common Treaſury to all her children, as every portion of the Land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> was the Common livelihood of ſuch and ſuch a Tribe, and of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in that Tribe, without exception, neither hedging in any, nor hedging out.</p>
            <p>We ſay we hope we need not doubt of their ſincerity to us herein, and that they
will not gainſay our determinate courſe; howſoever, their actions will prove to
the view of all, either their ſinceritie, or hypocriſie: We know what we ſpeak is
our priviledge, and our cauſe is righteous, and if they doubt of it, let them but ſend
a childe for us to come before them, and we ſhall make it manifeſt four wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by the National Covenant, which yet ſtands in force to bind Parliament
and people to be faithful and ſincere, before the Lord God Almighty, wherein eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one in his ſeveral place hath covenanted to preſerve and ſeek the liberty each of
other, without reſpect of perſons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the late Victory over King <hi>Charls,</hi> we do claime this our priviledge, to
be quietly given us, out of the hands of Tyrant-Government, as our bargain and
contract with them; for the Parliament promiſed, if we would pay taxes, and give
free quarter, and adventure our lives againſt <hi>Charls</hi> and his party, whom they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Common enemy, they would make us a free people; Theſe three being all
done by us, as well as by themſelves, we claim this our bargain, by the law of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from them, to be a free people with them, and to have an equall priviledge of
Common livelihood with them, they being choſen by us, but for a peculiar worke,
and for an appointed time, from among us, not to be our oppreſſing Lords, but
ſervants to ſuccour us. But theſe two are our weakeſt proofs. And yet by them (in
the light of reaſon and equity that dwells in mens hearts) we ſhall with eaſe caſt
down, all thoſe former enſlaving, <hi>Norman</hi> reiterated laws, in every Kings raigne
ſince the Conqueſt, which are as thornes in our eyes, and pricks in our ſides, and
which are called the Ancient Goverment of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, we ſhall prove, that we have a free right to the land of <hi>England,</hi> being
borne therein as well as elder brothers, and that it is our right equal with them, and
they with us, to have a comfortable livelihood in the earth, without owning any
<pb facs="tcp:165152:5"/>
of our owne kinde, to be either Lords, or Land-Lords over us: And this we ſhall
prove by plain Text of Scripture, without expoſition upon them, which the Scholars
and great ones generally ſay, is their rule to walk by.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we ſhall prove it by the Righteous Law of our Creation, That man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
in all his branches, is the Lord of the Earth and ought not to be in ſubjection
to any of his own kinde without him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to live in the light of the law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and peace eſtabliſhed in his heart.</p>
            <p>And thus in love we have declared the purpoſe of our hearts plainly, without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
expecting love, and the ſame ſincerity from you, without grumbling, or
quarreling, being Creatures of your own Image and mould, intending no other
matter herein, but to obſerve the Law of righteous action, endeavouring to ſhut
out of the Creation, the curſed thing, called <hi>Particular Propriety,</hi> which is the cauſe
of all wars, bloud-ſhed, theft, and enſlaving Laws, that hold the people under miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie.</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Signed for and in the behalf of all the poor oppreſſed people of <hi>England,</hi> and the
