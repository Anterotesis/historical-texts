            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>No KING but the Old KINGS Son.</head>
            <head>Or, a Vindication of Limited MONARCHY, as it was Eſtabliſhed in this Nation, before the late War between the King and Parliment.</head>
            <p>IT being the general cry of the People, that Monarchy is the mirrour of Governments, under which we enjoyed the very perfection of Liberty, and were bleſſed far beyond any of our neighbour Nations; I ſhall lay down ſeveral ſerious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whereby it may plainly appear to the weakeſt capacity, that no Government can be ſo beneficial to this Nation, as to reſtore it to its ancient Monarchical Government, and to eſtabliſh the Son of the Old King in his Royal Dignities and Prerogatives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe thoſe that ſurfeited of our Kingly Government, and longed for Novelty, have loſt the ſubſtance of Liberty and happines in purſuit of the ſhaddow; and none of our fierce Champions for a free State can maintain, that it is not ſubject to violation, for if they ſhould undertake to prove it, they muſt renounce their ſences and deny the Faith of Story, which proves, that Republicks have been ſometimes invaded with uſurpation, ſometimes Debauched and embaſed with Oligarchy, and alwaies tormented with Faction. Yet of all Government Kingly Government did moſt excellently comply with the Laws, Genius, and Intereſt of this then flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Monarchy in theſe Nations is more ancient then Story or Record, and more venerable then Tradition it ſelf; Our Lawes were born (as it were) under that Climate, grafted into that ſtock and habituated in that ayre and Dyet; This made our Lawyers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune <hi>Oliver Crumwell</hi> to aſſume the ſtile and power of a King to which our Laws were ſhaped, rather then Protector a title un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Law.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our old Kingly Government included all the perfections of a Free State, and was the Kernel, as it were, of a Common-wealth, in the ſhell of Monarchy; the eſſential parts of a Commonwealth are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Senate propoſing, the People reſolving, and the Magiſtrate executing; for the Senate or Parliament, if ever a Free Parliament were, it was here, where the Deputies of the whole Nation, moſt freely choſen, did, with like Freedom, meet, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, debate and vote all matters of common Intereſt: No dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger eſcaped their repreſenting; no grievence their complaint; no publick Right, their Claim, or good, their demand; In all which, the leaſt breach of Priviledge was branded as a civil Sacriledge. And though there lay no appeal to the diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erced body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (Elections being ſo popular and Aſſemblies frequent) yet the ſame end was attained with much more ſafety and convenience. the Prince had likewiſe, in effect, but an executive power, which he exerciſed by Miniſters and Officers, not only ſworn, but ſeverely accomptable: For though both he and the Lords had their Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in making Laws, yet (no Tax being impoſable, but by conſent of the Commons) there was a wiſe and ſweet neceffity, for the King and likewiſe for the Lords, who were but as a grain in the Royal Scale, to confirm all ſuch Bills, as were convenient for the people, and not greatly hurtful to the Prince; And ſo this Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Negative, was reſolved into a meer Target, to ſhelter and preſerve the Government from being altered, at the will of the Commons, if at any time they ſhould prove Factious which hath been confirmed by great experience: Our Kings having rarely, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed any Bill, which they might ſufely grant; but on the other ſide, paſſed many high Acts of meer Grace, circumſcribing their Prerogatives, and clipping its Wings; Nay, I could wiſh they had not pierced its bowels.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This was our Gold ſeven times refined, for every Bill, being thrice read, debated and agreed on in either houſe, was at laſt brought to the King, for his Royal aſſent, the Mint of our Laws: a tryal ſo exact, that ſurely, no droſſe could eſcape it; ſince all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts muſt thereto concur, as truly it was but fit they ſhould, in the eſtabliſhment of that which muſt bind them all. This was that temperament which poiſed our humours, and at once endued us with health, vigour and beauty; No Vote was precipitated, no Act was hudled up: as by ſad events we have ſince ſeen, that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being engroſſed by one of the Eſtates, purged and modelled to the Intereſts of a Faction.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Kirg indeed had the power of making War, but he had not the means; and therefore it ſignified no more than giving him leave to fly if he could get w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngs, or to go boyond Sea ſo he went witbout ſhipping: He had a Sword, but he alone could never draw it, for the Trained-bands were a weapon, which he decently wore, but the Nation only could uſe it: He choſe Miniſters, But alas he was accomptable for them to the Tryennial Parliament, which none but the ſoundeſt integrity could abide.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Seeing his perſon was moſt ſacred, it was but needful to avoid circulation of accompt, reaſonable, ſince it carries with it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Nations; juſt that he ſhould not be the <hi>But</hi> of Faction and Malice, in worſe condition than the baſeſt of Vaſſals; honourable, that the nakedneſs of Government might not daily be uncovered; Wiſe, in the conſtitution, not at once, to truſt and provoke by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to ſhift for his own indempnity, no danger to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſeeming ſo extream, as the Out-lawry of a Prince; no task by daily experience, ſo difficult, as the arraigning of any power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Regal or Popular, And ſince we make golden bridges for fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemies, much more may we afford them to relenting Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When the Prerogative of Kings was moſt Rampant, then the greateſt of them could never prudently aſpire to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſole Legiſlators, nor preſumed to maintain Red-coats in the times of Peace. If any ſhould here object that Kingly power can no longer here ſubſiſt for want of a Revenue, I anſwer, That a King of <hi>England</hi> might and ſtill may (the ſale of Crown Lands, which exceeded not the value of 100000 <hi>li. per annum,</hi> being, me thinks, no matter of ruin, but rather of eaſie compenſation,) For the publick Revenue was proportioned according to the maintenance of Courts, not Camps or Fleets; a Gentleman of reaſonable Eſtate might live well upon his Rents, without disburſments out of the publick Revenue.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A Monarchical Government did provide greater freedom for their Citizens then any other, <hi>as Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right;</hi> hereby our Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates were ſecured eſtabliſhed, I think, as well as any thing, on this ſide Heaven: it were no ſoloeciſme to ſay, the Subject had his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, as well, as the King; And ſure I am, he was as good (if not better) condition to maintain it, the dependance being leſſe on his ſide: Liberty was no leſſe ſacred then Majeſty; <hi>Nole me tangere,</hi> was likewiſe its Motto; And in caſe of any, the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement (as eſcapes in Government may happen even in the moſt perfect;) It was reſented, as if the Nation had received a box on the Eare; If it be, as they ſay, the glory of a Free-Stat, to exalt, the ſcandall of Tyrany, to Embaſe our Spirits; doubtleſſe, this was our onely Common-wealth: For, ever ſince, me thinks, we have learned quietly to take the Baſtonade.</p>
            <p n="9">9. We can never hope under our Common-wealth, what ever promiſes may be made us, ſo perfectly to diſtinguiſh the Legſlative from the Miniſteral Authority, as once we did; when the Houſe of Commons had not the power of a <hi>Court Leet</hi> to give an Oath, nor of a Juſtice of the Peace, to make a <hi>Mittimum:</hi> Which diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, doubtleſſe is the moſt vitall part of Freedome, and far more conſiderable to poor Subjects, than the pretended Rotation; As on the contrary, the confuſion of them is an accompliſhment of ſervitude; For which the beſt Republick, I fear, have more to anſwer, than any limited Prince can have: Certain, it is, that our King in his perſonal capacity as he made no Laws, ſo neither did he by himſelf interpret Laws. His Privy Seal ever buckled to the great Seal, as being the Nations more than his.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> the Son of the late King, is the ſirmeſt adherer in the world to the true Proteſtant Religion, and continues immovable to the principles in which he was educated from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy: Therfore no way of Government can be ſettled ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to the preſervation of rhe true, ancient Catholick, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Faith, and to reſtore the unity of theſe languiſhing Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
