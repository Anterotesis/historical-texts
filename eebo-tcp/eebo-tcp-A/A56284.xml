            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I Have lately ſeen in Print an Apologie for ſuch Miniſters, and people, as out of conſcience did not obſerve the <hi>Thankſgiving-day</hi> dedicated by the Parliament to Almighty God, for giving us victory againſt the <hi>Scots:</hi> and the Apologiſt had prefixed this Title in his Front:
<q>
                     <p>Sad and ſerious Politicall Conſiderations touching the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Warre againſt our Presbyterian Proteſtant Brethren in <hi>Scotland,</hi> their late great overthrow, and the probable dangerous conſequences thereof to both Nations, and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                  </q>
As ſoon as I had read it over; I ſaw heavy, and bitter char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in it againſt the Power now Governing, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence againſt our Nation, and Religion, but all was built upon ſuch premiſſes, as were left utterly unproved. I doubt not therefore but all Schollers will deride the Author, as void of wit and ingenuity: and will think that Pamphlet unworthy of an Anſwer, which can challenge nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a flat denyall. But when I conſider the multitude, who ſcarce diſcern betwixt Arguments and Invectives, or points that require ſolid proofs, and ſuch as ſometimes are not worth prooving: when I conſider this multitude may be dangerouſly impoſed upon by confident writers indeed, ſuch as have effrontery enough to grant themſelves any thing under diſpute: I dare not be wanting to a diſtreſſed

What the Apologiſt though affirmant has left unproved, <hi>viz:</hi> that the Parliament has broken Covenant with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and made an Invaſive warre upon the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> the ſame I though reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhall endeavour to leave diſproved.

               <p>ABout 11. or 12. yeers ſince, the late King began to take Arms againſt the Scotch Nation upon Eccleſiaſtical quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, but his ſucceſſe was ſo ill therein, that He could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hopefully purſue, nor yet handſomly compoſe thoſe broils. The reaſon was, becauſe his Popiſh Subjects could not, and his Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>England</hi> would not ſupport him with their effectuall aſſiſtance in that cauſleſs warre. So this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was then convened to extricate the ſaid King out of thoſe difficulties: and had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Long it was not therefore after the ſitting of our great Councell, before the ſaid King gave open teſtimonies, how odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it was to Him to ſee his boundles Prerogative ſo checkt: nay many months had not elapſed before diſguſts had hacht &amp; ripend bloody &amp; dangerous plots againſt the whole repreſentative bodie of our State, 2. Armies were now in the North out of all military imployment, and this put the King in ſome hopes, that either one of them or both might be woone to his partie; and ſo help to rid him of his loathed rivality. Strong endeavours were uſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: but God blaſted them all: the Scotch Army thought it

This <hi>Proteſtation</hi> was taken in 1641. and the Proteſters did thereby in the preſence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God binde themſelves to defend Religion, the King, the Parliament, publick Liberty, the Union, and peace of the three Kingdoms, with a clauſe to be aſſiſting to all that adhered to this <hi>Protestation,</hi> and to be at enmity with all its oppoſers. The King ſtomacht much this new way of imbodying the people in leagues, and parties, and knew well that the contrivers of it intended it for a combination againſt his unlimited pretenſions: but ſeeing his intereſts were here as ſpecially provided for as any other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inſinuated ſubordination, and that it left his pretenſions as unprejudiced as they were before: he ſmothered much of his diſtaſte againſt it. Ordinary affronts, and miſadventures did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quicken then quaſh this Kings reſolutions, wherefore upon this Account He made the more haſte into <hi>Scotland</hi> upon ſome concealed reaſons of State: and his hope was, that by his paſſing through both the Armies in the North, He ſhould finde an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be his own negotiater with all the chief Commanders. All theſe royall arts nevertheleſſe miſcarried, and were not able to deboſh the Armies, for either the Commanders were jealous of the ſoulderies integrity, or the Souldiery of one Army ſuſpected the ſincerity of the other, or elſe the Parliaments ſollicitations proved as efficacious, as the Kings: ſomthing there was that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to the abortion of that miſchief.

Some Noblemen that were invited to a bloodie ſupper, got timely advertiſement of the royall aſſaſſinators, and ſo by flying privily out of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> ſecured themſelves: but that ever to be execrated inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts againſt the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Proteſtants, came to effect at that time; and tis known well enough that the chief actors in that tragedie alledged a Commiſſion from the King under the great Seal of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to juſtifie all that they then perpetrated. Here was an iſſue of blood ſpent, that is not ſtanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this day: little leſſe then 500000 Chriſtians were ſacrificed, and devoted to ſlaughter by that Commiſſion (and the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf never took any effectuall courſe to wipe off that ſtain) but what proſperity has that diſmall deluge of blood brought at laſt to the Kings cauſe?</p>
               <p>Hitherto the King keeps from open defiance with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England:</hi> but now Gods flaming Miniſter of warre begins to brandiſh his ſword againſt this Nation: now the King is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Scotland:</hi> and now begins the year 1642. wherein Arms are openly taken up, and avowed on both ſides. <hi>Scotland</hi> for two or three years before had ſeen war, but without ſlaughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> had been miſerably the yeer before imbrued with ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet ſaw no war: but <hi>England</hi> muſt now prepare her ſelf both for war, and ſlaughter. At the firſt harneſſing, and making ready for the field both ſides pretended to be on the defence: and both pretended to ſtand for the defence of the ſame perſons, and rights; the Parliament declares for the Kings rights aſwell as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Liberties: and the King for the Subjects Liberties, as well as his own rights: the matter of the <hi>Proteſtation</hi> is the cauſe they both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither were their ſucceſſes much unanſwerable to their profeſſions: for after a bloodie battell fought neer <hi>Keinton</hi> in Octob: and another hot encounter at <hi>Brainford,</hi> and after divers other conflicts in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall other places of the Northern, Weſtern, and middle Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England</hi> either ſide got blows, but neither ſide carried away any great advantage, or conqueſt: only the Kings ſecret correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> began now to grow more evident, as well by their declaring for the Kings pretences, as by his diver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing the preparations made here againſt them. At this time the threed of the Kings Councels was exceeding finely ſpun, the more zealous He ſeemed againſt the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

ſending ſupplies againſt them, the more unable we ſhould be in the end either to reſiſt the King here, or to reduce them there. Howſoever as was noted before, though the moſt ſubtill threeds of the King, were ſtrong enough ſometimes to fabricate toils and nets for his ſubjects, yet they never could be twiſted into ladders for the mounting of him to his aſpired grandour.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the year 1643. another black deſperate deſigne againſt the City of <hi>London</hi> was diſcovered, ſcarce inferior to any of thoſe former impregnations of the Kings inraged brain: whereupon the Parliament again had recourſe to this new religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous guard of Vowing, and Covenanting. And herein after the Covenanters had humbled themſelves before God for the Nations ſins, and judgements, and promiſed by Gods grace to endeavour for the future, an amendment of their wayes, they the ſecond time ingaged themſelves by Vow, and Covenant, in the preſence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, to be adhering faithfully to the Forces raiſed by the Parliament for defence of Religion, and liberty. &amp;c. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the vertue of both theſe holy remedies againſt the Kings unceſſant ſtratagems: about the latter end of the ſame Summer the Parliaments affairs came to a great declination, and till they obtained aid from the Scotch Nation, their condition was thought very tottering.

                  </gap>ermitted, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were long delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating about their march, and though they ſaw their ruin invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ours, and their faith no leſſe pre-ingaged to us for mutuall aſſiſtance, then ours was to them: yet they advanced not at laſt but upon theſe ſtrict conditions: 1. That we being then but a waſted part of <hi>England,</hi> yet ſhould preſently imburſe them out of our afflicted affairs with a great ſumme of ready money: 2ly, That they ſhould be payed as mercenaries, and yet have a ſhare in government here, as if they were our joyntenants. And 3ly, that we ſhould enter with them into a new ſolemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant upon Oath, as it was by them compoſed, and conceived. So diſproportionable, and unſuitable is their amity to their enmity: for when they had a pretence of a quarrell contrary to former Treaties with <hi>England,</hi> in 1648. twas in their power to invade <hi>England</hi> readily without aſſurance of preſent Advance-money, or eſtabliſht pay afterwards: and ſuch able Enemies we found them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108155:5"/>
in all ages: but when they were to be ayding to part of <hi>England,</hi> in obſervance of former Treaties, in 1643. there is no moving in ſuch a work without ample Covenants: ſo much more difficult amongſt them is the enterpriſe of helping, then is the enterpriſe of undoing.</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt now, by that which has been hitherto premiſed, that the firſt occaſion of flying to ſuch conſcientious tyes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients as theſe, was that the late Kings plots, and conſpiracies might be thereby the better diſappointed, and that the people might be thereby the better confirmed in their oppoſition againſt Him. And this makes it now ſeem the more ſtrange to us, that the <hi>Scots</hi> at preſent ſhould make their Covenant ſo main an engine for the King againſt us, which at firſt was certainly excogitated as a main engine for us againſt the King. 2ly, it is hereby as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Covenant which is now inſiſted on by that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was preſſed on us at firſt with ſo much rigor, did add no new obligation at all to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Religion, Liberty, Monarchy, and the peace of the Nations were aſ much ſecured before, and as ſanctimoniouſly by the Proteſtation in 1641. and by the vow, and Covenant in 1643. as they were afterwards by the ſolemn League and Covenant, when the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was to enter <hi>England.</hi> 3ly. We cannot obſerve by any remarkable bleſſing from Heaven, that the hand of God did ever give any gratious teſtimony in behalf of theſe new ſacramentall obligations. The proteſtation was thought ineffectuall till the vow, and Covenant came in with a greater ſupply of religion: the vow, and Covenant was not able to break the Kings Armies till the ſolemn League of <hi>Scotland</hi> had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced its further ſanctity: and when that was ſuperinduced and came accompanied with 20000 armed men from <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King ſubſiſted, yea and thrived a long time after: and without doubt thoſe Oaths which he impoſed within his quarters did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſervice againſt us, as ours did for us in our quarters. We all know that twas not a new Oath but a new modeld Army that by Gods moſt gratious hand firſt gave check to the Kings proſperity: and tis not ſo viſible that ever we trampled on the Royaliſts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by obſervance of the Covenant, as that we are now miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ingaged in blood againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> by miſpriſions, and falſe gloſſes of the ſame. The Lord of his boundles mercy grant at laſt that we may return to our old wayes of humiliation, ſeek to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe that Majeſty by faſting, and praying, which is to be feared
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108155:5"/>
we have provoked by ſuperſtitious vowing, and ſwearing. 4ly, We cannot finde that ever the people was rightly fitted, or at all benefited by theſe new ſacramentall Leagues, or rather politicall Sacraments: for in <hi>England</hi> we had too many that would take the Kings Oaths when He was prevalent, and the Parliaments alſo when they were prevalent: and in <hi>Scotland Montroſſes</hi> victory left lamentable ſpectacles of humane treacherie and impietie as to the <hi>Covenant:</hi> No ſooner had he in 1644. woon one pitcht Field but the Nation generally flow'd in to Him, to ſubmit unto his new royall bonds, with curſes upon them that had forcibly clogd their conſciences by contrary ones before; and no ſooner had <hi>D: Leſly</hi> routed Him, but the ſame people again ſhifted <hi>Montroſſes</hi> bonds with deteſtations as high, and bitter, as they had the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments before. This is a prodigious example, exceedingly to be deplored not onely by the <hi>Scots,</hi> but by all mankinde.</p>
               <p>But to proceed: The breaches, and hoſtilities which at this day are ſprung out of the <hi>Covenant</hi> betwixt the Covenanters of both Nations are too viſible: the queſtion is therfore, whether we ſhall charge theſe miſchiefs upon the ill compoſure of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> it ſelf, or upon the malice of the Covenanters: and if upon the Covenanters, whether are more guilty the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or the <hi>Scotch?</hi> And firſt as to the <hi>Covenant</hi> it ſelf, it ſeems to me that even that was not compiled ſo briefly, ſo clearly, and ſo impartially as it might have been, and that has given ſome occaſion of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to ſome: but certainly blood had never been drawn by brethren ſo leagued together, as we are, had it not been for the ignorance, arrogance, and high injuſtice of the Covenanters. Antiquity which was famous for ingenuity, had not any uſe to charge their humane contracts, much leſſe divine, with ſo various and heterogeneous branches, as this <hi>Covenant</hi> is charged withall: ſome points of it arc divine, ſome morall, ſome civil: ſome are of higher, ſome of meaner concernment: and all of them thus odly compacted together ſwell it up into too rude a lump. Moreover, ſince variety of parts made it more groſſe, and by conſequence more obnoxious to doubts, and intricacies, there ought to have been more care to diſtinguiſh betwixt thoſe parts which were coordinate, and thoſe which were ſubordinate: and in caſe ſome proviſoes proved inconſiſtent with others, it ſhould have been predetermined which ſhould ſuperſede, and which ſhould be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108155:6"/>
ſuperſeded. The King by one clauſe, as He is King, is to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained equally with Religion, &amp;c. yet by another clauſe, as He is a profeſt enemy to the Covenant, is to be purſued by arms, and brought to condigne puniſhment. The ſafetie of Religion may poſſibly be irreconcileable with the ſafety of the King: and the ſafety of the King confeſſedly owes a ſubordination to the ſafety of Religion: yet it is left dubious by the <hi>Covenant</hi> how far the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior here ſhall give way to the ſuperior. The unity, and peace of the Nations is the ſcope of one Article in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that Article had a high place in the intent of thoſe which indighted the <hi>Covenant:</hi> yet neither does this Article condemne all war as unlawfull betwixt the Nations, nor yet preſcribe when it may be judged Lawfull, nor by whom. The <hi>Scots</hi> by one interpretation of the <hi>Covenant</hi> are more ſtrictly imbodied with us then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo to be aſſiſting in our Reformation: yet by another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, they are to maintain to us our Nationall rights, and not at all to interpoſe in judging of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> affairs: and how can they reform where they may not judge, or how can they judge where they have no propriety? or how can they challenge more by vertue of this Covenant-union in <hi>England,</hi> then we do in <hi>Scotland?</hi> or how can confuſion of intereſts be introduced, where there remains a coordination ſo equally, and juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved?</p>
               <p>In the next place, there is a palpable partiality in the <hi>Covenant</hi> whereby is eaſie to be perceived in which Nation it received its being: for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are to be reformed, but the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is to be preſerved in its perfection of Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government. In ſumme, all three Nations are to purge away whatſoever is contrary to ſound doctrine, and the power of Godlines: and the only true ſtandart for ſuch purgation is the book of God, and foraſmuch as that is as truly a ſtandart to the <hi>Scots</hi> as to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they, though the <hi>Covenant</hi> prejudges and preſumes them perfect, are to be tryed by this Book as well as we are, and as that which is defective in them muſt be rectified by this ſtandart: ſo that which is not defective in us muſt be juſtified by the ſame. We conclude therefore juſtly, that either the Article it ſelf pre-judges us, or is by them ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged when they aſſume, that we are to conform to them, more then they are to conform to us: for ſo much as there is but one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108155:6"/>
only book to which we are bound equally both of us to conform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of that Book they are no more authenticall interpreters then we are. Theſe exceptions, and perhaps more, might be taken againſt the <hi>Covenant</hi> it ſelf, and the manner of obtruding it: but we fix not hereupon, nor will we mention it, as to the genuine intent of it, without reverence: the main offence that has been given to the world, has been given by the Takers of it in a falſe ſenſe, not by it ſelf. The inquirie therefore at this time is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> whether the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or <hi>Independents</hi> are moſt blameable before God, and Men, for the ſcandall which has been given by occaſion of this <hi>Solemn League, and Covenant.</hi> For the better diſcuſſion hereof, we ſhall do well to obſerve, firſt, which of the parties has been moſt clamorous againſt the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly, What the principall matter of thoſe clamors has been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3ly, What may be moſt probably aymed at by the raiſers of thoſe clamors: 4ly, What the iſſue has been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt it is apparent, that the <hi>Scoch Presbyterians,</hi> were the firſt compilers of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that they ſtill continue to ſet a ſacred value upon it, even unto a great degree of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and tis as apparent, that they had not been ſo ſtrangely tranſported with rage againſt us, but for our attributing leſſe then they do to it. The <hi>Covenant</hi> is their <hi>Word</hi> in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell; the <hi>Covenant in ſpecie</hi> is carried along by their Prieſts, when they march into the Field, as if it were held oraculous, and had the ſame preſence of God ingaged to it, as the Ark had amongſt the Jews: The <hi>Covenant</hi> in Law is made tranſcendent to an Act of Parliament; nay if both Nations ſhould agree in one Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that Act could neither make more intenſe, nor more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe the obliging force of this <hi>Covenant.</hi> This <hi>Covenant</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call'd Gods Covenant, and inſcribed by the <hi>Scots</hi> in the ſame table with Gods Covenant of mercy to his Church, and therefore when they will animate the people againſt us in war, they tell them that God cannot deliver up his Turtle dove, and his Covenant into the hands of ſuch Enemies. Now becauſe we come not up to this hight of adoration, we ſeem deſpiſers of the Covenant in the <hi>Scots</hi> eyes; and becauſe we ſeem deſpiſers of ſo holy a thing (accounted by them the very ſoul of Religion, and policy) their gall flows out moſt violently againſt us. They tell us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have brought great ſcandall, and reproach upon the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108155:7"/>
Name of God, the Name of his people, and the ſtudy of piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we have not onely broken the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> betwixt God and theſe Nations, but have in effect rejected it, and trampled upon it, are become enemies to all the ends of it, yea perſecuters of the ſervants, and people of God for their adherence to it. This in effect has been their burthen againſt us for divers yeers, though it be as void of truth, as it is of charity: and though we (who may more juſtly inſtance in this, and divers other things as breaches of the Covenant on their parts) have never made the Covenant any ground of quarrell, or reproach againſt them. Tis far from us to under-value the Covenant: we hold it a religious tie of mutuall aſſiſtance betwixt the Nations againſt the common Enemies of Religion, Liberty, and Union, and ſo we think hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of it: only we make it no ſpell, nor idol: nor can we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that it ties us to any duty, which our <hi>Preteſtation,</hi> and <hi>Vow,</hi> tied us not to before, nor did our <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> and <hi>Vow</hi> create any new duties to us when we firſt entred into them.</p>
               <p>In the next place, though there be many heavy breaches of <hi>Covenant</hi> ubrayded to us: yet all of them reſolve into theſe two, That we make not good what we have covenanted for either to God, or to the King. They could never ſay till this laſt Summer (nor can they truly ſay ſo of us laſt Summer) that we ever entred their Countrey to diſturbe their peace, to claim, or uſurp any ſhare in their Government, to lay taxes, ſeize Towns, waſte Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and deſtroy Natives amongſt them, as they have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us: all that they can object to us is, concerning injuries done to other parties, within our own territories, where by the Covenant they have no juriſdiction at all. In the behalf of God, they complain, that our profeſſed Faith is nothing elſe but a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Arrianiſme, Socinianiſme, Antinomianiſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Familiſme, Antiſcripturiſme, Anabaptiſme, Eraſtianiſme, and Independency: but they know well that for matter of Doctrine, we ſtill retain the old Articles of our Church, without any ſtaggering at all in the leaſt: and for matter of Diſcipline, we are willing to comply with them ſo far as they comply with Gods Word: but in this we have our eyes in our heads as well as they, and tis no Law for us to damne the opinion of <hi>Erastus,</hi> or the perſon of any <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> becauſe they by them are diſhonorably ſpoken of. The truth is, the <hi>Independent</hi> departs not ſo far from <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> as the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108155:7"/>
                  <hi>Presbyterian:</hi> and <hi>Eraſtus</hi> is no Freind to the ſupreme power of Synods, nor the uncontroulable dominion of Prieſts; and this makes the <hi>Independent</hi> ſo injurious to God, otherwiſe call'd the <hi>Kirk,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Kirkmen;</hi> were it not alone for this ſin in the <hi>Independent,</hi> Arrainiſme, Socinianiſme, &amp;c. (though we were therewith more infected then the <hi>Scots,</hi> as we are not) would make no breach of <hi>Covenant</hi> at all amongſt us.</p>
               <p>In behalf of the King, they complain, that we have treated him not onely as an Enemy to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> but alſo irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the very being of our State: and hereupon they take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to bewail the hard condition of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they are loaded with ſo many, and ſo great taxes, and ſubjected ſo rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and obdurate Laws: which ſhall receive Anſwers in due place. But in the mean time, tis neither the Kings, nor the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſufferings that ſtirs ſuch a deal of compaſſion, and zeal in the bowels of our fellow-Covenanters; tis the change of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which they perceive at laſt, they themſelves are verie great looſers. The truth is, the difference betwixt the King and us heretofore was of great advantage to them: and this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage (though it was no property, or right of theirs, but a wrong, and damage of ours) is now faln away from them. The King ſhall now have no more occaſion to give them penſions in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> nor gratifications here to do us diſ-ſervice in behalf of his Prerogative: nor ſhall we be any more bound to hire their ſervice againſt the Crown: and we muſt know, that theſe double offices, or ambidextrous verſatile arts of doing ſervices, and diſ-ſervices was as great a revenue to them (eſpecially ſince theſe laſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) as the intra does of all <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this therefore in the third place, may ſave us our labour of further inquiry about the ends, and aims of the <hi>Scots</hi> in their exclamations, and expoſtulations againſt us, when they conteſt in behalf of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> We ſee what the Clergie in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and here, are ſo thirſtie of, they would fain have Conſiſtories in every Pariſh, where they might have a free power to diſpence the Ordinances of Chriſt to ſuch as prove obſervant of them, and to caſt out all that are not ſubmiſſive enough: and for fear Lay Judges ſhould ballance too much there, they would have Claſſes above better defecated of ſuch ſecular perſons: and for fear leſt thoſe Claſſes ſhould be controuled by Parliaments: they would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108155:8"/>
have Aſſemblies above all to act for Chriſt in all matters whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever military, or judiciall, wherein Chriſts Throne, that is the Kirk may be concerned. No Proteſtant Biſhops ever aſpired to ſo ſollid a power on earth: nay except in the Popes own Patrimony, where He is a Prince, no Biſhops in Europe und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r any other Lay Princes are allowed to ſit and act ſo independently, upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſo large, as the <hi>Scotch</hi> Aſſemblies do: and therfore we cannot wonder if ſuch a new Hierachy, as this of the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be ſo deſirable amongſt our Kirk-men. Furthermore, when ſuch impetuous appetites of all the Clergie in <hi>Scotland,</hi> backs with ſome thouſands of ours in <hi>England,</hi> ſhall alſo fall in at the ſame time with the intereſts of ſo many of the Nobility, Gentry, and Souldiery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as drove a very thriving trade hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by ſiding ſometimes with the King againſt us, at other times with us againſt the King: and theſe things can be no other way compaſt, or pretended to but by the ambiguous ſenſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: we cannot wonder, if the Covenant be held ſo venerable a thing as it is in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and made the price of blood and war, as to every puntilio in it. More then this needs not be ſaid of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians, if as much could be ſaid of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, and that they may have as fair hopes, and probable ends againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> by ſuppreſſing the Covenant unduly, as the <hi>Scots</hi> have againſt us by inforcing it immoderately: I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly quit this as a nugatory, weightles preſumption. The laſt thing that may deſerve to ſtay and take up our thoughts a little is, the iſſue, and event that both ſides have met with, and this may juſtly ſway our cenſures in ſuch a queſtion, as this is. The King being driven to extremities in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and being privy to the differences betwikt both Nations about ſome conſtructions of the Covenant, choſe rather to caſt himſelf into theirs then our hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we cannot imagine that the King which ſo hated and feared the true intent of the Covenant, would rather intruſt his life to thoſe which He thought more true, then thoſe whom he thought more falſe to the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what ſucceſſe had that truſt of his? it coſt him his ruine in the end; for they which interpreted the Covenant for his purpoſe whileſt he was to put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108155:8"/>
tendered, when the King was thereby, and by other ſecret correſpondencies rendered more dangerous to us, and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>councellable to Himſelf was fatall to Him. But now ſince in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Son the former interpretation is reſumed the ſecond time: how has the caſe been altered? The caſe in truth is even thus, the young King has repented of his coming amongſt them, the Kirk begins to repent of his admiſſion amongſt them: the hand of God has been heavy upon both: and tis almoſt come to this, that the moſt conſcientious <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt read the Covenant in a new ſence amongſt us: whileſt all the reſt muſt lay afide the Covenant wholly amongſt the ancient, profeſſed Enemies of it. I will not ſtrain this argument of ſucceſſe too high: but this is to be remarked, that the ſucceſſe here put, is not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or meer ſucceſſe: foraſmuch as it has been ſent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after ſolemn appeals thither made by two religious parties, and as the honour of God was much concerned in it, ſo the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſending it was more then ordinary.</p>
               <p>We draw nearer now to the Covenant it ſelf, and ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it firſt in the whole, and then in its parts. The firſt claſhing we had with the <hi>Scots</hi> was about the right which each Nation had paſt to the other meerly by joyning in ſuch a mutuall, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſtipulation: for when we objected to them upon ſeverall occaſions, that they interpoſed too far in the Affairs, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of <hi>England,</hi> they as often gave us this Anſwer, that we were not ſince our conjunction with them in the Covenant and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to look upon them as ſtrangers, or ſo far diſtanced, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>England,</hi> as they were before. This was at large refuted, and ſilenced by the Parliament, and therefore little need to be ſaid in it: and indeed Leagues, and Pacts are common amongſt all other Nations, yet no man ever argued ſuch a State is united to ſuch a State as to ſuch a particular war, or as to the attaining of ſome other particular purpoſes, therefore they are incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into one State, and united as to all other purpoſes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. This is ridiculous: ſenſe, and experience is ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode it. And if the <hi>Scots</hi> plead further, that there is ſomething extraordinary in this bond of the Covenant, which knits faſter, and cloſer then all other bonds: proof will fail them herein: and yet if proof were not failing: their equality of intereſt with ours in <hi>England</hi> would not follow notwithſtanding. For either the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108155:9"/>
has reduced our two States and Dominions into one, or not. If it has not; then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mans intereſt is as intire, and remains as diſtinct from the Scochmans as it was before: confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of properties is a thing as abhorred in policy, as a vacuity is in nature. But if both the governments by our Covenant aduna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be compacted into one, and the ſame: then where is that one and the ſame ſupreme Tribunall, which is equally to determine all Nationall diſputes, and may legally challenge ſubmiſſion from all aggrieved parties? Should an Army be committed to 2. Generals, and the Commiſſion ſpecifie nothing concerning the partition of their Commands, and prevention of their rivalities, nothing but ruin could be expected. Therefore the very letter of the Covenant was ſo far from intending to take away all ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality from us, that it clearly puts each Nations Liberties and rights amongſt thoſe other things, which it propoſes to it ſelf to ſave by this promiſed aſſiſtance of each Nation: ordring likewiſe this aſſiſtance, that no man ſhould yeeld the ſame otherwiſe then in his ſeverall place, and calling, and according to all our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places, and intereſts. Tis the more immodeſty alſo in the <hi>Scots</hi> to arrogate to themſelves an equall ſhare in the rich Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England,</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> never made any pretence to in the like barrener ſoil of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But if a moity of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> government in all caſes whatſoever be not due to the <hi>Scots,</hi> as they are our brethren in Covenant with us, and equall parties in the ſame ſtipulation: yet in the next place we cannot deny them an equall ſhare in the judgment of the Covenant, and all diſputes about the ſame. If they be contractors with us, and by vertue of the ſame Contract are as well inabled to require performances of conditions from us, as they are obliged to perform conditions to us, it ſtands with all manner of equity and reaſon that they ſhould have as great a latitude and freedom, as we, in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what is to be performed on either part. We deny not to the <hi>Scots</hi> the ſame extent of judging in <hi>England,</hi> as to Covenant diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which we claim in <hi>Scotland:</hi> this onely is denied by us: that either they are as properly Judges of matters in <hi>England,</hi> as they are in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or we in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as in <hi>England.</hi> This was the fallacy that ſhould have blinded us, but there is no ſuch great depth of ſophiſtry in it. The States of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> are equally independent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the Covenant cannot grant to one equall

a juriſdiction over another. So long as both Nations ſtand upon equality, and confeſſe no ſuperiority to be in either: ſo long it is vain, injurious, and againſt the ends of the Covenant for one to paſſe ſentence upon the other. Tis vain, becauſe the ſentence has no operation at all, the party ſentenced proteſts juſtly againſt it, and all third indifferent parties look indifferently upon the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and proteſtation.

               <p>The late King ſome years before the eruption of theſe troubles had made many dangerous attempts againſt the purity of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberties of the Subjects in all the three Nations. Now in 1643. when Arms were taken up on all hands either for aſſiſting, or oppoſing the King in thoſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes againſt Religion, and Liberty: the Covenant was formed by that party which roſe up againſt the King, and the main, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary uſe, it was formed, &amp; intended for was to protect Religion, and Liberty againſt Him, and his adherents: The formers of it alſo at the ſame time took notice, that the caſes of Religion, and Liberty could not be well ſeparated, foraſmuch as the King if He prevailed againſt the one, would more eaſily prevail againſt, the other. Religion was the richer Free-hold, but Liberty had the ſtronger fence to preſerve it from the violence of intruders. It was likewiſe viſible that Religion would make the people more zealous for Liberty, and Liberty would impower the people the better to defend Religion. beſides, ſuppoſe the taking away of the people, and you ſuppoſe with all the taking away of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuppoſe the taking away of Liberty, and you do in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſuppoſe the taking away of the people; for the life of a bodie politick conſiſts not in living, but in living free. The Covenant therefore primarily, and ultimately propoſes to it ſelf the ſafety and proſperity of the true Proteſtant Religion in the ſafety and Liberty of the three Nations, and the ſafety and Liberty of the three Nations in the ſafety and proſperity of the true Proteſtant Religion. All other Articles in the Covenant are but ſecondary, and ſubordinate hereunto: and they are to have reſpect from us not as they ſtand higher, or lower in order, but as they are more, or leſſe ſerviceable to thoſe higher purpoſes, for which they were at firſt ordained. Upon this ground, that branch in the Covenant which obliges us, to ſeek God in this ſacred Ingagement by a ſpeciall amendment of our lives, and reformation of our own private wayes: at ſuch a time as this, merits the honor of the firſt place. And next hereunto worthily may ſucceed thoſe 2. branches by which the Nations are ſo ſtrictly confederated in peace, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108155:10"/>
amity: and by which all parties to this confederation have paſt their ſolemn Pacts to be aſſiſting to each other, &amp; bringing all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites to condigne puniſhment. That branch which was inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in favour of the King (at that time the principal Enemy of the Covenant) and for ſaving of his Prerogatives (ſo deſperately at that time diſputed by the ſword) if it could challenge any place at all, could certainly challenge none but the laſt and loweſt, how ſoever the <hi>Scots</hi> had ranged it, and do ſtill propugn it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſurely could more cloud the meaning of each part in the Covenant, or more peſter, and perturbe the whole frame of it, then this inſertion. The ſame Oath to God now binds us in one clauſe to purſue with fire, and ſword all that are enemies to this Oath, and yet the grand enemy of this Oath by another clauſe in the ſame Oath, is preſerved inviolable: nay that clauſe which preſerves one Enemy, has a local preference before, that which purſues all. Hereupon if a Commiſſion be taken from the King to deſtroy this Solemn League, He that takes it dies igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minouſly as a Traytor, but he that gives it, has that indemnity given by the Covenant, which his kingly office could not have given him. The very penning alſo of this Article leaves us very dubious, and perplext, how far the Kings royalty is ſaved to Him: for the ſaving is not abſolute; but refers to ſome thing in order above it: and that is the ſaving of Religion and Liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here therefore two new doubts meet with us to intangle us: 1. In what degree the King may be proceeded againſt, when in ſuch a degree He indangers Religion, and Liberty: 2ly, how we ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly judge of theſe degrees, when our judgements are wholly left at liberty, without any limits, or marks ſet by the Covenant. The <hi>Scots</hi> have proceeded ſo far as to impriſon the Kings perſon, and to ſequeſter all his royall power, which is a temporary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning, and depoſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they ſuppoſe Religion, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was ſo far impugned by Him: but they ſuppoſe that from an impriſoned, ſequeſtred King no further offence, or danger can ariſe: and therfore He ought not further to ſuffer. This is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently erroneous: but this is not all yet, for they will not only thus expoſe Religion and Liberty to greater hazards in their own Countrey, but they will over-rule us with their errors, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force us to run the ſame hazards in our Countrey likewiſe: and this is more, we are ſure, then the Covenant enforces us unto.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108155:11"/>
And doubtles this is very hard. For beſides that there is no Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor ſcarce any individuall perſon in any Nation, who is not Judge of his own danger: in this caſe our judgement is wreſted out of our hands, and reſigned into theirs, who are the creators of our dangers, and have declared for, and thereby diverſe times exaſperated our greateſt Enemy againſt us.</p>
               <p>In Novem. 1643. before the Covenant was conſummated, the Lord Generall <hi>Eſſex</hi> moved in Parliament for the ſhortning of our war, that the King (who perchance was then encouraged to prolong the ſame out of hope of impunity at laſt, in caſe his arms ſhould miſcarry) might have a peremptory day ſet Him to come in, or elſe to know his danger: and this was conſented to by both Houſes, but obſtructed by the <hi>Scoch</hi> Commiſſioners: what ſervice was done to the King by this obſtruction of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and divers other the like ambidextrous dealings, ſince that time, and how much longer the war was protracted by it, and how much miſchief the ſame has at laſt drawn upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> as well as us, time has clearly enough demonſtrated. And yet ſtill, upon this the meaneſt, and moſt intricate article of the Covenant, they think they may break the unity, and peace of great Brittain againſt one of the moſt indiſputable, fundamental tyes of the Covenant, and that onely to ſhew their zeal to an Anti-covenanter: which is a breach as indiſputable, and fundamentall, as the former. The intrinſecall form of the Covenant binds one party to aſſiſt the other againſt a common enemy: it binds not one party to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent againſt the other: for how can that be call'd aſſiſtence, which is direct oppoſition? Beſides, it binds ſpecially to aſſiſt againſt ſuch an enemy, as is injurious to the others right, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and property: and can the <hi>Scots</hi> perform this bond to us, when that which they call aſſiſtance to us, is oppoſition againſt us, even by taking away our right, freedome, and property? for what right can remain to us, whileſt we are ſubjected to their forces, what freedome, whileſt we are to be judged by their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What property, when we have loſt the independency of equals? Certainly if we covenanted with the <hi>Scots</hi> as equall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we did not covenant with them, as ſuperior Judges; and if we had ſo covenanted with them, our covenanting by Oath with God had been ſuperfluous, but we hope that will not be held ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perflous: and therefore we will not endeavour to aſſoil our ſelves
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108155:11"/>
before the <hi>Scots,</hi> we will onely in charity let them know, how we have hopes, to be aſſoiled before God. The change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England,</hi> which could not be without the execution of the late King, and rejection of his poſterity (more then they could be without change of Government) was urged upon us (and God, before whom we plead, knows we had not long premeditated it before, nor imbraced it willingly at laſt) by two unanſwerable, irreſiſtable arguments. The firſt was drawn from our duty to God: the ſecond from the naturall, neceſſary care of our own preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt argument preſſed us hard, that what God had commanded could not be reverſed by any act, or pact of man: that God had commanded us, to puniſh blood with blood in all perſons whatſoever under the power, and force of our Laws: and therefore our Covenant could not exempt the King himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it be ſaid, that the King of <hi>England</hi> was above all Law; that has been diſputed by the ſword theſe many years, and decided for us by ſignall victories: and the <hi>Scots</hi> have appeared as far upon that Triall, as we have done; and after that triall, tis unequall for us to deſcend now, to any other. We preſcribe nothing to other Nations, whoſe Kings have a Legiſlative power, and thereupon are <hi>ſolati Legibus,</hi> and have their very wils interpreted, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as Laws: nor do we cenſure ſuch States as have Princes ſubject to Laws, yet uſe not rigor in all caſes whatſoever. We are willing that every one ſhould ſtand, or fall to his own Maſter. Onely, when immuring, ſequeſtring, depoſing, impoyſoning of Princes has been very frequent in the world, that no Nation can be excuſed thereof at ſome time or other: this ſeems beyond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that our judiciall, publick execution upon the late <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould undergo an harſher cenſure then all theſe, meerly becauſe it wanted not the due ſolemnities of Law, and Juſtice to attend it. May a Prince be reduced from his publick capacitie, and when He is made a private perſon ſhall he be treated ſo, as no private perſon may be treated? Shall he be ſubjected to clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine, unlawfull proceedings, belowe the right of a common perſon, becauſe He was once more then a common perſon? and ſhall either Juriſts, or Statiſts that have any inſight into the Laws of God, and Nations, ſtand for a ſecreted veiled juſtice, ſuch as bluſhes, and dares not ſhew her face in open Court, yet paſſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects upon that juſtice, which as far abhors darknes? and diſdains the uſe of masks?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:108155:12"/>Our next argument was drawn from the hard neceſſity that was incumbent upon us for ſaving our ſelves from utter ruin. Divers times we had made humble addreſſes to the King for a cordiall pacification, the Lord knows our ſincerity therin: and the <hi>Scots</hi> that are now our accuſers were for divers years our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in that behalf: but before 1646. the K: had too much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> abettors, and ſo would not hearken. In the year, 1646. the Kings <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces in <hi>England</hi> failing, we made new addreſſes at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> where the King was in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Priſoner: but we ſoon found at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> that the Kings confidence was ſtill ſupported there alſo by ſomething that had been infuſed unto Him by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſo that hope prooved fruſtrate likewiſe. The dealing of the <hi>Scots</hi> herein was very cloſe, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were in Commiſſion with the <hi>Scots</hi> for governing the affairs of that Army in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Quarters, knew nothing by what invitation the King was drawn from <hi>Oxford</hi> thither, nor to what purpoſe <hi>Montreil</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Agent was there ſolicititing; but when our Propoſitions were rejected, and that the <hi>Scots</hi> (who joyned with us in tendring them) began to diſpute the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, &amp; their own againſt us in other things: and that their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mouth <hi>Louden</hi> profeſſed againſt the rigour of our capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the ſame elaborate Oration to the King, wherein He ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly laid open the neceſſity of them, we could not but diſcern a halting in that Nation: and that that halting had as ſtrange an operation upon the King. The King thought now He had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as great a ſtrength of <hi>Scots</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> the ſame being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fain away from our ſtrength, as He had loſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Nasby,</hi> and in the <hi>Weſt:</hi> and for our parts, had the <hi>Scots</hi> been gold-proof, we ſhould have thought ſo too. The diſpoſing of the King was the matter in queſtion: the <hi>Scots</hi> were not deſirous to take him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor would leave him in <hi>England:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under our pay within our own territories, where we had publick perſons in Commiſſion with them: without the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or their Commiſſioners conſents, they would be a guard to Him in <hi>England,</hi> till their Parliament at home were further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. In the mean time after a long conſuming war ended, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> was conſtrained ſtill to pay and maintain two Armies: the <hi>Scotch</hi> to prevent a new war if that were poſſible, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſuſtain a new war, if prevention proved unpoſſible: ſo that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108155:12"/>
every moment was irkſome to us, whilſt the Kings pretentions was an occaſion to draw ſo much treaſure from our coffers, and it was as irkſome to the King to ſee the <hi>Scotch</hi> arrears, or any thing elſe beſides his pretentions brought into debate, but at laſt the <hi>Scotch</hi> arrears took place, and juſtled out the Kings matters; for after a great ſum agreed upon, the <hi>Scots</hi> quite contrary to the high expoſtulations of ſome of their Papers, thought it honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to leave the King in <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thought it as profitable to buy the <hi>Scots</hi> out of <hi>England.</hi> This probably might prepare the King for new Pacificatory addreſſes, partly by damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hopes in the <hi>Scots,</hi> and partly by defeating the next privy applications of the <hi>Scots</hi> to Him: and partly by giving a better relliſh of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> whoſe priſoner then He was, &amp; yet had been treated very honorably; but this would not do, new Propofiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were once and again ſent, and denyed, and new aſſurances from the <hi>Scots</hi> were admitted, which procured thoſy denyalls. Nay, after that <hi>Hamilton</hi> in 1648. Commiſſion'd by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had invaded us with 20000 men, and was beaten, and a new party of Kirkmen of a contrary party to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> had gotten the ſway of the State into their hands, by the help of our forces who purſued the <hi>Hamiltonians</hi> beyond the <hi>Tweed;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtill received further repulſes. So vowedly inflexible was the King againſt all that could be tenderd by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though even when his condition was grown low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the Parliaments Propoſitions not at all rayſd higher, and ſo vowedly obſtinate were the <hi>Scots,</hi> and all parties, and factions among them upon all changes of affairs whatſoever, to make all agreements of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with the King, diſadvantageous to their fellow Covenanters. Their voluminous Papers yet ſhew what they pretended to in diſpoſing of the Kings perſon in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> what a negative voice in the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> they would aſſign to Him: what revenues, and ſigniorys out of the Court of Wards and elſewhere they would ſecure to Him: what power military, and judiciall they would intruſt him with in <hi>England:</hi> and how all ſhould be managed by the joynt advice and conſent of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſumme, the King muſt again be more humbly ſought to then ever: He muſt be diſcharged of impriſonment, received in pomp at <hi>London,</hi> to treat about what we had to propoſe: and his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108155:13"/>
freedome muſt be ſuch that He muſt ſent for, and advice with what Delinquents He pleaſde: if we granted the <hi>Scots</hi> this, we left our ſelves nothing: if we denyed, All <hi>Ireland</hi> was at the Kings devotion, all <hi>Ormonds,</hi> all <hi>Oneals</hi> adherents, all the old <hi>Iriſh,</hi> all the <hi>Engliſh Iriſh:</hi> all the Proteſtants, all the Papiſts were againſt us: we had then ſcarce three conſiderable Towns left in that Countrey: In <hi>Scotland</hi> all that <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> all that <hi>Huntly,</hi> all that <hi>Hamilton,</hi> all that <hi>Arguile</hi> the <hi>Kirks</hi> Champion had any power in, even <hi>Jo: Cheeſly</hi> himſelf to get a dubbing at the laſt hand was for the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cauſe: In <hi>England</hi> the Clergie had imbitterd the City, and the City had ſharpned the Countrey againſt the Army, and againſt all that had not forgotten the firſt quarrel with the King. The Parliament it ſelf had ſome leading men in it that had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly capitulated with the King, and thoſe falſe Leaders had many other ignorant followers that would beleeve no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. At ſuch a time as this, when all forrein States deſired, and contributed ſomething to our ruin beſides; and the King had as free ſcope to ſollicite and treat them as ever, and did make uſe of his time, eſpecially to conclude with the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> what ſhould the Army do? to execute the King, and eradicate Monarchy, was to expoſe themſelves to a thouſand hazards, and extremities: to ſpare the King, and Monarchy, and ſubmit to the <hi>Scoch Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> faction, was to periſh inevitably: to treat with the King brought them upon this perplexity: either they muſt propoſe things ſafe for the State, and then they had no hopes of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: or they muſt propoſe things unſafe, which would be ſinfull, diſhonorable, and ruinous to them, as well as others in the end. I am confident <hi>England</hi> never travail'd with ſuch ſharp throes, or ſtrugled through ſuch gaſping agonies ſince She was firſt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and none but God could have given her ſuch a deliverance. When the King was retrograde to his Truſt, and with the ſwinge of his Train had ſwept all the chief luminaries out of our firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: when the Clergie was generally diſaffected, and with their doctrines had almoſt poyſoned all the City, and almoſt half the Countrey, when the remaining part of the Parliament that had ſtoodout the brunt ſo long, and wetherd ſo many guſts became recreant at laſt, then did an Army inſpirde with ſtrange courage but ſtranger counſell from above, ſtep in to ſave their ſinking Countrey, over-powring all the windes, and waves that raged
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108155:13"/>
againſt them. The wonderfull diſpenſations of God bringing great matters to paſſe by ſuch croſſe meanes muſt be obſerved, and adored by all that are not aliens from Religion: and I doubt not but future Parliaments in future ages will be amazedly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with them: but of all men we that now live, and ſee the effects of that critical time, and what a proſpering poſture we are now in, within ſo ſhort a ſpace, in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and round about by the ſeconding mercies of God ſince, muſt needs moſt gratfully recent theſe things, except we have ſold our ſelves to Atheiſm &amp; rebellion againſt Heaven. The Chiliaſts from hence and from the race ordering of all our commotions, ſince, 1640. &amp; ſomething before may aſſure themſelves that Chriſt is to reign upon Earth, and that he ha's already taken the Scepter out of the greater Warriors and Counſellors hands of the earth into his own: For the hills are now plained, and the vallies are raiſed, and yet there is no humane hand appearing in it.</p>
               <p>Some men thinke all ſucceſſe unworthy of all regard, as if there were no difference between the adminiſtrations of God in his Church in times of diſtreſſe, and his diſpoſing of other mens ordinary affaires at other times: or as if <hi>Alexander, Hector, Caeſar,</hi> had foyled their enemy by the ſame inward promptings as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, David,</hi> and <hi>Judas Machabeus</hi> did: but this certainly is an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious error: for as there is a generall providence of God by which the courſe of all naturall things is ſteered: ſo there uſes to be a ſpeciall interpoſition of God in ſome things and is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, when his owne honour and intereſt is ſpecially concerned: and this ſpeciall interpoſition is ſometimes of the finger of God, when the effects are leſſe ſupernaturall; but when the effects are more ſtupendious, and beyond reaſon; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe ſtiles this the making bare, and the ſtretching forth of Gods arme.</p>
               <p>They which are diſaffected to the late egregious proceedings of God in the world will not, but they ſhall ſee, and owne this truth. But let us returne to the procedure of our affaires; when the Army ſaw it ſelfe ſurrounded with ſo many dangers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting enemies; it began by ſome faintneſſes, and carnall doubts to grow dangerous, and an enemy to it ſelf; it began to receive ſuggeſtions that the removing of a King and Kingly power was like to prove more unfeaſeable, then to treat a King into reaſon.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108155:14"/>
And this was likely to have proved the more banefull, becauſe the King by ſpeciall graces was as ready to draw them into this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcado as they were prone by their irreſolutions, and diffiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to run into it themſelves; for 'tis thought all agreements with the King would have been ſhort lived, but if any had been made with the Army, that would have bin but as <hi>Samſons</hi> withs, and ropes, which was the reaſon, That the King, upon whom Five Addreſſes of the Parliament had wrought nothing, ſeemed to lay the Armies Propoſals, though little differing in ſubſtance, exceedingly to heart: Howſoever it pleaſed God at this low ebbe of things, when the Army was weakeſt, and moſt apt to be inveagled, and when the King was ſecureſt, and had moſt hopes to inveagle, to break off that Treaty, and then was brought on the laſt with the Parliament in the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> which when it was likely to overturne all by accepting of the Kings Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; then alſo did God make the Army his Inſtrument, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting that ſad concluſion. The debate in Parliament after the returne of the Commiſſioners, was; Whether the Kings Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions at that Treaty had been ſuch, as might make further appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations hopefull, or no: and after a very long time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpent, the affirmative was Voted. This Vote ſtruck a true apprehenſion of an univerſall imminent danger into the Army; for, now an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the King by the ſenſe of the Parliament was to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, whereas in truth any accord (beſides an abſolute ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the King) was ſufficient to take away all hope; for ſince the King unſubmitting, had no viſible obſtacle betwixt him, and his long, eagerly purſued ends, but the Army: and any accord was certaine to diſcard, or new form that Army, the ſecurity of all our Laws, and rights; yea, and lives was ſolely to depend upon the Kings Honour: and what was honour in his ſenſe, who was ſo principled, and who had now for diverſe yeares waded through ſo much bloud, and expoſed himſelf, and poſterity to ſo certain a diſinheriſon, only to be true to his principles, any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary man may determine; Immediatly therfore after this Vote paſt, the Army ſaw no other remedy to prevent their eminent overthrow but to lay a hand of force upon the affirmative Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Parliament, and to bring the King to a tryall, which were done accordingly, and ſo both they prevail'd and we were preſerved as to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:108155:14"/>Some ſay twas more Noble to truſt the King too much, then too little: but theſe conſider not that Truſt is not always alike free; in this caſe diſtruſt could ruin but a few, and that by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall courſe; but Truſt was likely to have ruin'd Millions, and the Laws to boot. Some of the Scotts ſay; God was able to ſave Religion and Liberty in deſpight of the King: had he prov'd perfidious, and therefore if the King was not to be truſted, yet God was. Theſe conſider not that God holds himſelfe tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not truſted, when we leave the uſe of ordinary hopefull meanes on Earth, and rely upon unprovmiſt ſuccour from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Some ſay if the King was not to be truſted, yet the Army had no lawfull warrant to judge of him, and the Parliament, but theſe conſider not that extream, eminent, and otherwiſe inſuperable dangers give private perſons; yea, ſingle private perſons, an extraordinary warrant to defend themſelves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and this Warrant will be avowed by neceſſity, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that all Law admits to be within the reach of no Law; and the danger was here extream, becauſe it concerned Life, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Liberty, and all that could be endeared to man: it was likewiſe eminent, becauſe another day might have prevented them by disbanding, or ſome other way. Laſtly, it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſuperable; for that there was no other Judge, or hand on Earth that could hear and relieve them. Others ſay ſtill, the danger was not ſo exiſtent or manifeſt to other men, as to the Army. Let it be conſidered by theſe;</p>
               <p>1 That Nature has entruſted to every man a ſpeciall cuſtody of his owne ſafety; and there is none of us all, but would be loath that the ſame ſhould be transferred to another mans care, <hi>viz.</hi> in caſes extraordinary, where legall remedy cannot be had in a common way.</p>
               <p>2 In matters of fact, where no full proof can be had, every mans judgement is to be leſſe peremptory, and to take in as much of Charity as is poſſible. Whether the King would indeed have broken his Truſt, or no: and whether the Army did falſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch a fear, or no: neither of theſe is matter of Law, nor liable to any infallible proof, as to the fact: wherefore I may ſin againſt charity if I paſſe my judgement againſt either, but I cannot ſin, if I leave the judgement of both to God, and to waite for his determination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:108155:15"/>Some in favor of the King frame conjectures that He was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably very firme in performing becauſe He was ſo ſlow, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in ingaging: and that if He had been lubricous or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of his faith, He would not have refuſed an accord with the Parliament ſo long upon what tearms ſoever. Others make uſe of contrary conjectures to a contrary purpoſe; alleadging that 'twas but art in the King to dally, and to trifle away ſome time with the Engliſh, to ſet the higher eſteem upon his conſtancy, and make them the more aſſured of his performance: that He was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſecure of the Engliſhmens facility, and plain-dealing, and never made any doubt to be received at his own pleaſure: that he was never to his laſt day void of other confidences, or deſtitute of other plots to compaſſe his deſigne by force, that for his fidelity, and the value he ſet upon promiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and oaths, and the infinite ſubtilty he had to evade any ingagement whatſoever, ſcarce any forraign State or Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> was ignorant in that point.

But I liſt not to leane upon ſuch Reeds, as conjectures are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tis enough for me to know that whatſoever man intends, or acts wickedly and perverſly, God orders, and diſpoſes rightly, and profitably; may he ſo do for <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in all theſe late mutations.</p>
               <p>It remains now, that we cleer our ſelves in point of Church-Reformation: for having covenanted to reform in Doctrine, Diſcipline, &amp;c. according to the word of God, and the patterns of the beſt Reformed Churches, we are bound (as the <hi>Scots</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) to take our pattern from them, and that, we, as yet refuſe to do. This is the grand, and moſt heynous charge the <hi>Scots</hi> have againſt us: and becauſe we follow not the modell of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which they hold the beſt Reformed Church in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> they ſeek to overwhelm us with a thouſand calumnies, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to poſſeſſe the world that wee are nothing elſe but a Lerna of Hereſies, and a ſinck of all uncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>To this we anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. When wee are bound to reform according to the word of God, and the examples of the beſt Churches; wee conceive the word of God ſignifies all, &amp; the examples of other Churches ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing at all; for thoſe are the beſt Churches that reform

neereſt to the word of God, and what Churches have neereſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed cannot be known but by the word of God it ſelf, ſo that that inſtance might have been ſpared.</p>
               <p>2. If it come to tryal by the word of God, whether the <hi>Scots</hi> Reformation be the beſt or no, the <hi>Scots</hi> therein can challenge no more priviledg of judging, then we or any other Church. When we were governed by Biſhops, the Goſpel of Chriſt was as pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered in <hi>England,</hi> and as heartily embraced by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (any being Judges beſides the <hi>Scots</hi>) as ever it was in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and ſhall it be ſaid, that becauſe wee have caſt off Biſhops, and thereby come ſome ſteps neerer to the <hi>Scots,</hi> our Doctrine remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill the ſame without all innovation, ſhall it be ſaid that our very approaches have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

It will be required at their hands who are intruſted with the government of Chriſts Church, that his word and Ordinances be piouſly and duly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed: and it will be required at their hands who are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the diſpenſation of Chriſts words and Ordinances be faithfully and ſincerely entertained: but if the Governors right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharge their duty, and the governed fail of theirs, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors ſhall not anſwer for what they cannot help; 'tis God that gives the encreaſe, and does the ſaving, inward work: the Miniſter cannot go beyond planting, watering, and doing that which is the outward work. 'Tis one thing therefore for the <hi>Scots</hi> to upbraid the Flock, and another thing to upbraid the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers of the Flock, and yet the <hi>Scots</hi> conſtantly take an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt us by confounding theſe two things.</p>

               <p>1. That growing of Tares in Gods Field, does not alwayes ſhew that the Husband-man ſowed ill grain, the contrary rather is true: inaſmuch as the more buſie the good Husband-man is culturing and improving the Earth, the more ſollicitous ever the Enemie is in caſting in his malignant ſeeds, &amp; the more readily eager he is to deboſh &amp; mar the crop. It was ſo with the Church of Chriſt in it's Infancy; it was ſo under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in it's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity; it was ſo in <hi>Luthers</hi> dayes, when it began to recover out
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108155:16"/>
of a long lethargy: and we muſt expect the like now, when our aces are ſet upon the laſt, and greateſt calcination as ever the Church ſaw: as Reformation now in the ends of the world, when the chiefe myſteries of iniquity begin to be revealed, will moſt annoy Sathan, ſo Sathan will double his rage to annoy us accordingly. <hi>Hornius</hi> the <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> a great friend of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and who in favour of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery, has written a bitter Tract in <hi>Latine,</hi> to defame us in <hi>Germany;</hi> after he has repreſented us as the moſt leprous, contaminated Nation in the world; yet confeſſes withall, that to the prodigious revoltings of ſome amongſt us, there is an anſwerable improvement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in burning zeale, and ſhining ſanctity. In Religion beauty and deformity are not inconſiſtent: thoſe times often which have been moſt glorious for divine diſpenſations of knowledge and grace, have been likewiſe moſt deplorable for perſecutions and apoſtacies; and this has ever been a great ſtumbling block to carnall minds. If therefore the great Lyon range and roare, and ramp leſſe in <hi>Scotland</hi> then in <hi>England,</hi> let not our Brethren boaſt of it, or think themſelves the more ſafe.</p>
               <p>2. Let not partiality blind the <hi>Scots;</hi> Strangers think <hi>Scotland</hi> ha's as great cauſe of humiliation as <hi>England,</hi> if not greater. <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acos intra muros peceatur, &amp; extra;</hi> It were more Chriſtian-like in them, and leſſe Phariſaicall, to aggravate their own ſins, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate other mens, then to extenuate their own ſins, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate other mens: and if they wil remit nothing at all of their rigour againſt us, yet let them not ſtuffe their long catalogues of Pſeudodoxies with ſuch wandring terms as <hi>Familiſme, Eraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme, Independentiſme,</hi> &amp;c. which taken improperly, may reach the beſt Saints of God, and are ſeldome uſed properly by any. 'Tis a ſad thing to offend Gods little ones, 'tis a more ſad thing to deprave many congregations of Gods moſt precious ones.</p>
               <p>3. Whatſoever judgement the <hi>Scots</hi> will take upon them to paſſe againſt the people in <hi>England,</hi> yet let them not alway ſet upon the Magiſtrates, or Miniſters account what they find repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the people; let them not call us fedifragous for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing things beyond us, and ſuch as none can redreſſe beſides God; but this has been toucht upon already.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore ſee what is peculiarly objected to the preſent governing power in <hi>England.</hi> The Magiſtrate in <hi>England</hi> is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108155:16"/>
to be an Enemie to Magiſtracy, a ſtrange charge certainly. The very laſt anſwers we had this laſt Summer to our Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the march of our Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> tell us from the Committee of <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and Commiſſioners of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> that our expedition into <hi>Scotland</hi> is to overturn Religion, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Civill and Eccleſiaſticall, and to ſet up amongſt them the ſame vaſt toleration of Religion, as we have done in <hi>England.</hi> Now if this were true, the ſins of the People would become the ſins of the Magiſtrate, but what credite can this obtain in the world. As for the overturning of civill power, that is anſwered already; we confeſſe a change of the Form, but we deny any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturning of the thing cal'd Government in <hi>England;</hi> and wee hope our actions here, and in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in other Forreign parts, yea, &amp; our War in <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo will quit and eſſoyn us of anarchy and ere long make the <hi>Scots</hi> ſwalow downe their own untruths with open ſhame. As for the overturning Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall alſo, that may be as reſolutely and juſtly denyed as the other; for that lawfull power which was in Biſhops before, is ſtill in being; and though we have not committed it ſo intirely unto Presbyteries and Aſſemblies, as the <hi>Scots</hi> would have us, to the diſhonouring of our <hi>Common wealth;</hi> yet we have preſerved it from abolition and utter diſſolution. The truth is, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of our <hi>Covenant,</hi> we have conſulted with a Synod of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines about the beſt method of Diſcipline: and they are not able to ſatisfie us, that the word of God (the rule limited by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> for our Reformation) does inveſt any convention of Clergy-men, who claim to be the only due Repreſentants of the Church, and immediate Vice-gerents of Chriſt, with ſupremacy of independent power in all cauſes Eccleſiaſticall. The Pope claims no more in the pale of the <hi>Italian</hi> Church; the Popiſh Cardinals and Biſhops in <hi>Spain, France,</hi> &amp;c. claim leſſe; and the Proteſtant Prelates, whom we lately ejected for Uſurpers, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver claimed halfe ſo much. Now the word of God is ſo farre from holding forth to us any ſuch vaſt power in perſons Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall; that it's information is contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples of our Saviour for many years after his death aſſumed no more Authority on earth then he aſſumed: that our Saviour plainly diſclaimed all juriſdiction and dominion in this world: that by pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108155:17"/>
about power, or precedence amongſt his own deareſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. Beſides, if any ſuch ſpirituall ſupremacy were veſted by divine right in any ſuch Repreſentants of the Church, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars of Chriſt: it were neceſſary that exact obedience in all things ſhould bepayd them by all Inferiours: and if ſuch obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were due, it would be conſequently neceſſary, that they ſhould be free from errour, elſe the alleadged ſupremacy would ſerve to no great purpoſe: and we know God and nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce not great matters, but for purpoſes as great. This made the Romiſh Hierarchiſts rationally aſſert an infallible ſpirit, when they had once aſſerted an u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>limitable power in the Church; for where the Scripture is clear, there needs no ſoveraign Judg, every man is a ſufficient Interpreter to himſelfe: and where the Scripture is doubtfull, the doubt is to be cleared by ſomething elſe of the ſame indiſputable authority, or elſe that defect is not ſupplyed, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> can the ſame ſubmiſſion be demanded. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon this account we ſay, that unleſſe our ſupream Church Lords (when they take us off from our own judgments, &amp; cannot convince us by divine authority of cleer Scripture) wil not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of ſome other divine authority in themſelves of the ſame alloy as Scripture is for the inforcing of our acquieſcence: they deale worſe with us then the Pope does with his Vaſſals. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that power in the Church, which Eclipſes, and perturbes civill power cannot be ſuppoſed to be of Chriſts inſtitution: but ſuch is the power of the Clergy in <hi>Scotland</hi> many ways; <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For firſt claſhings may be about what is purely a Civill caſe, and what is purely Eccleſiaſticall, and all ſuch claſhings are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dangerous.</p>
               <p>2 Since there are very few caſes that are not mixt, and as few mixt caſes that are not unequally mixt: great queſtions may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, to whether Tribunall the caſe ſhall be firſt refer'd when it is equally mixt; and how the Tribunalls ſhall agree upon execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their decrees, where the caſe is unequally mixt, eſpecially if the decrees be contrary, as they may be. In the year 1648. the Repreſentative State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Voted a war with <hi>England</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: the Repreſentative <hi>Kirk</hi> Voted the ſame unlawfull; which contrary Votings might have confounded both, for if the war was neceſſary, the State might ſuffer much by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſeditious malediction: and if the war was unlawfull, yet the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108155:17"/>
people having no more warrant to obey the Eccleſiaſticall then Civill power in matters of that nature muſt needs be in a ſtrange diſtraction, and that diſtraction at that time might have created ethquakes in the whole Nation. It ſhould ſeem want of force in the party adhering to the <hi>Kirk</hi> preſerved them at that time from a bloodie ingagement againſt the contrary party, which might have devoured, and ſwallowed up all. For as ſoon as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> was defeated in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Kirk</hi> party got help from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, and by force wreſted the Government out of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nericks</hi> hands: and then again had not <hi>Lannericks</hi> ſide been too weak, another flame might have been kindled, and perhaps have continued unquenched to this day. Now if the temporal ſword be in part ſpirituall, and the caſes of warre be held ſo equally mixt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that both the ſupreme independent Councels claim an equall judgement in them, and do ſometimes judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily: and there can be yet no certain rule given for the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling of thoſe contrarieties: it is manifeſt, that theſe two coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate powers may be deſtructive to the people: and it is as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that no deſtructive inſtitution can derive it ſelf from God. Much more might be ſaid of the encroachments of the Clergie upon the Laity in caſes mixt, by pretending ſometimes to an equality of intereſt in ſome caſes, where the Laities ought to be greater: and pretending to all at other times, where the Laities intereſt ought to be equall: the Popiſh Clergie ſcarce ever uſed more jugling and trumperie in theſe affairs, then the <hi>Presbyterian Miniſtery</hi> now uſes. In the ſtating of the preſent war in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Kirkmen go hand in hand with the <hi>Committee of Eſtates,</hi> and in their Anſwers to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Declarations they interpoſe in all points whatſoever, whether religious, politick, juridicall, or military: and whether they be points of Law, or matters of fact. But if a Miniſter preach ſedition in a Pulpit, this appertains not to the ſecular Magiſtrate; for though ſedition be a ſecular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſedition may be preacht by a Miniſter in a Pulpit, yet a Miniſters Pulpit ſedition is no matter for ſecular cognizance. Was the Laity ever worſe bridled, when it was the Popes Aſſe? But of this no more, I will onely touch briefly upon the end of all this ſpirituall coordination, and ſo ſhut up this point.</p>
               <p>The Clergie of <hi>Scotland</hi> have ſpoken great, and magnificent things of the uſe of their ſpirituall ſword: and the principall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108155:18"/>
allegation for it was, that without ſuch a ſword in the hands of the <hi>Kirk</hi> ſecular Princes, and Grandees could not be awed, and reſtrained in many enterpriſes, and crimes very dangerous to the Church. But who can imagine they ever beleeved themſelves herein? when in the proceſſe of all our late wars, that very <hi>Kirk</hi> it ſelf which told the King He was guilty of a deluge of blood, and had made himſelf, and his throne, and his poſterity obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Gods high indignation thereby, yet never offered to ſtrike with the weapon of excommunication all that while? if there was any correcting, reſtraining, healing, recovering vertue in that weapon, why did they uncharitably forbear to uſe it? why did they not pitie thoſe multitudes of Innocents that periſhed daily under his fury? why did they ſuffer the King himſelf to run on, and die in his perſecutions? And if their pretended wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon had really no ſuch vertue in it, why do they brandiſh it ſo ludicrouſly onely to dazle our weak eyes?</p>
               <p>The next Objection of the <hi>Scots</hi> is, that we have not onely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred a great part of Chriſts ſpirituall power, and detained it in Lay hands, but have alſo abuſed the ſame power; tolerating thereby, and countenancing all manner of hereſies, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to our covenanted Reformation.</p>
               <p>Our Anſwer is, that we are neither intenſively, nor extenſively lyable indeed to this objection. For, 1. all ſects, and ſcandals are not permitted by us: nothing is more diſtant from truth, then this ſuggeſtion. All groſſe ſins, and ſeducers are ſuppreſt with as quick ſeverity as ever: nay ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt there have not been ſo many ſharp Laws made againſt Adultery, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, blaſpheming, Sabbath-breaking, and open prophanation, as have been made within theſe few yeers. All the remiſſion, and relaxation that our Parliament has indulged of late is only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards tender Conſciences, where men comport themſelves civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and inoffenſively towards their neighbours, and attempt to innovate nothing in the Church for perturbing of Religion; and even in this alſo we havenot extended our indulgence ſo far as the united States of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> have, and divers other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes in <hi>Germany.</hi> The truth is, we do not finde ſuch danger in Eraſtianiſme, Independentiſme, Anabaptiſme, Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headiſme, &amp;c. as our rigid <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſuſpect: and this would not diſlike the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> themſelves, if they were men willing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108155:18"/>
to do to others, as they are willing others ſhould do to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they themſelves are ſenſible, that we can never deſire more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe from them to us, then is now ſhewed by us to them. 2ly, That toleration which we are accuſed of, is but a non perſecution in its moſt intenſive degree: for we uſe all Chriſtian means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides force, to reduce ſuch as wander, and divide from us: and we are far from cheriſhing ſchiſmes and broyls either in Church, or State. Our Saviours own parable allows us where weeds have gotten head, and are as numerous as the ſtanding corn, rather to ſpare the weeds for the corns ſake, then to indanger the corn for the weeds ſake. Howſoever, it would be ſome charity in our traducers, if they would adviſedly conſider how the growth of our weeds came at firſt to be ſo rank amongſt us: and thereupon joyn with us in humiliation for it, not exult over us in ſcorn, and deriſion.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt defiance given by the King to the Parliament, half the Clergie at leaſt fell away from this cauſe: and before that rent could be ſowde up, there happened a ſecond diſtance betwixt us, and the <hi>Scots</hi> partly upon a royal, and partly an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall account, and that diſtance drew on as great a revolt of the Clergie as the former. And how can any man imagine, but that ſtrange diſorders muſt needs follow and abound in a Church ſo deſerted? When the dreſſers of the Vineyard do not onely quit their charge, but throw down the mounds, how can it be expected but that Bores and Foxes ſhould break in? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Parliament is ſtill ill beſet, for either they muſt deny preaching to the people, to three parts of foure, or elſe they muſt yeeld the Pulpits to their ſeditious Enemies: and to ſuch as ſhall ſeek to wound the Magiſtrate through the ſouls of the people. This being the Parliaments hard caſe, it may better become the <hi>Scots,</hi> to whom may be attributed a great part of theſe diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, to afford ſome pitie, and help, then to adde miſerie to our miſerie.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient to plead for our indulgence, let us onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> not to take unjuſt offence thereat, or to ſtumble into the contrary extreme. Tis wofull to ſee how rigidly the Miniſters carrie themſelves towards the poore people in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, and what an abſolute diſcretionarie power they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge in many places over the ordinances of God. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108155:19"/>
Pariſhes in <hi>England</hi> where the people have not been admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, nor ſome Infants to the Sacrament of Baptiſme for a long time. This deſerves much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing; for certainly God gave theſe rich Legacies to the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive body of his Church, for the ſpirituall comfort of the meaneſt ſervants of his, and not to that which cals it ſelf his repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body, to be a trade, and monopolie for their advantage in this world. But I have done: if the world now finde cauſe to condemne us of dealing treacherouſly with the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and our fellow-Covenanters, in that we have not ſubmitted to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and for their ſakes diſclaimed our own judgements and intereſts to gratifie the King, and the Presbyterian Clergie, with our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſervility: let us fall under their condemnation. Or if the world can juſtifie the <hi>Scots</hi> as purſuers of that union, freedome, and fidelity which was aimed at in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> when they made themſelves our Lords to give us Laws in our own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and when they did not onely raiſe ſedition here in our own bowels, but came in with an Army of 20000. men to devour us: let them ſtand upright here, and injoy their wiſhed Triumph. Our finall aſſurance, and comfort is, there ſits a Judge in heaven, who can neither deceive, nor be deceived, a Judge that hears all appeals, made above, and does right at laſt to all that groane under oppreſſion, and injuſtice belowe.</p>

               <p>The queſtion is only, when open war commenced betwixt theſe Nations, Whether the <hi>Scots</hi> firſt invaded us by their Duke <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> above two years ſince, or whether the <hi>Engliſh</hi> firſt invaded <hi>Scotland</hi> this laſt ſummer under the command of the Lord Gen. <hi>Cromwell.</hi> For a year or two after reception of the <hi>Covenant</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> a good correſpondence was kept betwixt us: the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners ſat in our Committee of Lords and Commons at <hi>Darby houſe,</hi> whereby they were admitted into the knowledge of our higheſt and ſecreteſt affaires, and had opportunity to frame parties amongſt us for promoting of their own Intereſts. Out of theſe kindneſſes ſprung our firſt unkindneſſes, for the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was given to the <hi>Scots,</hi> the more ſtill they thought was due, and the more they thought was due, the worſe uſe they made of all that was or could be given them. So all jealouſies could not long be ſuppreſt, for in time ſome of our Lords and Commons ſaw cauſe to conceale ſome things concerning this State from them, and this was extreamly ill taken, and indeed no otherwiſe then if it had been a reall piece of injuſtice to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but moderation as yet kept both within reaſonable bounds. Mr. <hi>A. Henderſon</hi> was then living, and converſant in thoſe buſineſſes, and ſurely he was a man of an Apoſtolicall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and though a great lover of his Countrey, yet He knowingly durſt not interpoſe in an ill action, for his Countreys advantage: and I am perſwaded He did very good offices and kept us from further jars during his life: and if He had lived longer, would have prevented much of what has hapned ſince,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides, <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Clergies darling ſeemd plauſible at firſt to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> and ſoon grew indeared to our Synod, and for a good ſpace it got ſuch footing in <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> had no cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction in that behalf. The King alſo the other darling of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, till about the latter end of Summer 1645. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperd ſo that He more ſlighted the <hi>Scots</hi> then He did us, and ſo about him, there was no great cauſe of animoſities: and if any did appear, they were more eaſily to be digeſted; But when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army under the Lord Gen. <hi>Fairfax</hi> had in one Summer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and utterly broken two very great Armies of the Kings,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108155:20"/>
and taken in divers other conſiderable Cities, and ſtrengths without any help at all from the <hi>Scots,</hi> many emulous conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions began to breed ſtrange alienations in the hearts of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. The eaſie warfare of the <hi>Scots</hi> all this while had afforded them, beſides good ſtore of pay and plunder, an abſolute ſigniory over the Northerne Counties (our Northerne men tell us wofull ſtories till this day) and now they ſaw that rich ſervice, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolute dominion was likely to come to an end, they thought ſit to ſtrengthen themſelves in <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and they got <hi>Carlile</hi> alſo by very foul play in ſpight of our Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, as if they were reſolved and certain to have a diſpute with us. Likewiſe in 1646. when <hi>Oxford</hi> grew ſtraitned, and unſafe to the King, and when it was viſible alſo that <hi>Presbytery</hi> after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years experience, did not altogether relliſh with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> preſently reſolved (as was related before) to expound the <hi>Covenant</hi> in favour of the King, at leaſt for ſetling and ſecuring their arrears, and making a commodious retreat out of <hi>England.</hi> Accordingly that Article which provided for the Kings intereſt, ſerved their intereſt wel enough, and war ſo well commented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by them, that it held us at a bay, till their contract was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and then after a long diſpute very chargeable to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the inſtance of an Army, and 200000 <hi>li.</hi> they delivered up <hi>Newcaſtle, Barwick</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> and took time to ſtudy the Kings Article a little longer.</p>
               <p>In the year 1647. there was no notable buſineſſe for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, <hi>England</hi> took a little breath, having nothing to do but to ſquench the few remainders of war, and <hi>Scotland</hi> kept at home to ſhare the late gotten ſpoiles of <hi>England;</hi> yet this year there paſt ſome new cajoleries betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and the King, and ſome conteſts betwixt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and us about the King: and no doubt, the next years action was now in forging, and all preparatory hammers were on working.</p>
               <p>And now enters the memorable year of 1648. a year never to be forgotten by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in regard of the unparralleld dangers that then overſpread it, and the unſpeakable mercies of God that then protected it. All the enemies of this poore <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> were now in a ſolemn conjuration againſt it. In <hi>Ireland</hi> all was held paſt recovery: <hi>Ormond</hi> the Parliaments revolted ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, was complying with the bloody <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and betraying his own

Religion into the bargain to get ſome of their forces into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> great bodies of men roſe up, ſome upon the old Royall account, ſome upon a new, whilſt many alſo of the Navy fell away from the Parliament to make the caſe the more deſperate. No leſſe then 40000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> did their endeavours this Summer to make way for <hi>Hamilton,</hi> from whom (by good intelligence doubtles) they expected 20000 <hi>Scots.</hi> Great was the goodneſs of God that all theſe confederates could not be in a readineſs at one and the ſame time, and that all the Forreign Princes round about us which favoured them, could not be aſſiſtent to them that yeer: God had ſo ordained it, that the <hi>Welſh</hi> ſhould be reduced before the <hi>Scots</hi> entred, or elſe our condition had been altogether hopeleſſe in the eye of reaſon. But to the <hi>Scoch</hi> buſineſſe. The <hi>Solemn League, and Covenant</hi> was now brought under a new debate in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and the main matter in queſtion was, how they could be abſolved of that holy ſtipulation, if they did not imploy all their power to reform Religion, and to reſtore the King in <hi>England:</hi> and for the fuller agitation, and ventilation of this matter, ſeverall grave harangues by perſons affected ſeverally were dreſt, and we may well imagine to what effect.

                           <p>My Lords and Gentlemen: The Covenant preſſes us all to endeavour the reformation of Religion, and the reſtauration of the King in <hi>England</hi> by a brotherly way of Aſſiſtance in our ſeverall places, and callings: and ſo, as that theſe ends of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> may ſtand, and agree with all the reſt. But withall, it behoves us to uſe a great deal of caution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and circumſpection in a matter of ſo high importance, wherein the honour of God, and good of the Nations is ſo religiouſly involved, not to be miſtaken either in the mark we all ſhoot at, or in the arrows we are to ſhoot. As for the point of Religion I am perſwaded, it wants reformation in <hi>England,</hi> and I beleeve I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent not therein from any here: but this ſcruple ſticks by me: I doubt whether I am ſo properly a Judge in <hi>England</hi> of Religion, as I am in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and if I am not; then I fear I ſtep out of my place, and calling, whileſt I take upon me there to reform by force, which ſure the Covenant requires not, but excludes in expreſſe terms. The account of my ſcruples I give thus: firſt, if we are now judges of matters Eccleſiaſticall in <hi>England.</hi> we are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the <hi>Covenant,</hi> for before the <hi>Covenant</hi> we pretended to no

If the <hi>Covenant</hi> give us a power ſo large in <hi>England,</hi> it muſt by the ſame reaſon give the <hi>Eng:</hi> the ſame in <hi>Scotland:</hi> for the bonds are equall, and reciprocall: and ſo here are diſcords raiſed betwixt us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the principall drift of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſuch as never can be pacified: the ſword it ſelf can never give any deciſion in the buſines: victory may take away equallity betwixt. 2. brethren: but meer victory can never take away the true right of equallity. <hi>4ly.</hi> The <hi>Covenant</hi> injoynes us preciſely to aſſiſt one another in reforming, now the word aſſiſtence intimates a concur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rence with the party covenanting againſt ſome joynt oppoſer, it cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to intimate any violence againſt the party covenanting. <hi>5ly,</hi> Not onely the tenor of the whole <hi>Covenant,</hi> but alſo the particular clear purport of the fifth Article in the <hi>Covenant</hi> mainly intends to tye a firmer, cloſer knot of union, and conjunction betwixt the Nations, then ever was before: and therefore to reſcinde a knot ſo manifeſt upon expoſitions, and gloſſes of things not manifeſt ſeems to me to be a wilfull violation of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> As to the other point about the Kings inlargement: much may be reſumed of what I ſaid before againſt our judging in <hi>England:</hi> but I forbear that: the ſcruples that here ſuggeſt themſelves to me are theſe. 1. If the Kings li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty may not be reſtrained, then neither any other of his royall prerogatives, honours, and powers: and yet we our ſelves hold all theſe here under ſequeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and for divers yeares of late, we have entred upon, and adminiſtred the whole royal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              <hi>Fourthly.</hi> If we diſpute not about the Kings impriſonment, but as it is ſuch; that is, as he is impriſon'd by the Souldiery in <hi>England</hi> without conſent of the Parliament there: then do we take upon us to vindicate the conſent of that Parliament, without conſent of that Parliament: And ſince we hear not that there is any change of the Kings reſtraint, ſave onely of the perſons under whom he is reſtrained, nor do the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England</hi> think fit to uſe force, nor to deſire our aſsiſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I doubt if we ſhould obtrude our force therin without any call, we ſhould offend againſt another proviſo in the Covenant, by intrenching upon the Parliaments priviledge there, and by invading the Subjects property like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which the charge of this war muſt neceſſarily draw after it. Theſe things deſerve a ſober deliberation before we reſolve upon the juſtice of this war: but then the juſtice being cleered, yet I conceave we are bound to all mankind, much more Chriſtians and brethren in Covenant, to give what evidence we can of the juſtice of our cauſe, that if poſsible they may be convinced, and do right before bloud be ſhed. And ſince the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> upon reports of our preparations ha's diſpatcht Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners hither to treat about all points in difference, and we ſpecially by Treaty were held to ſend the like to them, and after all to give three months previous warning, before we could have recourſe to the Sword: I hope no man here will offer any thing againſt a Treaty with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſsioners, that ſatisfaction before blood may be either given, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and if not, yet the due ſpace of warning may be obſerved; if we ſhould faile herein, I fear we ſhould proclaim our ſelves to the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive ſimulatory pretenders of the Covenant, only to prophane the high Gods Name to whom we have all lifted up our falſe hands. Next, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in obſervance of their faith to us, ingaged freely for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance in them, have left their Frontire Towns <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle</hi> ungarriſon'd, notwithſtanding the notice they have of our preſent poſture: I hope we ſhall ſcorne to make their plain dealing with us a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen.</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>YOu have heard how much may be ſaid for a preſent war with <hi>England,</hi> and how much may be ſaid againſt it: you have heard in what extreams the arguments both of a meer Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and a meer Scholler run, and now having heard both, and compar'd both, you may the better extract out of both that which is truly counſellable at this preſent, and that doubtleſſe, teaches warily to decline both extreams: The Gentleman that ſpake laſt maintained well the juſtice and neceſſity of the worke that is to be done: ſuch a ſervice to God and the King cannot but be juſt and neceſſary; and our Covenant cannot obſtruct any thing that is of it ſelf juſt and neceſſary; therefore to oppoſe our Covenant againſt this war, is to undervalue our Covenant, and to entangle our ſelves in ſuch nicities as are more fit for the Schools, then this Senate.</p>
                           <p>On the other ſide the Gentleman that ſpoke firſt interpoſed ſome neceſſary advertiſements about the manner of our proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting this high undertaking, not fit to be neglected, for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it concerns Gods honor, the ſafety of the King, and the perpetuall peace and ſafety of theſe Nations, that this affair be wiſely managed, as well as it is religiouſly intended. We all know that the taking of ſome advantages in war, if they be at too far a diſtance with Religion, may prove our diſadvantages: and ſo the parting with ſome opportunities in ſome caſes, may be a gayn of better to us; haſt ha's overthrowne ſome underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, as well as delay others. Wherefore I deſire leave to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe with a little moderation, that which hath been preſſed by both the Gentlemen that ſpoke before me.</p>
                           <p>And Firſt tis my humble motion, that the Kirk here may have all poſſible ſatisfaction given them in the forming, and heading of this Army, and in the conduct, and ſteering of the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; foraſmuch as without this condiſcention we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their concurrence, and without their concurrence, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect that readineſſe, or confidence in our Friends at home, nor that ſtupidity &amp; conſternation in our enemies abroad, as is to be deſired.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That if wee admit not the Engliſh Commiſſioners to treate, and then allow three moneths warning after the end of that Treaty: yet we may inſtantly diſpatch away an Expreſſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108155:23"/>
to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> with particular demands, and a cleere denunciation of warre within a moneth, if thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars be not inſtantly agreed to.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, That ſome reaſonable ſpace before wee march a Declaration may be emitted to ſatisfie our Friends in <hi>England</hi> with our ſincere intentions towards them: and that the buiſines of the Kirke being ſetled, and the King reinthroned, wee have no intention to intrench upon the priviledges of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, or to breake that bond of confederation and union that was intended to be confirmed by the Covenant.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, That <hi>Langdale</hi> may be countenanced at a diſtance, and with much reſervation, and that no other uſe may be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made of Him, then of a Forlorne Hope to ſeize the Engliſh frontire Garriſons for our uſe, and to ingage upon other the like hazardous ſervices. How well theſe things are calculated for the Meridian of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> I leave every man to gueſſe freely: but this is certain, there were few in the Scotch Parliament, who gave their judgements the firſt way: many went the ſecond way: and all went the third way, except onely in complying with the Kirke: and if there be any credit to be given to <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who affirm'd it religiouſly at the time of his arraignment in <hi>England,</hi> the Kirkes party refuſed to comply with Him, and his party, more out of emulations, and particular State-animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then out of any diſlike of the cauſe, or condemnation of the undertaking. And time ha's ſince made this more manifeſt, for even the Commiſſioners of the Kirke in their Declarations ſince, and by their ingaging againſt us with their yong declared King, have even by the Covenant, and the ſame conſtructions of it, owned every part of the quarrell againſt us, which they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Hamilton,</hi> ſetting only aſide his entring upon us without three moneths previous warning, well: The Scotch Parliament having ſufficiently Commiſſion'd <hi>Hamilton</hi> for his March into <hi>England,</hi> roſe without any audience, or intercourſe granted to our Commiſſioners.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Hamilton</hi> being ſo Commiſſion'd, makes preſent uſe of <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and his Train, ſpeeds away with 20000. men for <hi>England,</hi> ſeizes <hi>Barwick</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> commits infinite barbarous cruelties, and deſtructions in the foure Northerne Counties, before previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous warning given according to our Treaties, but within ſome

                           </p>
                           <p>Out of this matter of fact ſo ſtated, a diſpute now ariſes, whether this hoſtile action of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> that was then chargeable upon the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> be ſtill juſtly to be anſwerd and accounted for to the State of <hi>England,</hi> by the preſent State of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> deny it upon theſe grounds. For their firſt evaſion, they ſay, the good party that now governs is not the ſame, as the party was, that then governed. Whereby they would have us underſtand, that the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> is changed ſince, 1648. and does not remaine the ſame as it was at that time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be reſponſal for what was then done.</p>
                           <p>After the Committee of Eſtates, and the Kirk-Commiſſioners have condemned <hi>Hamiltons</hi> invaſion without antecedent warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his other miſcarriages in taking <hi>Barwick</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> &amp;c. and confeſt that nothing can be offerd in excuſe thereof: they yet adde, that never any people in the world in a time of defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did more evidence their freedome from guilt; then They (they meane the party now governing) did. Here is a defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on confeſt in a Parliament lawfully choſen, and in the major part of the people adhaering to that Parliament: but there was a remnant of good people which at that time evidenced their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from that guilt, and that remnant ſince by force, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Engliſh Army, ha's gotten power into their hands, and therefore the Magiſtrate that is now, is not guilty of that defection, nor conſequently the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> liable to make any reparation. This evaſion muſt be thus ſtopt up.</p>
                           <p>1. In all States where there is a Repreſentative, the publick act of that Repreſentative, or of its major part, bindes all, and every perſon. And though the next Repreſentative may repeale Laws formerly made, and recede at pleaſure from what its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap> ſemper jure Tertij:</hi> they muſt be without any prejudice to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>orrein States, and perſons there not repreſented. Nay, if the State of <hi>England</hi> paſſe an Intereſt in Land to a Subject of <hi>England</hi>
                              <pb n="45" facs="tcp:108155:24"/>
upon a good conſideration and contract, that act ſhal be binding perpetually, and may not under favour be avoyded by a New Repreſentative, becauſe that avoydance will appeare fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the State: and becauſe ſuch avoydance is to the damage of one that is as it were a third perſon, and contracts with the State upon equall terms; and it ſeemes, that a ſpeciall conſent is neceſſary in ſuch a caſe of his diſinheriſon, and that his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſent given by his Repreſentatiues ought not to diveſt him. And if it be here objected, that the conſtitution of the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> is different from other States, inaſmuch, as it conſiſts of two Repreſentatives, one civil and the other eccleſiaſticall; and in this ingagement of <hi>Hamilton</hi> the eccleſiaſticall Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative did not act, nor concurre, but diſſent, and proteſt againſt it, and ſo made the civil act the leſſe authoritative. We anſwer; Firſt, the eccleſiaſticall Repreſentative of <hi>Scotland</hi> ha's no power but in caſes meerly eccleſiaſticall, ſuch as this was in 1648. was not. Secondly, if the <hi>Scots</hi> will tell us, that <hi>Hamiltons</hi> action, and caſe was <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia:</hi> wee muſt not ſuffer ſuch col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to be turnd to our prejudice. The State of <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt not thinke it ſufficient to ſtroke us in their ſpirituall capacity, whilſt they ſtrike us in their temporal capacity: the duplicity of their Powers muſt not juſtifie, or excuſe duplicity in their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: when wee ſuſtaine publick injuries, whether it be from a juriſdiction Parliamentary, or Synodical, the whole State of <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt be anſwerable for ſatisfaction. Thirdly, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of <hi>Hamilton</hi> was the leſſe valid in Law (if we did grant this, as we doe not) becauſe all that feared the Lord in the Land did petition, and pray againſt it, and expoſe themſelves to ſome perſecution for not complying with it, yet this does not render the ſame ingagement the leſſe miſchievous to us. There was not one drop of Engliſh bloud the leſſe ſhed then, nor is there one drop the leſſe to be accounted for now. Fourthly, wee are not without ſome ſtrong preſumptions, that the ſmall number of the religious party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which were enemies to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement then, were not ſo much enemies to it as it was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to us, or unjuſt in it ſelfe, as becauſe it promoted <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons</hi> 
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>action too high, and had an ill aſpect upon their owne particular intereſt in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Elſe, what makes them ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous againſt our receiving of right now, which pretend they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108155:25"/>
were ſo zealous againſt our receiving of wrong then? It ſeemes ſtrange to us, that the Engliſh which had never a Friend in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> two yeares ſince to warde one blow from their throats, or to do any real act of reſiſtance to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> ſhould now finde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an Enemy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> obnoxious to their challenge of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: and that the ſame men ſhould be the moſt forward to debarre us of reparation now, which were then moſt forward to proteſt againſt our ſuffrings. Secondly, where two Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have been legally choſen, if it be not honorable for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to anull the formers act in prejudice of a third perſon that ha's right: much leſſe honorable is it for a Repreſentative brought in by the ſword to derogate from the acts of a former Repreſentative, that had a faire, and free election from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Wherefore, let the preſent power in <hi>Scotland</hi> apply this to themſelves: and the rather for that they complain of forcible alterations amongſt us, onely upon pretended diſcommodities to our ſelves, whilſt they themſelves make uſe of forcible alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations amongſt themſelves, to the defrauding of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Thirdly, Admit the Parliament, by which <hi>Hamilton</hi> was Commiſſion'd, was an unjuſt Parliament; admit it was no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at all; and admit that <hi>Hamilton</hi> with a leſſe party, and without any Commiſſion at all had broke in upon us in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile manner: yet even this would not leave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remediles; for in this caſe upon a juſt demand of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> muſt diſowne the act, and ſee the outrage legally expiated upon the actors; or elſe they owne it themſelves, and ſo become as obnoxious as the actors. That which was the ſin of one Towne in <hi>Benjamin</hi> at firſt, became the ſin of the whole Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> afterwards; and doubtleſſe, that which was the ſin of one Tribe in <hi>Iſrael</hi> at firſt, had become the ſin of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> at laſt, if juſtice had not been lawfully execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Let the <hi>Scots</hi> look upon this with ſad eyes, for that blood of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhed by <hi>Hamilton,</hi> which is now the guilt of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only in <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the deniall of juſt ice, may be made the guilt of all <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ſecond evaſion of the <hi>Scots</hi> is this; They ſay, if they were perſons challengeable of ſatisfaction, yet they that ſit now in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> are not perſons, that can duly challenge, or require ſatisfaction: It ſhould ſeeme as <hi>Scotland</hi> before was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108155:25"/>
not to be found in <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſo <hi>England</hi> is now not to be found in <hi>England:</hi> ſo hard a matter it is to get right from them that can thus eaſily transforme, and deforme whole Nationall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The meaning is, Government in <hi>England</hi> has been of late changed; two of the Eſtates in Parliament are removed by force, and the third Eſtate uſurpes, what was due to all: wherefore as they cannot treate with us about ſatisfaction, but they muſt acknowledge us a lawfull authority; ſo conſcience forbids them to acknowledge our authority lawfull.</p>
                           <p>To this wee anſwer. 1. The change of rule in a Nation, does not change the Nation; foraſmuch as the manner of rule is changeable, and accidentall, and ſo does not give beeing, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the eſſence of a State. If wee in <hi>England</hi> beeing a Monarchy owe three Millions to the <hi>Hollander,</hi> the change of Monarchy in <hi>England</hi> will not exempt us from, our obligation: and if we in <hi>England,</hi> beeing a Democracy, have three Millions due from the <hi>Hollander,</hi> our returne to Monarchy will not denude us of our remedie. The devaſtations and hoſtilities of <hi>Hamilton</hi> were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred by the Engliſh Nation, and the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands juſtice, and reſtitution for the ſame in behalfe of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Nation: now 'tis not agreeable to juſtice, or reaſon, that a ſlight exception taken againſt the ſubſtitute, ſhould diſable the Principal, or any incapacity of the demandant redound to the prejudice of him which is the true Intereſſent.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, If the uſurpation of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſhall bar the State of <hi>England</hi> from its due courſe of juſtice, yet how does it appeare to the <hi>Scots,</hi> that the power of our Parliament is an uſurp't power? If God or Man ha's given them any warrant to judge of our actions, and affaires in <hi>England,</hi> let them ſhew it: for without ſome ſuch warrant they are but our Equalls: and one equall ha's no power of judging another. If they plead any undeniable principle in nature which condemnes all alteration of Government as unlawfull: and all extruſion of Governours as uſurpation, and of this Maxime, they ſay, all men are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Judges; then how will they juſtiſie their extruſion of <hi>Lanne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and their new moulding of their Committee of Eſtates af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the defeature of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> which without armes, and our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance they could not have compaſt? Is that a naturall, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible principle in <hi>England,</hi> which is not ſo in <hi>Scotland?</hi> Away
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108155:26"/>
with ſuch partiall ſhifts; let the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhew us that Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven that ha's not ſeverall times been driven to mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Governments, and Governours, and been at laſt juſtified therein by the plea of neceſſity, and common ſafety: and wee ſhall confeſſe their Lordly power over us.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, If the <hi>Scots</hi> be our Lords, and will give judgement againſt us in this caſe, yet they muſt know, that wee are now upon our appeal before almighty God, and have accordingly taken Armes into our hands for the proſecution of that appeal. And does not one of the primary Lawes of Warre teach them what a hazard it is to deny right to him that beares his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>aked ſword in his hand? <hi>Arma Tenenti—Omnia dat qui juſta negat.</hi> Will the <hi>Scots</hi> lay an incapacity of Treating upon us firſt, and then of fighting afterwards. The difference now betwixt us is, whether wee have juſtly enterd <hi>Scotland,</hi> or no, to ſeeke redreſſe of many injuries, and depredations by tryall of battaile, which was denide us by debate in a friendly intercourſe: and doe the <hi>Scots</hi> thinke now to argue us out of our armes? doe they think, that the ſame condemnations of our uſurp't power, by which they inſulted over us, when wee ſought a Treaty, will be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable now, when the cauſe is preferd to a higher Court? This were to cut us off from all remedie whatſoever; this were to detrude us below the miſerableſt of men; this is beyond all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtrains of Tyranny: There is no Client, nor Subject, nor ſlave whatſoever, but by way of his laſt appeale, may repell force with force, when his caſe is beyond all other deciſion: and this is held no more then a making an humble addreſſe to Heaven, or laying the cauſe before the Lord of Hoſts his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole: Will the <hi>Scots</hi> then which have droven us their equalls to this, laſt reſort, prejudge and foreclude us in this alſo, and ſo make us worſe them the worſt of inferiors? Certainly, if we may not treate before wee confeſſe our ſelves uſurpers, wee may fight till God declares us to bee ſo; or that our enemies have uſup't over us.</p>
                           <p>The third advantage or exception of the <hi>Scots</hi> againſt our demands of ſatisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is taken from the ſpace of time that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlapſed betwixt the overthrow of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and our ſolemne denouncing againſt them for that hoſtilitie: as alſo from ſome reciprocall kindneſſes, and teſtimonies of accord and pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108155:26"/>
which paſt betwixt the Nations in the mean while. Of both theſe I ſhall now give this faithfull account. The victory of of L: G: <hi>Cromwell</hi> againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> was about the latter end of Summer, 1648: and our Forces following that chaſe ſtayed in <hi>Scotland</hi> till about Mid-winter following. During the ſtay of our Army in <hi>Scotland</hi> a good underſtanding was betwixt us, and the <hi>Kirk</hi> party there, for we had both the ſame ends againſt the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltonians,</hi> and ſo whileſt we extorted the ſword out of <hi>Lannericks</hi> hands, and put it into <hi>Arguiles,</hi> we did our own buſineſſe and the <hi>Kirks</hi> too, and the <hi>Kirks</hi> more immediately then our own. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit a Treaty was now begun in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> with the King, where the <hi>Scoch</hi> Commiſſioners appeared great ſticklers for the King to our Nations great diſ-ſervice, and this gave us ſome glimpſe, that even in the <hi>Kirk</hi> party, reſtored ſo lately to power by our means, all was not ſo ſound, and ſincere, as it ought to be. The Treaty not ſucceeding about the laſt of <hi>Januar:</hi> the King was brought to the block: and then the inſolencies of the <hi>Scoch</hi> Commiſſioners, and their haughty intruſions into the managery of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> State affairs, and their deſpicable ſubjecting of our Parliament to their over-ruling wils, grew ſo intolerable, that upon the 17. of <hi>Febr:</hi> the Parliament declared publickly againſt them. This begat another Paper from the Commiſſioners dated the 24. following more imperious, and controuling then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and this was preſently after voted a deſigne in the contrivers of it to raiſe ſedition, that ſo under ſpecious pretences they might gain advantage to ſecond their late perfidious invaſion. The 6. of <hi>March</hi> following, the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> wrote a Letter to us (as they now inform us) to avow their Commiſſioners laſt Paper, and withall diſallowing our conſtruction of it, for that they judged it no incroachment upon our Government, nor any indeavour to raiſe ſedition. They likewiſe ſignified in the ſame, that if any prevalent party in either Kingdom had, or might break the bonds of Union, yet thoſe ſacred tyes ought not to be layed aſide or cancell'd, but preſerved for the benefit of ſuch as were innocent in both Nations. The <hi>Scoch</hi> Commiſſioners to whom this Letter was ſent for delivery of it were now upon their return for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo the ſame never came to our hands, though the <hi>Scots</hi> untruly tax us of ſuppreſſing it. But why ſhould they ſuſpect any deſigne in us of ſuppreſſing this Letter? The
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108155:27"/>
Letter, if we had received it, would not have healed our grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, it would rather have made the wounds wider: for the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners had charged us of Treaſon, perjury, uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. for doing thoſe things within our own government, which were required at our hands by juſtice, and Reaſon of State: now their principals in <hi>Scotland</hi> tell us that this charge is true: but being true: it moleſts not, it ſhakes not, it juſtles not us out of any part of our power, nor ſtirs the people at all againſt us.

Sometimes they pretend they aime at nothing beyond a ſimple proteſting againſt us, and that a freedome of Proteſting is due to all men: but this is meerly to delude, and infect the people the more: for tis evident to all men, that ſuch Proteſtations as their Papers have exhibited, have ever been fraighted with the worſt of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, the ſevereſt of ſentences, and have been received by the people, as warlike defiances.</p>
                           <p>In this caſe therefore when ſo many inſurrections, and broils have been actually bred againſt us in our own bowels, and ſo dangerouſly ſeconded by forrein Forces, we call in all men to be Judges betwixt us, whether we may not more juſtly caſt out <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations</hi> when they do but palliate ſeditious conſpiracies, then to ſubmit to ſeditious conſpiracies, becauſe they cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the names of <hi>Proteſtations.</hi> This Letter miſcarrying, and our Parliament having waited awhile for ſome other return by ſome Expreſſe, or other, in <hi>May</hi> following, about nine months after the <hi>Scoch</hi> Rout, a complanatory Letter was ſent from hence about divers grievances in generall, and ſatisfaction was therein deſired by Treaty in a peaceable way. An Anſwer hereunto came in <hi>June</hi> following, recomplaining that the <hi>Scots</hi> juſtly found themſelves aggrieved at the late proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Religion, taking away the Kings life, and change of fundamentall Government, which they had proteſted againſt. That in caſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would diſclaim their late proceedings againſt <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Treaties,</hi> they were contented to authoriſe Commiſſioners for a Treaty.

the one hand, and the Enemies of Kingly Government, on the other. That in regard of the Covenant, the Treaties, and many Declarations of both Kingdoms, they could not acknowledge that to be a Parliament, from whom the laſt Propoſition came to them about a Treatie to be appointed. Here was a flat deniall of any ſatisfaction, by declining all means of treating about the ſame: Here was a reaſon given of that deniall, as full of enmity and hoſtility as could be: inſtead of making any compenſation due to the State of <hi>England</hi> for the bloodſhed, and rapine of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> here was a ſtrange coacervation and accumulation of new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Declaration was made as publick, as ever any was in <hi>England,</hi> and we have thouſands here of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation diſaffected enough to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ten thouſands of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Presbyterians beſides more imbittered then the <hi>Scoch,</hi> and all theſe can atteſtate the evulgation of this Declaration, yet the <hi>Scots</hi> call it a Dormant Declaration, and moſt diſ-ingenuouſly would infuſe it into the people that they had never, nor could have any notice of it. A Letter of theirs to us in the hands of a ſingle Meſſenger could not be intercepted: but a Manifeſt of ours Printed, and intitled to the whole world muſt needs miſcarry, and that by our colluſion. Some reply was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by us to the matter of this Declaration, and ſome months paſt away hanging our expectation: but none came: the firſt news we heard was that about the middle of <hi>March</hi> following there was a Treaty agreed on to be at <hi>Bredah</hi> betwixt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and their yong declared King: and that the principall Subject of that Treaty, was about the pretenſions of the yong King to <hi>England,</hi> and the quarrels of the <hi>Scots</hi> againſt <hi>England.</hi> This to us, that had ſo little hopes of reconcilement before, was a ſufficient alarme, and upon this our L: Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> was ſent for out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> all warlick preparations were made ready, and our Army

But the <hi>Scots</hi> alledge ſtill, that immediately after the breaking of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the diſ-arming of his brother in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there were given divers clear demonſtrations of amity, and good accord betwixt the Nations: Letters will yet teſtifie, that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly party in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſatisfied the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their innocency, and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did accept of the ſame, as good ſatisfaction. For example: in <hi>Septemb:</hi> and <hi>Octob:</hi> the L: Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> wrote in behalf of the Kirk patty, by Him then ſeated at the ſtern, and his letters did recommend them to the Parliament as men care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the unity of the Nations, and the intereſt of <hi>England.</hi> On the other ſide the <hi>Scots</hi> remitted hither an honourable Teſtimony of the fair comportment of our Souldiery there, together with a thankfull acknowledgment of the benefit, and advantage which our ſeaſonable aſſiſtance had afforded them. Likewiſe from the Parliament here it was written back, that the religious, and well affected people in <hi>Scotland</hi> were excuſed from thoſe impious, and unwarrantable actions, and that there was no willingnes in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to impute thoſe evils to the Nation in generall. As for the L: Generals Letters, queſtionleſſe they contained his true, plain, meaning: He did believe at that time, that the intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> and the unity of the Nations was valued by the <hi>Kirk,</hi> and the <hi>Arguilians</hi> in <hi>Scotland:</hi> but what diſcharge was this to the reſt of the Nation? nay what diſcharge is this to any of that Nation? His Commiſſion extended not to compound for the dammages ſuſtained by us: nor did He ever treat about the ſame: nor did He at laſt finde his loving recommendations juſtly anſwered by that Godly parties actions.</p>
                           <p>Out of this therefore there follows nothing but that our L: Generall was more charitable, then the <hi>Scots</hi> were gratefull. As for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Letters, they ſerve well to ſhew the ſingle dealing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108155:28"/>
of our L: Generall towards them, and their double dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Him: but they ſerve not at all to ſhew any act of oblivion, or any other pacificatory concluſion that was conſented to by both Nations. Therefore the good that they then bore witneſſe to in our Souldiery, we hold it to be juſt, and according to merit: but when they publiſh retracting contradicting Papers after the intermiſſion of two years, and therein complain (as they did this laſt Summer) tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> the <hi>L:</hi> Generall came in un-invited, that the manner of his entrance was not guided by their Inſtructions, and that the proceedings of his Army were very unſatisfying in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things: this is an argument of their profound diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. As for the Parliaments Letters: although the Parliament at that time was too full of Kirkmen, yet if they had any full words of releaſe in them, we ſhould no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> prolong our conteſtation hereupon: but the utmoſt that can be extracted out of them, is a charitable exemption of ſome that had the teſtimony of wiſhing well to the unity of the Nations, and intereſt of <hi>England</hi> from the pen of the L: Generall. The Parliament was unwilling, that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation in generall ſhould be charged with the guilt, and blood of the <hi>Hamiltonians,</hi> and therefore it did acquit, and hold exonerated thereof all the religious, and well-affected people of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Without queſtion the religious, and well-affected peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here excuſed, are underſtood to be no other then ſuch as had been adverſe to <hi>Hamiltons</hi> expoſition of the <hi>Covenant</hi> upon ſincere grounds, and not for any factious, or particular reſpects. But how few ſuch there were in <hi>Scotland</hi> at that time is now manifeſt, by the general adhering of that Nation to their new King againſt us. For there is not one man in <hi>Scotland</hi> that aſſiſts this young King againſt us now, but He expounds the <hi>Covenant</hi> in the ſame manner as <hi>Hamilton</hi> did then: and He might have as ſafely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with <hi>Hamilton</hi> in that Ingagement, as He may with the yong King in this: as will be further demonſtrated in due place. Theſe are the main ſubterfuges which the <hi>Scots</hi> flie unto, when we tax them of that cruell, barbarous Ingagement againſt us in 1648. The reſt of their pleas whereby they ſeek not to ſhelter themſelves from the whole guilt, but onely to extenuate it, or rather to qualifie our demanded ſatisfaction are ſcarce worth the mention.</p>

                           <p>They ſay moreover, that ſome ſatisfaction has been made us by the booty, and pillage which <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Army loſt in <hi>England.</hi> Some few <hi>Scoch</hi> Arms, and Horſes, which falling amongſt the Souldiers as due prize were like water ſpilt upon the ground, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received in ſatisfaction by the State of <hi>England,</hi> nor ſo given by the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> muſt come in upon the Account of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſatisfie them for all the plunders, murders, and waſts which a <hi>Scoch</hi> Army perpetrated contrary to Treaties, and ſworn Covenants.

All that the <hi>Scots</hi> deſired of the King as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuitors was but this, that He would take the <hi>Covenant</hi> (if that were but ſwallowed down in its literall ſence, they thought all their further aims ſufficiently provided for) and this could
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108155:29"/>
not be much more bitter to Him, then the <hi>Maſſe</hi> was formerly to his <hi>French</hi> Grand-father in the like caſe: and if it were, yet divers dulcifications might be added, and accordingly divers mixtures were uſed, to qualifie, and make more potable that draught. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements had been ſent from the yong Kings devout Mother in <hi>France,</hi> and from her moſt Holy Father at <hi>Rome,</hi> that in ſuch an extremity the Oath was compulſory, that the matter of the Oath was ſubject to many ſeverall, yea contrary interpretations: that He ſhould therefore be either left to be his own Interpreter at laſt in caſe He prevailed, or if not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet He ſhould be diſcharged of any contrary ſtrained interpretation. The truth was, the preſent Power in <hi>Scotland</hi> had condemned <hi>Hamilton</hi> for invading <hi>England</hi> in behalf of an Anti-covenanting King, and ſo it would be now too groſſe for them to do the ſame thing till they had a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting King: whereupon it became impoſſible to them to relax the King of this condition. The young King, it may be, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand why they ſhould more ſcruple fighting for an Anti-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting King, then to fight againſt a Covenanting brother, ſince the <hi>Covenant</hi> loſt no more credit by the one, then by the other: and perhaps He might further demand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why their conditions to Him were ſo rigorous; ſince his to them preſſed nothing but what was pleaſing, <hi>viz:</hi> a joint concurrence againſt a Common enemy. But his Mothers Councellors thought not fit to clog the debate with ſuch intricacies. All <hi>Scoch</hi> punctilioes being at laſt waved (for the young King was ſo far from capitulating about his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that He was more forward to capitulate againſt his truſting himſelf there) it came to the queſtion, what He ſhould obtain at their hands in relation to <hi>England.</hi> For ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction herein, it was aſſured, that the <hi>Scots</hi> had already proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> that they had alreadie Proteſted againſt the governing party in <hi>England,</hi> as guilty of Uſurpation: that they did now ingage to contribute their utmoſt endeavours, by all neceſſarie, and lawfull means, according to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and duties of loyall Subjects, to reſtore him to the peaceable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his other Dominions, according to his undoubled right of ſucceſſion. This was the tenor in briefe of that Parlee: here is an inthroning promiſt to the yong King by all neceſſary and lawfull meanes according to the Covenant: and here force of armes is not openly profeſt, as a neceſſary, and lawfull meanes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

of a warre with <hi>England,</hi> or had there been any certain time prefixt when that determination ſhould have been given: or had wee been aſſured of any juſt time to prepare our ſelves afterwards for a compleat defence, wee had not been ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in ſeeking out the hardſhips of that cold, and ſterill ſoyle, but as our caſe was, wee were great ſufferers, wee were ſufferers by perfidious Enemies, wee were deluſorily referd <hi>fine die,</hi> to Judges that were bound to no meetings, for the reſolution of a caſe that was before reſolved againſt us: and in the meane time whilſt wee were brutiſhly thus to waite upon ſuch Judges, all our conjured foes were contriving our ruine, and were certain to prepoſſeſſe irrecoverable advantages againſt us.</p>
                           <p>But now wee ſhall ſee in the next place, the ſame <hi>Scots</hi> that before the Judgement-ſeat of God charged us hitherto for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon them when wee were in no danger, nor under any provocation, ſeeing all their tranſactions at <hi>Bredah</hi> more fully come to light, betake themſelves from denying to confeſſing and avoyding. Such is their faultring, ſuch is their doubling: if their deniall could be maintained, they needed not deſcend to any confeſſion: and if their confeſſion were avowable, they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to fly to denyalls: but the truth is, they can neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deny, nor abſolutely juſtifie their hoſtile machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and combinations againſt us, and therefore they ſhufle, and trifle, and play faſt, and loſe betwixt both.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, when the <hi>Scots</hi> ſaw the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not yeeld themſelves to be deluded, or diſappointed, or forecluded of any advantages in war by the falſe pretexts of peace, they ſtated the caſe of their war in a Declaration, which they forced the young King to publiſh in his Name at <hi>Dunferlin,</hi> and according to the caſe there ſtated, they reſolved to joyn upon the iſſue of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, and in the Field to expect Gods own deciſion from Heaven. The Battail was fought, and the deciſion of Heaven diſſavoured the <hi>Scots:</hi> but the ſucceſſe of a pitcht Feild is not now held an Argument weighty enough to ſink a cauſe ſo ſtated. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more narrowly look into the particulars of that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and examine upon what ſure rules of equity and piety the cauſe of the <hi>Scots,</hi> as it is there drawn up, ſtands founded. At firſt the march of our Army was held meerly invaſive, &amp; cauſleſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> offenſive: the <hi>Scots</hi> denyed any hoſtile intentions againſt us at all:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108155:31"/>
now tis granted there was an intention of force, but it was no other then what was juſtifiable by the Covenant, inaſmuch as it threatned none but ſuch as were Enemies to the Covenant. This ſeems to mean, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> with all their Armies and Adherents, had had juſt cauſe to prevent an invaſion from the <hi>Scots,</hi> if they had been true to the Covenant, that is, if they had interpreted the Covenant in the <hi>Scotch</hi> ſenſe: but ſince they are judged to have dealt treacherouſly with the Covenant, they are not worthy of any defence, they ought not to claim ſo much priviledg, as to prevent any danger, or enmity; For if the <hi>Scotch</hi> deſign had been meerly to plunder and inſlave us, then we might have ſtood upon our guards, or uſed means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention lawfully: but ſince the deſigne was meerly to reforme us, and reclaime us to our loyalty, and to reconcile us to our Covenant: 'twas arrogance in us to thinke any reſiſtance at all reaſonable: Is not this a candid honeſt meaning? does not this high pitch of prejudice become a faire noble enemy? but to the effect, and purport of our <hi>Scotch</hi> Declaration: by that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are ſatisfied in two things.</p>

Surely twill be an uncooth innovation in <hi>England</hi> to ſee Kirkmen ſit in an Aſſembly, and publiſh Declarations concerning peace, and warrs, as they do now in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and whether ſuch an innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be conducing to a good accord, and underſtanding in the State, or no, we leave to conjecture. 3ly, As we muſt ſubject our ſelves to theſe grand innovations, ſo they muſt alſo be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by us with the price of ſome of our beſt blood: ſome few of our principall Patriots heads muſt be payed down in hand for them. It ſhould ſeem, their Idol the <hi>Covenant</hi> requires ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to make an attonement for the indignities, and prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it has lately ſuffered in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo foure or five mens lives are demanded, as a juſt oblation. But the <hi>Scots</hi> might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that we are not yet ſo tame, and that the demand of ſuch an oblation from us, is all one, as the demand of many Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombes: and therefore perhaps tis not parſimony of blood that makes them ſo parſimonious in their demands of blood. 4ly, As our pretiouſeſt Friends muſt lye under this diſcretionary danger, ſo the moſt fatall of our Enemies muſt be ſecured from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of our Laws: for in the cloſe of all, an Act of Oblivion is to overwhelme all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all men whatſoever, Royalliſts, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, Independents, Papiſts, Proteſtants are to be put into an equall condition. What is this leſſe then to ſpoil us of all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and exempt our Enemies from all diſadvantages that the event of theſe late wars have caſt upon us both? eſpecially when the Act is to paſſe as a Grace from our Maſters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not of reconcilement from us?</p>
                           <p>By this ſtate of the cauſe ſo formed, and owned by the <hi>Scots</hi> themſelves, 'tis now apparent, that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had yielded ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedly to all the conditions, and Laws that are here impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they had left nothing remaining to themſelves: the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation had been given up to vaſſalage under a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power. Thoſe very Royaliſts, and Presbyterians which

               <p>THere was lately Printed a ſheet of <hi>Conſiderations</hi> againſt our common <hi>Ingagement</hi> of Allegiance, to this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: the Author ſeems to be a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> of the <hi>Scoch</hi> Faction, by ſome thought able and learned: his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are very brief, and I will anſwer him, as briefly as may be: The Arguments by which our <hi>Ingagement</hi> is impugned, and as it were on every hand beleaguerd are eleven, as I take it.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Ingagement,</hi> to ſome that have already taken ſix or ſeven Oaths, may poſſibly ſeem contrary to ſome of thoſe former Obligations: and ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagers muſt now ſuffer, or ſin againſt their doubting conſciences.</p>

                  <p>1. No State can enact, or ordain any thing, but the ſame may be lyable to ſome mens doubts; (In Chriſtian Religion it ſelf all mens ſcruples are not prevented) thoſe Acts, and Orders therfore which are not lyable to juſt doubts, are ſufficient, and ought to binde. Now the <hi>Ingagement,</hi> which in truth is not repugnant to any of our former Oaths, or Obligations, is lyable to no juſt doubts. For our former Oaths, and Ingagements, if we rightly underſtand them, did not ſo intentionally oblige us to the form of Government, as to Government it ſelf; nor to this or that changable medium of governing, as to the fixt, perpetuall end of government. Forms, and Means are ſometimes very expedient, and ſo long they are neceſſarily to be obſerved: but the queſtion is how far they ought to be obſerved, when they claſh, and by ſome emergent alteration in the State are put out of Tune, and ſo jar, as it were, with ſubſtances, and Ends: and all wiſe men
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108155:35"/>
know: <hi>Subordinata non pugnant:</hi> the matter of leſſe moment gives way to the greater. The Law of the Sabbath was ſtrict in all its rites, and requir'd an exact obedience in all its duties which were ſuitable to its end: but when mans being which was the end of the Sabbath came in queſtion, all its ſubordinate offices, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities ſubmitted. The <hi>Jews</hi> thought man muſt rather periſh, then the Sabbath be broken by any labour to ſave him: and if man had been created for the celebration of that day, they had judged rightly: but ſince that days reſt was ordained for man, our Saviour gives a contrary judgement. The ſame reaſon reaches our caſe. Our allegiance has been formerly ingaged to the State of <hi>England</hi> governed in ſuch a form: that form is now changed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now our allegiance to the State cannot be continued in the old form, without danger to the ſubſtance, without ruine to the end, for which allegiance was ſo ingaged. In this caſe, if we grant, that the form of government is but a mean, and that it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the convenience of government, not government for the forms: we have nothing to do, but to conclude with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that neceſſity makes the change lawfull, and the violation of the form no violation: foraſmuch as there is no repugnance in ſubordinate things. <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was yeſterday under the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> tis to day under the <hi>French:</hi> the loyalty which the <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> payed yeſterday to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is now due to the <hi>French:</hi> That <hi>Dunkirker</hi> which now keeps his loyaltie to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> breaks it, and may juſtly ſuffer for Treaſon: but that <hi>Dunkirker</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from his former loyalty, keeps it, and the truth of his loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty will be juſtified by the end of all Loyalty.</p>

                  <p>3. The <hi>Ingagement</hi> is moſt injuriouſly accuſed of any obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; no art of man could pen any thing more clearly, or ſuccinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: nay I am verily perſwaded, that the ſame men that cavil at the <hi>Ingagement</hi> for ambiguity: can ſcarce produce one Law or rule in all the book of God, which might not be made as ſubject to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villations as this bond of allegiance. By our ſubſcriptions, we onely binde our ſelves to be true, and faithfull to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England,</hi> as its now governed without King, or Lords. To ask, what the Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> is, is ridiculous; tis the ſame now under this form of Regiment, as it was before under Monarchy. To ask, how it can be governed without King or Lords, is more ridiculous, our ſenſes diſcover to us, that we have a government; that we have a government without King or Lords: and if we pleaſe we may further inform our ſelves, that there have been other ſuch governments in all ages, amongſt all Nations. To ask how we may be true, and faithfull to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is moſt ridiculous of all: for Truth, and fidelity in <hi>England,</hi> is the ſame as Gods Law commands every where. No Law of Gods is more perſpicuous, then that which enjoyns obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſubjection to Powers and Magiſtrates; and yet the ſame Law of God which injoyns obedience, and ſubjection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends true obedience, and faithfull ſubjection: they cannot be divided: falſe obedience is no obedience, unfaithfull ſubjection is no ſubjection. Therefore let our <hi>Conſiderator</hi> cavil at God, and his Word, to which our <hi>Ingagement</hi> refers him, let him not cavill at thoſe which refer him.</p>

                  <p>4. Liberty is the due birth-right, of every Engliſhman: but Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty has its bounds, and rules; and the liberty of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber muſt be ſubordinate to the liberty of the whole body. By the Laws of Liberty every man is to injoy, that which is his own: but ſince one man has far greater, and better things to injoy, then another, the liberties of one may extend further, then the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of another. Likewiſe, when our Liberties are equall exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, one man may voluntarily renounce, or maliciouſly forfeit, that which another does not. Therfore we muſt not ſuppoſe, that any man in <hi>England</hi> by the Proteſtation, or Covenant, or any Law elſe, has ſuch an eſtate, or inheritance in his Liberty, as is altogether indefeaſible, and unreleaſible, whatſoever He does, or ſaies. But in the laſt place, there is a Liberty of the whole State, aſwell as of any particular ſubject: and that Liberty of the whole State muſt ſuperſede the Liberty of every particular ſubject, whenſoever both accord not: the leſſer, to avoid repugnance, muſt alwaies give place to the greater.

                  <p>5. Religious ties, and pacts are not unlawfull in themſelves, but we hold the uſe of them unlawfull when they are inforced without ſincerity, without neceſſity, and without due authority. As for the Biſhops canonicall Oaths; we are not ſatisfied that there was a ſincere meaning in them, or any cleer Law for them: and we are certain there can be no neceſſity pretended to uphold them: wherefore tis no marvell, if they proved fatall. As for the Covenant alſo, it was rigorouſly obtruded upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the <hi>Scots,</hi> without any pretext of authority: and as we have found ſince a want of ingenuity in the obtruders, ſo we are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the pleas of its neceſſity were miſtaken: foraſmuch as it has wrought contrary effects, and produced hoſtility, inſtead of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108155:37"/>
amity. Wherfore if this miſcarried alſo tis no great wonder. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does the line, that runs betwixt our <hi>Ingagement,</hi> and thoſe obligations prove a true parallell: for thoſe were Religious, ſo is not this: and thoſe were utterly unneceſſary, to ſay no worſe of them, ſo is not this. God has required us to be loyall, and true in our obedience to the higher powers: to obey God in this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: and therfore to promiſe obedience in this, even when our promiſe is a neceſſary part of our obedience: and is moreover a medium ſo aptly diſpoſed to reach the end of all obedience, the ſecurance of publick peace: we cannot but conclude it neceſſary. Beſides, the Conſiderator might take notice, that his objection here is generall againſt all ſtipulations, as ſuch: ſo that by the force of his objection, the very bonds of matrimony; the military Sacraments of ſouldiers: all the obligations almoſt betwixt man, and man, by which humane ſociety is preſerved, finde themſelves ſtruck at, and ſhaken. There was ſcarce ever any Nation yet ſo barbarous, as wholly to neglect ties of allegiance; and amongſt all ties of publick allegiance; there ſcarce will be any found ſo modeſt, brief, cleer, eaſie as our <hi>Engliſh Ingagement:</hi> the obligation is no more then civil, and the extent of it ſcarce equals the petie homages, and fealties which we pay in Leets, and in our Courts Baron.</p>

For: 1. we know there are diverſe, which refuſe this <hi>Ingagement</hi> out of meer diſ-affection to the preſent Government. 2. There are diverſe neutral minded men which do ſubſcribes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his <hi>Ingagement</hi> not without ſome unwillingneſſe, which nevertheleſſe will the rather be true, and faithfull becauſe they have ſo inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Fear of penalty will be as potent to keep ſome men from breaking, as it has been to keep others from refuſing the <hi>Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 3. Tis impoſſible for us to beleeve that pure conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains any man at all from ſubſcribing: it muſt be peeviſhnes, of humor, and opinion, it cannot be conſcience. Our reaſon is: becauſe there is no third thing betwixt being a Friend, and an Enemy: betwixt being true, and falſe: betwixt being obedient, and diſobedient. Can we poſſibly admit, that they are wholly for us in their judgments; that they expect to ſtand, and fall with us, that they are conſcientiouſly bound up from attempting againſt us: which think it a ſin to promiſe any truth, or fidelity to us? Either it is a ſin to be true, and faithfull to this Common-wealth,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108155:38"/>
or it is not. If it be a ſin: in the judgment of our <hi>Non-ingagers;</hi> to be true, and faithfull; then are our <hi>Non-ingagers</hi> worſe then Enemies: for enemies themſelves may without ſin paſſe pacts of truth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>idelity to each other: and if our <hi>Non-ingagers</hi> be worſe then ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, tis treacherous in them to pretend they are leſſe. Pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot permit them to ſay, they are wholly of our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their ſafety is involved in ours, they are no way diſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the preſent Government: whileſt at the ſame time it ſuggeſts to them that they ſin if they prove true, and faithfull to us. On the other ſide, if they allow there is no ſin in being true, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to us: then they muſt allow withall, that there is no ſin in promiſing truth, and faithfulneſſe. Nay without doubt, the thing being lawfull, the promiſe of the thing becomes lawfull, if not neceſſary when tis required by the Magiſtrate for ſecurance of the publick peace. Tis a ſtrange thing to imagine, what now predicament the <hi>Non-ingagers</hi> muſt finde out for themſelves. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemies they abhor to be, their judgements, their ſafeties, their own intereſts force them to diſclaim that Name: Profeſt Friends nevertheleſſe they dare not be; ſome ſcruples of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence deter them from any ſuch obligation. Neuters they cannot be, becauſe they are Natives, and members of this State, and owe allegiance to Government, howſoever they may except againſt this, or that form of Government. Forreiners that have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon us, nor owe allegiance to us, may profeſſe neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and if they be not againſt us, we repute them as if they were for us: but tis otherwiſe with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubjects. Ambidexters they will diſdain to be: for of ſuch the contrary rule is true: if they be not with us, they be againſt us: a ſeeming, ſimulatory, Friend to two contrary parties is a reall, aſſured enemy to both: our Saviours mouth has left it unqueſtionable, that <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters.</hi> It will therefore well become our <hi>Non-ingagers,</hi> to be plain dealing with us in this, though they may not be true to us, and let us know under what notion they would be lookt upon. If they be neither Friends, nor Enemies, nor Neuters, nor Ambidexters, let them give themſelves ſome fifth Name, onely let it be ſuch a Name, as may fall under ſome definition.</p>

uſe <hi>Calvins</hi> own words) which Chriſt has purchaſt with his blood for faithfull conſciences, to exempt them from the power of men: and that theſe prerogatives are loſt to ſuch conſciences, as yeeld themſelves to be ſnared with bonds of Laws, and Ordinances at the will of men. But we muſt underſtand with all, that no exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from the bonds of the Law moral, or any Civil ordinances not croſſing the Law moral, is here intended, or reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſts purchaſed Prerogatives: for Chriſt himſelf was obedient to the Higher Powers: and did profeſſe that He came not to deſtroy, but to fulfill the Law. We muſt therefore reſtrain <hi>Calvins</hi> meaning to a freedom from Leviticall ceremonies, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, unneceſſary impoſitions in matters Eccleſiaſticall: or to commands evidently ſinfull. Inaſmuch as the Conſciences of faithfull Chriſtians cannot be properly ſaid to be ſnared with any other Laws, and Ordinances. For that we are to be ſubject to government, and Governors for conſcience ſake: and that a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, pure conſcience is a thing very different from the ignorant fears, or raſh preſumptions of a miſ-guided minde, is very cleer by the Scripture. Therefore when the Conſiderator argues that a man may neither act, nor be enforced to act againſt an erring Conſcience. He ſeems to me to utter meer non-ſenſe, foraſmuch as that opinion which may be falſe, and erroneous, is ſo far from being a mans conſcience, that tis inconſiſtent with conſcience. Shall we call the Papiſts blinde zeal which makes him thirſt after Proteſtant blood an erroneous conſcience? and ſhall the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate forbear all force, and reſtraint towards Him, becauſe He onely follows the dictates of an erroneous conſcience? We may aſwell call that conſcience which leads the Ranter into unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: which urges the Arrian to blaſpheme Chriſt, and which induces the poore Indian to offer humane blood in ſacrifice to the Divill. No: Conſcience in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe (whom <hi>Calvin</hi> follows) is that Agent of God in the ſoul which holds forth to us the lamp of Nature (or rather of God creating us) improved further with the oyl of grace (or rather of God redeeming us) to ſhew us the uglines of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Can we then imagine, that Conſcience Gods reſident in the Soul is divided againſt it ſelf? or can we imagine, that that trumpet which ſounds points of war ſo contrary is to be obeyed, above all Laws, and Ordinances? and revered as Gods reſident? The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderator</hi> will ſay: if I have my diſſatisfactions both wayes, how ſhall I extricate my ſelf either way? how ſhall I ingage, or not ingage without ſin, ſince neither ingaging, nor refuſing is of faith with me? is it not in this caſe my ſafeſt courſe to obey that inſtinct, or prompting of my conſcience which is moſt powerfull, and leaſt oppoſite to faith? I anſwer, God has not left thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an iſſue, and a way to eſcape out of the midſt of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities. For all caſes are either certain, or dubious; and in all caſes certain God has made every man a Judge: and has left in every man that which we call Conſcience to negotiate in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; and the judgement which Conſcience paſſes herein, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other Laws, and Juriſdictions.

By this warrant, the Apoſtles, and their followers did pay due

allegiance to the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> the worſt of men, and moſt injurious of uſurpers: though it was more then probable in thoſe daies, that their Titles were gotten, and maintained by force, fraud, and bloody rapine. Who knows not, that in that infancy of the Church <hi>Herod</hi> had newly uſurpt over the Jews, that the <hi>Romans</hi> uſurpt over him, and were in like manner preſently after uſurpt over by the <hi>Caeſars:</hi> yea that even in the family of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> there were almoſt continuall uſurpations?</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> will ſtill ſay: can Conſcience permit me to diſpence with Oaths formerly taken by ſubmitting now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, inconſiſtent <hi>Ingagements?</hi> is not this a thing evidently, and indubitably evill? and is not Conſcience a ſufficient Judge of things ſo evident, and indubitable? I anſwer. 1. Where man is hem'd in, with two unavoidable evils, the leſſe is to be choſen: and the choiſe of the leſſe, is no ſin, but a duty. When man cannot preſerve himſelf, or ſome other living Creature without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing a Sabbath duty, the tranſgreſſing of that duty becomes an office of charity: becauſe the means by its ſubordination was neceſſarily to give way to the end. 2ly, To ſubmit to a new obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which is conducent to the publick good, and to wave a former contrary obligation, when it is become oppoſite to its firſt end is no evident, indubitable evil. The Law by Oath bound the King, and all under him to maintain the ancient rights, uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Statutes of the Land: yet when any change of thoſe rights, uſages, and Statutes became neceſſary for the publick good, we are all ſatisfied that the King and all under him gave way to that change without perjury. So if we have been ſworn to maintain Monarchy, the form of government being but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to an higher end, when Monarchy becomes deſtructive to that end, the force of our Oath ceaſes: for Laws create forms, and Laws uphold forms by Oaths; but neither forms, nor oaths binde longer then the Laws: and we ſee, there is a ſubordination even amongſt Laws themſelves, and by the rules of that ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, temporary Laws are to yeeld to perpetuall Laws, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall to abſolute; mediate, to finall. When Nature permits hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie bodies contrary to the Law of heavy bodies to aſcend, for the prevention of ſome greater breach of ſome Law that concerns all the Elements, and the peace of the univerſe: it teaches us, what we are to do in politicks. I leave theſe things to the <hi>Conſiderators</hi>

own application. The Magiſtrate which is now girt with Gods ſword, requires an aſſurance from him of his allegiance for the better preventing of future broils, and diſturbances. His private phancie tels him that aſſurance is due to ſome other Magiſtrate, which if He may judge of ſecret reaſons of State, and things above Him, has more right to the Sword: yet in the mean time doubts, whether God has intruſted him with any ſuch judgement, or no: and He ſees his example keeps the publick Peace the more unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and He forfeits the protection of Law to Himſelf, by denying his obedience to the ſame: I ſay no more: the <hi>Conſiderator</hi> here is hedged in with two inevitable evils, let him conſider, whether is the greater.</p>
