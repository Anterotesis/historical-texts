            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In these few sheets, I haue lodged to the number of three thousand; who (could they speake) would vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly informe you, that they were acquired and sought out for no other reason, than to be exposed to your noble view and most iudiciall censure. All which I haue charmed with such art, that the fairest amongst them you may admit into your Bedchamber without suspition, and the most clamorous into your Closet, without noyse. Amongst the illustrious Queenes, your Lordship may reade those whom you haue as zealously honored, as you haue been by them royally fauored, Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp; Q. <hi>Anne.</hi> Amongst the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ladies, memorated for their incomparable Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb facs="tcp:20365:3"/>
or commended to posteritie for their admirable Vertues; thinke (my Lord) you behold all the vnpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld accomplishments of the excellent Ladies your Daughters, intended and comprehended: And to whom more pertinently may I commend the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of good women, than to your Honor, who hath been the happie Husband &amp; fortunate Father of such. If you happen of others in this Tractat contrarily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, they are but as Foyles to set off the lustre of the former; for Vertue and Vice, Beautie and Deformitie discouered together, makes the horrid aspect of the one more odible, and the imitable glory of the other more eminent. Therfore <hi>Minerua</hi> still thought her selfe fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, when <hi>Medusa's</hi> Head was present, which was of all others the foulest. If your Lordship, from your more weightie designes of State, and grauer Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, can spare any retyred houres, and in them to vouchsafe the perusall of these few imperfect histories, I shall not only hold my trauaile well vndertaken, but liberally rewarded. I was (my Lord) your creature, and (amongst other of your seruants) you bestowed me vpon the excellent Princesse Q. <hi>Anne</hi> (to whose memorie I haue celebrated in these Papers the zeale of a subiect and a seruant) but by her lamented death your Gift (my Lord) is returned againe into your hands, being stil yours, either to keepe vnto your selfe, or to conferre where your noble disposition shall best please. Howsoeuer, as I haue euer been an admirer of your Vertues, so my prayers still are, they may not only continue you a lasting Honor here vpon Earth, but purchase you an euerlasting Glorie, reserued for you in Heauen.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Enerous Reader, I haue exposed to thy most iudiciall view a Discourse of Women: wherein expect not, that I should either enuiously carpe at the particular manners or actions of any liuing, nor iniuriously detract from the Sepulchers of the dead; the first I could neuer affect, the last I did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes detest. I only present thee with a Collection of Histories, which touch the generalitie of Women, such as haue either beene illustrated for their Vertues, and Noble Actions, or contrarily branded for their Vices, and baser Conditions; in all which, I haue not exceeded the bounds and limits of good and sufficient Authoritie. Here thou mayest reade of all degrees, from the Scepter in the Court, to the Sheepe-hooke in the Cottage: of all Times, from the first Rainebow, to the last blazing Starre: of all knowne Nations, from the North to the Meridian, and from the East to the Septentrion: of all Faiths; Iewes, Pagans, or Christians: of all Callings; Virgins, Wiues, or Widowes: of the Faire and Foule, Chast and Wanton, of each of these something: Briefely, of all Estates, Conditions, and Qualities whatsoeuer. In the Goddesses, and other Poeticall Fictions (which to some Readers may appeare fabulously impossible) you shall find their misticall sences made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous and plaine, with the true intent of the Poets, which was not (as some haue dreamed) meerely to transferre Worship and Honor vpon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Causes, thereby to debarre the true and euer-liuing Creator of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Adoration, but rather including in darke and aenigmaticall Histories, Precepts of Wisdome and Knowledge, least they should be made too popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and therefore subiect to contempt. The like Illustrations you shall find in the <hi>Nymphes, Graces, Oreades, Driades, Hamadriades,</hi> &amp;c. No seeming Fable being here remembred (though neuer so intricate &amp; obscure) which is not made plaine and easie. In the <hi>Muses,</hi> you shall meet with the first Inuentresses of all good Arts, and Disciplines; in the <hi>Sybills,</hi> their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Prophesies set downe at large; in the <hi>Vestalls,</hi> the honor due to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie; in Queenes, how such should beare themselues in their power, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Noble Ladies in their obedience. Wiues may reade here of chast Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, to patterne their Daughters by, and how to demeane themselues in all Coniugall loue towards their Husbands: Widowes may finde what may best become their solitude, and Matrons those accomplishments that most dignifie their grauitie: and so of the rest. Now if any aske, Why I haue
<pb facs="tcp:20365:4"/>
shut vp and contruded within a narrow roome, many large Histories, not delating them with euerie plenarie circumstance? I answer, That therein I haue imitated <hi>Aelianus de Var. Hist.</hi> and <hi>Valer. Maxim.</hi> who epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised great and memorable acts, reducing and contracting into a compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Method wide and loose Histories, giuing them notwithstanding their full weight, in few words. Some also may cauill, that I haue not introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in order, neither Alphabetically, nor according to custome or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident; which I thus excuse: The most cunning and curious Musick, is that which is made out of Discords; and <hi>Ouid</hi> preferres a blunt Carriage and a neglected Habit aboue all sprucenesse and formalitie. It may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obiected, Why amongst sad and graue Histories, I haue here and there inserted fabulous Ieasts and Tales, sauouring of Lightnesse? I answer, I haue therein imitated our Historicall and Comicall Poets, that write to the Stage; who least the Auditorie should be dulled with serious courses (which are meerely weightie and materiall) in euerie Act present some Zanie with his Mimick action, to breed in the lesse capable, mirth and laughter: For they that write to all, must striue to please all. And as such fashion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to a multitude, consisting of spectators seuerally addicted; so I, to an vniuersalitie of Readers, diuersly disposed. I may be further questioned, Why I haue in the Front of my Booke no Encomiasticks, or commendatorie Verses from my friends, to vsher in the Worke (especially being so much and so long conuersant amongst the Poets) which is able to discourage a Booke, wanting their approbation and countenance? Let that (I entreat) be no preiudice to my Labours, since I did not communicate them vnto any: And how can any man truly commend what he hath not aduisedly perused? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I thinke I am so little knowne, or ill beloued amongst them, that any one would haue denyed me so small a courtesie. But being onely a matter of forme, and neither helpe nor hinderance to that which hath alreadie past the Presse; I expose it naked to the free view, and vnguarded with any such faction of friends; either by the worth thereof to be commended, and so liue; or by the weakenesse to be disparaged, and so perish. And these are all the difficulties of which I am now to expostulate, desiring thee to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse a suddaine Businesse, which began with the Presse, kept it still going, and ended some few dayes before it. These things well considered, may in any generous spirit preuent all Cauill and Criticisme: and to such onely I submit my selfe.</p>

            <div n="1" type="book">
               <head>The first booke which is <hi>CLIO,</hi> treating of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses Coelestiall, Terrestriall, Marine, and Infernall.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EFORE wee enter into a particular tractate of these Goddesses, it shall not bee amisse to speake something of the opinions setled in sundry Nations, concerning them: Who were their first Adorers and Worshippers; the multiplicitie of their gods; and what seuerall rights, and customes, obseruations and Ceremonies they vsed in their Oblations and Sacrifices. The Aethiopians are said to bee the most ancient, and the first beginners of Diuine adoration, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> is of opinion; Imagining in themselues, and verely beleeuing some of their gods to bee euerlasting, and others to participate of a mortall and corruptible nature. The Phoenicians, they deliuered admirable and strange things concerning their gods, and the first beginning and Creation of things; aboue all others hauing in Diuine worship <hi>Dagona</hi> and <hi>Chamas.</hi> The Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides (a people of Affrica) they are confident that the generation of the gods proceeded from them, and the first that raigned amongst them they called <hi>Coelum,</hi> which is heauen. The Augitae another nation (in the Affricke Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) acknowledged no other deityes than the Ghosts of such noble persons as were deceased, to whose sepulchers they vsuallie repayred to demand answers of all such things wherein they doubted. The Theologie of the Phrygians was not much different from theirs. The Persians neither erected Statues nor Altars, they worshipped the Heauen, which they called <hi>Iupiter;</hi> the Sunne, by the name of <hi>Mithra;</hi> the Moone, <hi>Venus;</hi> the Fire, the Earth, the Winds, and the Water. <hi>Isiodorus</hi> saith, the Graecians first honoured <hi>Cecrops,</hi> whom they sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and were the first deuisers of Images, erecters of Altars, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of sacrifice. The Iewes, as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> relates, apprehended but one diuine power, and that onely they acknowledged. The Germans of old (as the same author affirmes) were of opinion, That the gods could not bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within walles, nor haue any humane shape appropriated vnto them, measuring their incomprehensible power by the magnitude of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20365:7"/>
Now concerning the diuers opinions of men, what this supreame deity should be; some held it the vniuerse or the gloabe of the world: of which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>Origines</hi> in his fift booke against <hi>Celsus.</hi> The Stoicks held it to bee the first world; the Platonists, a second world; and diuerse other Sectists of Greece to bee a third world. <hi>Thales Milesius</hi> called God, a Mind, that fashioned all creatures out of the water, that knew no beginning, and was not capable of end. <hi>Anaxmiander</hi> he ascribed a deity to the starres and the planets, and these coelestiall bodies, attributing no honor to that Mind, of which <hi>Thales</hi> dreamed. <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> thought it to be the Infinite ayer, to which hee attributed the Originall of all causes, and deriued the birth of the gods from thence; for so Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> affirmes. <hi>Democritus Abderites</hi> (as <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Arnobius</hi> testifie of him) was of opinion, that it was a Mind of fire, and the soule of the world. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> sets downe <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his opinion concerning this godhead, and thus defines it: A Minde still trauelling, neuer out of motion, but disperst and diffus'd through all the parts of the world, and things naturall; from which all creatures whatsoeuer that are borne take life. <hi>Lysis</hi> and <hi>Philolaus,</hi> call it an vnspeakeable number, or a summity of the greatest or smallest number, for so <hi>Origines</hi> faith. <hi>Archelaus Physicus</hi> would haue all things to be created of earth, and (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> testates of him) the beginning of all things to proceede from thence. <hi>Pherecidas</hi> taught that the earth was before all other things, and therefore to that he appropriated a diuinitie, <hi>Heraclius Ephesius,</hi> contested the gods to be made of Fire; so <hi>Varro</hi> writes of him: of the same beleefe was <hi>Hippasus Metapontinus</hi> (witnesse <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius.</hi>) <hi>Anaxagoras Clazomen</hi> called his god <hi>Homoeomeria,</hi> that is, Likenesse of parts; and that a diuine thought was the producter of all things whatsoeuer: So <hi>Augustine</hi> reports of him; others, that he held an infinite Mind to be the first moouer. <hi>Prodicus Coeus,</hi> as <hi>Epihanius</hi> tels vs, plac't his god in the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: likewise in the Sun and the Moone; in which two planets there existed a liuing vertue. <hi>Diogenes Apollonaites</hi> deriued his god from the Ayre, as the matter from whence all things had their reality, as likewise that it did parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of diuine reason, without which nothing could be created. <hi>Cleanthes Assius</hi> would haue his god of the Firmament, as diuerse other of the Stoicks. And as <hi>Arnobius</hi> witnesseth of him, sometimes he called him the Will: now the Minde: then that part of the ayer which is aboue the fire: and sometimes againe the Reason. <hi>Straton</hi> made Nature his <hi>summum bonum. Antisthenes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniensis,</hi> he taught that there were many popular gods, but one onely Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the fabricke of the world. <hi>Chrysippus Silix</hi> the Stoicke, hee taught that god was a naturall power endued with diuine reason; and then againe, he called him a Diuine necessity. <hi>Zeno Citteieus,</hi> called him a diuine and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law; and sometimes the Firmament. <hi>Zenophanes Colophonius</hi> called him, Whatsoeuer was infinite in a conioyned mind, or one vniuersall and euery thing that (as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> saith of him) he imagined to be god. <hi>Parmenides Eliates,</hi> called him fantasme, or an apprehension of an Imaginarie thing, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing resembling a crown; which the greeks call <hi>Stephanos,</hi> conteining within it a fierie light, an orbe, or girdle which compasseth and embraceth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: adhearing to his fantasie were <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Simplicius. Empedocles Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> he would haue foure natures of which all things should subsist, and these he taught to be diuine: as also, that they had byrth, and should see end; for so <hi>Cicero</hi> writes in his book <hi>de natura deorum. Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> speake of one <hi>Theodorus</hi> sirnamed <hi>Atheos,</hi> the Atheist: He affirmed the gods to be meere
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20365:7"/>

The same Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers attributed a god-hood to the starres and all other coelestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. <hi>Heraclides Ponticus,</hi> thought the World and the Minde, both diuine, and was of opinion that this forme of the deity was mutable, reducing the earth and the heauens within the compasse of Godhead. <hi>Epicurus Atheniensis,</hi> hee made him gods of Atoms of Moates, allowing them bodies differing from men, but bearing humaine forme. <hi>M.

But least I should grow tedious in the search of so many diuerse opinions, which to some may appeare impertinent to the tractate in hand, yet not altogether vnnecessary to such who haue not trauelled in the search of these Antiquities; I wil come neerer to the matter, and to speake of the goddesses, as we promist. <hi>Hesiod</hi> hath left to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, that there are no lesse than thirtie thousand gods within the compasse of the world, and euery one haue seuerall predominance ouer men, beasts, fish, foules, and all other creatures vegetatiue and sensatiue. <hi>Tertullian</hi> hee speakes of three hundred <hi>Ioues</hi> or <hi>Iupiters</hi> counted by M. <hi>Varro.</hi> Therefore it was not permitted amongst the Romanes, to adore any other gods or god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses than such as were approoued and allowed by the Senate.

In other cities were the like instituted to Pouertie, and to Fortune: lest the one should afflict them, and that the other should fauor them. Floods likewise and riuers were esteemed as deities, some portraide in the figure of men, and others in the semblance of beasts. Amongst the Lacaede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates, Temples were edified, one to Feare, another to Laughter, a third to Death. The Aeyptians worshipped the Sunne and Moone, the Goddesse <hi>Ibis,</hi> a cat, an eagle, and a goate. The Syrians adored a doue: the Romanes a goose, by reason that by cackling of geese the Capitall was preserued from the sacke. Amongst the Thessalians it was held an offence Capitall to kill a Storke. Those that inhabite the Island Syrene, honour the fish called Pharos: those that dwell in Moeotis, the fish <hi>Oxiringus:</hi> In Ambracia, a <hi>Lyonesse,</hi> because in times past a Lyonesse ceased vpon a Tyrant and tore him to pieces; by which they were restored to their ancient liberties.

A <hi>Dragon</hi> in Alba (a groue iuft opposite against <hi>Iunoes</hi> Temple) was honoured by the Spartane virgins: to which at certaine times they went, and fedde him from their hands.

                  <p>It is related of <hi>Iuno</hi> further, that when shee and her husband being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and pleasantly discoursing, held argument betwixt themselues, Whether in the act of generation men or women tooke the greatest delight? and that by ioint consent their controuersie was to be determined by <hi>Tyresias</hi> (one that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20365:9"/>
had beene of both sects:) <hi>Tyresias</hi> giuing vp his censure, That women were by nature the most wanton; her sport turned into spleene, and her mirth into such madnesse, that shee instantly bereaued him of his sight, and strucke him blinde: to recompence which losse, <hi>Iupiter</hi> inspired him with the spirit of Diuination and Prophesie; to which, her continnued anger further added, That howsoeuer hee truely prophesied, yet his presages should neuer bee beleeued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alcmena</hi> too, growing great of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and readie to bee deliuered, shee taking on her the shape of a beldame, sat her downe before her owne altar with her knees crossed, and her hands clutched, by which charme shee stopped the passage of her child-birth; which <hi>Gallantis</hi> espying, and aprehending (as it was indeed) that to be the occasion why her ladie could not be deliuered, she bethought her of a craft to preuent the others cunning; for leauing <hi>Alc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> in the middest of her throwes, shee assumes a counterfeit ioy, and with a glad countenance approcheth the altar to thanke the gods for her Ladies safe deliuerie: Which <hi>Iuno</hi> no sooner heard, but vp shee riseth and casts her armes abroad; her knees were no sooner vncrost and her fingers open, but <hi>Alc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> was eased, and <hi>Hercules</hi> found free passage into the world. <hi>Gallantis</hi> at this laughing, and <hi>Iuno</hi> chasing to be thus deluded, she afflicted her with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard off punishment by transhaping her into a <hi>Weesill,</hi> whose nature is to kindle at the mouth; that from the same jawes with which shee had lied to the gods about <hi>Alcmenaes</hi> childbearing she should euer after bring foorth her young.</p>
                  <p>No lesse was her hatred to all the posteritie of <hi>Cadmus:</hi> for when <hi>Agaue</hi> had lost <hi>Penthaus;</hi> and <hi>Antinoe, Acteon;</hi> and <hi>Semele</hi> had beene consumed by <hi>Ioues</hi> thunders; and there remained onely two, <hi>Athames</hi> and <hi>Ino,</hi> shee possest them both with such madnesse, that hee being on hunting, transpierst his sonne <hi>Learchus,</hi> mistaking him for the game he chased; and <hi>Ino</hi> snacht vp young <hi>Melicertes</hi> and with him cast her selfe downe headlong into the Sea, from the top of an high promontorie. But at the intercession of <hi>Venus,</hi> who was borne of the waues, <hi>Neptune</hi> was pleased to ranke them in the number of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods, so that <hi>Melicertes</hi> is called <hi>Palemon;</hi> and <hi>Ino, Leucothoe.</hi> I could further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of manie other poeticall Fables, as of <hi>Ixion,</hi> who entertained and feasted by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> attempted to strumpet <hi>Iuno,</hi> and adulterat the bed of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> which to preuent, and shunne the violence of a rape, she fashioned a Clowd into her owne similitude and semblance, which <hi>Ixion</hi> mistaking for <hi>Iuno,</hi> of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Centaures. As also, the birth of her sonne <hi>Vulcane,</hi> and her daughter <hi>Eccho;</hi> he lame, and shee so deformed, that being ashamed to shew her selfe or appeare to the eyes of any, she hath so conceald her selfe in thicke woods and hollow vaults and cauernes, that neuer any part of her could euer yet be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered more than her voice.</p>
                  <p>Yet to shew that in all these seeming fables golden meanings were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I will briefely thus illustrate them: <hi>Iuno</hi> was therefore called the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Saturne,</hi> because the world was created by God, the great worke-master of Nature. Then, in his course was <hi>Time</hi> borne; from thence, <hi>Ether,</hi> which is, whatsoeuer is aboue the Element of Fire, the Firmament, or the Sky; and next that, the Elements: The highest next <hi>Iupiter</hi> is <hi>AÃ«r,</hi> namely <hi>Iuno,</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratresse of the life of man, by whom the treasures of raine and haile are disposed and gouerned: of the Aire waxing hot, are generated creatures, trees and plants, &amp;c. whose temperature hath an influence in the bodies and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20365:9"/>
mindes of reasonable creatures: therefore when from water <hi>Aer</hi> is next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, shee is sayd to be nourisht by <hi>Oceanus</hi> and <hi>Thetis;</hi> when the force of the Element workes with the <hi>Aer</hi> in the procreation of creatures, shee is then sayd to be the wife of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> when shee is changed into fire, then shee brings forth <hi>Vulcan:</hi> when the benignitie of the aire hath cooperation with such things as are generated, shee is then stiled the goddesse of marriage. So likewise it is saied of <hi>Ixion,</hi> that for attempting the bed of <hi>Iupiter</hi> he was from heauen cast downe into hell; which some would bring within the compasse of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: But that hee is there tortured vpon a wheele incessantly turning round, must needs include moralitie. Most probable it is that <hi>Ixion</hi> disgrac't and banisht from the court of that king whose wife he had sought to adulterat, was thereby made of all men the most wretched and miserable, as one excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated with perpetuall ambition and enuie: for such as vnder the imaginarie Idea of vertue apprehend the realitie of vaine glorie, they can attempt nothing good, nothing sincere or lawdable, but all their actions are criminall, irregular and meerely absurd; importing thus much, That their estates can haue no continuance, that by sinister and indirect courses seeke to clime to the heigth and crowne of glorie.</p>

The places celebrated to her deitie, were Ithinas a hill neere to Athens, where shee had a Temple errected; the mountaine Pireas, in Attica; in Aracinthus, a place in Aetolia, from which (as <hi>Statius</hi> writes) she was called <hi>Aracinthia. Plinie</hi> saith that Nea, one of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands called Ciclades, was peculiar to her. But Athens was her place of most honour, which citie she is sayd to haue built: From thence she hath the name of <hi>Athnaea, Attica, Cecropia,</hi> and <hi>Mosopia: Horace Carm. lib.</hi> 1. The great citie called Alcomeneum, scituate in Boetia, hath likewise by the testament of the first founder submitted it selfe to her patronage. Of <hi>Scira,</hi> a prophet of Elusina, shee was called <hi>Sciras.</hi> The solemnisation of her feastiuals were called Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenea. There were certaine wreastling contentions, which <hi>Theseus</hi> in Athens first instituted to this goddesse, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath deliuered. She had likewise her <hi>Quinquatria</hi> yearely celebrated, which were kept sacred fiue daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the blacke day, (and therefore so called) the blacke day was immediatly after the Ides. In her sacrifices it was their custome to offer a Goat, because as <hi>Plinie</hi> hath left recorded, The biting of the goat is preiudiciall to the Oliue tree, whose fruit <hi>Minerua</hi> best loueth; the verie licking of the rinde with their tongues makes it barren. Shee slew the beast Alcida, a monster that from his mouth and nosthrils breathed fire. <hi>Aelianus</hi> writes, that when <hi>Alexander</hi> brought his armie against Thebes (amongst manie other prodigies) that the image of <hi>Minerua,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Atalcomineides</hi> was burnt by a voluntarie flame, no fire being neere it. At Assessum she had two Temples: from that place she was called <hi>Minerua Assessia.</hi> From other places where shee was worshipt, she tooke the name of <hi>Pallenides</hi> and <hi>Pedasia: Alea</hi> from her temple amongst the Tegeates. <hi>Tutelaris</hi> she was called by the inhabitants of Chios, and honoured as an Oracle amongst the Aegyptians; she had only a porch amongst the Seians. In some places her statues were couered with gold, in others they were of plaine stone.

Of her Temple at Ephesus, it shall not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to speake a word or two by the way. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke <hi>De vitando Aere alieno,</hi> saith that the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> was a Sanctuarie, wherein all deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were safe from their creditours.

office; the third <hi>Parieres,</hi> that was dead from the seruice. This statelie and magnificent structure was first erected by the Amazons, so beautifull and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, that when <hi>Xerxes</hi> had with sword and fire wasted and demolisht all the Temples of Asia, he spared onelie that, as the richest iewell of the world. It is reported of one <hi>Herostratus,</hi> a wicked and debosht fellow, who finding in himselfe nothing good to preserue his memorie, and willing that his name should liue to posteritie, set this Temple on fire, for no other purpose, but that hee would bee talkt on: the Ephesians vnderstanding this his malicious ambition, they made it death once to name him. <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> writes that the same night that this famous structure was ruin'd and defaced by fire, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> was borne in Pella, in the three hundered and eighth yeare after the building of Rome: so that at the extinguishing of one light of the world, another was kindled. It being demanded of one of <hi>Dianaes</hi> priests, Why <hi>Diana</hi> being a goddesse, would suffer her Temple to be vtterlie destroyed? and what she was doing the while? It was answered againe, That it was done vnawares to the goddesse, for she was that night at the labour of <hi>Olimpias,</hi> and busied about bringing <hi>Alexander</hi> into the world. Notwithstanding this great ruine, the people of Ephesus caused it to bee re-erected, and made both richer and more beautifull than before: of which worke <hi>Dinocrates</hi> an Architectour of Macedonia was chiefe. <hi>Diana</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Simposaicon</hi> saith) is called <hi>Elitheia,</hi>

After the like manner is the day sorted out for our labours and affaires, the night for our rest and repose. So likewise in explicating the power of <hi>Luna,</hi> or the Moone: some call her the daughter of <hi>Hiperion</hi> or the Sunne, because shee being <hi>Corpus diaphanes,</hi> that is a bodie cristaline, like reflectiue glasse, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres the light receiued from her father, vpon the earth to vs; for which cause she is called also the sister of the Sunne: by the swiftnesse of her course her proper motions are declared. To expresse her nature alwaies appearing to vs greater, or lesser, is to signifie her strength and multiplicitie of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, therefore they alot her a garment of diuers and sundrie colours. In attributing to her the double sexes of male and female (as some haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented) the reason is, in that as shee is woman, shee infuseth an humor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie and profitable to the nutriment of all creatures: in respect of her

                     <p>So superstitious they were in the daies of old that they attributed all their intents, actions, and euents of things, to the guidance and will of <hi>Fortune,</hi> nay that shee had a power in their verie birthdaies, and dayes of death: as of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi> the most famous Tragick Poet, hee was borne on the same day that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Salamine, the Greeks and the Meades fought that famous Sea-battel, and died vpon the birth day of <hi>Dyonisius</hi> senior, the tyrant of Sicily. When as (<hi>Timaeus</hi> sayth) at one instant, <hi>Fortune</hi> tooke away the imitator of Tragicke calamities, and brought in their true actor and performer. Ascribed it is to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Conquerer, and <hi>Dyogenes</hi> the Cynick, should die both on a day: and, that king <hi>Attalus</hi> left the world, the same day of the yere that he entered into the world. The like was read of <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, the same day of the moneth that he was borne in Rome, the same (or as some will haue it the day after) he was beheaded in Aegypt. <hi>Pyndarus</hi> the Greeke Poet, borne in Pithea, consecrated many diuine Hymnes to <hi>Appollo,</hi> patron of the place. <hi>Florus</hi> remembers <hi>Carniades</hi> in the celebration of <hi>Platos</hi> birth day, whom he calls a stout champion of the Accademie, obseruing that they were both borne on the feast day of <hi>Appollo, Plato</hi> in Athens, where the Thargetia were acted; and <hi>Carniades</hi> in Cyrene, where the Carnia were celebrated; both these feasts falling vpon the seuenth day, on which his priests say <hi>Appollo</hi> himselfe was borne, and therefore they call him <hi>Septimanatus,</hi> and <hi>Hebdomagenus,</hi> as much as to say, the seuenth day borne. Those therefore that call <hi>Plato</hi> the sonne of <hi>Appollo</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith) haue done the god no indignitie or dishonour, hee hauing succeeded him in the Oracles of diuine philosophie, of whom <hi>Tindarus Lacedemonius</hi> hath left this character:

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>quest. Rom.</hi> the 64. question, demands why <hi>Seruius Tullius</hi> dedicated a Temple to little Fortune, or Short? (for so the Latine words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, being <hi>Paruae &amp; Breui</hi>) because saith he, that in the beginning from basenes and obscuritie (as being borne of a captiue mother) by the benefite of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20365:18"/>
he was exalted to the principalitie of Rome: or doth this change not rather shew her power than her pouertie, that she is a gyant, and no dwarfe? Of all the other Deities, <hi>Seruius</hi> was knowne to celebrate her with the most Diuine honours, and to inscribe her in all his actions: for he not onely built Temples to <hi>Fortuna bonae spei,</hi> of good hope; <hi>Auerruncae,</hi> to turne away her anger; <hi>Blandae,</hi> to her smiling; <hi>Primogeniae,</hi> as to the eldest child of Inheritance; <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rili,</hi> as she was manly: but he erected one also to his owne proper fortune. He gaue her also the denominations of <hi>Conuertentis,</hi> turning, or turning towards; <hi>Bene sperantis,</hi> of well hoping; and <hi>Fortunae virginis,</hi> Fortune the Virgin; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Viscosae,</hi> as catching and clinging to vs in all our attempts and actions. May it not therefore be obserued, that this Temple, and these rights and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were celebrated to Little Fortune, that she may assist and much auaile vs euen in things of the smallest moment? Teaching vs, that in all occurrents and euents we ought to intermit no occation or opportunitie that may auaile vs, for the smalnesse in shew or sleightnesse in appearance. But to apply these things to our better vse, and shew that all these Diuine attributes bestowed on this goddesse were heathenish, and absurd, I hold opinion with <hi>Plutarch, lib. de Fortuna,</hi> That Wisedome guideth the life and actions of man, not Fortune. Was it by Fortune (saith he) that <hi>Aristides</hi> liued in pouertie, when it was in his owne power to purchase wealth? or that <hi>Scipio</hi> hauing taken Carthage, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saw the prey, nor tooke part of the spoyle? That <hi>Philocrates</hi> hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued so many Talents of <hi>Alexanders,</hi> spent them vpon strumpets, and Fishes. That <hi>Lasthenes</hi> and <hi>Euthycrates,</hi> by proposing to themselues no other felicitie than the throate and belly, lost Olynthus? If these things be attributed to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, we may as well say, Cats, Goates, and Apes, are by chance giuen to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racitie, lust, and squirilitie. If all things be attributed to fortune, what can be deuised? what learnt? what citties gouernment could subsist? or what Kings counsell be managed without prouidence, and wisedome to direct it? did For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune sway all? Many bruite beasts are better furnisht in their nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than man; some are arm'd with hornes, some with teeth, some with prickles, not so much as the Porcupine, nay the Hedge-hogge, but as <hi>Empedocles</hi> saith:

Looke but into crafts, arts, and sciences, we see mettalls tried, houses built, statues caru'd, yet not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these by chance or accident; for the arts crafts (as we call them) acknowledge <hi>Ergana,</hi> that is, <hi>Minerua</hi> (not Fortune) for their goddesse and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronesse.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20365:18"/>
It is recorded of a Painter, that hauing drawne a horse in all his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaments, colours, shape, and euery thing in their true posture, onelie the foame forced from the horses mouth by the curbe or bit of the bridle he had not done to his mind; which often blotting out, and againe seeking to make perfect, but in vaine, in a great vexation and anger, he cast his pencell (being then full of the same colour) against the table, which hitting in the same place gaue so fortunat a dash, that what art could not doe, meere chance and accident made compleat and perfect: and this is the onelie master-peece of Fortune that I haue read off. In all sciences, Artificers vse their rules, squares, lines, plummets, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, numbers, least any particle of their cunning should be conferd vpon hap or accident. There is a prouidence euen in tuning of an instrument, in slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or stretching the string; in the kitchin to season meate to the pallat: nor doth any man that hath bought cloath to suite himselfe, kneele downe and make his orisons to Fortune, to make them vp and fit them to his bodie. Hee that hath gathered together abundance of treasure and riches, hath many cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues about him, and seruants to attend him, dwells in a Pallace with many porches and gates, sees it furnisht with costlie hangings, sumptuous beds and tables, without true wisedome to manage all these, apprehends no true felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or happinesse of life. Therefore one asking <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> why hauing armes, and bowes, and weapons, and other militarie ornaments, What kind of man he was that profest not any? he answered, he was that man that had dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all these, and power to vse them at his pleasure. Therefore wisedome is neither gold, nor siluer, nor glorie, nor health, nor riches, nor strength, nor beautie; it is onelie that which by knowing how to vse them well, makes them laudable and profitable, without which they are meerelie vaine, barren, yea, and oft times damnable, and to him that inioyes them brings trouble and shame. I will conclude this tractate with the saying of the Poet,

About her chariot are wilde beasts, the reason is, shee is the producter and nourisher of all creatures whatsoeuer. Deseruedly she weares a crowne of Towers and Turrets, being the queene and mistresse of so many Townes, Castles, and Cities. By the noyse of musicke and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours at her sacrifices, is obserued the whistling and blustring of the windes, who are necessarie in all the affaires of nature, especially in heate and cold, bearing the showers and tempests too and fro vpon their wings, to make foule weather in one place, and a cleere skie in another. Her chariot is drawne with foure Lions, which imports those foure brothers which blow from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the Australl, the Occident, and the Septentrion; these, are sayd to be her coach-steeds and hurrie her from place to place, because in generation they are much auailing: therefore as all things, as from a fountaine deriue their originall and beginning from her, she is most pertinently called <hi>Rhaea, Ã  fluendo</hi> of flowing.</p>

discouered by <hi>Iuno,</hi> shee begd her as a gift and gaue her in custodie to <hi>Argus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Aristor,</hi> whose hundered eyes <hi>Mercurie</hi> (by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Iupiter</hi>) hauing charmed asleepe, he cut off his head and so slewe him.

He borrowed of them that eye and tooth: neither of which he would restore till they had brought him to the nymphes with winged shooes, which taking from them, and being armed with the Helmet of <hi>Pluto,</hi> the sword of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the mirrour of <hi>Pallas,</hi> he fled to Tartessus, a cittie of Iberiae where the Gorgons then inhabited; whose heads crawled with adders, whose teeth were like the tuskes of a boare, their hands of brasse, and their wings of gold; and there arriuing, found them asleepe, and spying her head in <hi>Mineruaes</hi> glasse, in which he still looked, it directed him so, that at one blow he cut it off, out of whose blood <hi>Pegasus</hi> sprung forth.

in <hi>lib.</hi> 8. agree that this <hi>Scilla</hi> was the daughter of <hi>Nysus,</hi> King of the Megaren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, who surprised with the loue of King <hi>Mynos,</hi> stole from her fathers head that purple locke in which consisted the safetie of his owne life and kingdome. The Athenians hauing inuaded his dominion, and ceised many of his townes, and wasted the greatest part of his countrey by their fierce and bloody incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, they at length besieged him in the cittie Nysaea.

                           <l>Falls from the hin-decke of the ship, and thence sores through the Aire.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zenodorus</hi> saith, that she was hanged at the stearne of <hi>Minos</hi> his ship, and so dragged through the waters till she dyed: and that <hi>Scylla</hi> the daughter of <hi>Phor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> was a damsell of imcomparable beautie, and vitiated by <hi>Neptune,</hi> which knowne to <hi>Amphitrite,</hi> she cast such an inuenomous confection into the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine where she accustomed to bath her selfe, that it cast her into such a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that she drowned her selfe. Of his mind is <hi>Miro Prianaeus</hi> in his first booke <hi>Rerum Messanicarum.</hi> Others imagine, that she had mutuall consocietie with <hi>Glaucus</hi> the sea god, which <hi>Circe</hi> (who was before inamoured of him) vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, she sprinkled the well wherein she vse to laue her selfe with such ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous iuice, that from her wast downewards she was translated into diuers monstrous shapes; which as <hi>Zenodotus Cyrenaeus</hi> saith, was the occasion of the fable commented vpon her. <hi>Isacius</hi> thus describes her deformitie; She had six heads, the one of a canker-worme, the other of a dogge, a third of a Lyon, a fourth of a Gorgon, a fift of a whirle-poole or a whale, the sixt of a woman. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> in his <hi>Odissaees</hi> describes her with six heads, and twelue feet, euery head ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing three order of teeth. <hi>Virgill</hi> in <hi>Sileno</hi> saith, that all ships were wrackt and deuoured by those dugges that grew beneath her nauell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Charibdis.</hi> She was likewise a most deuouring woman, who hauing stolne many oxen from <hi>Hercules,</hi> which he before had taken from <hi>Gerion,</hi> was by <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> stroke with a thunderbolt, and so transformed into that monster of the sea; others contest, that she was slayne by <hi>Hercules,</hi> and after so transhapt: of these diuers are diuerslie opinionated. <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, that <hi>Homer</hi> imagined the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment flux and reflux of that sea about the concaues of those rockes made so terrible a noyse, that therefore the Poets fabulated, that in her sides, and about her interiour parts were the barkings of dogs continuallie heard. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacius</hi> writes, that <hi>Scilla</hi> is a proeminent promontorie ouer against Rhegium in Sicilie, hanging ouer the sea, vnder which are many huge and massie stones hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the billowes, in whose concauities many sea-monsters inhabit, and when there is shipping in those parts amongst those rockes and shelues, they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20365:27"/>
are either swallowed by <hi>Charibdis</hi> or <hi>Scylla. Charibdis</hi> being scituate directlie against Messana, and <hi>Scilla</hi> against Rhegium: they are therefore said to be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, because a far off these promontories appeare as it were in a feminine shape, what fleete soeuer by the tides and tempests was forc'd vpon <hi>Charibdis,</hi> were there shipwrackt, &amp; such as by <hi>Charibdis</hi> were tost on the rocks of <hi>Scilla</hi> were there swallowed. In which fable is included the nature of Vertue and Vice. No man but in the progresse of his life sailes betwixt these two quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fands: if he incline to one hand more than the other, he is either swallowed by <hi>Scilla,</hi> or deuoured by <hi>Charibdis.</hi> What else doth this signifie, but that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Aethicks illustrates, Vertue, which is the medium betwixt two extreames? both which are to be auoided, and the middle, wherein is safetie to be imbraced: for mans life is nothing else but a continuall nauigation betwixt diuers molestations of one hand, and tempting and vnlawfull pleasures on the other; both which are comprehended in these Syrtes, or places of certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. For <hi>Scilla</hi> is so called <hi>Ã  spoliando,</hi> or <hi>repando;</hi> of spoyling or grieuing; And <hi>Charibdis</hi> of sucking vp and swallowing; betwixt which two dangerous, and almost ineuitable gulfes, a vertuous and pious man shall in the greatest stormes and tempests (neither inclining to the right, nor the left) securelie, and with great safetie attaine vnto his wished harbour. Moreouer, where <hi>Scilla</hi> is said to be transhapt into this monster, by <hi>Circe,</hi> being so faire and beautifull a creature, What is it but to demonstrate vnto vs, that all such as digresse from reason, and the true institution of good life and manners, doe withall put on a bestiall and brutish shape, since <hi>Circe</hi> imports nothing els than a wanton tillation, inciting vs to immoderate and vnlawfull lusts and pleasures: and so much I guesse was intended by the Poets in these fables of <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis.</hi>

Ceselius Vindex</hi> he giues them three other names, <hi>Nona, Decima,</hi> and <hi>Morta;</hi> and cites this verse of <hi>Liuius,</hi> a most antient Poet,
<q>
                           <l>Quando dies venit quam praesata morta est.</l>
                           <l>When the day commeth that Morta hath presaged.</l>

                     <p>As much to say, <hi>Many come to their death whilst they feare it.</hi> They are sayd moreouer to measure the life of man with a spindle and thread which they spinne from their distaffe; from which they are called <hi>Lanificae</hi> by the Poets,

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaking of the face that is visible within the Orbe of the Moone, sayth some are of opinion that the soules of men are resolued into the Moone, as their bodies into the Earth: <hi>Aliquanto post tempore eas quoque ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas in se recepit Luna atquae composuit.</hi> 1. After some time the Moone receiues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her selfe those soules which she had before framed, restoring their mindes before lost: (for they are all in a dreame, like the soule of <hi>Endimion</hi>) and by coadiuting with the Seminarie and vitall powers of the Sunne, makes them as new soules. The <hi>Tetra,</hi> that is the number of Foure supplying the bodie: for she giues nothing after death, who receiues towards generation. The Sunne takes nothing from, but receiues againe the mind which he giues; the Moone both receiues and giues, and composeth or makes, and diuides; when shee makes, she is called <hi>Lucina;</hi> when shee deuides, <hi>Diana.</hi> So of the three <hi>Parcae, Atropos</hi> is placed about the Sunne, as the beginning of this new birth; <hi>Clotho</hi> is carried about the Sunne, to collect and mingle; <hi>Lachesis</hi> the last, her office is vpon the Earth: but these are riddles rather to trouble the braine than profit the vnderstanding. <hi>Parcae</hi> the mother of these three sisters, is said to bee the daughter of Necessitie: doubtles the Ethick writers held these to bee most powerfull goddesses, because all things borne, or that had subsistance, were thought to bee vnder their iurisdiction and power, and therefore they were imagined by some to bee the daughters of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Themis,</hi> because (as the Pithagorians taught) <hi>Ioue</hi> gaue to euerie one a bodie and forme suitable to the merits or misdeeds of their former life; or else because the diuine Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome allotted to euerie soule rewards or punishments, as their good deedes or badde deserued, the cause of which diuision the antient writers not truely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, appropriated all to Fate, and the <hi>Parcae.</hi>

The sacreds that were made to these, were by such as hauing escaped any dangerous desease, or pestilent sickenesse, had bin spared by the Fates; and their sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were onely done with a sad silence. The priests were called <hi>Hesichidae,</hi> of a HeroÃ« called <hi>Hesicho,</hi> to whom, before the solemnitie, a Ramme was still of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, as <hi>Polemo</hi> witnesseth in that worke he writ to <hi>Eratosthenes:</hi> It was held a prophanation (saith he) for any of the meaner sort of people to haue accesse to these ceremonies, onely to these <hi>Hesichides,</hi> whose familie was onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to these seuere goddesses, and in all their oblations had the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall prime place and precedence.

And (compendiously to shut vp all) the antient writers would by these signifie vnto vs, That to a good and just man only, all things are safe; &amp; that innocencie and integritie alone, make men feareles and constant against all the mutabilities of fortune, since the like tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mind, &amp; troubles of Conscience still attend on all such as are impure and dishonest.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE bodies of all reasonable creatures (as <hi>Ficinus</hi> saith) are naturallie pregnant, as hauing in them the seedes of is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, so likewise is the mind; both, still procreating and bringing forth: as we see at such a time the heire appeares; after, the teeth breake forth of the gummes; at such an age, the beard growes vpon the chinne, and in time alters and changes colour; and still the naturall faculties are in action. If then the body be so fertill, how much more is the nobler part of man, the Soule and the Mind, plentifullie furnisht with these seedes, that long for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction? as the instinct of manners, of arts, of disciplines, and such like, which are generated in the breast, and in their fit and due time haue their seasonable birth. For no sooner are we past the cradle, but we begin to affect few things good, honest, or profitable: but none at that age acquires after things vnknown. It is therefore a consequent, that there is borne with vs and bread in vs, certain notions of those outward things, the forms of which we apprehend, and their practise study to imitate. This euerie man, if he will but obserue, may by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience find in himselfe. For if we recollect our selues to apprehend any probleme or mysticall doubt, which is not within the compasse of our present capacitie; after deepe consideration and mature deliberation, all the barres and rubbes of our fantasie and sences being remooued, we retyre our selues into a more priuate and inward contemplation, and then most subtillie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning with our selues, we shall by degrees perceiue the clowd to vanish, and the truth appeare in full glorie and splendour. Therefore, when we present our selues vnto schoole-masters: the braine fashioneth in it selfe many Ideas, without rule or example, which like a rank and well manur'd field, hath in it the seedes and grounds of many fruitfull sciences; these if a skilfull man take in hand, bring oft times a croppe aboue expectation.

                     </note> and to commit vnto them the affaires of the Common-wealth, and such they called <hi>Amnemodes,</hi> or remembrancers. <hi>Alc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeon</hi> and some few others, call them the daughters of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Heauen. Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus</hi> in one of his Hymnes thus speakes to one of them, <hi>Incipe vero Coeli filia. Aristarcus</hi> and <hi>Mimnerca</hi> (if we may beleeue <hi>Eustathius</hi>) determine, that the <hi>Muses</hi> were before <hi>Iupiter,</hi> interpreting the word <hi>Musa,</hi> the <hi>knowledge of the soule,</hi> which is a thing no lesse diuine than the soule it selfe. To him <hi>Homer</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, calling it, <hi>The celeritie of knowledge. Plato</hi> in <hi>Cratilo</hi> deriues it from diligent search and inquisition, to whom <hi>Pharnutus</hi> in his booke intituled, Of the nature of the gods, subscribes. Of the same opinion is <hi>Suidas.</hi> They are therefore (saith he) deriued from Inquirie, being the originalls and causes of all sciences and disciplines: others, as <hi>Cassiodorus,</hi> because they conteine in them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie and concordance of arts: or (to conclude) as <hi>Diodorus</hi> writes, They were therefore called <hi>Musae,</hi> because they comprehend the art of modulation or tuning, with a consent or agreeing of all other disciplines. Diuers authors much differ about their number, <hi>Varro,</hi> as <hi>Seruius</hi> witnesseth of him, allowes onelie three, <hi>Ina,</hi> which is bred by the motion of the water; a second, begot by the sprinkling of the ayer; a third, meerelie arising from the sound of the voyce. <hi>Augustine</hi> speakes of a cittie, which <hi>Gyraldus</hi> names Sicion, the primates of which, of three seuerall famous worke-men bespake three effigies or images of the <hi>Muses,</hi> to bestow as a gift vpon the Temple of <hi>Apollo;</hi> and which of them could expresse the greatest art and most exquisite workemanship, he to be the best payd for his paines. It so hapned, that their three labours were equallie beautifull, and so esteemed, in so much that all the nine pieces pleasing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie, they were all bought and dedicated to the Temple. To euery of which, the Poet <hi>Hesiod</hi> after gaue a seuerall Embleme or Motto: Not (saith he) because <hi>Iupiter</hi> had begot nine Muses, but that three artificers had forged three apeece: and therefore the number of three; because it is easie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, that euerie sound which begets any materiall thing concerning musicke, is tripartite by nature: either it proceedes from the voyce simplie, as to those that sing without an instrument; or with the breath, as the Trumpet, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, or Sackbut; or by the stroakes, as the Lute, Harpe or Gitterne. The names of these statue-makers, <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, were <hi>Cephisodotus, Strongilio,</hi> and <hi>Olimpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osthines. Pausonias</hi> relates, that in times of old there were acknowledged no more than three, (by <hi>Oto</hi> and <hi>Ephialtes</hi> the sonnes of <hi>Aloeus</hi>) cald Meditation, Memorie, and Song or Musicke. <hi>Archestratus</hi> the Poet, affirmes as much; as also, that these two were the first that offered diuine sacrifice to the Muses, and imposed these names vpon them in Hellicon. Some authours will approue but two; others will make them vp foure, for the excellencie of the number, which the Pythagorists held to be so sacred, that by that (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> replyes) they vsed to sweare, <hi>Per quaternionem sacrum, qui animae nostrae tradi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those that made foure, as <hi>Cicero,</hi> or fiue, had reference to the auncient instruments of musicke then in vse, and which yeelded no more seuerall sounds. Those that approoued seauen, to the seauen liberall arts alluded the seauen Muses. But there are nine receiued and allowed amongst vs, and that for diuerse reasons; as first because the number of nine is held to be vertuall and perfect; being an euen foure, arising from a first odde; and then odlie to an odde: it is likewise deuided and distinguished into three equall oddes, then it consists of Triangulors, &amp;c.

                  <p>It may now lastly bee demaunded by those that are studious of antiquities, Why the Vertues, the Disciplines, the Muses, the Deuisers and Patrons of all good arts, with diuers of the like nature, should rather bee comprehended vnder the faeminine sexe, by the names of Virgins and women, as also their pictures drawne to the portraitures of damosells, than either by masculine nomination, or according to the effigies of men; the rather since not onely the Ethnickes and Morrall men, but euen Christians and Theologists themselues, in all their bookes and writings which they commit to posteritie continue them vnder the same gender? for who is ignorant that <hi>Sophia,</hi> which signifies Wisdome, was not from the beginning, and before the world; who is sayd to be the mother of the three Theologicall Vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charitie, and these represented as Women? why should the seuen liberall Arts, bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in Womens shapes? why the nine Muses bee the daughters of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> as all writers agree? Why is Wisdome called the Daughter of the highest, and not rather the Sonne, as witnesseth the booke of Wisdome? why <hi>Pallas,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise called <hi>Minerua,</hi> not the Sonne, but the Daughter of <hi>Ioue,</hi> (of whose braine she was borne?) and why the most curious and diligent inquisiters into these curiosities figure the liberal Arts and Disciplines like women and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like men? or by what reason the Muses should be personated rather like Damosells than young men, strenuous and excelling in masculine Vertue? To all these obiections, it is briefely answered by <hi>Lilius Gregorius,</hi> as likewise by <hi>Cornutus</hi> whom some cal <hi>Pharnutus;</hi> That by the symbole or semblance of such women, much science is begot, and besides much fruit ariseth from the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the soule: besides it was a custome of old for Virgins to play and daunce in companies, which excellently fitted the coupling and sisterhood of the sciences: these coherences are called by <hi>Martianus Capella, Ciclicae;</hi> from whence <hi>Vitruuius</hi> grounded his <hi>Euciclium:</hi> besides, the Greekes <hi>Euciclopaedia</hi> is frequent with <hi>Plinie, Plutarch</hi> and the rest: likewise in <hi>Beroaldus</hi> commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vpon the Golden Asse, he adds this one thing worthie obseruation, to the great honour and commendation of the feminine sex: the foure parts of the world haue their denominations from women. Asia was so called of the nymph <hi>Asia,</hi> from whom and <hi>Iaphethus, Prometheus</hi> descended; Europe, of <hi>Europa</hi> the daughter of <hi>Aegenor;</hi> Lybia, which is Africa, of <hi>Lybia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Epaphus;</hi> in like manner America (since discouered) beareth the like female figure: which (as <hi>Beroaldus</hi> saith) if the women of our age did fully apprehend and truely vnderstand, how insolently would they boast of their worth and dignitie? how would they glorie in vaine boasts and ostentations, how much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuall

                     <p>But it is next to be inquired what the ancient Poets chiefly intimated in this Nymph <hi>Clio:</hi> She is called the daughter of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and signifies Glorie. If it be lawfull therefore to acquire glorie, and to leaue the memorie of your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions to posteritie, farre be it we should seeke the daughter but from the father, or court her without his consent: who from the memorie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of a deed well done, deriues to vs a fame, in no age not to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. She is called <hi>Prima cogitation, i.</hi> The first thought of seeking knowledge: and because no mans meditations are about that by which he hath not a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to inlarge the dignitie of his owne name, therefore she is called the first of the Muses. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Simposaicon,</hi> diuides the nine Muses into two halfes: the one to gouerne and haue dominion ouer pastimes and pleasures, least any man should foolishlie and vnaduised fall vpon actions dishonest or vncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, stirring him vp with songs, dances, and sweet sounding instruments, to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous exercises; and reteining and keeping him backe from lusts, both vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pernitious: the other diuision incourages vs, to actions difficult, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires serious and of import; and these are <hi>Clio, Calliope,</hi> and <hi>Thalia:</hi> for all things ought to be done in that <hi>Symmetria</hi> and due proportion of mediocritie, that in our sports we slide not into lusts, and in things serious westumble not at the morositie and peeuishnesse of age. She had two sonnes, <hi>Ialmus</hi> and <hi>Himenaeus,</hi> men of two sundry lots and conditions; the one in no place, but where there was ejulation and mourning; the other where there was euer sport, myrth, banquets, and nuptiall ioyes.

                     <p>EVery man hath his pleasures and delights, as well wise men as fooles: there is no man of so seuere a grauitie or austere a condition (no not <hi>Timon</hi> him selfe) whose nature is not mollified, and made more tractable with the delight of some one thing or other. One is much pleased with horses of good stomacke, another with dogges of excellent sent or swiftnesse, some with wealth, others with honour, and so of the rest; and thus we passe through the pilgrimage of a life full of infelicities and calamities, with the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ease by pondering some such things in our minds, in which we take the greatest pleasure and comfort. Neither are the wise men without this alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, being sometimes extaside in the contemplation of things sublime and high. <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Philebis</hi> (saith he) <hi>As the imtemperat man takes pleasure, so doth the temperat man in his temperance; As the foole is delighted in his foolish opinions and vaine hopes, so is the wise man in his wisedome and constant purposes; but that their contents are different and of contrarie qualities, no man makes question.</hi> The wise man therefore and the vnwise haue both their pleasures, but so farre pre-excelling is the one, as the other is vile, abiect, and contemptible: for the one is gorged and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted with his delicacies, euen to loathing and vomit; the other, inebriated or rather quickned and inspired with the sprightly nectar of contemplation, flyes into the celcitude and maiestie of things inscrutable: neither conteines he himselfe within the narrow and straight empire of this vniuerse, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires things aboue capacitie, and transcending nature; for incited with the deepe studie of metaphysicall philosophy, he striues euen to trace the steps of the infinite maiestie, though it be confest that this ambition of his is both foolish and arrogant, yet is it daring, and noble, that not satisfied with the knowledge of humble and terrhene things, pierceth deeper, and aymeth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, till it attaine that perfection of height, that the mind or vnderstanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled, may stoppe at the farthest, as there hauing fixt <hi>non vltra.</hi> But this small digression, being of <hi>Euterpe,</hi> which word implyes nothing els but <hi>true delectation</hi> or <hi>delight,</hi> I hope hath not beene much impertinent. <hi>Hesiod</hi> cals her the second Muse in order, and the daughter of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and Memorie. <hi>Neanthes</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>Rerum Graecarum,</hi> calls her the mother of <hi>Themistocles</hi> but <hi>Amphicrates</hi> in his tractat of illustrious men,<note place="margin">

harpe (the pipe of which <hi>Euterpe</hi> was the first deuiser) were held in great esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and honour: these be his words, <hi>As in times of old to play vpon the harpe at meetings and banquets, or the like instruments, was held laudable and honest; so eyther to deny it, or haue no skill in it, was an opprobry and scandall. Lycurgus,</hi> though he instituted most hard and seuere lawes ouer the Lacedemonians, yet the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of musicke he did both allow and highly commend, as a sollace by which the troublesome burden of labour and trauell might be the easilier transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Fauius</hi> saith, that songs cheere the gally-slaue at his oare, and the pipe though not exquisitelie playd vpon, yet the modulation is comfortable to such as are ouertrauelled. The first vse of pipes amongst the Greekes was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certaine great victories atchieued, where they were in great opinion of themselues; but they were after relinquisht in Athens, either because they were held as inciters to wanton meetings, or because they raysed a kind of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comelinesse and deformitie in the faces of such as playd vpon them. Of these pipes there were diuers kinds, That which was made of the Lote-tree, was called <hi>Plagiauton;</hi> that of the Box tree, <hi>Elimon;</hi> that of the Lawrell tree, <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbon; Monantus</hi> was likewise made of the Lote-tree, and most vsed at nuptials, which was called also <hi>Pholingia.</hi> The pipe nam'd <hi>Libis,</hi> called by some <hi>Matroa,</hi> was that which was solelie attributed to the inuention of <hi>Euterpe,</hi> though some bestow it on the mother of the gods. The Tyrhenes vsed pipes of horne; the Thebanes made theirs of the shankebones of Hynd calfes; the Celtae, of reeds; the Islanders of the Ocean (as the Scithae, the Antropagi, and Armaspians) of the legge bones of Eagles and Vultures; the Aegyptians pipe called <hi>Polypthon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> is composed of the stalkes of Barlie. There be as seuerall sorts of this kind of instrument, as it is vsed amongst sundrie nations and places. Certaine it is, though her inuention was but poore and wretched at the beginning, yet it increased miraculouslie: for almost no nation but sung their songs, oades, ditties and hymnes, to seuerall sorts of wind instruments; but especiallie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Germanes in Europe they were in the most frequent vse, from whom they had the name of <hi>Tybiae.</hi> The interpreters of <hi>Appollonius</hi> and <hi>Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> affirme that she first inuented the Mathemata, or disciplines: others, that she was much practised in Logicke.

                     <p>IT is a position, That the lawfull <hi>Platouicke</hi> banquet doth refresh both the body and the mind: such a one exprest <hi>Athenaeus</hi> in his <hi>Dipnosophistae;</hi> which signifies <hi>Cenaesapientum, A supper or feast of Wise men,</hi> which is a discourse at table, both of pleasure and profit; and of such is the Muse <hi>Thalia</hi> ladie and mistresse. For there is nothing that doth better delight the body, refresh the mind, or make cheerefull the countenance, than a banquet of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purpose. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, That man is composed of a body (which is an earthie masse consisting of spirit humour) and of a mind which includes two things, namelie Sence and Reason, from which all honest pleasure doth arise and flow, if it be temperatelie and moderatelie gouerned. And <hi>Galen</hi> saith, That in a modest and well disposed banquet, all these occurre and meete: For who knowes not, but by such meanes the members are nourisht, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours renewed, the spirit refresht, and the reason after a sort watered? By this we haue a cessation from labour, a retyrement from care; for the body, sollace; for the braine, incouragement. Take away the hillarities and mirth of feasting and banquetting; the nutriment of loue, the communitie of friendship, and the sollace of life, is by such a restraint opprest, and by degrees adnichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: for the communion and societie of life, is the scope at which moderate banquets ayme, and not the lauish inuitation to healthing and intemperate drinking: which <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Symposiacis</hi> seemes to approoue in these words, speaking of the Muse <hi>Thalia: For that which belongs to surplusage of meate, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie of drinke, concernes not</hi> Thalia, <hi>who makes a man sociable in his banquets, who otherwise of his owne condition is churlish and froward.</hi> Therefore is <hi>Thalia</hi> deriued of <hi>Caliazein,</hi> which as the Greekes giue the etimologie is <hi>Conuenire,</hi> to meete according to appointment, well and contentedlie to please the pallat, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the appetite, and not to gormondise and exceede in surfet. Therefore the counsell of <hi>Varro</hi> is, that all such banquetters be either musicall or learned, and not to exceede the number of the Graces, or the Muses at most. From such a feast are to be excluded all such as are full of spleene, or prone to anger: but such whose affabilitie is smoth, and apt for the time and place, voyde of all loquacitie, and superfluous language, that rather sweeten than distast the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; let such be welcome guests to her table: but the gluttenous and fat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> let them be as hatefull as cates saust with poyson, and such belly gods appeare to thee as dogges and serpents. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charmus Comicus</hi> saith, that this Muse is the most of all the rest fauourable and gracious to Poets, because they loue to meete familiarlie and fare daintilie, to expell sorrow as they would doe shame, and melancholie as they would doe madnesse: and this they doe with an <hi>Antipharmacum,</hi> composed of neat and briske wine, which doth smooth and enlighten a wrinkled and clowdie counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for <hi>Thalia</hi> will at no time suffer a Poet to droupe in spirit, or his fame to wither,<note place="margin">

without brawles or riot; or lastly (as others will haue it) in regard the Poets fame once deseruedlie got, shall outlast time and liue with eternitie. Many bestow on her the inuention of the Comedie; some make her the first teacher of Agriculture; and others, to be the mother of <hi>Palephatus,</hi> who writ much concerning plantation and inoculating, besides fiue bookes <hi>Incredibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or things past beliefe. Therefore, the papers of <hi>Palephatus</hi> grew into an adage or prouerbe, because his bookes had no credit giuen vnto them. Much is spoken of him by <hi>Coelius</hi> in his <hi>Antiquae Lection:</hi>

Therefore it was the custome in all the Tragedyes of old, to annexe to the end of euerie act, a Chorus, with some sad and mournfull song: and the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer they grew to the catastrophe or conclusion, the songs were set to the more passionate tunes, and soong with the more sorrowfull accent, expressing an augmentation of griefe both in countenance and gesture. Some of the great Authors conferre vpon her the inuention of Rhetorick, of which opinion was <hi>Pharnutus,</hi> who doth etimologise <hi>Melpomene,</hi> from <hi>Molpe,</hi> which signifies the Sweetenesse of the voice: for one of the chiefest ornaments in an Orator is first Action, then a constancie in Voyce, Motion, &amp; Gesture beseeming and comly.

                     <p>Of Daunces there be sundrie kindes; some tooke name from the song, and such was called <hi>Emmeleia,</hi> that was held to be Tragicall: a second, was called <hi>Cordax Comica,</hi> or a countrie daunce; of such <hi>Arriamnus</hi> in his Indian commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries remembers vs: some bestow the inuention of such vpon the Satires, others affirme that <hi>Bacchus</hi> by his Orgyan leapings or daunces, brought the Tyrhenians, the Indians and Lidians, all warlike nations, to his subiection: Therefore those that were called <hi>Siccinastae,</hi> they conferre on him or some of his fellowes and adherents, though the Sicinni were the people of Creete, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom that kind of measure was most celebrated. In what estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20365:40"/>
these were of old, may be easily imagined, when no sacrifice was offered at Delos, but daunces were the chiefe in all their superstitious ceremonies. The Brachmani, a people of India, morning and euening in their adoration of the Sunne, frequently vse them. Amongst the Aechiopians, the Thratians, the Aegyptians, the Scythians, their sacreds are not solemnised without them, as first instituted by <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Musaeus.</hi> Some daunc't in the honour of <hi>Mars.</hi> The Lacedemonians had them in continuall practise, so likewise the Thessali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: in so much that the most wise <hi>Socrates</hi> after hee was growne in yeares practised to daunce, and not only gaue such exercises an extraordinarie chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of commendations, but numbered them amongst the best sciences. These daunces were not in custome without musicke, especially in their feastiualls and sacrifices; for the boyes or young men went in the first place, some play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon harps and pipes, and others selected for the daunces: whose custome was, as they tripped and skipped about the altar, they first proceeded so, that from the left hand they might incline to the right, to obserue the course of the Zodiacke; and againe from the right hand turne to the left, to imitate the motion of the <hi>Primum mobile. Pindarus</hi> calls <hi>Apollo, Orcheste,</hi> that is, <hi>Salcator,</hi> a dauncer. <hi>Plato</hi> in his first booke <hi>de Legam latione,</hi> sayth that the first ground of learning proceeded from the works of <hi>Apollo</hi> and the Muses; holding that man vntutered and ignorant that was not practised in the measures of the Muses, and him accomplisht and best instructed that could tread them with the best agilitie and cunning. By which it may be concluded, that these Choreae were begot by musicke, and fetcht from the very intrails of number vsed in verse (which some of <hi>Rithmus,</hi> call Rime) and from other Ethick obseruations: therfore some attribute to her the inuention of that which we call <hi>Humanitatis Disciplina,</hi> wihch signifies, The discipline of humanitie. By the sonne of <hi>Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> shee had the Syrenes (though <hi>Fulgentius</hi> calls them the daughters of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liope</hi>) and by <hi>Mars, Bistone,</hi> of whom the countrie is called Bistonia: shee is therefore rankt in the fift place, and sayd, <hi>Chorcis delectari,</hi> because it is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and delight to the Auditors, for the benefits they receiued by hearing the mysteries of learning and knowledge manifested &amp; layd open vnto them: as if we should say <hi>Terpsichore,</hi> is a <hi>delight in instruction;</hi> or, <hi>to take a felicitie to be instructed. Fulgentius</hi> will haue <hi>Polimnia</hi> to take place before her, his reason is, because after inuention or much memorie (which is <hi>Polihimnia</hi>) it is then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to judge and determine of that which was before deuised and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Cornutus</hi> sayth that good men transmit the best and greatest part of their liues in delectation and ioy; or else that they bring pleasure and content to all such with whom they shall conuerse: of which delight this Muse is the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Others thinke she was so called, because she was so pleasing to the soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of the rest of her sisters: but whence soeuer shee had that name bestowed vpon her, it was neither idle nor vnmomentarie; the fable of this Muse thus much insinuating, That part of the Muses are intentiue onely vpon serious and sollid matters, as Philosophie, the Mathematicks, and the like: the rest vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on recreation, sports, and pastimes. By which the ancients would teach vs, That it is not possible, but hee that hath spent most of his age and studie vpon <hi>Calliope</hi> and <hi>Vrania,</hi> but shall in that knowledge be most ioyfull, and filled with all manner of delectation: which pleasure and content they signified by daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, musick, and banquets.</p>

                     <p>IN <hi>Platos</hi> Sanctuaries it is left recorded, that <hi>Amor,</hi> which is loue, in Greeke called <hi>Erota,</hi> which is the name of the Muse of whom wee are now to speake (and by him called the voice of <hi>Venus</hi>) is knowne to be nothing else by such as truely vnderstand, than the desire of beautie; of which <hi>Plotinus</hi> makes a threefold distinction, it is either in the Mind, begot by vertue, and that is called <hi>Venustas,</hi> which may extend to a gracefull pleasantnes in speech, or delectable vtterance; or in the Bodie, of the lineaments and colour mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the greatest congruitie, and that is called <hi>Decus,</hi> which is comlinesse or a sweetenesse of proportion; the last is the concordance and pleasantnesse of sounds, which comprehends in it an excellent, though inuisible fairenesse or pulchritude.</p>
                     <p>This threefold beautie hath three sences subseruient or agreeing; The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior eye of the Mind; The sight of the Bodie; and the Eare, accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and apt for the entertaining of sounds. Banisht therefore from the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie and perfection of <hi>Platos</hi> loue are all the inflamations of fierie lust, and titillations of vnlawfull pleasure. Euen <hi>Socrates,</hi> who by the Delphick Oracle was iudged the wisest of his time, profest himselfe a seruant of this loue. In Athens as oft as any sacreds were made to <hi>Pallas,</hi> so oft were they to the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Loue, which was placed in the same Temple. In the popular ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Loue was honoured of all men. The Lacedemonians (before they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted or encountered the forteine enemie) made their oblations to Loue, as if hee had the power to giue them both safetie and victorie. The band or companie, which among the Thebans was called Sacred, consisted on Louers, and such as were beloued. They had besides, a schoole or an Accademie dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Loue. <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Phedra,</hi> proclaimed Loue to bee a god, and miraculous both with gods and men, as it is in his <hi>Simposi. Loue is a great god, and wonderfull both to men and gods; and besides many other things, especially for his generation and birth.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hesiod</hi> speaking in his <hi>Theogonia,</hi> sayth that Chaos was first made, then Earth and Hell next created, and immediately after them, Loue; this is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in an allegoricall sence, and mysticall and obscured: for he doth not by Loue vnderstand the sonne of <hi>Venus,</hi> for how can he be borne when his mother was not yet come into the world. We must vnderstand another Loue more ancient, which is significant in the name of this Muse called <hi>Erato;</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hesiod</hi> defines him borne of Chaos and the Earth. Of the same opinion is <hi>Diuus Dionisius Arreopagita,</hi>

                        </note> for thus he sayth, <hi>Loue, whether you tearme it diuine or angellicall or spirituall, liuely, according to creatures, or naturall; you must vnderstand an inherent and commixt vertue which doth insinuate or intice the superior things to the inferiour, which doth reconcile things equall amongst themselues; making them sociable, and equally communicating, and lastly doth pleasantly prouoke such things as are infinite, to be conuerted to matters more sublime and greatlier to be desired; that like things combustible added to fire alreadie kindled, may make them sparkle and burne afresh.</hi> Worthie hee is no doubt, who is commended of all men, not onely for the nobilitie of his birth, but the antiquitie of his house, as is obserued from <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;</hi> but great must he needes be of force, to whose Empire both gods and men are subiected.</p>
                     <p>Hee is besides to bee wondred at for his shape and feature, because euerie
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20365:41"/>
man admires that beautie which he best loues. Lastly, he is to be commended, and Encomiastickes to be sung in his praise, for the vtilitie and profit that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from him. Therefore from those before vs, for his nobilitie: from these present with vs, for his magnitude and potencie: and from those that shall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede and come afer vs, for the expected vtilitie, this Loue is to be held in great honour and adoration. But the opinion of <hi>Ouid</hi> doth no way assent with the words of <hi>Hesiod,</hi> who saith, <hi>Nunc Erato &amp; tu nomen amoris habes;</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the sonne of <hi>Venus</hi> from the foresaid antiquitie; by which he would make him much more elder than his mother. But to speake according to the Greeks, it is deliuered vnto vs by them, that <hi>Erato</hi> was the mother of <hi>Thamira,</hi> she that was the first Inuentresse of the Amatorious poem (or loue verses.) The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians will not allow <hi>Erato</hi> in the number of the Muses, onely they giue her the character of a prophetesse, who was married to <hi>Archas</hi> the sonne of <hi>Calisto</hi> begot by <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and that she was the first publisher of <hi>Pans</hi> Oracles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Patroclus</hi> that commented vpon <hi>Hesiod</hi> conferres vpon her the inuention of Poesie; but the Poet himselfe sayth, that shee first deuised dauncing: as may appeare by that which I haue before interpreted.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Plectra gerens Erato saltat pede, carmine vultu.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Some of the Greeke authors allow her dauncing, others musicke. <hi>Pharnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> writes, that shee was so called from demanding and resoluing, which is (more plainely) from questions and answers, which two are much frequent amongst disputants. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> deriues her from the inuention of Similies, because that after Science and Memorie, is requisit that we deuise something resembling that which we haue learned. To conclude therefore: <hi>Erato</hi> is a certaine Loue borne by nature, which the wise men receiued from the gods. Or (to speake according to <hi>Ariopagita</hi>) a certaine institution by which <hi>Socrates,</hi> being eleuated, and (as it were) rap't into an higher element, soong and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his diuine mysteries: before which time (as hee hath of himselfe deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) hee was altogether ignorant of things Superior or Inferior, Coelestiall or Infernall. Therefore with <hi>Erato</hi> I thus conclude, The force of Loue is in all creatures miraculous, but in man especially.</p>

By the same reason we place one of the</hi> Muses <hi>in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and about coelestiall things, which is</hi> Vrania: <hi>for that which is aboue hath no need of diuersitie of gouernment, hauing one vniuersall directresse, which is Nature: where ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be many errors, excesses, &amp; transgresses, there the eight remaining are to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (and one particular Muse still reserued) one to correct this fault, and another that. Vrania</hi> therefore (according to <hi>Plutarch</hi>) hath predominance in things coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which by how much they are aboue things terrestriall in excellence, they are so much the more difficult. Some stretch the influence of the starres to <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riasta's</hi> magicke, in which he was popularlie famous, nay more, his name by that art enobled: notwithstanding, the annalls testifie that he was subdued and slaine in battell by <hi>Ninus.

Howbeit by these instances it is not to be inferred as the mysticallest and powerfull part of the Mathematicall desciplines. The inuentions of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilius</hi> most indirectlie conferres it vpon <hi>Mercury. Plato in Epinomide,</hi> would haue all that contemplate Astrologie, to begin in their youth; such is the excellencie of the art, and the difficultie to attaine vnto it: for these be his words, <hi>Be not ignorant that Astrologie is a most wise secret:</hi> for it is necessarie, that the true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomer be not that man (according to <hi>Hesiod</hi>) that shall onelie consider the rising and setting of the starres, but rather, that hath a full inspection into the eight compasses, or circumferences, and how the seauen are turned by the first, and in what order euery starre mooues in his owne spheare or circle: in which he shall not find any thing which is not miraculous.

And since Poetrie comes not by fortune, nor can be attained to by art, it must consequentlie be a gift from the gods and Muses. For when <hi>Plato</hi> names the god, he intends <hi>Appollo;</hi> when the Muses, he vnderstands the soules of the spheares: for <hi>Iupiter</hi> is the mind of the deitie, who extasies and illuminates <hi>Appollo, Appollo</hi> the Muses, the Muses the Poets, the Poets inspire their interpreters, the interpreters make impression in the Auditours.

Antient likewise is Poesie, whose inuention is giuen to <hi>Calliope,</hi> as to the Championesse that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the standard of the Muses. Besides <hi>Orpheus,</hi> some say she had two other sons, <hi>Ialmus</hi> and <hi>Hymenaeus,</hi> of whom we spake before. <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> was beloued of <hi>Thamiras,</hi> who was the first Poetiser of vnchast venerie.

But now to search what was chieflie aymd at by the Poets in this Muse <hi>Calliope:</hi> It appeares that by her they apprehended the sweetnesse and modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of song, as taking her denomination <hi>Ã  bona voce,</hi> of a good and tunable cleere voice; therefore she is called <hi>Vox deae clamantis,</hi> The voyce of the calling goddesse; from which they gaue her the dominion ouer the persuasiue art of Rhetoricke and Poetrie. The generall tractat of the Muses, ayming onelie at this, That the first thing requisite, is to haue a will to knowledge and learning; the second, to be delighted in that will; the third, to be constant in that wee delight; the fourth, to attaine to that in which wee are constant; the fift, to commemorate that which we haue attained; the sixt, to make similitude and compare what we haue commemorated; the seauenth, to iudge of those likes which we haue made and compared; the eighth, to make elections of such things as thou hast iudged; the last, eloquentlie to speake, and facundiouslie to delate of that thing of which before thou hast made election.

ioy, pleasure, content, and delectation.</p>
                     <p>A word or two of the Muses in generall, and so conclude with them. They are held to be the soules of the Spheares: <hi>Vrania,</hi> of the starrie Heauen, and of that spheare which is called <hi>Aplanes; Polyhimnia,</hi> of <hi>Saturne; Terpsichore,</hi> of <hi>Iupiter; Clio,</hi> of <hi>Mars; Melpomene,</hi> of the Sonne; <hi>Erato,</hi> of <hi>Venus; Euterpe,</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; Thalia,</hi> of <hi>Luna.</hi> These eight Muses are referred to the eight Tones of the spheares; from all which <hi>Calliope,</hi> not till now named amongst them, ariseth and is begot; these being neere to the body that is first mooued, which is said to be next to the seat of the supreame deitie, are said by <hi>Hesidus</hi> to daunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Altar of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> But because diuerse and sundry are the studies of these Muses, therefore by their influence the minds of mortall men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with sundry and diuerse delectations, which (as the Pythagorians thinke) descend downe vpon them from these spheares. Those ouer whom the Moone hath predominance, participate of the nature of <hi>Thalia,</hi> and are therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with comick lasciuiousnesse and wantonnesse. Those whom the spheare of <hi>Saturne</hi> gouernes, or <hi>Polyhimnia,</hi> being of a drie and cold tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are wondrous retentiue in the remembrance of things long past. For the dispositions of the mind, and constitutions of the body, haue a conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the nature of that planet vnder which they were borne: therefore some are delighted with one study, some another, according to the aspects of the planet. For example, if <hi>Mercury</hi> be in a good and pleasing aspect, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets eloquence, facunditie, and elegancie of speech, besides skill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in many things, but especiallie in the Mathematicks: the same being in coniunction with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> they are bred Philosophers and Diuines: beeing ioyn'd with <hi>Mars</hi> in his happy aspect, it makes men skilfull Physitians and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; but in his bad aspect, such as prooue vnskilfull, vnluckie, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times theeues and robbers, which commonlie happens when he is scorcht with the planet of the Sunne. Being in coniunction with <hi>Venus,</hi> thence proceedes Musitians and Poets; ioyn'd with <hi>Luna,</hi> warie merchants, and diligent and thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie husbands; with <hi>Saturne,</hi> it infuseth men with prediction and prophesie. But let this little serue to illustrate the rest, so from the Muses we come to the Sybells.</p>

The Magi among the Persians had many assemblies of purpose onely to augurate and to diuine: but all such are condemned of ignorance and want of art, who presage meerely by concitation and rapture, without the helpe of reason and coniecture. <hi>Sagire</hi> signifies to perceiue acutely or sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; therefore they are called Sagaces that know much: he that is sayd <hi>Sagire, viz.</hi> to know, before things come to passe, is sayd <hi>Presagire</hi> that is to presage. It is called Diuination when it extends to a higher degree of prediction. But when by diuine instinct (as in the <hi>Sibells</hi>) the minde is as it were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and extaside in rapture, it is then called <hi>Fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The messenger hauing made his Orisons, offered sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and presented gifts according to the custome of the place, petitioned for an answere to his vnknowne request, and so layd him downe to sleepe by the altar: in the morning being throughly awake, he remembered himselfe of a vision that appeared vnto him; it seemed vnto him that he saw one of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells</hi> standing before the altar, who onely spake to him this word, <hi>Nigrum,</hi> (a blacke) and so vanisht.

But <hi>Thamus</hi> thus resolued, that if the wind stood faire, he would not alter his course, but passe the Island, but otherwise he would deliuer the message according as he was inioyned.

There was in those daies an antient and much adored altar, sacred to <hi>Apollo,</hi> to which the Aeolaes and the Ionians in all their hesitations repaired for counsell; it was scituate in the Milesian fields, neere to the port called Panormus: to this place were sent men both of birth and trust, to demand from the Cumae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Whether <hi>Pactias</hi> should bee deliuered vnto the Persians? who answered, <hi>Let him be surrendered vp:</hi> which when the men of Cuma heard, they with a ioynt sufferage concluded to send him thence, and to obey the Oracle. To which decree, <hi>Aristodicus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Heraclius</hi> violently opposed himselfe (a man amongst the rest at that time most illustrious) either not giuing credit at all to the answere, or distrusting their fidelitie that brought it: therefore hee himselfe with other of the prime citisens prepared themselues for a second expedition; these repairing to the Branchidae or Priests, of which this <hi>Cumaea</hi>

was one; <hi>Aristodicus</hi> humblie kneeling before the altar, thus bespake <hi>Apollo, Pactyas</hi> the Lidian (oh king, and god) to shunne a violent death, gaue himselfe into our patronage, the Persians redemaund him of the Cumaeans; we, though we feare not their forces, yet dare not surrender vp a suppliant to death, who hath tendred his safetie into our hands, till wee heare from thee what in this destraction is most fit to be done. To these words, the Priest as from <hi>Apollo</hi> returned this answere: Let <hi>Pactias</hi> be deliuered vp to the Persians. This done, <hi>Aristodicus</hi> it seemes not well pleased to betray the life of his friend, surueying the Temple round, he spyde where sparrows and other small birds had builded their neasts, who taking away their young was about to depart the Temple: when instantly was heard from the altar, the sound of a voice thus speaking; Oh thou most wicked of men, what arrogant boldnesse hath so far possest thee that thou presumest to take hence my suppliants, and such as I haue taken to my protection? at which words <hi>Aristodicus</hi> returning, made this free and bold answere, Doest thou (oh king) succour and protect thy suppliants, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest vs to betray the life of <hi>Pactias</hi> to the Persians?</p>
                     <p>Some haue cauelled with these Oracles that their verses haue bin harsh, and not in smoothnesse of stile or elegancie of phrase to be compared with those of <hi>Hesiod</hi> or <hi>Homer:</hi> to which may be answered, We are sicke with the disease of the Eare and the Eye; let vs not blame a Pythian Prophetesse because shee sings not so sweetly as <hi>Glauce</hi> the mynstrell, nor appears in her heire perfumed with pretious vnguents, and her selfe ietting in Tyrian purple; when the Sybel vtters her diuinations with a troubled braine, and a destracted countenance, her words harsh and vnpleasant, as not rellishing laughter, delight, or orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for such things are least pleasing to vs in shew that are most beneficiall to vs in proofe, <hi>Voluptatem enim, non admittit quod integrum &amp; castum,</hi> That ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no pleasure which of it selfe is perfect and chast.

Of this Sybells particular actions, much hath not beene commended to posteritie: onely of her person, that such a one there was; and of her prophesie, which was thought to be this:

                     </p>
                     <p>It is likely, and may be coniectured, that she came to the light of <hi>Elias</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, for in the like manner he distributed the world, diuining of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of mankind, and the change of times: the first two thousand yeares he called <hi>Tempus inane,</hi> which may be thus interpreted, because the many regions of the earth were not fullie inhabited, Babylon not yet built, and diuers spati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prouinces vndiscouered: or else because the polliticke estate of the Church was not yet visiblie established, and separated from other nations: For then were no Empires extant, which after were apparant in the Monarchies. Yet doubtlesse it is, that the first age was the golden and most flourishing; because the nature of man was then most potent and vigorous, as may appeare by their longeuitie, liuing so many hundred yeares: moreouer, it bred many wise old men, full of the diuine light, that spake of God, of the Creation, and were witnesse of the arts and sciences. The second times was numbered from the Circumcision to Christs comming in the flesh, and being borne of a Virgin; which conteiues little lesse than two thousand yeares, and that is vnder the

Lawe. The third Time, if it reach not to the full number to equall the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it is for our sinnes, which are many and great, for which mankind shall be the sooner destroy'd, and Christ for his elect sake will hasten his iudgement.</p>

                     <p>Of these Wonders briefly, to make her diuination the more plaine. Of these Pyramides there were diuerse,<note place="margin">That 60000 men were 20 yeares in building.</note> of which the greatest tooke vp eight acres of ground, parted into foure angles, each equally distant eight hundred eightie foot, and in heigth twentie fiue. A second, foure angles, euerie one containing by euen spaces seuen hundred thirtie and seuen foot. A third, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended three hundred sixtie three foote betwixt euerie angle. A fourth, errected by <hi>Rhodope</hi> the strumpet, the mistresse of <hi>Aesop,</hi> by the money which she got by her trade. <hi>Herodotus</hi> speakes of a Pyramis made by <hi>Cleopys</hi> king of Aegypt, of stones fetcht from Arabia, whose length was fiue furlongs, the breadth ten paces. He erected a second more magnificent, which was not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht in twentie yeares, vpon which he spent so much treasure, that hee was forc't to prostitute his daughter, a most beautifull young virgin, to supply his owne necessitie. <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, that in this structure he impolyed so many workemen, that they eate him 1800 talents in onyons and garlicke. 2. The tower of Pharos, built by <hi>Ptolomaeus,</hi> in that Isle, which serued as a lanthorne to direct nauigators by sea in the night: he spent vpon it 5300 Talents: <hi>Sostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> was the Architectour, as appeares by the inscription of his name vpon the Cittadell. 3. The wals of Babylon were built by <hi>Semiramis,</hi> they were (as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modorus</hi> writes) in thicknesse fiftie cubits, in heighth two hundred, within the compasse of which were an hundred Ports, hauing brasen gates, that all moou'd vpon hinges; they were beautified with three hundred Turrets, and Chariots might meete vpon the toppe of them, and haue free passage without impediment. 4. The Temple of Diana, of which I haue spoken before, was in length 425 foote, in breadth 220: It was beautified with 127 Collumns. 5. The tombe of <hi>Mausolus,</hi> built by <hi>Artimesia</hi> queene of Caria, was in height 25 Cubits: it was compast with 36 collumns: it contained from the South to the North 33 foote, the whole compasse contained 1411; That part which lay towards the East, was perfected by <hi>Scopas;</hi> that which was towards the North, was ended by <hi>Briax;</hi> that towards the Meridian, by <hi>Tymothaus;</hi> that which butted vpon the West, by <hi>Leocares.</hi> 6. The Colossus of the Sun, which bestrid the riuer Rhodes (betwixt whose legges shippes without vailing their top sailes came into the harbour) was of that vastnesse, that a man with his spread armes could not compasse his thumbe, euery finger being as bigge as a common statue. After it had stood six and fiftie yeares it was emolisht by an earthquake. The Souldan of Aegypt hauing inuaded Rhodes, with the broken brasse thereof laded thence 900 cammells. The chiefe workeman was <hi>Chares Lindius,</hi> the scholler of <hi>Licippus.</hi> 7. The image of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> to which some equall the pallace of <hi>Cyrus</hi> king of the Meades, built by <hi>Memnon,</hi> the stones of which were simmented together with gold. But I leaue further to speake of these, and proceed to the next Sybill.</p>

In the same volume she prophesied of Christ, after this manner:

The words he vsed were these, This vestall Priest, whom I enter into this holy office, according to the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20365:54"/>
institution of the best law, I receiue by the name of <hi>Amata,</hi> to make her inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions for the Nobilitie and people of Rome. It was a custom to admit them all by the name of <hi>Amata,</hi> because she that was first chosen by king <hi>Numa</hi> was so called; and with these ceremonies shee was as it were hurried to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Vesta.</hi> In <hi>Labeons</hi> commentaries it is thus found recorded, <hi>The Vestall vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is incapable to be made heire of any man or woman that dies intestate: her goods like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise after her death returne to the common treasurie. Pomponius Latus</hi> in his booke <hi>de Sacerdotijs,</hi> agrees with <hi>Fenestella,</hi> That <hi>Aeneas</hi> first brought the Vestal fire from Troy into Italy: and Lauinium being built, he there erected a Temple to her honour. After this, <hi>Ascanius</hi> consecrated another in a part of the hill Alba: beneath which, or at the foote thereof, was a thick groue, in which <hi>Mars</hi> viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>Illia</hi> the mother of <hi>Romulus.</hi> These Ministers of <hi>Vesta</hi> were tied to an oath of perpetuall virginitie: for it was a custome amongst the Latines, to make choice of the most noble and chast virgins. After many yeres <hi>Romulus</hi> deuised all the chast ceremonies belonging to that Order: and as <hi>Varro</hi> declares to vs, created three score Priests to those publique seruises, selected by their Tribes and Families, but of the most noble &amp; vnblemisht stocks amongst the Romans. The temple of <hi>Vesta</hi> is built round, and is scituat betwixt the Capitoll and the Pallace: in this is kept the perpetuall Fire; for the Etimologie of <hi>Vesta</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but <hi>purus ignis, i.</hi> pure Fire. Some are of opinion that in that Temple are kept the remenbrances of many both sacred and secret monuments, some strange and vnknowne euen to the Priests and Virgins. Some speake of two toonnes of no great quantitie, the one continually shut, the other open &amp; emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: some of the Virgins haue reported that the Palladium that fell from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and was receiued into Troy, is there still to be seene. The first Virgins ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>Numa,</hi> were foure, <hi>Gegania, Berenia, Camilla, Tarpeia,</hi>

                     </note> two others were added by <hi>Seruius Tullius.</hi> Their vowes of virginitie were vnalterable for thirtie yeares. In the first ten yeares, they were to learne the ceremonies, and to be as ministers and handmaides: in the rest she was to gouerne and instruct others; and the thirtie yeares expired, she had libertie (if she pleased) to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. If any of these <hi>Vestalls</hi> had wantonly offended, she was to bee chastised by the Priest: but such as were found incestuous, were punished after this manner, Being first bound she was laid vpon a beere, like a coarse alreadie deceased, and so carried through the midde Forum to the port or gate called Collina, for there betwixt two walls, is the graue of the vnchast <hi>Vestalls</hi> still apparant: there is a caue hollowed vnder the earth, the descent is with a ladder by the mouth, which is of no great widenesse; in this vault is a bed readie prepared, a light burning, with bread, milke, and oyle: these things being all made readie for the purpose, the delinquent is set downe, her bands loosed, and her head couered, the high Priest whispering certaine secret things in her eare, the other priests turning their faces from her, which is no sooner done, but shee is let downe into the cauerne, earth throwne vpon her, the graue filled, and shee stifled aliue; and that day on which this execution is done, there is a generall silence and sadnesse through the whole cittie.</p>

                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologie against the nations thus argues: All spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are winged, and therefore are euery where in an instant; the spatious earth and all the corners thereof, are to them but as one place, and whatsoeuer is therein done, they can as easily know as suddenlie declare: by this means they make themselues the authours of many things; and so they are indeed of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes often, of good things neuer. The Croesians and the Pirhians make it most apparant with what deceiuing cunning he hath shadowed the ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Oracles. No question but the diuell by the infallible prophesies of <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Daniell</hi> (both which had liuelie and expresselie deliniated the young man <hi>Alexander</hi>) knew that this <hi>Alexander</hi> by subduing <hi>Darius,</hi> should enioy all Asia, and transferre the Monarchy from the Babylonians to the Graecians. The Prince therefore comming to the Delphian Oracle, and of the Prophetesse demanding the successe that should follow his intended expeditions, shee of long time made him no answer; but he not so satisfied, by intreaties, menacies, and all manner of importunities, at length wrested from her these few words, <hi>Inuictus eris Alexander, Oh Alexander, thou shalt be inuincible:</hi> which words, had they fayled in the successe of his warres, yet had a shadow of truth, in that his vrgence ouercame the silence of the Oracle. After, traiecting his army against the Persians, diuers prodigies appeared; at his entrance into Asia, the statue of <hi>Orpheus</hi> was seene to sweat; in his conflict with <hi>Darius,</hi> an Eagle was still visibly, seene soaring and houering ouer his head, and as it were menacing the enemie: these were, no question, the mockeries of the diuell, to auert the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of such as gaue not much credit to the superstitions of these vaine Auguries, and to the firmer establishment of his own kingdome. He knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of the Prophesies of <hi>Esay,</hi>

                     <hi>Iohannes Wyerius</hi> in his first booke, <hi>De praest. Demon.</hi> tells vs, that vpon a time mention being made of <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> before the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> in his imperiall pallace, one of his chiefe nobilitie, and a prime counseller of Sate amongst the rest began to speake most affectionatlie in their praise, extolling their actions, strength, and vallour, in that high measure, that the Emperour was most desirous (if it were possible) to behold them in their true effigies and portrature. A Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian at the same time liued about the court, who boasted so much of his skill, that he profest himselfe able to accomplish the desires of the Emperour, and that without danger or preiudice to any: this comming to the eares of the Emperour, he was sent for, and commanded to shew some testimonie of his art. The Magitian, in hope of reward, and promise of silence, free from all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, vndertakes it, and moreouer to secure the spectators from danger: when placing the Emperour in his regall throne, he cast about the same a wide and spacious circle, that done, he mumbles certaine vnknowne words to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which he seemed to reade out of a small booke of characters, which hee drewe out of his pocket. This was no sooner done, but <hi>Hector</hi> beates at the doore with such violence, that at the terrour of the stroakes, the whole pallace seemed to tremble: the doore being opened, <hi>Hector</hi> enters armed <hi>Cap a pe</hi> in a helmet plumed, his target vpon his arme, and in his right hand a long mightie speare, headed with brasse: who thus accountred, with terrible and flaming eyes lookes round about the roome; his stature much larger than any that hath liued in our latter dayes. At another doore, first knockes, then enters <hi>Achilles,</hi> with the like maiesticke gate, compleatlie armed, with an austeare and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing brow, beholding <hi>Hector,</hi> shaking and charging his speare against him, as if he instantlie purposed to inuade him. These two, after honour done vnto <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> hauing gone on, and returned backe three times, vpon the instant vanisht. This act being past, next enters on the stage king <hi>Dauid,</hi> his head crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a rich diademe, and adorned with all kinglie magnificence, playing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20365:57"/>
vpon his harpe, but his aspect more plaucible and his countenance more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than the former: he likewise three seuerall times past by the Emperour, still sitting in his throane, but without any reuerence done to his person at all, and so likewise vanisht. The Magitian being asked by the Emperour, Why, of the rest, <hi>Dauid</hi> had onelie denyed to doe him honour? he presentlie answered, That all kingdomes to the kingdome of <hi>Dauid</hi> must submit themselues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ himselfe came of his stocke and linage. Thus we see how the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is neuer without scripture in his mouth, though blasphemie and execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his heart. Besides these kind of Diuiners, there are such as are called <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiligae,</hi> and these predict by lots, and that after sundrie manners, of which I will instance one onelie: They make a round circle, and diuide it into foure and twentie equall distances, according to the number of the Greeke alphabet, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry space hauing the character of one of these letters, vpon which they put a graine of wheat or barlie; then is put forth a Cocke kept for the purpose, and by those graines that he picks vp from the letters, they make their coniectures. <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour much perplexed in his mind about the succession in the Empire, retyred himselfe to this kind of Augurie: when the letters and the graines being placed as is aforesaid, the vaticinating Cocke (called <hi>Alectioman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi>) was turned out, who pickt vp the graines, and made bare these fiue let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, THEOD: by which was signified <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who after succeeded. Other predictions were gathered out of the sentences of the Poets: but especiallie out of <hi>Homer</hi> of the Greekes,<note place="margin">

Some reckoned the daughters of <hi>Atlas</hi> to the number of twelue, and that <hi>Hyas</hi> was their brother, who being stung to death by a serpent, fiue of his sisters tooke his death so grieuously that they dyed with sorrow; of whom <hi>Iupiter</hi> tooke such pittie that he translated them into so many starres, which still beare their brothers name, and are called <hi>Hyades.

                     </note> who witnesseth that the Graces were set foorth as obiects, either by the Grauers, the Painters, or the Poets; of which number were <hi>Pythagoras, Parius, Bupalus, Appelles,</hi> and others: but in habits fashioned in a modest decencie, their haire faire, long, and comely; therefore <hi>Homer</hi> in his hymne to <hi>Apollo</hi> calls them <hi>Pulcricemae,</hi> or faire haired. <hi>Horace</hi> hee setteth them out with gyrdles, which are neuer worne without other garments. It is therefore apparant that the ancient writers allowed them robes and vestures, either because it was a great immodestie to present women vnclothed, or else to keepe them from the violence of the winters cold, by which their tempers are much distasted, howsoeuer since they haue fallen into the hands of latter writers who haue robbed them of these habits, with which they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled by the former: for which robberie they are said, as ashamed of their nakednesse, to haue exiled themselues from the Earth. The first of all mortall men that erected a Temple to the Graces was <hi>Eteocles</hi> a king o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Orchomaenians;<note place="margin">

And <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in his Coniugall precepts, sayth, That a chast and modest woman in her societie &amp; conuersation towards her husband, needes the helpe of the Graces, that (as <hi>Metrodorus</hi> was wont to say) she may leade her life with him so sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that her boldnesse be to him no distast, nor bashfulnesse any burden; for by all such as affect their husbands, neatnesse and cleanlinesse in the house and at boord, with pleasing and smooth language at bed, are by no meanes to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: for coursenesse of manners in the one, makes her appeare harsh; and frowradnesse in the other,<note place="margin">

But now to find out what by these Graces was first intended; They are called the daughters of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Eurinome,</hi> which implies nothing els than the fertilitie of the fields, and the abundance of fruits: all which plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ariseth from the benefit of peace, signified in this word <hi>Eunomia.</hi> For where law and equitie haue predominance, there violence, oppressions, robberies, and direptions are exiled, the fields smile, the houses flourish, the Temples of the gods are both repaired and honoured, and all places filled with splendour and ornament. Neither are these the sole blessings of <hi>Eurinome,</hi> or <hi>Eunomia,</hi> or of <hi>Autonoe</hi> (by which is meant <hi>Prudentia,</hi> Wisedome) without the helpe of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which includes the Diuine clemencie, by which the aire and the earth are both reconciled vnto vs, the one in his temperature, the other in increase. They are called the children of the Sunne and <hi>Aegles,</hi> as knowing the Sunne to be the chiefe planet in the gouernance of the elements, without whose heat and incouragement, no hearbe or plant can attaine to any ripenesse and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. They are tearmd, conioynd and vnseparable sisters, by reason of the threefold profit arising from agriculture; the first from the fields, the second from the trees, the third from the creatures: nor are their names vnfitlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vpon them. <hi>Thalia,</hi> is a pleasant budding or burgening; <hi>Aglaia,</hi> is splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; and <hi>Euphrasine,</hi> gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is <hi>Aglaia</hi> called the wife of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> because there is a refulgence arising from all arts whatsoeuer. Others haue preferred <hi>Pasithaea</hi> in the place of <hi>Aglaia,</hi> in that she signifies heards, flocks, or such cattell as belong to tillage: out of whose labours or increase, there groweth pleasure or profit. They are nominated the goddesses of Benefits and good Turnes: the reason is, in regard that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fertilitie of the earth, no man can be liberall or munificent, nor rich, which is the foundation of all bountie. They are vpheld to be virgins, because the most honest and conscionable vsurie is bred from the earth, without salle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or brokage; at the first demonstrated vnto vs by the antient Poets, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and well apparrelled, vnlesse iniurie, oppression, and vsurie, in these latter times leaue them despoyled and naked.</p>

                     <p>They are called <hi>Horae</hi> of the Greeke word, which signifies <hi>Custodire,</hi> or to keepe; and therefore said to be the guardians of heauens gates, as hauing power to admit of our deuotions, and giue them accesse vnto the gods, or otherwise if they be not faithfull and sincere, to exclude them at their pleasures: hauing moreouer alwayes beene, and still continue great fauourers and prosperers of all such as are laborious and studious. They are called the daughters of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Themis,</hi> because as the Graces import nothing els but the hilaritie and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that ariseth from the increase of the earth, so these Houres signifie the fruit it selfe; for the Greeke word <hi>Carpo,</hi> is <hi>Fructus:</hi> properlie then they are said to be the attendants of the Graces, as the Graces are still the handmaids of <hi>Venus,</hi> for the fruits of the earth are the increase, as that plenty still followes delight: and therefore they all equipage together, as being by the Poets ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer separate.

The abundance of all things is the companion of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and Honestie: but Scarcitie and Death are the pages to Irreligion and Impietie: for there is not a cleerer mirrour in which may truelier be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the malice or gratitude of men towards the gods, and consequentlie of their punishment and pitie towards men, than in the alterations of the Seasons; which, the antient writers the better to signifie vnto vs, made the Houres the Porters to heauen gates, and gaue them power ouer the clouds, both in the mustering of them, or dispersing them. And so much for the Houres.</p>

                     <p>And these things are the most remarkeable which haue beene fabulouslie obserued of <hi>Aurora,</hi> who is therefore supposed to be the daughter of <hi>Hyperion</hi> and <hi>Thia,</hi> because by the diuine bountie Light proceedeth from the Sunne, to illumine the earth and all the inhabitants thereof; for there is no benefit ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of pleasure or profit that can accrue to vs, which flowes not from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate grace and goodnes. She is said to haue a ruddy colour, because she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares as if she came blushing from the pallace of the Sunne. And for that cause they describe her with roseat fingers, a high complexion, a golden seat, and red steedes to draw her charriot, to answer and correspond to the liuerie which the Sunne giues, his being all of the like colour. For the swiftnesse of her motion, she is allowed a charriot, and such as conferre white steedes vpon

her, deriue not their hew from the gray vapours that arise from the earth, but rather from the cleere and perspicuous splendour of the light it selfe. Those that of this fable would make a historie, say that <hi>Tythonus</hi> marryed a wife out of the Easterne countries, by whom he had the fore-named children, and after liued to that age that he grew not onelie decrepit and bed-rid of his limbs, but doating and childish of his braine. From hence ariseth the fable, That <hi>Aurora</hi> was inamoured of him, by reason of the temperature of those Orientall climates, to be possest of which pleasant places she purchast for him Immortalitie. And where some fable that he was turned to a grashopper, it signifies nothing els but the loquacitie of age, ambitiouslie groaning in the often repetition of things past, glorying in times of old, and despising those latter in respect of them; such a one did <hi>Homer</hi> personate in <hi>Nestor.</hi> The marke at which all these arrowes are aim'd in this fable, is to persuade men by wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome patientlie to vndergoe all the chances and changes incident to vs, both in time and nature; since death by the bountie of the gods is granted to man as a rest and cessation from all calamities and troubles. For when <hi>Aurora</hi> had beg'd immortalitie for <hi>Tython,</hi> he feeling the infirmities and defects of age, became himself a suppliant to the gods, That they would be to him so gracious as to giue him leaue to sleepe with his fathers, accounting it much better and happier to dye once, and be at rest, than to bee continuallie afflicted with the troubles and difficulties of a wearie and despised life.</p>

                     <p>AFter morning past, the Sunne gone about, and the day spent, comes Night; neither was she in meane honour amongst the antient Poets, who taught her to be the first, and long before all other nymphs or goddesses, as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing all places, and all things, hauing in her owne dispose and gouernment that deformed and vnshapen matter, called Chaos, ouer which she raigned Emperesse before the gods themselues had any existence or being: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, some contend to make her the daughter of this Chaos, as <hi>Hesiod</hi> and others:

And because so borne, she was called The most antient: the reason is approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, For before the masse was opened, the matter of which to make things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, and the world it selfe created, there could nothing be which might be properlie called Night: therefore <hi>Aratus</hi> in <hi>Astronomac.</hi> stiles her <hi>Nox an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqua;</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> in one of his hymnes, The mother of gods and men, as both hauing their birth from her.

                           <unclear>Consolator</unclear>:</hi> for life is nothing els but a light lent vs by the Creator of all mankind, which if it be redemanded of vs, ought no more grudgingly to be paid back, than comming to a friends house to bee merrie in the morning, and hauing feasted there all the day, to returne to our home at night; or to pay back what wee borrow, to the owner: For there is no iniurie done to vs, if God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde that back at our hands which hee hath before but lent vs. Now from the daughter to come backe to the mother, and know what is allegorically meant by Night. These pests &amp; mischeifes before commemorated are therfore sayd to be her sonnes and daughters, because the ignorance and mallice of man (which is indeed the night of the mind) is the parent and nurse of all calamities incident to vs: yet may some of their violences by wisedome be mitigated, though not frustrated of their ends, namely Age, Loue, Fate, Death, and the like; who though they be in perpetuall motion, their speed may bee slackned though not stayd, and their pace slowed though not quite stopt. She was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the most Antient, because before the Heauens and the Sunne were created there was no light extant; which is said to proceede from the lower parts of the earth, in regard that the Sunne compassing the world, when he lights the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes with his beames, the earth shadowes them from vs, which shaddow is nothing else than Night. She is called the mother of all, as being before the birth of any thing. The word <hi>Nox</hi> is deriued <hi>Ã  Nocendo,</hi> of hurting or harming; the reason is, as some Phisitions hold opinion, because the corrupt humors of the night are infectious and dangerous, especially to men any way diseased; of which there is continuall experience in all such as haue either woundes, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or agues, or feauers, or the like, to all such weakenesses or imperfections, the humors of the Night are still most hurtfull and obnoxious. And so much breifly what morally can be gathered by that which hath bin fabulously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented of Night.</p>
                     <p>That Sleepe could not fasten on the eyes of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> it is intended, not to bee conuenient for him that hath the charge &amp; protection of the whole Vniuerse, to whose care and foresight the administration and guidance of all things are committed, should so much as slumber or wincke at all; neither doth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Nature need any rest to repaire and comfort his troubled spirits, when he is not capable of either labour or discommoditie. And <hi>Lethe</hi> is called the sister of <hi>Somnus,</hi> in regard that by our naturall repose, wee for the time forget all paine, anguish, or trouble. Because he comes to many creatures, and at the same time, he is said to be winged; in regard the humor of the Night encreaseth the vapours of the stomach, ascending to the higher parts of the body, which after by the frigiditie of the braine, descend againe lower and more coole, by which Sleepe is begot; hee is therefore not vnproperly called, the sonne of Night: which Night calls me now to rest, with the finishing of this second booke, called EVTERPE.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Orgias</hi> held opinion, that Women were not to be honored according to their forme, but their fame; preferring actuall vertue before superficial beautie: to incorage which in their sex, funerall orations were allowed by the Roman Lawes to be celebrated for all such as had beene either presidents of a good and commendable life, or otherwise illustrious for any noble or eminent action. And therefore (least the matrons or virgins in Rome, the one should diuert from her stayed grauitie, or the other from her virgins professed integritie) the vse of Wine was not knowne amongst them; for that woman was taxed with immodestie, whose breath was knowne to smell of the grape. <hi>Pliny</hi> in his naturall historie, saith, That <hi>Cato</hi> was of opinion,<note place="margin">

As if the father were iealous of his daughters continence, if by kissing her, he perceiued she had drunke wine. But kissing and drinking both are now growne (it seemes) to a greater custome amongst vs than in those dayes with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: nor am I so austeare to forbid the vse of either, both which though the one in surfets, the other in adulteries, may be abused by the vicious; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarilie at customarie meetings, and laudable banquets, they by the nobly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and such whose hearts are fixt vpon honour, may be vsed with much modestie and continence.

What man was euer knowne to be eminent, whom woman in some manner hath not equalled? Come to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as there was an <hi>Hercules</hi> and a <hi>Theseus;</hi> so there was a <hi>Menalippe</hi> and an <hi>Hippolite</hi> to encounter them: who as they conquered not, so they were not vanquished.

In Poetrie compare the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes of <hi>Sapho</hi> with <hi>Anacreons,</hi> and <hi>Corinnaes</hi> with <hi>Pindarus,</hi> and it shall be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made manifest that <hi>Sapho</hi> in all points paraleld the first, and <hi>Corinna,</hi> in fiue seuerall contentions for the palme, preceded the last. But the similitude or discrepance of men &amp; womens vertues conferd together, can be made no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apparant (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith) than by comparing Life with Life, and Action with Action, by which we shall see they haue almost one and the same effigies: For oppose the magnificence of <hi>Sesostris</hi> against that of <hi>Semiramis;</hi> tha craft &amp; subtlety of <hi>Seruius Tullius</hi> against <hi>Tanaquills;</hi> the magnanimitie of <hi>Brutus</hi> against <hi>Porceaees;</hi> compare <hi>Pelopidas</hi> with <hi>Timoclea;</hi> and which shall yeeld to the other preheminence? especially if wee exactly consider the end at which the vertue it selfe doth ayme: for diuerse vertues haue diuers colours laid vpon them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the temperature of body, or the disposition of the mind. <hi>Achilles</hi> was valiant one way, and <hi>Aiax</hi> another, yet both their indeuours intended to one Fortitude; the Prudence of <hi>Nestor</hi> vnlike that of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> yet both wise men; <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Agesilaus</hi> were both vpright men, yet executed justice two sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie waies; <hi>Irene</hi> loued one way, <hi>Alceste</hi> another, yet both endeeredly affected their husbands; so likewise <hi>Cornelia</hi> and <hi>Olimpias</hi> were differently magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious, yet either of them attained to that height of honour to which their heroick mindes aspired. But to come to our former comparison from which I haue somewhat digrest; in what greater vertue can either sex expresse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, than in true coniugall loue? <hi>Cicero de Diuinatione,</hi> and <hi>Plinie in lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. report of <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi>

He therefore preferring the safetie of his wife before his owne health, caused the male to be instantly cut in peeces, and the female let goe, beholding with his owne eyes his owne instant destruction in the death of the serpent. Therefore it was disputed, whether <hi>Cornelia</hi> were more happie in inioying such a husband, or made more wretched in loosing him? An admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and rare president in man, and a husband; which I can easily instance in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a wife: for as there is nothing more diuelish and deadly than a maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ill disposed woman, so there is on the contrarie, nothing more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and comfortable to man than one prouident, gentle, and well addicted; for as she that is good and honest, will vpon iust necessitie lay downe her life for her husbands health and safetie, so the other will as willingly prostitute hers for his distruction and ruin. Therefore a wife by how much neerer she is to vs in the strict bond both of diuine and humane lawes, by so much either the sweetenesse of her behauiour tasts the pleasanter, or the harshnesse of her crabbed condition, relishes more bitter; for she is euer either a perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, or a continuall torment: she of whom I intend to speake is none such as the last,<note place="margin">

This <hi>Admetus</hi> hearing, he petitioned to <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> who commiserating his suit, the one brought him a Lion, the other a Beare, both made tame and gentle to his hand: who presenting them to the father of <hi>Alceste,</hi> and hauing yoaked them and made them drawe according to the Edict, receiued her as his bride, and departed with her thence into his owne countrie of Thessaly. Not long after <hi>Admetus</hi> falling into a great infirmitie of sicknesse, and consulting with the Oracle about his health, answere was returned, That he must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily leaue the world vnlesse he could procure some friend, kinsman, courtier, or other, who by sacrificing their owne liues to his loue, might ransome his, and by no other meanes his health to be restored. This motion being made to many both neere and deere to him (who no doubt had promised more, with purpose to performe lesse) in conclusion it was refused by all; which comming to the eare of <hi>Alceste,</hi> she gaue her selfe vp to a most willing death, to redeeme the health and life of her husband, and with her owne hands slew her selfe. Now tell me (Ã´ you Satyrists against the sex of women, that call them fraile, inconstant, weake, and timerous) in which of these two did manly courage, noble resolution, or coniugall loue most shine? in him that by suffering death to steale vpon him yeelded himselfe to the necessitie of fate, or in her who like a bold Virago with an vnmatchable resolution with her owne hand extracted that blood from her chast brest, with which shee writ herselfe a character of honour, to outlast all antiquitie? In these things then you see, they may justly claime an equall competence with men, but in many things a iust prioritie, as in noursing and bringing vp their children, in mannaging the affaires of the house, and care of all domestick businesse, in prouiding vs Diet, Linnen for the backe and bed, in sewing, weauing, and in spinning: for who cannot imagine how ill great <hi>Hercules</hi> did become the distaffe? But I will cease further to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20365:66"/>
speake in their praise, least I be taxed of palpable flatterie, and some may lay on mean aspertion, That either I lou'd that sex wondrous well in my youth, or perhaps now begin to dote on them in my age. And since I last spake of that conioyned loue that ought to be betwixt man and wife, I will produce an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram taken from <hi>Ausonius</hi> to that purpose, the inscription is as followeth.

To this two of them assented, but the third presuming much vpon the loue of his wife, was willing to put it to another venture, both to saue his purse, and expresse to his friends the gentle disposition of a woman to her husband, whose welcome home was still as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant at midnight as at mid-day: he therefore made a second motion, that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the controuersie, euerie man should instantly make hast home by turnes, as they lay neerest in their way, and he that did not that thing instantly which his wife badde, the whole charge of the reckoning should be imposed vpon him, and not to part companie till they see this done: vpon which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.

Vpon this ground he sent to <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> king of the Hunnes, who then inhabited Pannonia, asking him, Why hee would dwell in the barren continent of Pannonia, when the most fertile coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Italie lay open to his inuasion? <hi>Albinus</hi> apprehending this incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Narses,</hi> in the yeare six hundred threescore and eight, made his first incursion into the Emperours confines, who sent certaine spyes to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the forces of <hi>Albinus;</hi> of which he hauing intelligence, caused all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to vntye their haire and fasten it about their chinnes, thereby to seeme men, and make the number of his army appeare the greater. The spyes obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them, wondred amongst themselues, and askt what strange people these were with the Long beards? and from hence their names were first deriued, which hath since beene remarkeable in the most pleasant and fertill climate of all Italy, from them called Lombardie. Others say, that when they went to fight against the Vandales, There was a man that had the spirit of Prophesie, whom they besought to pray for them and their good successe in the battaile; now when the Prophet went to his orisons, the queene had placed her selfe and hir women iust against the window where he prayd, with their heire disposed as aforesaid; and iust as he ended his deuotions, they opened their casements and appeared to him, who presentlie said to himselfe, what be these Long-beards? to whom the queene replyed, <hi>To these Long-beards then whom thou hast named, let the victorie happen,</hi> thus saith the history. <hi>Rhodegondis</hi> was queene of

In which triall shee answered boldly and with great courage in the defence of her owne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: but being by manifest proofes conuicted, in so much that her purpose could not be denied, she then descended so low as to excuse herselfe, alleaging that (indeed) apprehending the greatnesse of his person, and that she was in degree no better to him than an handmaide; and fearing least some other more accomplisht beautie might steppe betwixt him and her to insinnuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fauour and grace, shee therefore had prepared an amatorious confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, minding only to continue his loue, not to betray his life; and if her woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish weakenesse had in any kind (through ignorance) transgrest the bounds of loyaltie, she submitted her selfe to his royall clemencie, whose approoued judgement shee made no doubt, knew how to distinguish betwixt folly and malice.

any kind, rather a strumpet than a chast and vnblemisht virgin: The others comming before <hi>Cyrus,</hi> smiled vsing many immodest and lasciuious gestures; she onely with her eyes deiected, and manifest blushes in her cheekes, by her teares expressed an extraordinarie bashfulnesse. The king commanding them to sit downe in his presence, the rest boldly contended who should place her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe next him; but this Phocean damosell at first seemed not to heare, nor without the robustious vsage of that souldier who first surprised her, could be wonne to sit downe. The king beginning to dallie with them, and playing with their cheekes, neckes, and brests, the rest willingly suffered him; shee onely strooke his hand aside, and if hee offered but to touch her in the least part, she presently cried out, and told him he should not do it vnpunished. The king much delighted with this vnexpected coynesse, since at euerie offer of his shee fled his embraces (which was against the custome of the Persians) hee more ardently fixt his affection vpon her, and turning to the souldier who first presented them, thus sayd, This Phocean onely thou hast brought me chast and vncorrupted, the rest both in beautie and behauiour are impostures: and from thencefoorth she was solicited and beloued of the king aboue all others with whom he had before or after conuerst with, and from that time a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all affection grew betwixt them, so great, that it increased as farre as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and absolute confirmation of marriage, conformable to the custom of the Graecians. In so much that the loue of the king to <hi>Aspasia</hi> was not rumoured in IÃ¶nia solely, but through all the spatious prouinces of Greece, euen Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponesus was filled with the bruit therof, to the glorie of the great King; who after his familiar acquaintance with her, was neuer knowne to haue vsed the companie of any other woman. And now began the vision of <hi>Aspasia</hi> (concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Doue) to be much spoken of, and of the goddesse that appeared to her, to whom she dedicated (after) a goodly statue, called the image of <hi>Venus,</hi> beautified with many rich jewells; withall, the picture of a Doue, to which she made daylie supplications, sacrifices, and oblations, still imploring the fauour of the goddesse. To her father <hi>Hermotimus</hi> shee sent many rich and vnualued presents, making him of a subiect almost vnparraleld for wealth, vsing in the processe of her life (as witnesse, as well the Persian as Graecian Ladies) a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous modestie and continence. <hi>Hormus,</hi> sometimes of Thessaly, was sent from <hi>Scopa</hi> the junior, who was of Scicily, with an admirable rich Iewell to <hi>Cyrus</hi> for a present. Who hauing shewed it to many, all wondering at the cost and workemanship, and prowd of so rich a gemme: presently after dinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the chamber of <hi>Aspasia,</hi> and finding her asleepe, cast himselfe vpon the bed by her without disturbing her rest: who waking and espying the king so neer, began to embrace him according to her accustomed manner, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently taking the jewell from the casket, showed it to her vsing these wordes, This I bestow on thee as a gift worthie the daughter or mother of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which I charge thee to weare for my sake in a carkanet about thy neck. To whom she wisely &amp; consideratly answered, And how dare I be the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of so great a treasure, which rather becomes the maiestie and estate of your mother <hi>Parasatides?</hi> therefore I intreat you send it to her, for I without this ornament can present you with a neck sufficiently beautifull. The king much pleased with her answer, daily and howerly more and more increased his loue towards her, and what she said and did, sent in a letter to his mother, with the iewell inclosed. For which she was not only much graced and fauored by the Princesse, but after by <hi>Cirus</hi> rewarded with many rich gifts, of value in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:20365:72"/>
all which she modestlie sent backe with this message; These things, <unclear>Ã´ king</unclear>, may be vsefull to thee that hast the charge of such infinites of men, when my greatest riches is to be solely beloued of thee: with these and the like, she tyed the King in inseparable bonds of affection towards her. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all competitorship, in the beauty of face, feature of body, integritie of life, and noblenesse of mind, she was aboue all those of her time admirable. But after <hi>Cyrus</hi> being slaine in battaile by his brother, and his whole army: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, she likewise fell into the hands of the enemy: whom the king <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> with singular care and diligence caused to be sought, and brought before him, as one whose name and vertues he held in great respect and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and being presented before him bound, hee grew wondrous angry, commanding all such to prison as were the authours of her least durance: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all commanding a costlie and magnificent roabe to bee cast about her, which she with many teares and much sorrow refused, till shee was compeld to it by the king, still taking to heart and lamenting the death of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But thus ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to the Persian state, shee appeared in the eyes of all men the fairest of women, especiallie in the kings, much surprised with her extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary beautie, still persuading her to race out the memorie of <hi>Cyrus</hi> dead, and in his roome to admit of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> liuing; which slowly and at length though late, he obtained, respecting her aboue all other his wiues and concubines. Soone after, his Eunuch <hi>Teridates</hi> dyed, more than a child, and scarce full man, the most beautifull youth in Asia, and of the king the most beloued; who so much lamented his death, that all the principalities and nations vnder him see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to participate of his griefe; yet none that durst be so bold as to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his presence, or minister to him any words of comfort. Three dayes being past in these lamentations and sorrowes, <hi>Aspasia</hi> in a funerall habit, and with her eyes fixt vpon the earth, appeared before the king; who no sooner espyed her, but demanded the cause of her comming: To comfort thee (said she) Ã´ king, if thou beest so pleased, else to returne to the place of sorrow from whence I came. At which seeming to reioyce, the king intreated her to her chamber whether he would presentlie repaire, to whom she obeyed. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing put on a roabe of the Eunuches, so much bewayled, and in that casting her selfe vpon her bed, she gaue the king such content, that he commanded her till the dayes of mourning were past, neuer to appeare to him but in that habit; she more preuailing with him than all his Princes, wiues, subiects, and seruants about him, still liuing in his most especiall grace and fauour.

Not long after he caused to be assembled all the friends, kinsmen, Nobilitie, and Gentrie of his land, inuiting them to his daughters marriage, but not yet knowing or hauing determined in himselfe on whom to conferre her.

He being in his army neere to Tanais, and hearing this newes, secretlie conueyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of his tent, and without any seruant or attendant sauing his chariotter, came priuatelie into the Cittie of <hi>Homartes,</hi> hauing in wondrous short space runne 8000 furlongs; this done, he disposed both of his charriot, and driuer, and withall putting himselfe into a Scythians habit, hee came to the place where this marriage was to be celebrated, and thronging in amongst the rest, he beheld the beautifull <hi>Odatis</hi> sad in countenance, and tempering her draught with a slow and vnwilling hand: to whom approaching more neerer, he thus whispered, Behold <hi>Odatis</hi> thy dearest <hi>Zariadres</hi> for whom thou didst latelie send, ready to doe thee all seruice.

As noble an act worthy memorie was not long after done by the women of Chios, what time <hi>Philip</hi> the son of <hi>Demetrius</hi> opposed the cittie, who published a proud and barbarous Edict to insinuate the slaues of the cittie to his aide, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising them not onely free manumission but to marry them to their mistresses and possesse them of their masters fortunes: which kindled such an vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wrath in the ladies and matrons of the cittie, that fired with rage and disdaine, they together with their seruants assisting them, with incredible faith and honesty maintained the breaches, defended the walls, guarded the ports, casting stones, darts, fighting, exhorting and incouraging one another, euen to the beating of the enemies backe, raysing their shamefull siege, and pursuing them flying with their weapons, till <hi>Philips</hi> army was quite discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited. In all this troublous warre (notwithstanding the proclamation) not one seruant amongst so many had the least suspition, much lesse aspersion cast vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fidelitie.</p>

The wiues of the captiues this hearing, came to the prison doores and with humble prayers and infinite teares, besought those that had the charge of them, that by their visitation they might administer some small comfort to their husbands: which after much importunitie granted, they were admitted, where suddenlie they caused their husbands to change habits with them, which they did, and so were let forth in stead of the women; they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming themselues against all the spight and furie of the Spartanes.

The horridnes of this nothing moued the tyrant, but (that if greater could possiblie be deuised) he gaue countenance euen to such mischeifes, causing many of the prime cittisens to be slaine, and to the number of eight hundred banished. But fearing in regard of their number, hee might be in time by them subuerted: he made proclamation, That all such wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that had a desire to visit their absent husbands, should with such gold and treasure as they could conueniently carrie (with their children) haue peaceable passage from the cittie into Aetolia, where many or the most of their exiled friends then soiourned. Many of the women incouraged by this edict, being to that purpose assembled, and with such goods as they had, departed the citie, he sent after them his horse men, who not onely rifled them, but stampt their children beneath their horses feete, where many of the infants perished, and so in confused heaps hurried them backe into the towne, bearing the spoile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tyrants treasurie. These outrages were the least of many which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely omit. There liued at that time an antient noble man in the cittie, called <hi>Hellanicus,</hi> who entred into a combination with the exiles, about the suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Tyrant, and by reason of his yeares was neither by him feared nor suspected: by the incouragement of this <hi>Hellanicus,</hi> the confined citisens assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselues into a citie most conuenient for their deseigne cald Amimona, to whom many of their allies and friends (copartners in the publique calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) resorted <hi>Aristotemus</hi> somwhat affrighted with this new faction, repaired to a place of publike assembly, whether he had caused all the chiefe matrons to be before called, &amp; there in a premitated oration, stuft with many threats aud menaces, protested to inflict vpon them rackes, tortures, and lingring deaths, vnlesse by speedie letters they did not onely persuade but preuaile with their husbands, instantly to abandon the place they had fortified.

<q>Weart thou a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20365:81"/>
true spirited man, as nothing lesse appeares in thee, thou wouldest not threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten women in this base kind to betray their husbands, but wouldest rather haue negotiated with them, who haue entire power &amp; command ouer vs, and that in smoother and more deceitfull language than such by which thou hast hetherto beguiled vs. But if thy cowardise and despairation compell thee to this exigent, as thinking by our meanes to complot their ruines, thou art in that hope destitute of all comfort: let that day neuer be callendred, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morise them among men so void of councell and discretion, that by sparing the liues of their wiues and children, they should betray the sacred libertie of their countrie: for the mischiefe is not so great to loose vs altogether, whom they haue alredy wanted so long, as the good and profit that must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accrue by redeemimg the citties from thy insolencie and tyrannie.</q> These words were no sooner vttered, but <hi>Aristotemus</hi> distracted with rage and furie, commanded her young sonne to be sought and brought, whom hee purposed to massacre before the mothers face:
and whil'st his lictors and serieants were inquiring for him amongst others that were then busied about their childish sports, she spying him, or her own accord called him to her with these words,
<q>Come hether to me, Ã´ my sonne, and now in thy childhood before thou hast apprehension or passionate feeling of tyrrannie, be freed both from the terror and burden therof; for mine own part, I had rather see thee innocently dying, than basely and ignobly seruing.</q>
The Tyrant at her last speech more inraged than the former, drew out his sword with purpose to haue slaine her, when <hi>Cylo</hi> one of his familiar friends (but indeede a cheefe man in the confederacie with <hi>Hellanicus</hi>) staid his hand, and by gentle words so tempered his spleene, that he departed thence without any act of murder, yet purpose of a future reuenge. Vpon a day as hee was sporting vpon the bed with his wife vntill dinner was prepared and disposed vpon the table, it happened that an Eagle soring aboue the Pallace, let fall a great stone vpon the battlements iust ouer the bed where the king then lay, and alighting there, made such a fearefull and prodigious noyse that it not onely amased the king within, but was wonderfull to all that beheld it without. The Augurers were sent for to know what omen should succeede: they flatter the tyrant, and promise nothing but what is good and prosperous. <hi>Hellanicus</hi> the same night in his dreame immagined his sonne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him (which sonne was by <hi>Aristotemus</hi> before murdered with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) who spoke to him to this effect, <hi>O father arise, is this a time to sleepe when the whole gouernement of the cittie must depend on you to morrow?</hi> With this dreame incouraged, he comforted his adherents, all attending the opportunitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. <hi>Aristotemus</hi> meane time hearing that <hi>Craterus</hi> was marched as farre as Olimpius with a great armie, leauied for his safetie and supporture, grew so bold vpon the rumor of so great a power, that without his guard, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>Cylo</hi> onely, he aduentured into the market place: whom <hi>Hellanicus</hi> meeting by chance, and almost extasied to see him so weakely attended; with both his hands aduanced, and with an audable and cleere voice he made this clamour, Where be you, you good &amp; long oppessed countriemen? a braue Theatre is this for so noble a contention as our libertie, being seated in the middest of our countrie, and centre of our cittie. This <hi>Cylo</hi> inuaded the next man to the king and slew him. <hi>Thrasibulus</hi> and <hi>Lampides</hi> assaulted the tyrant, who fled to the temple of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> where they fell vpon him &amp; killed him; then dragging his bodie into the market place proclaimed their libertie. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men issued out of their houses with ioy &amp; clamour, embracing their husbands,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20365:81"/>
fathers, and friends, with loude and glad acclamations; thence in multitudes they made concourse to the pallace. The tyrants wife to preuent their furie made fast her doore, and in her priuat chamber strangled her selfe. <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temus</hi> had two beautifull yong virgins to his daughters, both marriagable, these they were about to dragge into the streetes with purpose to destroy them, but first to excrutiate them with all disgraces and contumacies. Which <hi>Megisto</hi> seeing, with her best oratorie appeased their present furie, proposing to them how shamefull a thing it were for a noble and free state, to immitate the insolencies of a bloodie and inhumane tyrannie: libertie therfore was granted the yong damosells (at her intercession) to retire themselues into their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and to make choise of what death best suited with their present feares. <hi>Myro</hi> the elder sister vnloosing from her wast a silken gyrdle,<note place="margin">

                     </note> fastened it about her owne necke, and with a smiling and cheerefull looke thus comforted the younger: <hi>My sweete and deere sister, I more commiserat thy fate than lament mine owne: yet immitate (I intreat thee) my constancie in death, least any abiect thing or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie may be obiected against vs vnagreeable with our blood and qualitie.</hi> To whom the younger replyed, <hi>That nothing could appeare more terrible to her than to behold her die; therefore besought her, by the affinitie of sisterhood, to be the first that should make vse of that gyrdle, and dying before her to leaue to her an example of resolution and patience. Myro</hi> to her made answere, <hi>I neuer denied thee any thing sweete soule in life, neither will I oppose thee in this thy last request at thy death: and for thy sake will I indure that which is more greeuouous to mee than mine owne death, namely to see thee die.</hi> When accommodating all things for the present execution, shee no sooner saw her dead, but she gentlely layd her out and with great modestie couered her. Then she besought <hi>Megisto</hi> on her knees, to haue a care of them in their deaths, that nothing immodest or vncomely might bee done to their bodies: which graunted, she not only with courage, but seeming ioy, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went her last fate, till she expired: nor was there any spectator there present, to whom the memorie of the tyrant was neuer so hatefull, from whose eyes and hearts this obiect did not extract teares and pittie.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Megisto</hi> is exprest the Magnanimitie of spirit, but in these following, I will illustrate Fortitude in action. The Turkes busied in the siege of some townes in Catharo, <hi>Vluzales</hi> &amp; <hi>Carocossa</hi> (two of no meane place and eminence among them) wrought so farre with the great Admirall, that he deliuered into their charge the managing of threescore gallies, with munition and men in number competent, to make incursions into the bordering Islands then vnder the state of Venice. These two Turkish captaines land their forces before Curzala, a citie that giues name to the countrie, with purpose to inuest themselues before it: which <hi>Antonius Contarinus</hi> (then gouernour of the cittie) vnderstanding, like a timerous and fearefull coward, taking the aduantage of the night, fled with his souldiors thence, not leauing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The towne thus left to the weake guard of some twenty men, &amp; about fourescore women, the Turks giue them a bold and fierce assault: when these braue viragoes chusing rather to dye like souldiers than like their husbands runne like cowards; some main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Ports, others defend the walls, and with that noble resolution, that what with fire, stones, scalding water, and such like muniments then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest at hand, so opposed the assailants, that many of the Turks in that conflict were slaine, and all repulst, retyring themselues with purpose (some rest giuen to the souldiours) to salute them with a fresh alarum. But fortune was so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20365:82"/>
to these Amazonian spirits, that a mighty tempest from the North so tost and distrest the Turks gallyes, that they were forced to abandon the Island with dishonour, leauing to the besieged, a memory worthy to outliue all posteritie.</p>

In what manner she dyed, I referre you to <hi>Virgill,</hi> and will speake a word or two of her sister <hi>Anna,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Belus.</hi> She, after the death of her sister, forsaking of the cittie of Carthage then inuested with siege by <hi>Hyarbus,</hi> fled to <hi>Battus</hi> king the Island Melita, but making no long soiourne there, she put againe to sea and fell vpon the coast of Laurentum, where being well knowne by <hi>Aeneas,</hi> she was nobly receiued, but not without suspition of too much familiaritie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them: in so much that iealousie possessing <hi>Lauinia</hi> the wife of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> she conceiued an irreconcilable hatred against <hi>Anna,</hi> in so much that fearing her threatned displeasure she cast her selfe headlong into the riuer Numicus, and was there drowned; for so <hi>Ouid</hi> reports in his booke <hi>de Fastis.</hi> But touching the illustrious Queene <hi>Dido,</hi> vnder her statue were these verses or the like engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in a Greeke character, interpreted into Latine by <hi>Ausonius,</hi> and by me in the sacred memorie of so eminent a queene thus englisht:

                     <p>THere arose great warres betweene the Milesians and Naxians, kindled by the adultrate practise of the wife of <hi>Hypsicreon</hi> a Milesian, who violating her coniugall vowes, by throwing her selfe into the lustfull imbraces of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon,</hi> a Naxian, then her guest, and fearing the iust anger of her husband, and withall the punishment due to her adultrate sinne, fled with him into Naxos: from whence being againe demanded, but denied, this priuate wrong turned to a publique ruin: for deuouring warre accompained with many calamities preyed vpon both their countries. But as this Beacon was first fired by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans lewdnesse, so was it at last extinguished by a womans vertue: <hi>Diognetus</hi> who had the command of those Erythraeans which came in ayde of the Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, had committed to his custodie a certaine strong hold, scituated against the citie Naxos: who hauing taken from the Naxians a prize of women and free virgins, he was deepely stroke in loue with one <hi>Polycrata,</hi> whom he led with him not as a captiue, but as his wife. It chanced that the Miletians cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated a generall festiuall day, <hi>Polycrita</hi> besought <hi>Diognetus</hi> to make her so far indebted to his fauour, as to suffer her to send her brothers part of those iun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates then at the table, which willingly he granted: she secretly writ vpon the leaden table of the marchpane what shee had proiected, withall charging the bearer to intreat her brothers not to let any participate therof saue themselues:

The lady vndertakes their suit, and with much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie solicited her lord in their behalfe; but he being of a haughtie and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent disposition, stil persisted immoueable: but she commiserating their estate, as daily mooued with their complaints, without cessation still sollicited for them, and with such vrgence, that he had neither peace at boord nor quiet in bed; he at length as much wearied with her importunitie, as she tired with their petitions, she wrested from him this churlish and indeffinite answer, <hi>Cease Lady further to persuade me, for I protest, and that with an vnaltered resolution, that there is but one onely meanes by which their franchises are to be recouered, which if thou wilt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, (as I presume thou wilt not) I will surrender them vp intirely, if not, I will continue them in the same estate that I now hold them.</hi> The lady gently demaunding what imposition he would inioine her, he thus replied, <hi>Thou shalt strippe thy selfe starke naked, and mounted on horseback, at mid-day ride in that manner through the citie, from one gate to another, and by this exployt only their desire and thy suit is to be granted.</hi> The modest lady after some little pause, promised her lord that for their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good she would doe it. This being sealed by an oath from him, and a vow from her, she acquainted the cittisens with her purpose, and appointed a day in which she commanded them to locke all their doores and shut in their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and not to leaue any small cranny open towards the street, nor suffer any liuing thing to be abroad. This being faithfully and punctually performed by them, shee as effectually accomplished her promise, and rid in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with no more touch of immodestie, than when shee shifted her smocke in her priuat chamber. Some may say, Yet what might the people apprehend in their conceits, to thinke vpon a naked Ladie so mounted? I answere, They could not more immodestlie conceiue of her, than a man that sees any beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful woman wel habited, many do in his libidinous immaginations, by compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending euerie naked lineament before she put on her apparrell. Of this noble Ladie there is in the citie both monument and memorie vnto this day.</p>

                     </note> might it be held no ridiculous digression, I would tell you an old tale to that purpose, which though I dare not warrant it for truth, I am willing to make it yours as freely as it was made mine. I speake not of the woman, that when her husband came home to her in hast, and brought newes there was a new edict come out, that all Cuckolds should be cast into the riuer; presently asked him, why he did not learne to swimme: nor of her that when her good-man came to her in like manner with acclamation, and sayd, Wotte you what wife, such a woman (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming one of his neighbours) is found to be false, and hee branded for a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20365:85"/>
cuckold: answered, Lord husband you are such another man. But my discourse is at this present of a disputation in hell, what this thing Cuckold should be, or what kind of creature; since all sortes of people of what estate or degree soeuer, examined by <hi>Lucifer,</hi> or any of the three infernall judges, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied themselues to bee the same. It was therefore agreed amongst them, to send vp some of the most ingenious diuells amongst them, by surueying the Earth, to discouer this strange vnknown creature: and if it were possible to bring him thither aliue, to make them spectators of an obiect they so much desired to see. With this commission away goes the diuell, showes himselfe vpon the earth, and taking the shape of a gallant thrusts himselfe into the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of all kind of people: hee comes to the countrey man, askes if he bee a Cuckold, who answers he knowes not what it meanes. The cittisen denies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be the man. The souldier with oaths outfaceth the name. The lawyer will arrest any man vpon an action of slaunder that shall call him by that name. The courtier (indeed) confesseth himselfe to be a Cuckold-maker, but to be a Cuckold he can indure by no means. In so much that the poore diuell, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disappointed of his purpose was readie to retire againe to his black house of darkenesse: as he was meditating with himselfe to the same purpose, hee happened into an Ordnarie, where a cittisen being at game amongst many gentlemen, the dyce so fauoured him, that he got a great hand, blew vp two or three gallants, and so gaue ouer play; which one aboue the rest taking not well, importuned him still to hold him game, which the other absolutly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the gallant told him, A Cuckold he found him, &amp; so would leaue him, and with that language he bad him farewell. This the diuell hearing, grew ioyfull in himselfe, thus intimating; I haue found him at length whom I so long haue sought, this is my prise, and shall be my purchase. He presently prouides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of a large bagge able to containe so great a burden, and desiring the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisen more familier acquaintance (to cut off circumstance) drew him out of the towne to take a turne or two in the fieldes. Together they walke, and comming to a remote place, the diuell discouering himselfe, appeares vnto him in a rough blacke haired shape, and tels him to what purpose he was come, and to what place hee was inioyned to beare him: therefore wished him pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and quietly to creepe into his bagge. The man at these words amased, began to struggle with the diuell, who layde violent hands vpon him. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that neere to this wrestling place a poore labouring man was digging of grauell, there lay by the edge of the pit a lustie mastiffe (that had bin a beare-dogge) to keepe the poore mans hat and jerkin, whil'st he was at worke below: this dogge seeing the man and the diuell contend, tooke (it seemes) the fiend, by reason of his rough skinne, to be a beast of the game; vp skippes he to take the diuell by the throat, who presently lets goe his hold to secure himselfe from the dogge, and away he flyes. The citisen by this meanes secured from the present danger, and willing to be gratefull to his preseruer, comes to the labourer and bargaines for the mastiffe; the price is made, and both parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed. It is to be presupposed, that the diuell in this feare, had left (for hast) his bagge behind him, and fled out of sight: which the cittisen apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and being emboldned with so valiant a second, thinkes to put a new tricke vpon his aduersary; for he imagines that (tenne to one) hee will come backe againe for his bagge, therefore he intreates the poore man to helpe him to put the dogge into the sacke, and tye the mouth of it fast with the strings. All is done and they retyre themselues apart, when iust as they imagined, out
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20365:85"/>
comes the diuel peaking from the place where he lay hid to see if the coast was cleere, and casting his eyes timerously about him, as fearing the like assault, he came softlie treading to the place where hee had left his sacke, and gently feeling, findes somewhat to stirre therein: vpon which he presently imagines that it was the supposed cuckold, who for feare had crept into the same; and being wondrous iocund with this conceit, snatcheth him vp vpon his backe, and with his glad purchase sinkes himselfe down among the infernalls. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne was rumord in hell, and a sinod cald, in which <hi>Lucifer</hi> seated himselfe in his wonted state with all his princes, iudges, and officers about him, all in great expectation of the obiect so much desired: the messenger is summond, who appeares before them with his bagge at his backe, or rather vpon his necke; he is commanded to discouer this strange creature so often spoken of, but till then in that place not seene; the sackes mouth is opened, out flyes the mastiffe amongst them, who seeing so many ougly creatures together, thought (it seemes) he had beene amongst the beares in Paris garden: but spying <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> to be the greatest and most ill-fauoured amongst them, first leapes vp into his face, and after flyes at whomsoeuer stood next him. The diuels are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst, euery one runnes and makes what shift he can for himselfe, the sessions is dissolued, the bench and bale-docke cleered, and all in generall so affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that euer since that accident the very name hath beene so terrible amongst them, as they had rather entertaine into their darke and sad dominions tenne thousand of their wiues, then any one man who beares the least character of a cuckold. But hauing done with this sporting, I proceede to what is more serious.</p>

                  <p>IT is reported of the wiues of Wynbergen, a free place in Germany, that the towne being taken in an assault by the Emperour, and by reason the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisens in so valiantlie defending their liues and honours, had beene the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the greatest part of his army; the Emperour grew so inplacable, that he purposed (though mercy to the women) yet vpon the men a bloody re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. Composition being granted and articles drawne for the surrender of the towne, it was lawfull for the matrons and virgins (by the Emperours edict) to carry out, of their owne necessaries, a burden of what they best liked. The Emperour (not dreaming but that they would load themselues with their iewels and coyne, rich garments and such like) might perceiue them issuing from the Ports, with euery wife her husband vpon her backe, and euery vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and damsell her father or brother: to expresse as much loue in preseruing their liues then, as the men had before, valour in defending their liberties.

So after many persuasiue motiues to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his fainting resolution, she intended to dye with him in her armes: and to that purpose, least her hold by accident or affright should vnloose, she with a cord bound fast their bodies together, and taking him in her louing imbraces from an high window which ouerlooked part of the sea, cast themselues both headlong into the water.

Further he was proceeding, when I stayd his penne, and so stopt the torrent of his poeticall rapture, and laid before him so many noble histories of glorious and illustrious women, some already in this tractate, and others hereafter to be remembred; that he forsooke his late apostacy, confest his errour, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended a new beleefe, professing himselfe futurely to bee a constant cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of their honours and vertues.

But this is my encouragement to proceede, because I can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of History to the disgrace of the bad and vicious, which addes not to the honour of the good and vertuous. Were none foule, what benefit were it to be faire? and if none deformed, what grace could it be to be well featured? There were no honour to be ascribed to modestie, but that we see the dishonour of immodestie depending; nor to the temperate, but that we dayly find the inconueniences inherent to ryot and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. Besides, were all alike faire, what prayse were it to be beautifull? or if all alike chast, what admiration could be attributed to so rare a Vertue? As we see in the trying of mettalls there is the gold and the drosse; in the progresse of time, there is day and night, comprehending light, and darknes; in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, there is the immortall soule and the corruptible flesh. And as it hath pleased the diuine prouidence to prouide a heauen and a hell, the one to crowne the vertuous, the other to condemne the wicked: so there is a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of number to people both, nor are the torments of the one more feelingly apprehended than in contemplating the ioyes and felicities of the other. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst artificers, vessells are made some for honour, some for dishonour; in all estates there are the noble and the base; amongst Princes, the good king and the tyrant; amongst subiects, the true liegeman and the traytour; in schooles, the learned and the ignorant; amongst magistrates, the wise and the foolish; if one be bountifull, another is auaritious and griping; if one pious and religious, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers atheisticall and prophane: neither is the vilenesse of the one any asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or blemish to the other, but rather as a foyle to set it off with more lustre and beautie. Those therefore that are before presented, are to imitate: the rest that in this next booke succeede, to beware and shunne.

the part of securitie, willingly to swallow himselfe vp in the quick-sands: therefore I wish you all to striue, that the beautie of your mindes may still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede that of your bodies; because the first apprehends a noble diuinitie, the last is subiect to all frailtie: and as the higher powers haue bestowed on you fairenesse aboue man, to equall that excellencie of iudgement and wisedome in which man claimes iustly a prioritie before you, so it is both behoouefull and becomming your Sex, that your outward perfections should altogether aime at the inward pulchritude of the mind; since the first is accidentall and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall, the last stable and permanent. Besides, if beautie bee once branded with impudence or inchastitie, it makes that which in it selfe is both laudable and desired, reiected and altogether despised. For vertue once violated, brings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and dishonour, not onely to the person offending, but contaminates the whole progenie; nay more, lookes backe euen to the iniured ashes of the ancestours, bee they neuer so noble: for the mind, as the body, in the act of adulterie being both corrupted, makes the action infamous and dishonourable, dispersing the poyson of the sinne euen amongst those from whom she deriues her birth; as if with her earthly being they had giuen her therewith her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and the first occasion of this her infamie. It extends likewise to the posteritie which shall arise from so corrupt a seed, generated from vnlawfull and adulterate copulation. How chary then ought a faire woman to be, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then her bodily beautie with that of the mind? Of what small continuance it is, and how nature hath disposed of your age, you should consider: the beautie of your Cradle you cannot apprehend, nor of your Childhood, and therfore in it you can neither take pride nor delight, or if you could, it is not yet perfect. When you grow ripe for marriage, and that it beginnes to attract you sutors and seruants, it growes to budde, and is then commonly in the blossome, when you haue made choice of a husband: as you begin to be the fruitfull mother of children, so one by one the leaues fade and fall away. Alas, how swiftlie doth Age with wrinkles steale vpon you, and then where is that admiration it before attracted? neither is that small season free from the blastings of disease and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker wormes of sicknesse, able to make the fairest amongst you to looke aged in her youth. Then may the choicest of you with beautifull <hi>Lais,</hi> who when she saw the Lillies in her brow faded, and the Roses in her chekes withered, the Diamonds in her eyes loose their lustre, and the Rubies in her lippes their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour (as being now growne in yeares) in these words giue vp your looking-glasses backe to <hi>Venus.</hi>

Vpon this presumption, she stretched her vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so farre, that she commaunded them to lay hands vpon the king her husband before night, and committing him to prison, caused him within few daies to be put to death. She had by <hi>Ninus</hi> one sonne called <hi>Ninus</hi> junior, who should haue succeeded his father, that for fiftie two yeares space had swaied the Babylonian Empire: but whether in her owne ambition desirous of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie, or finding her sonne too effeminate to be lord ouer so great a people, and vncertaine withall, whether so many men, and of so many sundrie nations would submit themselues to the soueraigntie of a woman, all these suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions being doubtfull, certaine it is that in the steade of the mother of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> shee assumed the person of <hi>Ninus</hi> hir sonne, changing her womans shape into the habit of a mans; for they were of one stature, proportioned in linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alike, semblant in voice, and in all accomplements difficultly to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, in somuch that neuer mother and child could haue more true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance: hauing therefore luld her sonne in all effeminacie, and attired him in her queenelike vesture, the better to shadow her owne proportion she sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her selfe in long garments, and commanded all her subiects to do the like; which habit hath bin amongst the Assirians, Bactrians, &amp; Babylonians in vse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to this day.

She therefore confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Dedalus,</hi> a great Artsmaster (one that for murder had fled from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and with his sonne <hi>Icarus</hi> there secured himselfe) hee deuised by his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous skill, a wodden cow, hollowed within with such artificiall conuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that the Queene inclosed, had satisfaction of her desires to the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of her libidinons appetite.

                     <p>THese might seeme fearfull enough before related, but I will giue you a short tast of some more abhominable: I haue shewed the examples of Lust, but these following are besides lust polluted with vnheard of tyranny. <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in his third booke speaking at large of the life and acts of <hi>Cambyses</hi> the great Persian king, and sonne of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> relates, that hauing shewed his puissance abroad in Aegipt, Greece, and other places, to the terror of the greatest of the world: he caused his innocent brother <hi>Smerdis</hi> to be secretly made away by the hand of his most trusted <hi>Praxaspes.</hi> The next inhumanitie which he purposd to exemplifie vnto the world, was the death of his sister, who followed him in his Campe to Aegipt, and back againe: being not only his sister by parents, but his wife also. The manner how she came to be his queene was as followeth; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, it was not lawfull, but punishable amongst the Persians, to marry into that proximitie of blood: but <hi>Cambyses</hi> surprised with the loue of his sister, and hauing resolued by what meanes soeuer to make her his wife, yet to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour his purpose, he sent for those honorable persons who were stiled the kings Iudges, being selected men for their wisedomes, and of great place and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as those that inioy their offices <hi>Durante vita,</hi> vnlesse some capitall crime bee prooued against them; besides, they are the expounders of the lawes, and to their causes all matters of doubt and controuersie are referred. These being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>uented, the king demanded of them, Whether they had any one law amongst so many, which licenst a man (that had a will so to doe) to contract matrimony with his sister? to whom the Iudges thus ingeniously answered: <hi>We haue indeed no law which giues licence for a brother to marry with a sister, but we haue found a law (oh Soueraigne) which warrants the king of Persia to doe whatsoeuer liketh him best.</hi> Thus they without abrogation of the Persian lawes soothed the kings humour, and preserued their owne honours aud liues, who had they crost him in the least of his disseignes had all vndoubtedly perisht: This hee made the ground for the marriage of the first, and not long after hee aduentured vpon the second.

                     <p>In his latter daies he was present at Thebes at their great feast called Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia, and from thence comming to Ius and sitting on a stone by the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, there landed some fishermen, whom <hi>Homer</hi> asked what they had taken, but they hauing got nothing that day, but for want of other worke onely lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues, thus merilie answered him:
<q>
                           <l>Non capta afferimus: fuerant quae capta relictis.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>Meaning, that all such vermine as they could catch they cast away, but what they could not take they brought along. Which riddle when <hi>Homer</hi> could not vnfold, it is sayd that for verie griefe hee ended his life. This vnmatchable Poet whom no man regarded in his life, yet when his workes were better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of after his death, hee had that honour that seuen famous citties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about the place of his birth, euerie one of them appropriating it vnto themselues: <hi>Pindarus</hi> the Poet makes question whether he were of Chius or Smyrna; <hi>Simonides</hi> affirmes him to be of Chius; <hi>Antimachus</hi> and <hi>Nicander</hi> of Colophon; <hi>Aristotle</hi> the Philosopher to bee of IÃ¼s; <hi>Ephorus</hi> the Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher that hee was of Cuma.

But I may haue occasion to speake of him in a larger worke intituled The liues of all the Poets Moderne and Forreigne, to which worke (if it come once againe into my hands) I shall refer you, concluding him with this short Epitaph:

                        <note place="margin">A strange Incest.</note> that this accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in Erphurst in Germanie: There was (saith he) a maid of an honest familie that was seruant to a rich widdow, who had a sonne that had many times importuned the gyrle to leaudnesse, insomuch that shee had no other way to auoide his continuall suggestions, but by acquainting the mother with the dissolut courses of the sonne. The widdow considering with herselfe which was the best course to chide his libidinous purpose and diuert him from that leaud course, plotted with the maid to giue him a seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and to appoint him a place and time in the night, of meeting, at which he should haue the fruition of what he so long had sued for: shee herselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to supplie the place of her seruant, to schoole her son, and so preuent any inconuenience that might futurely happen. The maid did according to her appointment, the sonne with great ioy keepes his houre, so did the mother, who came thither on purpose to reforme her sonne; but he being hot and too forward in the action, and she ouercome, either by the inticements of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, the weakenesse of her Sex, or both, gaue herselfe vp to Incestuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, the young man knowing no otherwise but that hee had inioyed the maid. Of this wicked and abhominable congression, a woman child was begot of whom the mother (to saue her reputation) was secretly deliuered, and put it out priuately to nourse, but at the age of seuen yeares tooke it home. When this child grew to yeares, the most infortunate sonne fell in loue with his sister, and daughter, and made her his vnhappie wife: what shall I thinke of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable sinne, which euen beasts themselues abhor? of which I will giue you present instance.<note place="margin">

                     <p>THis that I now speake of is remembred by <hi>Ranulphus,</hi> Monke of Chester, <hi>Ierome,</hi> and others. There was a man in Ierusalem by name <hi>Reuben,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Isachar,</hi> his wife was called <hi>Cyborea:</hi> The first night of their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the woman dreamed that she was conceiued of a sonne who should bee a traytour to the Prince of his owne people: she told it to her husband, at which they were both sad and pensiue. The child being borne, and they not willing to haue it slaine, and yet loath to haue it prooue such a monster to his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they in a small boat cast it to sea to try a desperate fortune, this vessell was driuen vpon an Island called Iscariot, where the Queene of that place had then no child. This babe being found, she purposed to make it her owne, and put it to be nobly nurced and educated, calling his name <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Iscariot</hi> of the Island where he was taken vp. But not long after, shee was conceiued of a sonne, who prouing a noble and hopefull gentleman, <hi>Iudas</hi> (whose fauour in court began to wane, and his hope of inheritance, which but late flourisht now quite to wither) he plotted against his life and priuately slew him: but fearing least the murder might in time bee discouered, and hee compeld to suffer according to the nature of the fact, hee fled thence to Ierusalem, where he got into the seruice of <hi>Pontius Pilatus,</hi> and found meanes to be prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by him, being then in the cittie deputie gouernour for the Romans. <hi>Iudas</hi> (because their dispositions were much of one condition) grew into his especiall familiaritie and fauour. The Pallace of <hi>Pilot</hi> hauing a faire bay window, whose prospect was into <hi>Reubens</hi> Orchard, he had a great appetite to eate of some of those ripe apples which shewed so yellow and faire against the sunne. This <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> vnderstanding, promist him to fetch him some of that fruit, and mounting ouer the orchard wall, he was met by his father, who rebuking him for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, <hi>Iudas</hi> with a stone beat out his braines, and vnseene of any, conueyed himselfe backe. <hi>Reubens</hi> death was smothered, and the murderer not knowne. <hi>Cyborea</hi> being a rich widdow, <hi>Pylate</hi> made a match betwixt her and his seruant <hi>Iudas,</hi> who being marryed to his mother was now possest of his owne fathers inheritance. Not long this incestuous couple had liued together, but <hi>Cyborea</hi> being vpon a time wondrous sad and melancholy, and <hi>Iudas</hi> demanding the cause, she began to relate to him her many misfortunes; First, of her dreame, then of her sonne in what manner he was put to sea, then how she lost her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being slaine, and the murderer not found; and lastly, how by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Pilat</hi> she was now compeld to match against her will, who had protested to her selfe a lasting widdowhood. By these circumstances, <hi>Iudas</hi> most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly knew that he had slaine his father, and had marryed his mother; which acknowledging to her, she persuaded him to repent him of these great euills, and to become a Disciple of Iesus, who was then an eminent Prophet amongst the Iewes.

In this height of fortune, as neuer hauing knowne any disaster, hauing bestowed some time in managing the affaires of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and next such places as he occupyed in Macedonia; he priuately then retyred himselfe into Asia, where he tooke view of the scituation of those defensed citties, and this without the iealousie or suspition of any. From thence he remooued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into Bythinia, proposing in his owne imaginations as if hee were already Lord of all. After this long retirement hee came into his owne kingdome, where by reason of his absence, it was rumoured and giuen out for truth that he was dead. At his arriuall he first gaue a louing and friendly visitation to his wife and sister <hi>Laodice,</hi> who had not long before in that vacancie brought him a young sonne. But in this great ioy and solemnitie made for his welcome, hee was in great danger of poyson:<note place="margin">An vnnatural wife.</note> for <hi>Laodice</hi> supposing (it seemes) <hi>Mithridates</hi> to be dead as it before had beene reported (and therefore safe enough) had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted her selfe to diuers of her seruants and subiects: and now fearing the discouerie of her adulterie, shee thought to shaddow a mightie fault with a greater mischiefe, and therefore prouided this poysoned draught for his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20365:98"/>
But the king hauing intelligence thereof by one of her handmaides who deceiued her in her trust, expiated the treason with the bloods of all the conspirators. I reade of another <hi>Laodice</hi> the wife of <hi>Ariarythres</hi> the king of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia, who hauing six hopefull sonnes by her husband, poysoned fiue of them, after she had before giuen him his last infectious draught; the youngest was miraculously preserued from the like fate, who after her decease (for the people punisht her crueltie with death) succeeded in the kingdome. It is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the greeke Commentaries, by what reason or remedy affection once so diuelishly setled in the brest or heart of a woman, may bee altered or remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; or by what confection adulterous appetite, once lodged and kindled in the bosome, may bee extinguished. The Magitians haue deliuered it to bee a thing possible; so likewise <hi>Cadmus Milesius,</hi> who amongst other monuments of history writ certaine tractates concerning the abolishing of loue (for so it is remembred by <hi>Suidas</hi> iu his collections.) And therefore I would inuite all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of corrupted breasts to the reading of this briefe discourse following. A remarkeable example was that of <hi>Faustina,</hi>

The Emperour perceiuing this distraction still to grow more and more vpon his daughter, consulted with the Chaldaeans and Mathematicians in so desperat a case what was best to bee done: after long consideration it was concluded amongst them, that there was but onely one way left open to her recouerie, and that was, to cause the fencer to be slaine; which done, to giue her a full cuppe of his luke-warme blood, which hauing drunke off, to goe instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to bed to her husband.

The Magitian in this interim was not onely possest of all the Kings Pallaces and Treasures, but he inioyed all his wiues and concubines; amongst which was a beautifull Lady called <hi>Phaedima,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Otanes,</hi> a man of great power amongst the Persians.<note place="margin">

He then sent her word, that if she her selfe could not come to the sight of him, to demaund of <hi>Atossa</hi> the daughter of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and brother to <hi>Smerdis;</hi> who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse could decipher him in euery true lineament.

This answer made <hi>Otanes</hi> the more and more suspitious, and desirous with any danger to finde out the truth, he aduentured a third message to <hi>Phaedima</hi> to this purpose: It behooues you (Ã´ daughter) being descended from noble ancestours, to vndergoe any hazzard, especially at the request of your father, when it aimes at the generall good of the common-weale and kingdome; if that imposter bee not <hi>Smerdis</hi> the brother of <hi>Cambises</hi> (as I much feare) it becoms him neither to prostitute and defile your body, nor to mocke and abuse the whole estate of Persia vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: therefore I charge you as you tender my loue, your owne honour, and the Empires weale, that the next night when you are called vnto his bed, you watch the time when he is soundliest asleepe, and then with your fingers gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feele both the sides of his head; if thou perceiuest him to haue both his eares, presume then thou lodgest by the side of <hi>Smerdis</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but if on the contrary thou findest his eares wanting, then thou lyest in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of <hi>Smerdis</hi> that base Magitian. To this she replyed by letter, Though I truely apprehend the danger, should I be taken seeking of such things as hee perhaps knowes wanting (which can be no lesse than death) yet for your loue and the common good, I will vndergoe the perill: and with this briefe answer gaue satisfaction to her father. But greater content he receiued from her, when hauing discouered and layd open whatsoeuer her father suspected, she sent him a faithfull relation of euery circumstance.<note place="margin">Deceit disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</note> These things discouered by <hi>Phaedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Otanes</hi> makes a coniuration amongst the Princes, all vowing the supplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this vsurper: who in the interim, the more to confirme the people in their errour, he sent to <hi>Praxaspes,</hi> promising him honours and treasures, but to pronounce him once more before the people to bee the true and legitimate heire.

But the plaine honest man knowing her spleene and his own innocencie, he called his wife to him at the instant when his head was to be cut off: and besought her as she euer tendered his former loue (which towards her he had kept inuiolate) to meditate vpon some course or other by which his guiltlesse and vnmerited death might be made manifest to the world: which she with much sorrow and many teares hauing promised, hee gently submitted to his fate, and his bodie was deliuered to the charge of his widdow. Within few dayes after, the Emperour kept a day solemne, in which his custome was, being mounted vpon his royall Throne, to examine the causes of the fatherlesse and widdows, and to search wherein they were oppressed, and by whom, and in person to doe them justice. Among the rest came this iniured widdow and brings her husbands head in her hand, humblie kneeling before the Emperors throne, demaunding of him, What that inhumane wretch deserued, who had caused an innocent man to be put to death? to whom the Emperour replyed, Produce that man before the judgement seat, and as I am royall hee shall assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly loose his head.

These things being in order related to <hi>Cassander,</hi> he with all speede possible hastens towards the cittie Pictua, and inuests himselfe before it, compassing the place with an inuincible siege. <hi>Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias</hi> being now oppressed both with sword and famine, besides all the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies depending vpon a long and tedious warre, treated vpon conditions, in which her safe conduct, with her traines, being comprehended, she was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to submit her selfe into the hands of the conqueror: at whose mercie, whilest her wauering fortunes yet stood, <hi>Cassander</hi> conuents the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and in a publike oration desires to be counselled by them how to dispose of the queene; hauing before subborned the parents of such whose children she had caused to be murdered, who in sad and funerall habits, should accuse the crueltie and inhumanitie of <hi>Olimpias.</hi> Their teares made such a passionate impression in the breasts of the Macedonians, that with loude acclamations they doomed her to present slaughter, most vnnaturally forgetting that both by <hi>Philip</hi> her husband, and <hi>Alexander</hi> her sonne, their liues and fortunes were not onely safe amongst their neighbour nations, but they were also possessed of forreine Empire and riches from prouinces till their times scarce heard of, but altogether vnknowne.

                     <p>ABout the time that the Hunnes came first into Italie and expelled the Longobards, they layd siege to the cittie Anguilaea, and in a hot assault ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing slaine the duke <hi>Gysulphus,</hi> his wife (the dutchesse <hi>Romilda</hi>) making the Towne defensible, brauely and resolutely maintained it against the enemie. But as <hi>Cacana</hi> king of the Anes approched neer vnto the walls, incouraging his souldiers to hang vp their scaling ladders and enter; <hi>Romilda</hi> at the same time looking from a Cittadel, cast her eie vpon the king, who as he seemed vnto her, with wonderous dexteritie behaued himselfe, and with an extraordinarie grace became his armes. This liking grew into an ardencie of loue, for shee that at first but allowed of his presence, now was affected to his person: in so much that in the most fierce assaults, though within the danger of their crosse-bows and slings, she thought her selfe secure, so she had the king her obiect. This fire was alreadie kindled in her brest, which nothing could qualifie, in so much that impatient of all delay, shee sent vnto her publike enemie priuate messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, That if it pleased the king (being as she vnderstood a batchilor) to accept her as his bride, she would without further opposition surrender vp the towne peaceably into his hands: these conditions are first debated, next concluded, and lastly confirmed by oath on both sides. The towne is yeelded vp, and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana</hi> according to his promise takes <hi>Romilda</hi> to wife, but first he makes spoyle of the towne, kills manie, and leads the rest captiue. The first night he bedded with his new reconciled bride, but in the morning abandoned her vtterly, commanding twelue Hunnes, and those of the basest of his souldiers, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another to prostitute her by turnes: that done, hee caused a sharpe stake to bee placed in the middle of the field,<note place="margin">A miserable death.</note> and pitched her naked bodie vpon the top thereof, which entering through the same made a miserable end of her life, at which sight the tyrant laughing said, <hi>Such a husband best becomes so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse an harlot.</hi> This was the bloodie and miserable end (as <hi>Polycronicon</hi> saith) of <hi>Romilda.</hi> But better it happened to her two beautifull and chast daughters, who fearing the outrage of the lustfull and intemperat souldiors tooke putrified flesh of chickens and colts,<note place="margin">A rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie.</note> and hid it raw betwixt their breasts: the souldiors approaching them, tooke them to be diseased, as not able to come neere them by reason of the smell; by which meanes they preserued their honours for the present, and they for their vertues sake were after bestowed vpon gentlemen of noble qualitie. The same Authour puts me in mind of another Adulteresse, who to her guilt of inchastitie added the bloody sin of murder. Our moderne Chroniclers remember vs of one <hi>Ethelburga,</hi>

the kings breast, that the wrinckles of all suggestions were cleared, and shee freely admitted into the kings court, and by degrees into his especiall fauour: so rich were her iewells, so gorgeous her attire, so tempting her beautie being now in her prime, and withall so cunning and deceitfull her behauiour; that all these agreeing together, not onely bated the hearts of the courtiers, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the eyes of the great Maiestie it selfe, in so much, that the king spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with her in a great Bay window, the prince his son then standing by him, he merrily demanded of her, If she were instantly to make election of a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whether she would chuse him or his sonne? to whom shee rashly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That of the two she would make choice of his son. The king at this som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what mooued and obseruing in her a lightnesse of behauiour, which his blind affection would not suffer him before to looke into, thus replied, <hi>Haddest thou made election of mee, I had possest thee of my sonne; but in chusing him, thou shalt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy neither.</hi> So turning from her, commaunded her to be stripped out of her jewells and gay ornaments, and presently to be shriuen and sent to a monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: where she had not long beene cloystred, but to her owne infamie, and the disgrace of the religious house, she was deprehended in the dissolute imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a wanton and leaude fellow, for which she was turned out of the cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and after died in great pouertie and miserie. In memorie of whom there was a law established amongst the West-Saxons, which disabled all the kings wiues after her, either to be dignified with the name of queene, or vpon any occasion to fit with him in his regall throne: yet this woman, though she died poorely, yet died (as it is said) penitently, therefore me thinkes I heare her leaue this or the like memorie behind her.</p>

They that can containe themselues within these few prescriptions, may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly store vp a good name to themselues, and honour to their posteritie: But what the neglect of these may grow vnto, I will in some sort illustrate vnto you in a moderne Historie lately happening,<note place="margin">A true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> and in mine owne knowledge. An antient gentleman, as well growne in reputation, as yeares, and in those parts where he liued hauing purchased to himselfe a generall respect for both, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed a beautifull young gentlewoman of good parts and parentage: But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no issue by her, he selected vnto his acquaintance a noble young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, one that had trauelled France, Italy, Spaine, and had beene at the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre: making that happy vse of his trauell, that he was able to discourse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and without affectation either of the scituation of citties, or the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and customes of people; and in one word to giue him his owne deserued character, there was nothing in him wanting that might become a perfect and a compleat gentleman. This young mans father was a great friend and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar neighbour to this old man before spoken of, who had obserued his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and curteous behauior euen from his infancie, and therefore was the more affected to his discourse and company: his affection grew so farre that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to make him a peece of his heire. Whilest they continued in this famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aritie (and the young man still frequented the house) there grew great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance betwixt him and the gentlewoman: No maruell, for they had bin play-fellowes and schoole fellowes, and by reason of their paritie in yeares, vsed though an honest, yet a kind of suspected familiaritie; insomuch that it grew to a calumnie, till passing from one man to another, it ariued at length to the eares of the young mans father, who sorted opportunitie to talke with his sonne, demaunding of him how that fire was kindled from whence this smoke grew: who, notwithstanding many protestations of his owne innocence, in which he derogated nothing from truth, was charged by his father (to auoid all rumor and aspertion) to forbeare the occasion and absent himselfe from the house, and this he imposed him vpon his blessing. To this the young man with great modestie assented; as vnwilling to contradict his fathers counsell as to increase that iniurious suspition concerning the gentlewomans honour, which was vndeseruedly called in question. It is to be vnderstood, that many friendly and modest courtesies had past betwixt this young couple, in so much that hauing all libertie granted both of societie and discourse, hee prest her vpon a time so farre, to know if it should please God to call away her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (being verie old and by the course of nature not likely to liue long) how
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20365:103"/>
she purposed to dispose of her selfe. To whom she protested, that though she wisht her aged husband all long life and happinesse, yet if it pleased the higher powers to lay the crosse of widdowhood vpon her, she would if so hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, conferre vpon him her youth, her fortunes, and whatsoeuer shee was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with, before any other man liuing, if it pleased him to accept of them, and this she bound with an oath: This the gentleman (betwixt honouring and louing her) could not chuse but take wondrous kindly at her hands, and vowed to her the like. The conditions on both sides were accepted, onely as shee had bound her selfe by one oath, she imposed vpon him another, namely, that till that time of her widdowhood, he should neither associate him priuately, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse nor contract matrimonie with any woman whatsoeuer. These things thus accorded betwixt them, yet the fathers coniurations so farre persuaded with the sonnes obedience, that notwithstanding many vrgent and important messages from the good old man the husband (who wondered what distast might breed his sudden discontinuance, as suspecting nothing from either) he still excused his absence and forbore the house. It happened that some month after riding to a market towne not farre off equally distant betwixt his owne fathers house and the old gentlemans, to giue a meeting to some gentlemen of the countrey, by chance he happened vpon a chambermaide that belonged to his betrothed mistresse, whom he well knew; he saluted her and she him, and after some complement past betwixt them, he asking how euery body did at home, and she on the other side wondering at his strangenes, telling him how long he had beene expected, and how much desired of all the house: these things ouer, he intreated her to drinke a cup of wine, which the maide wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted. They being alone and falling into discourse of many old pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages well knowne to them both, the young man began to speake how much he respected her mistresse, and how dearely tendered her honour: she on the other side began a cleane contrarie discourse, as that for his own part she knew him to be a noble gentleman and well parted, one whom her old master affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted aboue all men; proceeding, that she was not altogether ignorant what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities had past betwixt him and her mistresse, who onely bore him faire outwardly and in shew, when another inioyed both her heart and body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warldly and in act, and that vpon her owne knowledge; and to confirme her accusation, nominated the man (who was his neerest and most familiar friend.) At this report the gentleman was startled, but better considering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, told her he thankt her for her loue, but could by no meanes beleeue her relation; first by reason he knew her ladies breeding, and was confirmed in her knowne modestie and vertue, as hauing himselfe made tryall of both to the vttermost, hauing time, place, and opportunitie, all things that might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get temptation. Lastly, for his friend, in all their continuall and daily conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation he neuer perceiued either familiar discourse, wanton behauiour, or so much as the least glance of eye to passe suspitiously betwixt them. To which she answered, it was so much the more cunningly carryed; for her owne part she had but done the office of a friend, and so left him, but in a thousand strange cogitations: yet loue persuading aboue iealousie, he began againe to itterate and call to mind, with what an outward integritie shee had still borne her selfe towards him, and with a puritie by no womans art to be dissembled. Next he bethought himselfe, that perhaps the maid might bee falne in loue with him, and by this calumny might seeke to diuert him from the affection of her mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:20365:103"/>
by this meanes thought to reuenge her selfe. In the middest of these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, or rather distractions came another letter from the husband, complaining of his absence, wondring at the cause, and vrgently desiring his company, though neuer so priuate, where hee would reconcile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe touching any vnkindnesses that might bee conceiued, and withall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue him what hee should trust to concerning some part of his lands. The gentleman still remembring his fathers charge, yet thought a little to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with it, and writ backe word (knowing euery part of the house by reason of his long frequenting it) That if he pleased to leaue his garden doore open at such a time of the night, hee would accept of such prouision as hee found, and be merry with him for an houre or two, and giue good reason for his vnwilling discontinuance; but thus prouided, that neither wife, friend, nor seruant (sauing that one whom hee trusted with his message) might bee acquainted with his comming in or going out. This was concluded, the time of night appointed, and euery thing accordingly prouided: They met, the old man gaue him kind and freely entertainment, seeming ouerioyed with his companie, and demaunding the reason of his so great strangenesse; Hee answered, that notwithstanding his owne innocence, and his wiues approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Temperance, yet bad tongues had beene busie to their reproach, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring them by their owne corrupt intents, and therefore to auoyde all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation whatsoeuer, his study was by taking away the cause to preuent the effect: his reason was approoued, and the old man satisfied concerning both their integrities. Time calls the old man to his bedde, and the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is left to his rest, purposing to bee gone early in the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of the houshold should bee awake and stirring. Beeing now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and not able to sleepe in regard of a thousand distracted fancies that were pondering in his minde and braine: hee arose from his bedde, and walking vp and downe the chamber, after some meditation, as of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, her vowes, her protestation, her oathes, all pleading together in the behalfe of her innocencie so farre preuailed with him, That considering hee was now in the same house, and that by reason of the old mans age they very often lay asunder, that hee was acquainted with euery stayre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case, and knew the ready way to her chamber; Loue conquering all sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, hee purposed once more to visite the place where hee had (but euer honestly) sate with her at all houres, and where their intended mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was by their interchange of oathes at first confirmed. With this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose stealing softly vp the stayres, and listening at the doore before hee would presume to knocke, hee might heare a soft whispering, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times growing lowder, hee might plainely distinguish two voyces (hers, and that gentlemans his supposed friend, whom the maide had before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated) where hee might euidently vnderstand more than protestations passe betwixt them, namely the mechall sinne it selfe.

worst of enuy. Therefore hee instantly made himselfe ready, left the place, and without the knowledge of any man or discouering to any what had past, returned to his fathers: where pondering at full with himselfe, the nature of his abuse (beeing beyond example) the strictnesse of his oath, beeing not onely debarred from marriage, but as it were banished from the societie of women; that shee onely reserued him as a stale or shadow, whilest another carryed away the substance; that shee kept her selfe to bee his wife, and anothers whore; and that from all these no safe euasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could bee deuised to come off towards her like a gentleman, or tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards God like a Christian; all these iniuries ioyntly considered, droue him into a suddaine melancholie, that melancholie into a doubtfull sicknesse, and that sicknesse into a dangerous distraction, in so much that his life was much feared, and hee with great difficultie recouered: but by the helpe of good Physitions being cured, and the counsell of his best friends comforted; he at length gathered strength, and prepared himselfe for a second trauell, with purpose neuer more to reuisite his countrey where such an vnnaturall mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster was bred. But before his departure, the old man hearing what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, sent for him to his house to take of him an vnwilling leaue: at the importunitie of his owne father he was forced to accompany him thither, where hee must of necessitie take another view of his betrothed mistresse and his treacherous friend. Dinner being past with his much impatience, it was generally imputed to his loath to depart; when his sadnesse was meerely grounded vpon her impudence. Parting growing on, she singles him for a farewell, weeping in his bosome, wringing him by the hand, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to haue a care of his safetie, but especially of his vow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; all which proceeded from such a counterfeit passion, as hee almost began to question, what in his owne notion hee knew to bee infallible. But in stead of reply hee deliuered her a letter, which hee intreated her to vouchsafe to peruse in his absence, in which his minde was fully sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. Imagine them with the rest of the companie diuided, euery one wishing the gentleman good speede and safe returne: when shee rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her selfe, opens the letter, wherein was layd open euery passage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her lust, what hee himselfe personally had heard and knowne, the place where, the time when, the very words whispered, with euery vndeniable circumstance, and these exprest with such passionate effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in which hee laboured to make knowne his iniuries, and her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries (the sole occasions of his voluntarie exile;) all these (I say) were so feelingly set downe, that they strooke her to the heart, insomuch that shee fell into a present frenzie, and dispairingly soone after dyed. Which newes came to the gentleman before hee had past Grauesend, by which hee vnderstood himselfe to be quite released of all his intricate oathes and promises: whose noble disposition the old gentleman vnderstanding, insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in a great part of his land, which he inioyes to this day, and in my opinion, not altogether vndeseruedly.</p>

                        </note> was for face, feature, and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature, far surpassing all the Virgins of her time; in so much that hee not onely greatly desired to see her, but purposed that if her beautie were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way answerable to that which fame had blazoned her to be, to make her his Queene. This secret apprehension hee communicated to one Earle <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold,</hi> a noble gentleman, in his great fauour and best acquainted with his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacies, commanding him to make a iourney to the Earle of Deuonshire her father, and there to take of her a free and full surueigh, and finding her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the publique rumor, not onely to demand her of the Earle <hi>Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> but to bring her along with her father royally attended like the bride of a king, to partake with him all regall honours. This iourney <hi>Ethelwold</hi> with great willingnesse vndertakes, without disclosing to any the secrets of his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage: and comming to the place where the damosell with her father then so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned, he was noblie entertained, as a fellow peere, and an especiall fauourit to the king. No sooner came the Ladie in presence, but <hi>Ethelwold</hi> began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that report had beene too niggardly in her praise, for hee had not in his lifetime seene a Ladie of so incomparable a feature, to whom all the Court-beauties appeared scarce good Christall to that vnmatchable Diamond. What cannot loue worke in the heart of man, when such a beautie is his obiect? it makes the sonne forget his father, and the father not remember that hee hath a sonne, but either hath made the others bed incestuous: It hath subiected cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and depopulated countries, made the subiect forget his allegeance to his soueraigne, and the soueraigne most vnnaturall and inhumane to his subiect, as may appeare by this historie. This Earle surprised with the loue of this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, hath either quite forgot the message he was sent about, or else is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to remember it. Not speaking of the king at all, but counterfeiting some occasions into that countrey, and as if he had happened vpon that place by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, or come to giue him visitation in noble courtesie; at supper finds dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning the Ladie, and at length preuailed so farre with the old earle that they were contracted that night, and the next morning married. After some few daies soiourne there, the kings impositions inforced him to take an vnwilling farewell of his new married bride, onely at parting he earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them for diuerse reasons which much imported him, to keepe the marriage as secret as possibly might bee, and so posted backe to the Court. He was no sooner arriued, but the king was busily inquisitiue concerning the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Ladie, how tall, how straight, of what haire, what complection, whether her lookes were cheerfull or sad, her behauiour sober or suspitious.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20365:105"/>
To all which he answered in few, she was indeed a Ladie, and that was her best, an Earles daughter and therfore flattered, for what in a priuat woman is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, is in such excellent; and what in the former praise worthie, in the latter rare and admirable: but for this Ladie <hi>Elfritha</hi> she was a course home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponne peece of flesh, whose nobilitie and dower might make her capable of beeing wife to some honest Iustice of peace, or Sherife of the shire, but not becomming the bed of any of the nobilitie (vnlesse some one whose estate was decayd;) indeed a meer Rooke, and most vnworthie the eye of the prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eagle. With this answere the king was satisfied, and for the present disposed his affection elsewhere, immagining these prayses might be diuulged abroad as well in scorne of her person as otherwise, so for some few weekes it rested: in which interim <hi>Ethelwold</hi> was oft mist in the court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This bred some iealosie in the king, and the rather because the fame of this Ladies vnmatched beautie more and more increased. Therefore to bee more punctually informed of the truth, he sent another priuat messenger, who brought him intelligence how all things stood, with the certeintie of euerie accident how it befell. The king not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to disgest such an iniurie from a subiect, smothered his grieuance for a space, and at length caused the gests to bee drawne, for hee purposed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse into the West. <hi>Ethelwold</hi> yet nothing suspecting, was the formost man to attend the king vpon his iourney: but when they came almost to Excester, he began to mistrust the kings purpose, the rather because hee sent to the Earle <hi>Orgarus</hi> that at such a time hee meant to feast with him. Now must <hi>Ethelwold</hi> bestirre himselfe, or instantly hazard the kings high displeasure: he therefore posts in the night to his wife and to his father in law, reports the truth of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie circumstance from the beginning, how he was sent by the king, and to what purpose, how her beautie had so inflamed him that he was compelled by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of affection to deceiue the kings trust; and lastly, to secure his owne life, which for the loue of her he had hazarded, he was forced to disparage her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, dissemble her worth, and disgrace her beautie: and therefore besought her, as she tendered his safetie being her husband, either not to appeare before the king at all, or if she were called for and so compelled, to bee seene in that fashion as he had described her to his soueraign, namely with a smodged face, counterfeit haire, vncomely habit, and in her behauiour to put on such a garbe of folly as might rather breed loathing than any liking in his maiestie. The first of his speech she heard with patience, but when he came to deliuer to her how he had disparaged her beautie, and to the king too; nay more, would haue her derrogate from her owne worth, and be accessarie to the blasting of that beautie which nature had made so admirable, this her womanish spleene could hardly disgest: yet she soothed him vp with faire and promising language, and told him she would better consider of it, and so dismist him in part satisfied. In the morning he presented himselfe early to attend the king, who was that day to bee entertained by the earle his father in law.

Table, but I find no such matter remembered in my Author) the truth is, the king about the middest of dinner cald for the Earle <hi>Orgarus</hi> and demanded of him whether he had a wife or no, if he had, why he might not haue her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, knowing it was a generall obseruation in England, that without the wiues entertainement there could be no true and heartie welcome? The earle replied, that at that time he was an vnhappie widdower: he then demaunded, whether he had any children to continue his posteritie? to which he answered, heauen had onely blest him with one daughter a plaine damosell, yet the sole hope of his future memorie. The king was then importunate to see her, and commanded her to be instantly brought vnto his presence; which put <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold</hi> into a strange agonie, yet still hoping she had done as hee had late inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her, when shee (contrarie to his expectation) came in apparelled like a bride, in rich and costly vestures, her golden haire fairely kembed and part hanging downe in artificiall curles, her head stoocke with jewells, and about her neck a chaine of diamonds, which gaue a wonderous addition to that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which naked of it selfe without any ornament was not to bee paraleld; a contrarie effect it wrought in the king and her husband. To <hi>Edgar</hi> she seemed some goddesse, at least a miracle in nature; to <hi>Ethelwold</hi> (in regard of his feare) a furie, or what worse hee could compare her to. O fraile woman, in this one vanitie to appeare beautifull in the eyes of a king, thou hast committed two heinous and grieuous sinnes, Adulterie, and Murder, for accordingly it so fell out. <hi>Edgar</hi> was as much surprised with her loue, as incensed with hate against her lord, both which for the present he dissembled, neither smiling on the one, nor frowning on the other. In the afternoone the king would needes hunt the stagge in the forrest of Werwelly, since called Hoore-wood: In the chace, by the appointment of <hi>Edgar,</hi> Earle <hi>Ethelwold</hi> was strooke through the bodie with an arrow and so slaine, the king after made <hi>Elfritha</hi> his bride and queene. The Earle had a base sonne then present at the death of his father, of whom the king asked how hee liked that manner of hunting, to whom he answered, Royall sir, what seemeth good to you shal be to me no way offensiue: from that time forward he was euer gratious with the king. And <hi>Elfritha</hi> thinking to make attonement with heauen for the murder of her husband, or rather (as <hi>Ranulphus</hi> saith) for causing <hi>Edward</hi> (to whom she was step-mother) to be slaine, that her owne sonne <hi>Egelredus</hi> might raigne, builded an Abbie for Nunnes at Worwell, where she was after buried.</p>

He was no sooner dead but there came to carrie away his soule, an Angell and a Fiend, these two contended about it, the one would haue it, so would the other, great was the controuersie betwixt them; at length they concluded to put the case to duke <hi>Richard,</hi> &amp; both to stand to his arbitrement: much pleading there was on both sides, at length the duke gaue sentence, That the soule should be restored againe to the bodie, &amp; be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againe vpon that bridge from whence he had falne, and if then he would offer to goe from thence to his sweet heart, the diuell should take him; but if otherwise, he (because he was a Church-man) should be still in the Angels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. This was done, and the Monke left his way to the woman, and fled to the church, as to a sanctuarie, whether the duke went the next day and found the Monkes clothes still wet, and told the Abbot euerie circumstance as it fell out; therefore the Monke was shriuen, did penance, was absolued and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. This I haue read, which I persuade no man to beleeue. This duke liued with the faire <hi>Gunnora</hi> long time dishonestly and without marriage, had by her those children aforesaid, but at length by the persuasion of the nobilitie, and intercession of the cleargie, he tooke her to wife. The first night after the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage when the duke came to her bed, she turned her backe towards him, which she had neuer done till that time: at which hee maruelling, demaunded of her the reason why she did so.

I will conclude this discourse of Martyrs with one of our owne moderne stories: Our english chronicles report that <hi>Maximus</hi> the Emperour hauing held long warre with one <hi>Conon Meridock</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and bold Brittaine, hauing in many bloody conflicts sped diuersly, sometimes the victory inclining to one side, and then to another, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion to the losse of both; their hostilitie was by mediation at length at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned, and a firme peace establisht betwixt them: that done, <hi>Maximus</hi> made warre vpon the Galls, and inuading a Prouince then called America (but since Little Brittaine) he wonne it by the sword, and after surrendered it to <hi>Conon</hi> to hold it for euer as of the Kings of great Brittaine.

Hee answered him, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster kept great store of pullen about the house, and that was all Hennes doung. Hennes doung saith the gentleman, I haue a peece of land at home I would it were all there, if thou canst helpe me to any quantitie of it (being sure that it is such) I will giue thee twentie shillings a loade for as much as thou canst prouide, and fetch it away with mine owne carriage. The fellow hearing this, promised within a moneth to furnish him with twentie loade at least at the same price. The match was made, and the gentleman after breakefast tooke horse and departed. The hosteler bespeakes all such soyle as the Towne could affoord, or the next Villages by, and made such a huge heape as annoyed the whole yard (knowing the gentleman to haue beene euer a man of his word) who came according to the time appointed. The hosteler is glad to see him, and tells him he hath prouided him of his commoditie, and withall brings him to the place where it lay like a lays<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The gentleman seemes wondrous glad of this new merchandise, and drawes out certaine peeces out of his pocket, as if he meant to giue him present payment, but withall asked him, Art thou sure all this is Hens-doung? vpon my life it is saith the hosteler, expecting still to finger the gold. But (replyde the gentleman) art thou sure there is no cockes doung amonst it? Ã´ lord yes (saith the hosteler) how can it be else? why then quoth the gentleman I pray thee make thy best of it good friend, for if there be the least cockes doung amongst it, it will doe me no pleasure, I will not giue

thee three farthings for it all. Thus was the hosteler, notwithstanding his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cost, forced to remooue all that muckhill, and make the yard cleane at his owne charge, with much addition of mockerie and laughter. If for a little quantitie of cockes doung you cauell at all the rest here included, the better judgements I hope will impute it, as to my simplicitie, so to your ouer curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Another maine thing is to be feared, wherein I must of force incurre the censure of some or other, namely, Why amongst prophane histories I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted Martyres, and to confirme their truth haue brought Authors that haue beene held superstitious? I answere to all in generall, I haue onely specified such things as I haue read, and for mine owne opinion I keepe it reserued. But because I now come to a conclusion, I will end this booke thus briefly, in regard that women die, and so many die, and that they die at all, I will giue you a womans reason why it is so, <hi>Because they can liue no longer.</hi>

               <head>THE FIFTH BOOKE inscribed <hi>TERPSICHORE.</hi> Intreating of Amazons: and other Women famous either for Valour, or for Beautie.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Question may be demanded, Why vnder the Muse <hi>Terp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sichore,</hi> I personate the Bold and the Beautifull, the Warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and the Faire, she being the Muse to whom measures and daunces are solely peculiar, as being of them the onely and first inuentresse? I answer, (and I hope not impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that considering euery circumstance, I know not how to commend them to a more fit Mecaenas or Patron: for of what doth all your martiall discipline consist; but vpon time, number, measure, distance, and order? and all these in <hi>Choreis, Tripudijs</hi> (<hi>i.</hi> daunces) especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are obserued. In daunces we keepe time to the musicke; so in marching or drilling, our eares are attentiue to the voice of the captaine or generall. In the figures of the one, and files of the other, number is necessarily obserued, so is measure, distance, and order, for in these they haue an equall correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Now concerning faire women, whom in all Maskes at the Court, Cittie, or elsewere, doe your gallants picke out, but the virgins or Ladies most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull? nay euen at Wakes or weddings in the countrie, the fairest lasse is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually called out to daunce, be it but to the harpe, taber, or bag-pipe. Amongst the souldiers were celebrated the Pirhick daunce in armour, first instituted by king <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> of Epire; so likewise the Matachine or sword daunce: what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures haue beene deuised for the exercise of faire Ladies, Custome deriued from all Antiquitie still makes frequent amongst vs. It was vsed amongst the Iewes, witnes <hi>Herodias,</hi> and is still continued in Spaine, Fraunce, and England. A second doubt is, whether the magnanimous, or the exquisitly featured, whether Fortitude, or Pulcritude, ought to haue precedence and first place. It is a maxime amongst the Phisitions, <hi>Plus necat gula, quam gladius, i.</hi> surfets haue beene the destruction of more men than the sword: so I am of opinion, That beautie hath beene the ruine of more citties, the depopulation of more king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and destruction of more men than the sword. But in this place, since the courage of the mind, and excellence of forme, contend for the vpper hand, I take it from Feature, to bestow it on Magnanimitie and spirit, since the deeds

The lesse Asia (cald <hi>Asia minor</hi>) ioyneth to Cappadocia, and is closed in with the great sea, for it hath on the North the mouth and sea that is cald Euxinus, on the West Propontides, on the South the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an sea. This lesse Asia conteineth many prouinces and lands, on the North side Bythinia butting vpon the sea against Thracia, and is called Phrygia the greater. The chiefe cittie of Bythinia is Nicomedia. Galathia takes name of the Galls that assisted the king of Bythinia in his warres, and therefore had that Prouince giuen them to inhabit, It was first called Gallograecia, as being a people mixt of the Galls and Graecians, but now they be cald Galathians, and these are they to whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writ his Epistles <hi>Ad Galates.</hi> The third part of <hi>Asia minor</hi> is called Phrygia, and tooke name of <hi>Phrygia</hi> daughter to <hi>Europa</hi> the daughter of <hi>Aegenor:</hi> that Phrygia was likewise called Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia of <hi>Dardanus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> It hath on the East side Lydia, and on the West the sea Hellespontus, so called of <hi>Helles</hi> the sister of <hi>Phrixus,</hi> who was

                     <hi>Palaephatus</hi> in his fabulous narrations saith, The Amasons were not women, but certaine barbarous men who vsed to weare long gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and loose, reaching below their ankles after the manner of the Thracian women, who shaued their chinnes, and wore the haires of their head long but couered with miters: These Amasons were a warrelike people, and did many braue and remarkeable deedes of armes. But there is no likelihood (saith hee) that such should bee women, because of that nation there is at this day no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: but this was but his opinion. <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> from whom <hi>Iustine</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts his history, thus speaks of their origenall: Scythia towards the East, is of one side imbraced by the sea, on the other part hem'd in by the Ryphaean moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, the longitude and latitude thereof lyes open to Asia and the riuer Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais: These Scythians haue no portions of land amongst them which any man can call his owne,<note place="margin">The custome of the Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> they manure no fields, they build no houses, ignorant both of Agriculture and Architecture, their riches are their heards and their cattle, they delight in vnfrequented solitudes and inhabitable desarts, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue from one place to another, they carry their wiues along with them in charriots and waggons, these are couered with leather and skinnes of beasts, to shroud them from summers shewers, and defend themselues from winters tempests; they know no houses els, and for no others care. Iustice is maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the modestie of their manners, not by the seueritie of their lawes: There is no offence so grieuous to them as theft, because their flockes lie open without folds or sheepe coates; Gold and siluer they despise as much as other nations couet it, esteeming it rather an vnusefull burden than a profitable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise: Their food is for the most part milke and hony, the benefite of wooll or cloath is to them altogether vnknowne, though the climate oppresse them with continuall cold, their habit is furres and the skinnes of beasts; their continence teacheth them that iustice, That they couet nothing but what is their owne: for where there is desire of riches, there must necessarily be vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and oppression. Were the like moderation and abstinence vsed amongst all nations, warre and surfet would not (as they now doe) destroy more than age or nature. Admirable it is, that custome in them should attaine to as much true morall humanitie as the wise men of Greece haue reached to by the learning of arts, or study of Philosophy; and that vntaught Barbarians should excell

A nation in labours vnwearied, in dangers vndismaied, not seeking to get what they cared not to loose, in all their victories preferring the glory before the spoile. The first that made warre against this nation was <hi>Vexores</hi> king of Aegypt, who by his Embassadours sent them word to prepare themselues for defence: by whom they returned to the king this answer, <hi>We wonder that the captaine of so rich a people will wage war against vs that are knowne so poore, considering the successe of warre is doubtfull; and howsoeuer the euent prooue, the reward of the victorie is nothing, but the dammage arising from the fight, manifest.</hi> Their answer went before, which their resolution as suddenlie and swiftlie pursued after, for their army and their answer almost arriued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whose celeritie in march,<note place="margin">A base flight.</note> and resolution in purpose, when <hi>Vexores</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, he forsooke his tents and all prouision for warre, and betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to a base and dishonourable flight. They pursued him to the Aegyptian fennes, but by reason of the marishes and vncertaine ground, their further passage was prohibited. Retyring thence they ouerranne Asia, and subdued it vnder their predominance, imposing on the Nations a small tribute, rather in acknowledgement of the title, than to be gainers by the victory, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my rather suffering disgrace than oppression: fifteene yeares they continued in Asia, rather to settle the estate than to extort from the inhabitants. From thence they were called by the wickednesse of their wiues, from whom they receiued word, That vnlesse they instantly repayred home, they would seeke issue from the neighbour nations, for they would not suffer the posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the antient Scythians to bee in the women extinct. Asia was for many yeares tributarie to the Scythians; <hi>Trogus</hi> and <hi>Iustine</hi> say for a thousand and fiue hundred yeares, which ended in <hi>Ninus</hi> king of Assyria: In this interim, two princely youthes among the Scythians, <hi>Plinos</hi> and <hi>Scolopitus,</hi> being by the opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates and chiefe of the people expulst from their families, drew to their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie a mightie confluence and inuaded Cappadocia, planting themselues neere to the riuer Thermedon: and being by conquest possest of the Prouince of Themisciria, there hauing for many yeares made spoyle of the neighbour nations by the conspiracie of the multitude who were opprest with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies, they were betraide and slaine.

Thus they aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their seigniories and establisht their common-weale without the counsell or assistance of men, whose fellowship they began now altogether to despise: and to communicate their losse, to make the widdowes of equall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with the wiues, they slew all the men that yet remained amongst them, and after reuenged the deaths of their husbands formerlie slaine, vpon the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering people that conspired against them.

                  <p>These Amazons were by the Scythians called <hi>Aeorpata,</hi> which is as much as <hi>Viricidae,</hi> or man-killers.

Herodotus</hi> writes of them many things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse here to insert, onely one is worth the obseruation: To incourage their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and that there should be no coward amongst them,<note place="margin">A law among the Amazons</note> they haue a law, That no Virgin shall be capable of a husband, or enter into familiar congresse with man, before she hath brought from the field, the head of an enemie slaine with her owne hand; which hath beene the cause that so many of them haue died old wrinkled beldames, that neuer knew what belonged to the interchange of carnall societie. Of other Scythian women that had a purpose, it seemes, in some kind to immitate these Amazons, it is thus remembred by <hi>Strabo</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: The warlike Scythians in their third Asian expedition, being absent from their wiues the space of seuen yeares, they supposing their husbands ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue beene defeated and lost, than deteined with the tedioufnesse of so long and lingring a warre, married themselues to their slaues and seruants, such as were onely left at home to keepe their heards, flockes, and other cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. The Scythians after the expiration of their warre, returning into their countrie were opposed by their owne vassalls, and repelled from their terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories as strangers and inuaders, and not such as came to repossesse their owne wiues and fields: after many skermishes and conflicts, the victorie still remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doubtfull and incertaine, the Scythians were aduised to change their manner of fight, and because their opposition was against the basest of slaues, not the noblest of enemies, therefore to suit their weapons according to the persons, and laying by the noble armes of a souldier, to encounter them not with weapons but with whips, not with steele but with scourges and other like instruments of the terrors of base and seruile feare. This counsell was generally approoued and followed, so that the next time their slaues affronted them in battaile, they met them with the commanding lookes of maisters, not of equall enemies, and shaking these whips and scourges, with the sight ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their seruants were so terrified that instantly they betooke themselues to seruile and ignoble flight, conquering them as slaues whom they could scarce oppose as enemies, all such of them as they tooke they put to tortures and death. Their wiues knowing themselues guiltie both of adulterie to their beds, and treason to their liues, some slew themselues with the sword, others strangled themselues with the halter, all in conclusion brauely and resolutely with selfe hands finished their owne liues, leauing their husbands lustie wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowers, with free libertie to make choice of honester wiues.

                  <p>I Know not better how to expresse the boldnes of women, than by shewing you the feare of men, nor can I more plainly illustrat the valor of one sex than by putting you in mind of the cowardise of the other. It is well obserued of an Italian (who writes himselfe of Lucca) concerning the passion of Feare,<note place="margin">Of Feares.</note> of which there are three sorts commendable; the first is naturall feare, by which
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:20365:118"/>
we auoid the iniuries of men, preuent the inconuenience of postelent sickenes, with such like casualties, and arme our selues against want, dearth, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie. The second is ciuile Feare, wherein we feare to transgresse the law or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre penaltie, are timorous to doe ill because it is ill, when we dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue whats good or derrogate from our own reputation. The third is a more supernatural Feare, in which by our loue towards God and our neighbour, we feare to offend the higher Maiestie, and next that, feare the terror of eternall death and damnation; by the first we preserue our bodies, by the second our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, by the last our soules. But those other abiects the feares I purpose heare to exemplifie,<note place="margin">Examples of Feare.</note> onely such as proceed from Effeminacie and Cowardise. It is read of <hi>Pysander</hi> of Greece, that being aliue, he feared least his soule had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die forsaken his bodie. Likewise, of one <hi>Artemon</hi> who was of that hare-hearted disposition, that he mooued not abroad without Targets of brasse borne ouer him like cannopies, least any thing should fall from aloft and beate out his braines; or if he rid, it was in a horse-litter seeled and crosse-bard with gads of steele and plates of yron, for which hee was called <hi>Peripharetes. Sabellicus</hi> writes that <hi>Cassander</hi> so feared <hi>Alexander,</hi> that long time after his death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Delphos to behold the goodly statues there errected, at the verie sight of his old maisters effigies, hee fell into such a timerous feauer, that his verie bones daunced in his skinne, and longtime it was ere they could constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly settle themselues in their owne places.

Hereof hath growne a prouerbe, to any man that hath a strong apprehension of feare, they will say hee hath <hi>La fieure de saint Vallier, i.</hi> the feauer of <hi>Saint Vallier.</hi> Another thing is recorded, of a fellow that was so affraid of the name of <hi>Hercules,</hi> that he hid himselfe in caues and rockes, though he knew not of any quarrell betwixt them, at length, stealing from the obscure cauerne where he had denned himselfe, to see if the coast were cleere, casting his eye by chance on the one side and espying <hi>Hercules</hi> who came that way by chance, his life blood sinking into his heeles, he shooke them a little and died in that feauer. I could recite terrors and vaine feares which haue arise from nothing, that haue terrified whole citties of Grecians, armies of Romans, and multitudes of other nations, but these particulars shall suffice, for my purpose is not too farre to effeminate men, nor too much to embolden women: since the most valiant man that is, is timerous ynough, and the modestest woman that is may bee made sufficiently bold.<note place="margin">

Her next achiuement by which she purchased her selfe honour, was her contention in the sports of <hi>Peleus.</hi> It shall not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to tell you what these sports or pastimes were, They were the twelue in number that were celebrated amongst the Greekes, <hi>Acastus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Peleus</hi> instituted them in honour of his father. <hi>Zethaes</hi> the sonne of <hi>Aquilo</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame in that which was called <hi>Dolichodromus,</hi> which signifies a race of twelue furlongs. <hi>Calais</hi> his brother had the best in the <hi>Diantus,</hi> which was a race of two furlongs. <hi>Castor</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iupiter</hi> was victor in the <hi>Stadium,</hi> which was a place of running or exercise as wel for men as horse; the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a furlong or a measure of ground;<note place="margin">Three sorts of Furlongs.</note> there be of them three sorts, one of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie containing 615 feete, which amounteth to 125 paces; the second is called <hi>Olimpicum,</hi> which exsists of 600 feete, which is an hundred and twentie paces; the third <hi>Pythicum,</hi> conteining 1000 feete, which comes to 200 paces. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these <hi>Stadia, Plinie</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> differ: in the discription of Sicily, eight of these furlongs make an Italian mile, conteining 1000 paces, and euerie pace fiue feete. <hi>Pollux</hi> carried away the prise called <hi>Cestus,</hi> which signifies a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age belt or gyrdle which the husband vsed to tye about the wast of his bride, and vnloose the first night of their wedding. <hi>Telamon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Aiax</hi> had the praise in <hi>Disco,</hi> or casting the bullet or the stone. <hi>Peleus</hi> in wrestling. <hi>Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager</hi> the sonne of <hi>Oereus</hi> in casting of the dart. <hi>Cignus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Mars,</hi> slew <hi>Pilus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Diodatus.

And <hi>Iolaus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iphicles,</hi> for mannaging the chariot. <hi>Hercules</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame in many things, but <hi>Atalanta</hi> in al. Not long after this comming, to the knowledge of her parents, and being by them persuaded to marrie; to preuent the loathed embraces of a husband, trusting to her owne incomparable swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, she deuised a race, in which she proposed her selfe the prise of the victor, but the vanquished were mulcted with the losse of their heads: after the slaughter of many princes, <hi>Melanion</hi> (before spoken of) inflamed with her loue, receiued of <hi>Venus</hi> three golden apples, which he let fall one after another in the swiftnesse of their course, she by stooping to take them vp slackened her speed, and by loosing the race became his prise and bride. Some write that they ran in chariots and armed, trusting to the swiftnesse of their steeds, not the veroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their owne feet. The manner of their running is elegantly described in <hi>Ouid,</hi> of which I will guie you present expression. <hi>Hesiod, Naso,</hi> and others will not allow <hi>Atalanta</hi> to be the daughter of <hi>Iasus,</hi> but <hi>Schoeneus; Euripides</hi> deriues her from <hi>Menalus,</hi> making her the bride of <hi>Hyppomanes</hi> the sonne of <hi>Megaraeus,</hi> grand-child of <hi>Neptune,</hi> not of <hi>Melamion.</hi> The manner of their course is thus set downe, <hi>Metamorph. lib.</hi> 10.</p>

A mad fellow newly married, had onely one yong child by his wife, of some quarter old, whom he deerely and tenderly loued, as being his first; but he was much giuen to good fellowship, and shee altogether addicted to spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and good huswiferie: still when he vsed to come merrie from the tauerne, where he had beene frollicke with his boone companions, she being as sparing of his purse as prodigall of her tongue (for she was little better than a skold) would often vpbraide him with his expences, that what hee wasted at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, were better bestowed at home, that he spent both his mony &amp; time, and that being so often drunke, it was preiudiciall both to his bodie and estate, with many such matron-like exhortations: but alwaies concluding her admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a vow, That if euer he came home againe in that pickle, shee would (happen what could come) fling the child into the moat (for the house was moated about.) It hapned about some two daies after, that he reuelling till late in the euening in a cold frostie winters night, and she hauing intelligence by her scouts where he was then drinking, and making no question but he would come home flustred; she commanded her maide to conueigh the infant to the further part of the house, and to wrap the cat in the blankets and put it in the cradle and there to sit and rocke it; presently home comes the husband, shee falls to her old lesson and beginnes to quarrell with him, and he with her: Ill words begot worse, and much leaud language there was betwixt them, when the woman on the sudden stepping to the cradle (hauing spyde her aduantage) I haue long sayth she threatned a mischiefe, and that reuenge I cannot worke on thee, come dogs come diuells I will inflict vpon the brat in the cradle; and instantly snatching it vp in her armes, ran with it to the moate side and flung it into the middle of the water:<note place="margin">A pretie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</note> which the poore affrighted man following her and seeing, leauing to pursue her, and crying, saue the child, Ã´ saue the child, in

that bitter cold night leapt vp to the elbowes in water, and waded till hee brought out the mantell, and with much paine comming to the shore, and still crying alas my poore child, opened the cloathes; at length the frighted cat crying mewe, being at libertie leapt from betwixt his armes and ran away: the husband was both amased and vexed, the woman laught at her reuenge, and retyred her selfe: and the poore man was glad to reconcile the difference before she would yeeld to allow him either fire or dry linnen. Considering this, me thinkes it was not amisse answered of a gentleman, who being persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a friend of his not to marry with such a gentlewoman to whom hee was a suitor, his reasons alleadged were, because she had no quicke and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tongue, neither was she of any fine witte or capacitie: to whom he instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replyde, I desire to haue a woman to bee my wife that shall haue no more tongue to answer mee to a question than yea, or nay; or to haue more wit than to distinguish her husbands bed from another mans.</p>
                     <p>Another woman hauing a husband who customably came drunke home, and shrinking from his stoole or chaire would oft fall vpon the floore and there lie along: &amp; stil when she cald him to bed, he would answer her, Let me alone, the tenement is mine owne, and I may lye where I list, so long as I pay rent for the house. Some few nights after comming home in the like tune, and sitting asleepe in a chaire before the chimney, his wife being gone to bed, presently the man falls into the fire: the maide cryes out to her Mistresse, Oh mistresse, my master is falne and lyes in the fire, euen in the midst of all the fire; shee lay still and turning her on the other side, sayd, so long as hee payes rent for the house, he may lye where he please.

He notwithstanding he had before sworne to her homage, caused himselfe to be crowned at London vpon a Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> day, by <hi>William</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canturburie, one that had before past his oath of alleagence to the Emperesse. Much combustion there was in England in those dayes betwixt <hi>Maude</hi> and <hi>Stephan,</hi> and many battails fought, in which the successe was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the victorie sometimes inclining to the one, and againe to the other, the circumstances rather would become a large Chronicle than a short tractat: I will therefore come to that which sorts best with my present purpose. This lady tooke the king in battaile, and kept him prisoner at Bristoll from Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas day to Hollyrood day in haruest: for which victorie the people came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her with procession, which was approoued by the Popes legate. From Bristoll she came to Winchester, thence to Wilton, to Oxford, to Reding and Saint Albons, all the people acknowledging her their queene and soueraigne, excepting the Kentishmen onely: shee came thence to London to settle the estate of the land, whether came the wife of king <hi>Stephan</hi> for her husbands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie, vpon condition that <hi>Stephan</hi> should surrender the kingdome vp entirely into her hands, and betake himselfe euer after to a sequestred and religious life: But to this motion the Emperesse would by no meanes assent, the Cittisens likewise intreated her that they might vse the fauourable lawes of <hi>S.

But <hi>Robert</hi> her brother was there taken prisoner, and committed to safe custodie. Then the Queene imployed herselfe on the one part for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease of her husband, and the Empresse on the other, for the enfranchisement of her brother: at length, after long debating of the businesse, it was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Mediators on both sides, that <hi>Stephan</hi> should be restored to the Kingdome, and Duke <hi>Robert</hi> to his Lordship and Earledome; and both, as they had disturbed the peace of the Land, so now to establish it. To this the Earle would not assent: so that all that yeere there was nothing but spoyle, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughter, direptions, and all manner of violence, robbing of the rich, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the poore. The King vpon Holy-Rood day was released, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged the Empresse in the citie of Oxford, from Michaelmas day to mid-Winter: where, being oppressed with famine, she tooke the aduantage of the Frost and Snow; and attyring her selfe all in white, escaped ouer the Fennes, and came to the castle of Wallingford. And so much shall suffice to expresse the magnanimitie and warlike dispositions of two noble and heroicke English Ladies.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is reported of a king, that for many yeeres had no issue, and desirous to haue an heire of his owne bloud and begetting to succeed in the Throne, vpon his earnest supplication to the diuine powers, he was blessed with a faire sonne, both of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and hope. And now being possest of what he so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, his second care was to see him so educated that hee might haue as much comfort of him in his growth, as hope in his infancie: hee therefore sent abroad to find out the most cunning Astrologians to calculate of his natiuitie, that if the starres were any way maleuolent to him at his birth, he might by instruction and good education (as farre as was possible) preuent any disaster that the Planets had before threatened. A meeting to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose being appointed, and the Philosophers and learned men from all parts as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled: after much consultation it was concluded amongst them, That if the infant saw Sunne or Moone at any time within the space of ten yeeres, hee should most assuredly be depriued the benefit of sight all his life time after. With this their definitiue conclusion, the father wondrously perplexed, was rather willing to vse any faire meanes of preuention, than any way to tempt the crosse influence of the starres: Hee therefore caused a Cell or Caue to be cut out of a deepe Rocke, and conueying thither all things necessarie for his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, hee was kept there in the charge of a learned tutor who well instructed him in the Theorie of all those Arts which best suited his apprehension. The time of ten yeeres being expired, and the feare of that ominous calculation past ouer, the day was appointed when his purpose was to publish his sonne to the world, and to shew him the Sunne and Moone, of which he had often heard and till then neuer saw entire; and to present vnto his view all such creatures of which he had beene told, and read, but could distinguish none of them but by heare-say. They brought before him a Horse, a Dogge, a Lion, with many other beasts of seuerall kindes, of which he onely looked, but seemed in them to take small pleasure. They shewed him Siluer, Gold, Plate, and Iewels; in these likewise hee appeared to take small delight or none, as not knowing to what purpose they were vsefull: yet with a kind of dull discontent, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their names, and so past them ouer. At length the king commanded cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine beautifull virgins, gorgeously attyred, to be brought into his presence: which the Prince no sooner saw, but as recollecting his spirits, with a kind of alacritie and change of cheare, he earnestly demanded, What kind of creatures they were, how bred, how named, and to what vse created? To whom his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ieastingly replyed, These be called Deuills, of which I oft haue told you, and they are the great tempters of mankind. Then his father demanded of him, To which of all these things he had beheld, he stood affected best, and to whose societie hee was most enclined! who presently answered; <hi>O Father, I onely desire to be attended by these Deuils.</hi> Such is the attractiue power of beautie: which women cannot fully appropriate to themselues, since it is eminent in

Come to the flowers, and plants; what artificiall colour can be compared to the leaues of the Marigold, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Violet, the curious mixture of the Gillyflower, or the whitenesse of the Lilly; to which, <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his glorie was not to be equalled?

What is she that exceeds the Doue or Swan in whitenesse, or the Pyne or Cedar in straitnesse?

The next morning, by such seruants as she best trusted, she caused <hi>Gyges</hi> to be sent for, who (misdoubting nothing that had past, as one that had many times free accesse vnto her) instantly came; she causing her seruants to withdraw themselues, thus bespake him:
<q>Two wayes are proposed thee, Ã´ <hi>Gyges,</hi> and one of them instantly and without least premeditation to make choyse of; Eyther thou must kill <hi>Candaules,</hi> and that done, be possest of me,

But finding that necessitie, that he must be forced to one or the other, to kill the king, or to be slaine by others; he rather made choyse to suruiue, and let the other perish, and thus answered her: Since (generous Ladie) you vrge me to an enterprise so much opposite to my milder nature and disposition, propose some safe course how this may be done.

                     <head>The Faire ladie of Norwich.</head>
                     <p>ANd now because wee traffique altogether with Historie, it shall not bee amisse sometimes to mingle <hi>Seria Iocis,</hi> as shall appeare by this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course which I haue often heard related. A knight both of same and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and whose name is still vpon record, beeing eminent and of note with <hi>Henrie</hi> the fift, as personally with him in all the warres in France; after the king had both conquered and quieted the Land, this noble Englishman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred himselfe into his countrey. He had a Ladie that was of such beautie that she attracted the eyes of all beholders, with no common admiration, in briefe I cannot speake of her feature sufficiently, as being farre beyond the compasse of my penne, and therefore I put her into the number of my Faire ones. This ladie with her husband residing in the cittie of Norwich, He, after so many troubles and torments, purposed a more sequestred life, and (next the solace he had in the beautie and vertues of his wife) to take a course meerely contemplatiue: and thought, out of the aboundance of his wealth, to doe some pious deeds for the good of his soule: hee therefore erected in the cittie and neere to the place where his house stood, a goodly Church at his owne charge, and betwixt them a Religous house that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained twelue Friers and an Abbot, allowing them demeanes competent for so small a brother-hood. In this couent there were two, Frier <hi>Iohn</hi> and Frier <hi>Richard;</hi> these were still at continuall enmitie, and especiall notice taken of it amongst the rest, which by no mediation could be truely reconciled: but omitting that, it was custome of the knight and his ladie dayly to rise to morning Mattins, and she being affable and courteous to all, it bred a strange inciuile boldnesse in Frier <hi>Iohn,</hi> for she neuer came through the cloyster, but he was still with duckes and cringes attending her, which she (suspecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) simply with modest smiles returned thankes to him againe: which grew so palpable in the Frier, that as farre as they durst it was whispered in the couent. Briefly, after these incouragements (as he constered them) it bred in him that impudencie, that he presumed to write a letter to her, in which he layde open a great deale of more than necessarie loue. This letter with great difficultie came to her hand; at which the ladie astonished, as not drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:20365:133"/>
that such leaudnesse should come from one that professed chastitie, and not knowing whether it might be a tricke complotted by her husband to make triall of her chastitie: howsoeuer, least her honour should be any way called in question, shee thought it her best and safest course to show the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her husband; of which he had no sooner tooke a view, but he began to repent him of his former charitie, in regard of their so great ingratitude. But there yet wants reuenge for so great a wrong, the knight concealing his rage, causes an answere of this letter to be drawne, to which he commanded her to set to her hand; the contents to this effect, That she was greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate of his loue, &amp; that such a night her husband being to ride towards London, hee should be admitted, lodged, and entertained according to his owne desires. This letter was sealed, closely sent, receiued by the Frier with ioye vnspeakable: against the night he prouides him cleane linnen, a perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nightcap, and other necessaries; he keepes his time, obserues the place, is closely admitted, and by herselfe without witnesse, and so conueighed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a close chamber. Which hee was no sooner entered, but in comes the knight with his man, and in great furie, without giuing him the least time either to call for helpe to the house or to heauen, strangled the poore Frier and left him dead vpon the ground. The deede was no sooner done, and his rage somewhat appeased, but he began to enter into consideration of the foulenesse of the fact and heinousnesse of the murder, withall the strict pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie of the law due for such an offence, which would be no lesse than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of life and estate; and now hee beginnes better to ponder with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe how to preuent the last, which may giue him further leasure to repent the first. After diuerse and sundrie proiects cast betwixt him and his man, it came into his minde, by some meanes or other to haue his bodie conueyed backe into the Monasterie, which being diuided from his house onely with a bricke-wall, might be done without any great difficultie: this was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner motioned, but instantly his man remembers him of a ladder in the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeard fit for the purpose; briefly, they both lay hand to the bodie, and the man with the Frier on his backe mounts the ladder, and sits with him astride vpon the wall, then drawing vp the ladder to the contrarie side, descends with him downe into the Monasterie, where spying the house of office, hee set him vpon the same as vpright as he could, there leaues him and conueyes himselfe againe ouer the wall, but for hast forgetting the ladder, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers to his master how and where hee and bestowed the Frier: at which being better comforted they betooke themselues both to their rest. All this being concealed, as well from the Ladie as the rest of the houshold, who were in their depth of sleepe. It happened at the same instant, that Frier <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> being much troubled with a loosnesse in his bodie, had occasion to rise in the night, and beeing somewhat hastily and vnhandsomely taken, makes what speede he can to the house of office, but by the light of the Moone dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning some one before him, whilest he could and was able, hee conteined himselfe, but finding there was no remedie, he first called and then intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come away; but hearing no bodie answere, he imagined it to be done on purpose, the rather because approaching the place somewhat neerer, he might plainely perceiue it was Frier <hi>Iohn,</hi> his old aduersarie, who the louder he called seemed the lesse to listen; loath hee was to play the slouen in the yard, the rather because the whole couent had taken notice of a cold he had late got, and how it then wrought with him: therefore thinking this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit

What shall hee now doe? The gates are fast locked, and flye he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: but as suddaine extremities impresse in men as suddaine shifts, so hee espying the Ladder, presently apprehends what had beene whispered of Fryer <hi>Iohns</hi> loue to the knights ladie: and lifting him vpon his shoulders, by the helpe of the same Ladder, carryes him into the porch of the knights hall, and there sets him, and so closely conueyes himselfe backe into the Monasterie the same way hee came, not so much as suspected of any. In the interim, whilest this was done, the knight being perplexed and troubled in conscience, could by no meanes sleepe, but calls vp his man, and bids him goe listen about the walls of the Monasterie, if he can heare any noyse or vprore about the murther. Foorth goes hee from his maisters chamber, and hauing past the length of the hall, purposing to goe through the yard, findes Fryer <hi>Iohn</hi> sitting vpright in the porch; hee star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the sight, runnes backe affrighted, and almost distracted, and (scarce able to speake) brings this newes to his maister: who no lesse astonished, could not beleeue it to be so (but rather his mans fantasie) till himselfe went downe and became eye-witnesse of the strange obiect. Then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derously despayring, he intimates within himselfe, that murther is one of the crying sinnes, and such a one as cannot be concealed: yet recollecting his spirits, he purposeth to make tryall of a desperat aduenture, and put the discouerie thereof to accident: hee remembers an old stallion, that had beene a horse of seruice, then in his stable, one of those he had vsed in the French warres, and withall, a rustie Armor hanging in his Armorie; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands both instantly to be brought, with strong new cords, a case of rustie Pistolls, and a Launce. The horse is sadled and caparrison'd, the Armor put vpon the Fryer, and hee fast bound in the seat, the Launce tyed to his wrist, and the lower end put into the rest, his head-peece clasped on, and his Beauer vp; the skirts of his grey gowne serue for Bases: and thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred, like a knight compleately armed <hi>Cap a pe,</hi> they purpose to turne him out of the gates, hee and his horse, without any Page or Esquire, to trie a new aduenture. Whilest these things were thus in fitting, Fryer <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> in the Monasterie no lesse perplext in conscience than the knight, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the murther, casting all doubts, and still dreading the strictnesse of the Law, summons all his wits about him to preuent the worst; at length sets vp his rest, that it is his best and safest way to flye: he remembers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that there was belonging to the Fryerie a Mare, imployed to carry corne to and fro from the mill (which was some halfe a mile from the Monasterie) being somewhat fat, and therefore misdoubting his owne footmanship, hee thinkes it the safer course to trust to foure legges than to two, hee therefore calls vp the Baker that had the charge of the beast, and tells him, hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands there was Meale that morning to be fetcht from the Mill, which was grinded by that time; therefore if he would let him haue the Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, he would (it being now night) saue him that labour, and bring it back before morning. The fellow willing to spare so much paines, caused the backe gate to be opened. The Fryer gets vp, and rides out of the Monasterie gate,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:20365:134"/>
iust at the instant when the knight and his man had turned out the Fryer on horseback to seeke his fortune, the horse presently sents the mare, and after her he gallops. Fryer <hi>Richard</hi> looking back amazed to haue an armed knight pursue him, and by the Moone-light perceiuing the Fryer armed (for hee might discerne his face partly by the Moone, and partly by the breaking of the day, his Beauer being vp) away flyes hee, and takes through the streets; after him (or rather the mare) speedes the horse. Great noyse was in the citie; insomuch, that many awaking out of their sleepes and morning rests, from their windowes looked out. At length it was Fryer <hi>Richards</hi> ill fate to take into a turne-againe-lane, that had no passage through; there Fryer <hi>Iohn</hi> ouertakes him: the horse mounts the mare, and with his violent motion the rotten and rustie armour makes a terrible noyse; Fryer <hi>Richards</hi> burthened conscience clamours out aloud for helpe, and withall cryes, Guiltie of the murther: at the noyse of murther the people being amazed, run out of their beds into the streetes. They apprehend miracles, and hee confesseth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but withall, that barbarous and inhumane fact, to murther one of his Couent: the grudge that was betwixt them is knowne, and the apparant iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of heauen the rather beleeued. Fryer <hi>Iohn</hi> is dismounted, and sent to his graue, Fryer <hi>Richard</hi> to prison; hee is arraigned, and in processe, by his owne confession condemned. But before the execution, the knight knowing his owne guiltie conscience, posts instantly to the king, makes his voluntarie confession, and hath his life and goods (for his former good seruice) pardoned him, Fryer <hi>Richard</hi> is released, and the accident remaines still recorded.</p>

It happened that in the middest of this tumult the Virgin escaped and fled into the countrey, whom the suitors no sooner missed, but they with all expedition pursued her; it so fell out (for such was her good fortune) that she light vpon some countrie people that were remoouing their corne from the field into the barne (for it was then haruest) whom she humbly besought, to bee her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors from rape and the preseruers of her virginitie: they hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration of her youth and beautie (both which are preuailing orators) hid her amongst the sheaues, by which the pursuers were disappointed of their purpose, and being at a losse, ouer-run the game they chaced. Amongst these honest and simple people shee liued for a time retired and vnknowne, till the solempnitie of a great feast day, which the Boetians called <hi>Pamboe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otia,</hi> at which there was customably a mightie confluence of people of all sortes and degrees from the highest to the lowest.

which was then celebrated in the cittie Coranea, and prostrating her selfe before the altar of <hi>Itonia Minerua,</hi> in the face of that great congregation, complained of the murder of her father, capitulating all their insolencies and her owne iniuries; which she did with such feeling words and passionate teares, that shee not onely attracted the eyes of euerie one to behold, but mooued the hearts of all to pittie; which perceiuing, and how the multitude was affected towards her, shee gaue to euerie of the murderers a particuler nomination, both of the families from whence they came, and the places where they had then their residence. The rioters this hearing, and finding how the people were annimated and incenst against them, they fled to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomenus, but were not there admitted but excluded from foorth the gates; from thence they fled to Hippota (a small cittie neere Hellicon scituate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Thebans and the Corineans) and were there receiued.

Vpon a time returning from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a woman appeared to her of a venerable aspect, and desired to see what she carryed so tenderly in her armes: the nurse told her it was an infant, but such an one as shee was loth to shew, and therefore desired to be excused, the rather, because she was enioyned by the parents not to expose it to the sight of any. The more the nurse put her off with euasions, the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate the strange woman was to behold it. At length preuayling, shee gently with her hand stroaked the face of the child, and kissing it, thus said: Goe nurse, and beare her home to her parents, who shall in time become the most beautifull of the Spartan Ladyes. From that time forward, her defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie began to fall away, and a sweet grace and delightfull comelynesse to grow as well in face as euerie other lineament.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>RATO signifies Loue; of which, there are but two kinds, that is, the loue of Vertue, or of Vice: then vnder what Muse could I more properly patronize the Chast, and the Wanton? But me thinkes I heare some of our Critickes murmure and say, Whither doth this man purpose to wander, that hath lost his way and gone too farre alreadie? Hee might doe well to breake off here, and leaue it to some other heads, eyther more ingeniously wittie, or more grauely serious. To such, I make the same answere that Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> did once to <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. The king of England, and <hi>Francis</hi> the first of that name, king of France, being at oddes, <hi>Henry</hi> was much incensed, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> (his Embassadour) to debate with him sharpely about the designes then in hand: who hauing accommodated all things fitting for the journey, came to take his leaue of the king his maister, who vttered many bitter and disdainefull words against <hi>Francis,</hi> all tending to his opprobrie and dishonour; And in these tearmes (sayth hee) deliuer vnto him thy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie. To whom <hi>Bonner</hi> replyed; If it please your Maiestie, if I should giue him such harsh and despightfull language, and in his owne Court too, he can doe no lesse than take off my head. Thy head (answered the king) If hee doe, it is no matter: but tell him further, If hee dares to cut off thy head, ten thousand of his subiects heads shall be sent after it. To whom <hi>Bonner</hi> (after some small deliberation) againe replyed: <hi>But I am doubtfull (my Liege) whether any of these ten thousand heads will fit my shoulders;</hi> in that short answere as well taxing the kings rash furie, as prouident for his owne safetie. With which the king somewhat satisfied, and better considering with himselfe, deliuered vnto him a more calme and milder Embassie. So, though those heads may fauour both of more Iudgement and Reading, I am doubtfull whether they could more naturally sute with my owne method, and stile, though neuer so meane or barbarous: Therefore, <hi>Deo

                  </note> I proceede: The Spartans had a custome in their solemne feasts, to haue a song of three parts, sung by three seuerall Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>russes, The first was of weake old men, The second of yong able men, The third of Boyes and pretie growne children. The old men began with this verse:
<q>
                     <l>Olim iuuentutem, nos strenuam egimus.</l>
                  </q>

                     <l>We haue beene Strong, that now Decrepit are.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To whom the yong men in a second quire answered:
<q>
                     <l>Sortes sumus nos, fac si vis periculum.</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>Wee are both Yong, and Strong, prooue vs who dare.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To them in a third tone the children ecchoed:
<q>
                     <l>Nos erimus his prestantiores plurimo.</l>
                  </q>

                     <l>With these in Youth and Strength wee shall compare.</l>

               </p>
               <p>To this three-fold age, I compare the triplicitie of the Muses. The first three books are by this, alredie spent in your iudgements: The second three, of which this is the last, are the pyth and strength of my present worke in hand; to which the three succeeding (though yet in their infancie) I shall striue to paralell, if not exceed the rest. And first of Chastitie. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a woman of Lacena, that a great man sending her rich gifts to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her chastitie, she returned him this answere, Whilest I was a Virgin, I was taught to obey my father, which I accordingly did; and being a wife, to submit my selfe to my husbands will; if then you desire any courtesie at my hands, get first his consent and you shall after vnderstand my further pleasure. <hi>Plutarch. in Lacon. Institut.</hi> relates, that diuerse of these Lacenaean Virgins were taken captiues and sold in open market; one of them beeing cheapened, was demaunded what she knew? she answered, To be faithfull. Another being asked if he should buy her, whether she would proue chast? answered, Whether he bought her or no, she would be chast howsoeuer: her maister after seeking to corrupt her, she slew herselfe, vttering these her last words, See what a treasure thou hast lost, that knewest not my worth whilest thou wast possessed of me. There haue beene many men that haue left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to women strict rules of Chastitie by their examples. <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> being asked why hee would not suffer his owne sister to dwell in the house with him? answered, Because such as may conuerse with her are not my sisters; intimating, that all such as would auoid the sinne ought to shun tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for he was wont to say, It is not good to looke vpon a woman, it is worse to conuerse with her, but worst of all to touch her. Therfore these sences of ours that are most subiect to danger, ought most to be supprest and bridled, <hi>Marul. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Capit.</hi> 7. and <hi>Sabin. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Hierome</hi> reports of the Abbot <hi>Hylarian,</hi> That when hee found any vnchast cogitations arise in his brest, hee would beate himselfe vpon the bosome, as if with blowes and buffets hee would expell them thence (and thus sayd) I will tame thee Ã´ Asse, that thou shalt no more kick and spurne against me with thy heeles, I will not henceforth feed thee with Barley but chaffe, I will abate thy wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse with hunger and thirst, I will loade thy backe with grieuous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,

After which time he vsed the spare dyet of rootes and the iuice of hearbes; and these onely when necessitie compelled him to eate: Hee inioyned himselfe (the time of prayer excepted) to strict and continuall labour, to increase his appetite, but not augment his dyet. Therfore <hi>Hierom</hi> against Lust prescribes these three souereigne remedies; fast, prayer, and hard labour: The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are innumerable, as well amongst Ethnick men as Christians. <hi>Alexander</hi> supping with <hi>Antipadres,</hi> there was brought to the table and set iust against the king, a wonderous beautifull woman, as excellent in voice as in face, both tempting so farre that <hi>Alexander</hi> began suddenly to be surprised with her loue,<note place="margin">

How farre then was this temperate Prince from adulterating another mans wife, that was affraid to doe his host the least iniurie in his strumpet? Therefore <hi>Iulianus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour hauing tooke the cittie Nalaca, wherein were many women of rare and extraordinarie feature, was so farre from corrupting their vertues that he commanded, not any of them should be suffered to come in his presence. <hi>Calius lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 27.<note place="margin">

A gentleman meeting in the streets with a braue gallant wench and richly accommodated, seeing her walke with her brests bare almost downe to the middle: laying his hand vpon them, demaunded of her in her eare, whether that flesh were to bee sold, who skornefully answered, No, to whom he modestly replyed, Then let me aduise you to shut vp your shop-windowes.

                  </note> The monument of <hi>Aegiptae</hi> (the daughter of <hi>Edgar</hi> king of England, a professed Virgin in her life time) beeing opened after shee had many yeares lyen in the graue, all her bodie was turned into dust sauing her wombe and bowells; and they were as fresh and faire without any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as at the first day of her interment. Those that stood by wondering at the obiect, one Clerke amongst the rest broke foorth into these tearmes: Wonder not to see the rest of the bodie to taste of putrifaction, and the wombe still sound and perfect, which neuer was contaminated with the least stayne or blemish of lust. Of her, Bishop <hi>Danstan</hi> thus speakes: Worthie is her remembrance to be honoured vpon Earth, whose chast life is celebrated amongst the Saints in Heauen. O great reward, due to Virgin chastitie, by which such felicitie is attayned, that their soules are not onely glorified in Heauen, but their bodies are not subiect to corruption on earth. But because the Theame I am next to speake of, is of Virgins, giue me leaue to begin with the best that euer was since the beginning, for Beautie, Chastitie, and Sanctitie; nor shall it be amisse to speake a word or two concerning her Genealogie.</p>

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:20365:142"/>
it happened that one of the Priests of the foresaid number dyed, neyther after many voyces and sundrie nominations was any agreed vpon, or thought fit to be ascribed into his place. At length was propounded IESVS, the sonne of the Carpenter <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This suffrage standing, as hauing generall approbation from all, it was thought conuenient to send for his mother (for his father <hi>Ioseph</hi> was late dead) into the Consistorie, onely to know their names, and to register them in the aforesaid booke.
She therefore being called, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently questioned of her sonne and his father, thus answered, <q>That indeed she was the mother of IESVS, and brought him into the world; of which, those women are testates, that were present at his birth, but that he had no father from Earth: in which if they desired to be further instructed, shee could make it plainely appeare: For being a Virgin, and then in Galilee, the Angell of God (sayth shee) entred the house where I was, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto me (not sleeping, but thus as I am, awake) he told me, That by the Holy-Ghost I should conceiue, and bring foorth a sonne, and commanded me that I should call his name IESVS: Therefore beeing then a Virgin, by that Vision I conceiued, I brought foorth IESVS, and I still remaine a Virgin vnto this day.</q>
When the Priests heard this, they appointed faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and trustie Midwiues, with all diligence and care to make proofe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mary</hi> were a Virgin or no: they finding the truth most apparant and not to be contradicted, deliuered vp to the Priests, That shee was a Virgin, pure and immaculate. Then they sent for those women that were knowne to be at her deliuerie, and were witnesses of the Infants comming into the world; all which did attest and iustifie, That shee was the mother of the same IESVS. With these things the Priests amazed and astonished, they presently entreated <hi>Mary,</hi> that shee would freely professe vnto them what his Parents were, that their names (according to custome) might be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred amongst the others. To whom the blessed Virgin thus answered:
<q>Certaine I am, that I brought him into the world, but know no father that he hath from the Earth; but by the Angell it was told me, That hee was the Sonne of GOD: <hi>Hee therefore is the Sonne of</hi> GOD, <hi>and me.</hi>
                     </q> This the Priests vnderstanding, they called for the Booke; which being layd open before them, they caused these words to be inscribed: <q>Vpon such a day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased such a Priest, borne of such and such Parents; in whose place, by the common and vnite suffrage of vs all, is elected Priest, IESVS, <hi>the Sonne of the liuing</hi> GOD, <hi>and the Virgin</hi> MARY.</q>
And this Booke <hi>Theodosius</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (by the especiall diligence of the most noble amongst the Iewes, and the chiefe Princes) was reserued from the great sacke and destruction of the citie, and Temple, and was transferred into the citie of Tiberias, and there kept a long time after. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Howsoeuer, the effects of that abstenious life were not onely preiudiciall, but brought lamentable effects vpon this distracted king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, namely, Innouation and Conquest: for <hi>Edward</hi> dying without issue, England was inuaded and opprest by the Normans, and the people brought to that miserie, that happie was that subiect that could say, <hi>I am no English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> And in this, agree <hi>Matthew Paris, Capgraue, Fabian,</hi> and <hi>Polydore.</hi> As I hold it not necessarie for marryed folke to tye themselues to this strict kind of abstinence, so I hold it not conuenient for any such as haue to themselues, and in their soules, taken vpon them the strict life of Virginitie, to be compelled to an enforced marriage; as may appeare by this discourse following, recorded by <hi>Gulielm. Malmsburien. Simeon Danelmens. Matthew Paris, Roger Houeden, Capgraue, &amp;c. Henry</hi> the first of that name, king of England, and crowned in the yeere of Grace 1101, was by the instigation of <hi>Anselme</hi> (once a Monke of Normandie, but after by <hi>William Rufus</hi> consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Archbishop of Canterburie) marryed vnto <hi>Maude,</hi>

Much adoe had the King her father, the Queene her mother, her Confessor, Abbesse, or the Bishop, to alienate her from her setled resolution, or persuade her to marriage: but being as it were violently compelled thereunto, she cursed the Fruit that should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from her bodie; which after (as <hi>Polydore</hi> affirmes) turned to the great misfortune and miserie of her children: for afterwards, two of her sonnes, <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> were drowned by Sea. Besides, her daughter <hi>Maude</hi> (who was afterwards Empresse) prooued an vnfortunate Mother; and amongst many other things, in bringing forth <hi>Henry</hi> the second, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> to be slaine; it thus happened: All forraine warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing past, and ciuile combustions pacified, in the yeere of our Lord 1120,

                        <hi>Henry</hi> the first with great ioy and triumph left Normandie, and came into England. But within few dayes following, this great mirth and iollitie turned into a most heauie and fearefull sorrow; for <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> (his two sonnes) with <hi>Mary</hi> his daughter, <hi>Otwell</hi> their Tutor and Guardian, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> Earle of Chester, with the Countesse his wife, the Kings Neece, many Chapleines, Chamberlaines, Butlers, and Seruitors (for so they are tearmed in the storie) the Archdeacon of Hereford; the Princes play-fellowes, Sir <hi>Geffrey Rydell,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Maldvyle,</hi> Sir <hi>William Bygot,</hi> with other Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, great Heires, Ladyes, and Gentlewomen (to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of an hundred and fortie) besides Yeomen and Mariners (which were about fiftie; all these (sauing one man, which some say was a Butcher) were all drowned together, and not any one of their bodyes euer after found. Many attribute this great Iudgement to the heauie Curse of Queene <hi>Maude,</hi> others censure of it diuersly: Howsoeuer, in this King (as <hi>Polydore</hi> sayth) ended the Descent and Lyne of the Normans. Of this <hi>Anselme</hi> (before spoken of) there are diuerse Epistles (yet extant) to many women, in those dayes reputed of great Temperance and Chastitie: as, To Sister <hi>Frodelina,</hi> Sister <hi>Ermengarda,</hi> Sister <hi>Athelytes,</hi> Sister <hi>Eulalia,</hi> Sister <hi>Mabily,</hi> and Sister <hi>Basyle,</hi> To <hi>Maude,</hi> Abbesse of Cane in Normandie; and <hi>Maude,</hi> the Abbesse of Walton, here in England.

a woman, and so tooke their leaues and left him to consider of it. Loath was the old man to loose his Virginitie which hee had kept so long, but more loath to part with his life which he desired to keepe yet longer; and hauing meditated with himself from whom he was to depart, and what to leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him; namely his possessions, his money, his neighbours, friends, and kindred, and whether hee was to remooue, to the cold and comfortlesse graue; he resolued with himselfe to prolong the comfort of the first, and delay (as long he could) the feare of the last: Therefore hee resolued ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to be accessorie to the hastening his owne death, to take the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the doctors.

To whom the sicke (but pretily well recouered) man thus replyde, Neighbour you much mistake the cause of my sorrow, I neither greeue nor weepe for the good &amp; wholsome phisicke I had the last night, but I now vex and torment my selfe that I haue so idly spent mine age, there being such a pleasure vpon earth (aboue all that I haue hetherto inioyed) that I neuer had the grace to know it sooner, and trie what it was before this time.

                  <p>Of these Wantons there bee two sorts, <hi>Meretrices</hi> and <hi>Scorta,</hi> that is, Whores and common Women, such as either for Lust or Gaine, prostitute themselues to many, or all.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:20365:149"/>
of Sardis (it seemes being hot fellowes) sent their Embassadors into the citie to this purpose, That vnlesse they would send them their wiues, to adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at their pleasures, they would not onely race their citie, and leuell it with the earth, but kill man, woman, and child, and so extirpe their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This message bringing with it not onely terror but horror, much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed the besieged: and betwixt the distractions of perpetuall infamie and most certaine death, not able what to determine (and hauing sat long in counsaile, but nothing amongst them concluded) a yong lustie Virago (one that was hand-maid or bond-woman to <hi>Philarchus</hi>) desired to be admitted into the Senate. And being called in amongst them to know what shee had to say, shee told them, That vnderstanding to what miserable exigent they were driuen, shee had deuised (so pleased them to be swayed by her directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) a meanes not onely to deliuer themselues from skorne, their wiues from dishonor, their children from the reproach of bastardie, and their liues and goods from spoyle, but to subiect the barbarous enemie into their hands, with a noble and memorable victorie. No maruell if to such a proiect they gaue attention, when greedily demanding, By what meanes the least of these proposed blessings might be accomplished? she thus counsailed them, Send (saith she) to these lustfull Sardinians, and tell them you will in all points sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their desires: At the time appointed, let me with the rest of your slaues and vassals, be attyred in the habits of our ladies and mistresses; for (no question) being deckt in their ornaments and iewels, wee shall appeare not onely free women, but sufficiently beautifull. Now in the night, when we are fast lodged in their embraces, and they dreaming of no further dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers than their present delights, and that you thinke wee haue sufficiently cooled their hot courages; arme your selues against the Sardinians, whom (if they offer to rise and arme themselues at the Alarme giuen) wee will keepe still fast lockt in our armes, till what wee haue left of them being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, you your selfe dispatch being armed.

                  <p>A Tale something like vnto these, I haue beene told of a Mistresse, that in some sort did as much to saue her maids honestie; but whether to the same commendable purpose, of that I am somewhat doubtfull.

Hee further prouided by his last will, That whensoeuer either <hi>Iulia</hi> his daughter or <hi>Iulia</hi> his grandchild expired, their bodies should not rest beneath his monument. One thing of her I had almost forgot; Vpon a time comming to visite and doe her dutie to her father, she perceiued his eyes to be much offended with the gawdinesse of her attire, as sauering of immodestie; the next day taking occasion to reuisite him, she changed her habit into a comely ciuill and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronly garbe, and in that sort came to embrace her father: <hi>Caesar</hi> who had the day before suppressed his greefe, was not now able to conteine his ioy, but broke out into these tearmes, Ã´ how much more decent and seemely are these ornaments for the daughter of <hi>Augustus?</hi> to whom shee instantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyde, Indeed this day I apparelled my selfe to please the eyes of a father, but my yesterdayes habit was to content the eyes of a husband.

Nor was any woman to refuse the money that was offered her (whatsoeuer it were) because it was to be employed in their supposed pious vses. Neyther was it lawfull for a woman to refuse any man, but she was compelled to follow him that cast the first coyne into her apron. This beeing done, it was lawfull for her to mingle her selfe in prostitution with whom she pleased.

At a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of gentlemen about this Towne, whether in a Tauerne, or an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, I am not perfect, but amongst other discourse at the Table, one amongst the rest, began thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:20365:163"/>It is recorded (saith hee) by a Spanish Nobleman who had beene Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour in Russia,<note place="margin">A poore man and a Beare.</note> that in the time of his residence there, a strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent befell, which was after this manner: A poore man of the Countrey, whose greatest meanes to liue was by gathering stickes and rotten Wood in the Forrest, and after to make marchandise thereof amongst the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour villages; hee climbing a hollow Tree, much spent with age, and that Countrey (aboue many others) beeing full of Bees, as appeares by their traffique of Waxe and Honey; of which, in the bulke and concauitie of the Tree there was such a quantitie, that treading vpon a broken branch, and his foot-hold fayling, he fell into the trunke thereof, where presently hee was vp to the arme-pits deepe in Honey, besides the emptinesse aboue his head, not being able to reach to any thing by which he might vse the helpe of his hands. In this sweet pickle hee continued the space of three dayes, feeding vpon the reliefe the place affoorded, but altogether despairing euer to be released thence, as not daring to crye or call out for helpe, fearing the danger of wild beasts, of which in those Wildernesses there are infinite plentie. But it so fell out, that a mightie great Beare comming that way, and by reason of the poore mans moouing and stirring himselfe vp and downe within the Tree, smelling the Honey (which they say Beares haue appetite vnto aboue all other things whatsoeuer) hee mounts the Tree, and (as their custome is) not daring to thrust in their heads first, as fearing to fall headlong, prouident Nature hath allowed them that fore-sight, as catching fast hold vpon the top with their fore-feet, with one of their hinder legges (as with a Plummet) they sound the depth of the place, and how farre it is to the commoditie for which they come to search. All this the Beare did, at such time as the miserable poore man was casting his armes abroad to catch hold of any thing by which he might rayse himselfe out of that pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Purgatorie, who meeting with such an vnexpected Pulley, or Crane, catcht fast hold vpon the Beares legge: at which, the beast being sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affrighted (fearing to leaue one of his limbes behind him) drew it vp with such a mightie strength, that he pluckt out the man withall to the top, where he first fell in, by which meanes the poore wretches life was preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and the affrighted Beare (as if the Deuill had beene at his tayle) neuer lookt backe, till he had got into the thickest parts of the Wildernesse.</p>
               <p>His discourse being ended, and euery one admiring the strangenesse of the accident, a Traueller that sat next him affirmed it for truth, as being then in the Countrey at the same time: and thereupon tooke occasion to discourse of the cities, the riuers, the manners, and dispositions of the people; and withall, the coldnesse of the Clime, which in some places (saith he) I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test is so extreame, that one of my countreymen and I talking together one morning in the fields,<note place="margin">A cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> our words still as we spoke them, froze before vs in the ayre, and that so hard, that such as the next day past that way, might read them as perfectly and distinctly as if they had beene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:20365:164"/>
but one thing amongst the rest, which I shall neuer forget whilest I haue an houre to liue,<note place="margin">My Hostesses Lye.</note> That riding from Musco, the great citie, to a place in the countrey, some fiue miles off, in a mightie great Snow, and the high way being couered, and hee mistaking the path, hee happened to tumble horse and man into a deepe pit, from which hee could not finde any possible way out eyther for himselfe, or for his beast: and lying there some two houres, and readie to starue with cold; as necessitie will still put men to their wits, so hee bethought himselfe, and presently stepping to a Village some halfe a mile off, borrowed or bought a Spade; with which comming backe, hee fell to worke, and first digged out himselfe, and after his Horse; when mounting, hee (without more trouble) came to the end of his Iourney: And this (sayth shee) hee hath told to a hundred and a hundred Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, in mine owne hearing. To end this discourse in a word (which by examples might be amplified into an infinite) one of the guests sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by, said, I can tell you a stranger thing than all these: being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what? hee answered, I beleeue all these things related, to bee true. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke <hi>De educandis liberis</hi> sayth, <hi>Prater haec omnia ad sue faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi sunt pueri vt vera dicant, &amp;c.</hi> Aboue all things, children ought to be accustomed to speake the truth, in which consisteth the chiefe sanctimonie: but to lye, is a most base seruile thing, worthie the hate of all men, and not to be pardoned in seruants. <hi>Homer, Iliad.</hi> 1. to shew the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Truth and False-hood, hath these words:

But the keeper of the Gaole commiserating the Matron so sentenced (eyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he pittied her grauitie, or suspected her innocence) did not cause her to be instantly strangled, according to the rigor of her sentence.

The Sentence of their apprehension was performed, and their execution hourely expected: when the wife of <hi>Intaphernes</hi> cast her selfe groueling before the Court gate, with such pittifull eiulations and clamours, that they came euen to the eares of <hi>Darius,</hi> and much penetrated him, being vttered with such passionate and moouing accents, able to mollifie the Flint, or soften Marble. Imprest therefore with her pittious lamentations, the king sent vnto her, That her teares and clamours had so farre preuayled with him, that from the condemned societie they had ransomed one, and one onely, to continue the memorie of their Name and Familie; chuse amongst them all, whose life she most fauoured, and whose safetie with the greatest affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on desired, but further than this to graunt her his Sentence was vnalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. None that heard this small (yet vnexpected) fauour from the king, but presently imagined she would either redeeme her husband, or at least one of her sonnes, two of them beeing all that shee had then groning vnder the burthen of that heauie Sentence. But after some small medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (contrarie to the expectation of all men) shee demaunded the life of her brother. The king somewhat amased at her choyse, sent for her, and demaunded the reason, Why shee had preferred the life of a brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the safetie of such a noble husband, or such hopefull children? To whom shee answered, <hi>Behold (O king) I am yet but young and in my best of yeeres, and I may liue to haue another husband, and so consequently by him more children: But my father and mother are both aged, and stricken in yeeres; and should I lose a Brother, I should for euermore be depriued of that sacred Name.</hi>

Her hayre was parted the one way and the other, leauing a seame in the middest, that her forhead and face might be the plainlyer discouered.

Amongst the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, the Bridegroome kept his Bride concealed and couered at home in the place where she was after to be devirgined; the doores of the house were adorned with white Wooll, and crowned and beautified with Lawrel, which were first touched by the Bride, who annointed the posts and daubed the thresholds with Swines grease, or the fat of Wolues, to preuent all Pest, or pernicious diseases from euer hauing entrance into that house. Some vsed to sprinkle their heads with a rough kind of hearbe called <hi>Carix,</hi> much like vnto Broome, with the fruits of Palme-trees, with Pulse or Pease, and with a kind of powder which belongs to Painting: this office was still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by new seruants, at their first entrance into the houses of their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. The Law of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> amongst the Spartans was, That the Bride should cut her haire, and putting her selfe into mans habite, be brought into her chamber by the Bride-maids, who had before prepared it; and being left by them, the Bridegroome then entred, and first vnloosing her Virgin Girdle, hee had free libertie of congression. In Boeotia their Virgins were crowned with a wreath made of the hearbe called Sperage. In the Isle Cous the husbands were compelled to enter the Bride-chamber, attyred like wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. It was an vse amongst the Locrenses, for the Matrons to picke and gather selected flowers to make garlands for the Brides; but such as were bought for money, were held vile and contemptuous.

The Chelidonian women that had prostituted themselues to strangers, went with halfe of their faces open, the other halfe couered, else it was not lawfull for them to be seene abroad. They wore Girdles of Sheepes wooll wouen, about their Wasts, which was fastened about them with an <hi>Herculean</hi> Knot, which was not lawfull for any to vnloose, but either in the Bride-bed, or in the celebration of the Sacreds; in which they obserue a kind of <hi>Omen,</hi> that they should prooue as fruitfull in the propagation of issue, as <hi>Hercules</hi> was in getting of children. The German Virgins, when they prepared to giue meeting to their betrothed, and so to proceed to the Coniugall ceremonie, put on a straight or plaine garment, such a one as they in some places call a Huke, and ouer that a Cloake without spot or stayne, bearing a garland wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of Veruaine, an hearbe dedicated to <hi>Venus,</hi> with other selected flowers intermixed.

It was the fashion in other Prouinces of Greece, that those of lower degree (I meane the brides) when they were conducted home to their husbands, a young Boy went before them hung round with Oaken leaues and Acornes, bearing on his arme a wicker Basket full of bread; who all the way cryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, <hi>Efugi malum, &amp; inueni bonum, i.</hi> I haue shunned the bad, and found or

made choyse of the good. As she enters the doores, there the bridegroome stands readie to receiue her, the children demaund wall-nuts, which are cast vnto them in aboundance. Amongst the Rhodians, the bride is called from her fathers house by the common Cryer, &amp; by him conducted to the bed of her betrothed. The Romans obserued another custome: Their brides were not to touch the ground or pauement with their feet, but were snatched vp in their armes and borne vpon their shoulders, and as if shee were rapt and forcibly against her will hurried to her bedchamber: so <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirmes, others adde, That their haire was braided &amp; combed with a peece of a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers speare, intimating that they were now valiantly and resolutely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a new warr and skirmish. Amongst the Lusitanians, she was not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either to walke her selfe, or be led to her nuptiall Chamber, but the yong men came, and with pretended rudenesse and force snatched her from the armes of her mother, as if according to the Roman custome shee were raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed thence; before them went a piper &amp; one that sung an Hymenaean song, all her alliance and kindred attended her, of whom one bore a Distaffe with Towe, another a Spindle, next her a young man and a maide that had their parents liuing, one lighting them with a taper whose staffe was made of a Pine-tree; and with these ceremonies shee was conducted to her bride-bed.</p>

                  <head>Of Women excellent in the Art of Painting, Weauing, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>INnumerable are the men that haue been excellent in the qualitie of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: the Catalogue of their Names (without a Capitulation of their Workes) would aske much Paper, but greater paines to set downe. Yet as of the rest, I will giue you a small taste of their exquisite dexteritie in that Art. I haue read, That <hi>Apelles</hi> hauing made an excellent Piece, in which he had deciphered a Horse to the life, he thought it then a Present worthie <hi>Alexander:</hi> and comming to present it to the king, hee onely gaue it a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected looke, neither praysing it, nor discommending it, but found other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. The Painter still holding it vp, <hi>Bucephalus</hi> (on whom the king was then mounted) casting his eye vpon the Table, fell a neighing, thinking the liuely effigies had beene a liuing Beast. Which <hi>Apelles</hi> obseruing, could no longer containe himselfe, but cryed out aloud; O <hi>Alexander,</hi> I now well perceiue thy Horse hath better iudgement in Painting than thy selfe. <hi>Zeuxes</hi> being almost with him equally famous, <hi>Apelles</hi> maligning that any Painter should be named whilest hee was yet aliue, tooke occasion in an humour, to make a purposed Iourney to giue him visitation, but especially to obserue the manner of his shop, and worke-house: and crossing an Arme of the Sea, hee came to the citie where <hi>Zeuxes</hi> then liued; and enquiring out his house, was directed thither, where knocking, the maid came to the doore; <hi>Apelles</hi> asked her for her maister: shee told him, hee was gone into the Towne about very serious occasions, and was not then within; but I pray (Sir) when my maister returnes, who shall I say was heere to speake with him? <hi>Apelles</hi> spying a faire Table hanging in the shop, readie to be wrought, but no worke therein, and the Pensils and Colours all readie by it, By thy leaue maid (saith hee) and entring the shop, chused out a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sill, with which hee onely drew a curious small Line crosse the Table, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of that finenesse to deceiue the eye: which hauing suddainely ended, Tell thy maister (saith hee to the maid) That hee that drew this Line, was here to haue spoken with him, and so away hee goes: who was no sooner out, but <hi>Zeuxes</hi> returning, and asking her, If any man had beene there to aske for him in his absence? shee told him all, and shewed the Line drawne vpon the Table; on which hee looking with admiration, suddainely broke out into an acclamation, saying, <hi>This could neuer haue beene done, but by the hand of</hi> Apelles; and instantly sent vp and downe the Towne to seeke him. In the Interim (this president being still standing before him) in a kind of emulation, it animated him to aduenture on something worthie the sight of <hi>Apelles;</hi> when chusing out another colour, differing from that <hi>Apelles</hi> had wrought, he with his Pensill cut the first Line iust in the middle with a kind of miraculous sted fastnesse and euennesse: when glorying in his worke (which indeed was rare) Now tell the Painter (saith he) if he come againe to enquire of me, that I haue been since at home, witnesse that, and shew him the Table;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:20365:181"/>
and so retyred himselfe into the inner part of the house. Soone after comes <hi>Apelles,</hi> and askes the maid, If her maister had beene yet at home? Yes Sir (saith she) and bad me shew you this, and aske you how you like it. <hi>Apelles</hi> wondered (as thinking it had scarce beene to be found in Art) and was start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the first; but as one that had neuer beene equalled, and loth now to be exceeded, he againe tooke the Pensill, and altering the colour, in the very life and spirit of Art he diuided the (almost inuisible) Line of <hi>Zeuxes,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in the middest, with such a constant proportion, that it seemed alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to exceed the practise of Science. Which hauing done, Now (saith hee) commend me once more to thy maister, and aske him from me, If this last Line hath not made good the imperfections of the former: at which word <hi>Zeuxes</hi> appeared, and before he had the power to giue him any saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (looking vpon what he had done) acknowledged him Victor, yet held it no dishonor to him to be so ouercome. This Table was after held as a rare and an vnparalleld maister-piece, and being sold for a great summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as a choyse Iewell hung vp in the Capitoll of Rome, where it was long preserued, euen till time had defaced the colours, and raced out the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie thereof.

she persuaded him to peace, or troubled his eares with that base word of submission, that Hand which so long had opposed <hi>Alexander</hi> (all Coniugall amitie set apart) should be her luddaine and assured ruine. The Ladie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with the name of death, thought it no safetie to interpose so ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustious and setled a constancie, especially in a souldier dayly and hourely enured to bloud and massacre, therefore considering with her selfe what was best to be done; in meditating for her owne safetie, she thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by yeelding, to conquer, than by contending against power and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to be ouercome. After submission therefore made, and a new recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement established betwixt them, shee inuited him to a banquet in her Tent (which was furnished with all the dainties the Campe would yeeld, and whatsoeuer rarietie remote places could affoord) where she carryed her selfe with all humilitie and obedience. At this feast shee caused him to be plyed with Healths, and lauish Cups, till the Wine hauing got the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of his better sences, hee grew drowsie, and retyred himselfe to his Pallat. The Tables were then withdrawne, and euerie man that was inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, repaired either to his charge in the Armie, or to his rest. They hauing disposed of themselues, and the place now priuate, shee had confederated with one of her seruants, by whose assistance, shee in his depth of sleepe cut off the head of her husband, and gaue it to him. This done (hauing the Word) they past through the Watches and Guards, and by the breake of day came vnto the Campe of <hi>Alexander,</hi> desiring to haue conference with him about affaires which concerned him neerely. The Prince vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was a woman, commanded shee should be admitted into his Tent; which was accordingly done, and she appeared before him all stayned and sprinkled with blood (for she had not yet changed her habite) at which hee grew at the first amased, demaunding the cause of her repaire thither? She desired her seruant might be likewise admitted (who attended at the doore of his Tent) for hee had that about him by which he should be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. His entrance was graunted: but being suspected by the guard (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they perceiued him hide something folded vp in his garments) they searcht him, and found a head cut off, but by reason of the palenesse of the face (which was disfigured with the clottered and congealed bloud) the countenance thereof could hardly be discerned. The seruant was brought in, with the head (still dropping blood) in his hand. At which the king more wondering, desired by her to be better certified concerning the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell; to whom she boldly replyed, Loe here (Ã´ <hi>Alexander</hi>) the end of thy many troubles and feares, the head of the great Captaine <hi>Spitamenes,</hi> who though my husband, yet because hee was thine enemie, I haue caused his head to be cut off, and here present it vnto thee. At the horridenesse of these words, the king, with all that stood by, were abashed; euerie one glad of the thing done, but in their hearts detesting the manner of the deed.

To this purpose, he that collected the <hi>Memorable Histories of these times,</hi> hath quoted an Author, in many things beleeuable, That the like hath been knowne in our later ages: yea, children haue beene borne, that by the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues, Nurses, and Parents, haue beene mistaken for daughters, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for some yeeres. But growing to the age of twelue, or thereabouts, and are able to distinguish of good or euill (being capable of passions, and subiect to affections) whether Loue or Time haue produced these strange effects, I am not certaine: but those manly parts that were before inuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and concealed within the bodie, haue burst sorth, and beene made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant; insomuch, that they haue beene forced to change their womens names into mens, with the exchange of their habits; and after made choise of wiues, and as this <hi>Iphis</hi> to <hi>Ianthe,</hi> haue beene ioyfully married. <hi>Ouid</hi> in his twelfth booke of <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> remembers the like transhape from the mouth of <hi>Nestor.

In this interim of his glorious victorie <hi>Helena</hi> the mother of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> being on pilgrimage at Ierusalem, there found the Crosse on which the Sauiour of the world was crucified, with the three nayles with which his hands and feete were pierced. <hi>Ranulphus</hi> amplifies this storie of <hi>Helena,</hi> somewhat largelier after this manner, That when <hi>Constantine</hi> had surprised <hi>Maxentius,</hi> his mother was then in Brittaine, and hearing of the successe of so braue a conquest, shee sent him a letter, with great thankes to heauen, to congratulate so faire &amp; wished a Fortune; but not yet being truely instructed in the Christian Faith, she commended him that he had forsaken idolatrie, but blamed him that hee worshipped and beleeued in a man that had beene nayled to the Crosse. The Emperour wrote againe to his mother, That she should instantly repaire to Rome, and bring with her the most learned Iews and wisest Doctors, of what faith or beleefe so euer, to hold disputation in their presence concerning the Truth of religion. <hi>Helena</hi> brought with her to the number of seuenscore Iewes and others, against whom Saint <hi>Siluester</hi> was only opposed. In this controuersie the misbeleeuers were all nonplust &amp; put to silence. It hapned that a Iewish Cabalist among them spake certain words in the eare of a mad wild Bull that was broke loose and run into the presence where they were then assembled; those words were no sooner vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered but the beast sunck down without motion and instantly dyed, at which accident the iudges that sat to heare the disputation, were all astonished, as wondering by what power that was done. To whom <hi>Siluester</hi> then spake, What this man hath done is onely by the power of the deuill, who can kill but not restore vnto life, but it is God onely that can slay and make the same bodie reuiue againe; so Lyons and other wilde beasts of the Forrest can wound and destroy, but not make whole what is before by them peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: then (saith hee) if hee will that I beleeue with him, let him rayse that beast to life in Gods name, which hee hath destroyed in the Deuils name. But the Iewish Doctor attempted it in vaine, when the rest turning to <hi>Siluester,</hi> said, If thou by any power in Heauen or Earth canst call backe
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:20365:196"/>
againe the life of this beast which is now banished from his bodie, wee will beleeue with thee in that Deitie, by whose power so great a miracle can be done. <hi>Siluester</hi> accepted of their offer, and falling deuoutly on his knees, made his prayers vnto the Sauiour of the world, when presently the beast started vp vpon his feete; by which <hi>Constantius</hi> was confirmed, <hi>Helena</hi> conuerted, and all the Iewes and other Pagan Doctors receiued the Christian Faith, and were after baptised: and after this, and vpon the same occasion, <hi>Helena</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to seeke and find out the Crosse. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and others say she was an Inne-keepers daughter at Treuerent in France, and that the first <hi>Constantius</hi> trauailing that way, married her for her beautie; but our Histories of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine affirme her to be the faire, chast, and wise daughter of king <hi>Coil,</hi> before remembred. The perfections of the minde are much aboue the transitorie gifts of Fortune, much commendable in women, and a Dowrie farre tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending the riches of Gold and Iewels. Great <hi>Alexander</hi> refused the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull daughter of <hi>Darius,</hi> who would haue brought with her kingdomes for her Dower, and infinite Treasures to boot, and made choyse of <hi>Barsine,</hi>

It is an argument that cannot be too much am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified, to encourage Vertue and discourage Vice, to persuade both men and women to instruct their Mindes more carefully than they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne their Bodies, and striue to heape and accumulate the riches of the Soule, rather than hunt after Pompe, Vaine-glorie, and the wretched Wealth of the world; the first being euerlastingly permament, the last, dayly and hourely subiect to corruption and mutabilitie. <hi>Horace</hi> in his first Epistle to <hi>Mecaenas</hi> sayth:

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>orace</hi> sayth, <hi>Et prodesse solent &amp; delectare Poetae,</hi> In Poets there is both pleasure and profit, who are for the most part (I meane the best) studious for the pleasingest phrase and most moouing eloquence. From hence it grew that those of the first age, first introduced common ciuilitie, and humane moralitie amongst men, reducing them from irregular and bruitish conditions, into a mutuall and well gouerned societie: for by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and delightfull language refined from the vulgar Barbarisme, they first drew the eares of the ruder people to attention, from attention to instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by instruction to practise; so that in processe of time, by their smooth and gentle persuasions, illustrated with facunditie and eloquence, they brought them from voluptuousnesse to temperance, from the fields into houses, from liuing in villages to build walled cities, and by degrees from edifying of houses for themselues, to erect Temples to the gods; by whose adoration it impressed a reuerent feare to offend them: and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reduced them from rudenesse to a more formall regularitie. They were the first that taught them shame, and feare; shame, to seeme brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish to humanitie; feare, to appeare inhumane before a deitie. They moderated the ferocitie of their mindes, by smooth orations, profitable documents, and learned writings; and the more to insinuate into their dull vnderstanding, when prose seemed vnto them lesse delightfull, they deuised verse, and still as one kind grew stale or common they apprehended new; and thus that eloquence that before lay loose and skattered, was first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted within feet and number. Then when the vulgar seemed lesse capable of deepe Sophismes tending to moralitie and ciuile gouernement, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their grauer doctrines appeared to their eares harsh and vnpleasant, they dealt with them as carefull fathers vse to doe with their vntoward children; when things profitable will not still them, they seeke to please them with toyes; so the Poets, when wholesome foode would not tast their mouths, they deuised sweet meates to realish their pallats, finding out merrie and delightfull tales, best agreeable with their itching eares: comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding notwithstanding, golden truths in leaden fables. They after instituted good &amp; wholesome laws, to incourage the good, and deiect the bad, to raise the vertuous and well disposed to honor, and to punish the euill doer either with pennance or shame: then came the industrious man to bee first distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the sloathfull, and the thriftie from the prodigall: things were no more made common, euerie man eate of his owne labour, and what he earned he might call his owne: Hence first grew Industrie, without which no common-weale nor publike state can stand. And these and much greater were the first fruits of Poetrie, now in this age so much despised; the vse whereof was antient, the apprehension diuine, the practise commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and the name reuerent. There is a sympathie and correspondence betwixt Poetrie and Rhetoricke: <hi>Appollo</hi> is god of the first, and <hi>Mercurie</hi> the <hi>Mecenas</hi> of the second; which the ancient writers the better to signifie vnto vs, say, That <hi>Apollo</hi> acquainted <hi>Mercurie</hi> with the Muses, and <hi>Mercurie</hi> in requitall first inuented the Harpe and gaue it to <hi>Apollo,</hi> being the instrument to which the Muses most delighted to sing; as if they more plainely would

haue sayd, A Poet cannot be excellent vnlesse he be a good Rhetorician, nor any Rhetorician attaine to the heigth of eloquence, vnlesse he hath first layd his foundation in Poetrie. They are two excellencies, that cannot well exist one without the other: Poetrie is the elder brother, and more plaine in his condition; Rhetorick the younger, but more craftie in his profession: hence it comes Poets are so poore, and Lawyers so rich; for they haue made a younger brother of the elder, and possesse all the land. Besides, as much as <hi>Apollo</hi> is excellent aboue <hi>Mercurie,</hi> as being God of Light, of Musicke, of Physicke, of Arts, &amp;c. and the other God of Bargaining, Buying, Selling, of Cousening, Theeuing, and of Lyes; so farre doth the first claime due prioritie aboue the second. They may be thus distinguished: Poets in that which outwardly appeares fabulous, colour and shaddow golden truths, to their owne painefull studies and labour, and to the pleasure and profit of others: But many Orators, vnder seeming truths, apparrell scandalous ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, aymed onely to their owne benefit, to the impouerishing of others, and many times stripping them out of a faire inheritance: I speake of some, not all; and I honour the Law, because I liue vnder it. Poets, they were the first teachers and instructers; the people held them to bee inspired from aboue, and to speake as from the mouthes of the gods: some were Holy, as <hi>Ennius;</hi> some Diuine, as <hi>Homer;</hi> others Prophets, as hauing the name of <hi>Vates</hi> confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon them: and amongst these, may bee numbred the <hi>Sybills,</hi> the Priests of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and such as belonged to all the other Oracles. Of the Poets there were many sorts, and such as writ in diuerse kinds, yet all these imitated at least (if not equalled) by women.

But to begin with the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Poets, by their testimonies it is manifest that the practise of Witches and Witch-craft hath beene so great, that by their Charmes and Spells they haue had the power to transhape men into bruit beasts, to alter the course of the Planets, and Starres, haue changed the Seasons, making the naturall course of the yeare preposterous: further, that their exorcismes haue extended to Hearbes, Flowers, Fruits, and Graine, to infect men with Diseases, and cattell with Murren, to delude the Eyes and weaken the Sences, bewitch the Limbes, binde the Hands, gyue the Feete, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbe the other Members, apoplex all the vitall Spirits, and raise vp dead bodies from their Sepulchres; nay more, to call the Moone downe from her Sphere, with other most strange things, as miraculous to relate as difficult to beleeue, of such in his first booke <hi>Tibullus</hi> speakes,

When the wind stood faire, and that she with her seruants had bargained for their passage, and they were readie to go aboord, she sent for this woman, to know if shee would redeeme her pawne, for shee was now readie to leaue the towne, and depart for her countrey. The old woman came, humbly entreating her she would not beare away her Kettle, notwithstanding she had as then no money to repay of that she had borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but hoped that she was a good gentlewoman, and would proue her good mistresse, &amp;c. she answered her againe, That she had lent her so much mony, and hauing a pawne sufficient in her hand, finding it necessarie for her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, she would make the best vse of it she could a shipboord. The old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man finding her resolute, left her with these words, Why then (saith shee) carrie it away if thou canst. Marry and I will crie what I can doe, replyed she againe; and so they parted. The Maister called aboord, the wind stood faire, the Sea was calme, and the weather pleasant: but they had not beene many houres at Sea, when there arose a suddaine, sad, and terrible tempest, as if the winds and waters had beene at dissention, and the distempered ayre at warre with both. A mightie storme there arose, insomuch that the Maister protested, that in his life time he had not seene the like, and being in despaire of shipwracke, desired both Saylers and passengers to betake themselues to their prayers. This word came from them that laboured aboue the Harches to those that were stowed vnder: their present feare made them truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the danger, and betake themselues to their deuotions; when sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly one casting vp his eyes, espyed an old woman sitting on the top of the maine Mast: the Maister saw her, and all those that were aboue, being at the sight much amased. The rumor of this went downe; which the gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hearing (who was then sitting with her child in her Cabbin, &amp; warming it ouer a Charcoale fire made in the Kettle) O God sayth she (remembring her former words) then the old woman is come after me for her Kettle; the Maister apprehending the businesse, Marrie and then let her haue it, saith he, and takes the Kettle, coales and all, and casts them ouer-boord into the Sea. This was no sooner done, but the Witch dismounts her selfe from the Mast, goes aboord the Brasse Kettle, and in a moment sailes out of sight: the Ayre cleared, the Windes grew calme, the tempest ceased, and she had a faire and speedie passage into England: and this the same gentlewoman hath often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Nor is this more incredible than that which in Geneua is still memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.<note place="margin">A Witch of Geneua.</note> A young wench instructed in this damnable science, had an Iron Rod, with which whomsoeuer she touched, they were forced to dance without ceasing, til they were tired, &amp; lay down with wearinesse.

Our most learned writers are of opinion, that these Inchantresses can bewitch some, but not all, for there are such
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:20365:214"/>
ouer whom they haue no power. The same Author testifies, That he saw a Witch of Auerne,<note place="margin">Another kind of Witchcraft.</note> in the yere 1579, who was taken in Lutetia, about whom was found a Booke of a large Volume, in which were drawne the hayres of Horses, Oxen, Mules, Swine, and other beasts, of all colours whatsoeuer: She (if any beasts were sicke) would vndertake their cure, by receiuing some number of their hayres, with which she made her Spells and Incantations; neither could she helpe any beast, by her owne confession, but by transferring that disease or maladie vpon another; neither could shee cure any creature, if she were hyred for money: therefore she went poorely, in a coat made vp with patches. A nobleman of France sent to one of these Witches, to cure a sicke Horse whom he much loued: shee returned him answer, That of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie his Horse or his Groome must die, and bid him chuse whether: The nobleman crauing some time of pawse and deliberation, the seruant in the interim died, and the Horse recouered; for which fact she was apprehended and iudged. It is a generall obseruation, That the Deuill (who is a destroyer) neuer heales one creature but by hurting another, and commonly he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his hate from the worse vnto the better: For instance, if a Witch cure a Horse, the disease falls vpon one of higher price; if shee heale the wife, shee harmes the husband; if helpe the sonne, she infects the father. Of this I will produce one or two credible instances:<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerius.</hi>

The father to saue his owne life, yeelds that his sonne should perish: of which the Nurse hearing, iust at the houre when the father should be healed, is absent and conceales the child. The father is no sooner toucht, but helped of his disease; the Witch demands for the child, to transferre it vpon him: the child is missing, and cannot be found: which the Witch hearing, broke out into this exclamation, <hi>Actum est, de me, puer vbinam est? i.</hi> I am vndone, where is the child? when scarce hauing put her foot ouer the threshold to returne home, but she fell downe suddenly dead, her body being blasted, and as blacke as an Aethiope.<note place="margin">Example of the like.</note> The like remarkable Iudgement fell vpon a Witch amongst the Nanuetae, who was accused of bewitching her neighbour: The magistrates commanded her but to touch the partie distempered with her Inchantments (which is a thing much vsed by all the German Iudges, euen in the Imperiall Chamber it selfe) the Witch denyed to doe it: but seeing they began to compell her by force, shee likewise cryed out, I am then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; when instantly the sicke woman recouered, and the Witch then in health, fell downe suddenly and died, whose bodie was after condemned to the fire: And this, <hi>Bodinus</hi> affirmes to haue heard related from the mouth of one of the Iudges who was there present. In Tholosa there was one skilfull in Magicke, who was borne in Burdegall: hee comming to visit a familiar friend of his (who was extreamely afflicted with a Quartane Ague, almost euen to death) told him he pittied his case exceedingly; and therefore if he had any enemie, but giue him his name, and he would take away the Feauer from him, and transferre it vpon the other. The sick gentleman thanked him for his loue, but told him, there was not that man liuing whom he hated so much, as to punish him with such a torment: Why then (saith he) giue it to thy seruant; the other answering, That he had not the conscience so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

Vpon the instant the Magician was stroke with the feauer, and within few dayes after dyed, in which interim the sicke gentleman was perfectly recouered. <hi>Gregorie Turonensis lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. sayth, That when the wife of king <hi>Chilperick</hi> perceiued her young sonne to bee taken away by Witch-craft, shee was so violently incensed and inraged against the verie name of a Sorceresse, that she caused diligent search to be made, and all such suspected persons vpon the least probabilitie to be dragged to the stake, or broken on the wheele, most of these confessed that the kings sonne was bewitched to death, for the preseruation of <hi>Mummo</hi> the great Master, a potent man in the kingdome: this man in the middest of his torments smiled, confessing that he had receiued such inchanted drugs from the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerists, that made him vnsensible of paine: but wearied with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of torments, he was sent to Burdegall, where he not long after died.

soone recouered? to whom she answered, Oh master, master, why haue you beaten me thus? the man reporting this amongst his nighbours, one amongst the rest said, if this be true she is then doubtlesse a Witch, and one of these Extasists: at which the Master growing suspitious, vrged her so strictly that she confessed, though her bodie was there present, yet her soule was abroad at the assemblie of diuers Witches, with many other mischiefes, for which she was held worthie of death, and iudged. At Burdegall in the yere 1571, when there was a decree made in France, against the strict prosecution of Witches, an old Sorceresse of that place, amongst many horrid and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things confessed by her, she was conuicted and imprisoned, where <hi>D. Boletus</hi> visited her, desiring to be eye-witnesse of some of those things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by her acknowledged: to whom the Witch answered, That she had not power to do any thing in prison. But desirous to be better satisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such things, he commanded her for the present to be released and brought out of the Gaole to another lodging, where she in his presence hauing annointed her bodie with a certaine vnguent, from the crowne to the heele naked, fell into a sodaine apoplex, appearing to them as dead, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of all sence or motion: but after fiue houres returning to her selfe, as if she awaked out of a dreame, she related many things done neere and farre off in that interim; of which sending to know the truth, they found her to erre in nothing: this was confirmed to <hi>Bodinus</hi> by an Earle of great honour, who was then present when this thing was done. <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> in his historie, saith, That those things are common in the Northren parts of the world, and that the friends of those Extasists diligently keepe and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard their bodies whilest their Spirits are abroad, either to carrie rings, tokens, or letters to their friends though neuer so farre off, and bring them answers backe againe, with infallible tokens of their being there. Many I could here produce to the like purpose, I will end with <hi>S. Augustine lib. de Ciuitate Dei</hi> 18. who affirmes the father of <hi>Prestantius</hi> hath confest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to haue beene transported with such extasies, that when his Spirit hath returned to him againe, he hath constantly affirmed that he hath beene changed into an horse, and in the companie of others carried prouision in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the campe, when in the meane time his bodie was knowne to lie at home in his chamber breathlesse, and without moouing, and this hath reference to <hi>Liranthropia, i.</hi> The changing of men into beasts.

                     <p>As <hi>Ouid</hi> of <hi>Aegistus,</hi> so may I say of <hi>Leucippus,</hi> whom rest, and want of action, in a stirring braine, and bodie, wrought this distemperature. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed he was to court his sister, first because he knew her modest; a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond impediment was, she was elsewhere disposed, and contracted to a gentleman of a noble familie: besides, she was his sister, to whom he wisht all good, and then to corrupt her honor, he could deuise for her no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ill: he considered that to persuade her to her owne vndoing, would shew ill in a stranger, but much worse in a brother. In these distractions, what should he doe, or what course take? the thing he apprehended was preposterous, and the meanes to compasse it was most prodigious; for he came to his mother, told her his disease, and besought her of remedie: his words as they were vttered with feare, so they were heard with trembling, for they feauered her all ouer. Being in to the knees, hee cared not now, to wade vp to the chinne, and proceeded, That if she would not be the meanes for him to compasse his sister, notwithstanding all obstacles what soeuer, he would by speedie and sudden death rid himselfe out of all his miseries, desiring her speedie answer, or with his naked poniard in his hand, he was as readie for execution, as she to deny her assistance. I leaue to any mothers consideration but to imagine, with what strange ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, his words perplexed her, and what conuulsions it bred in her bosome, euen to the verie stretching of hir heart strings: but as she knew his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to dare, so she feared his resolution to act, therefore more like a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted mother, than a vertuous minded matron, rather desiring to haue
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:20365:221"/>
wicked children, than none at all, she promised him hope, and assured him helpe, and after some persuasiue words of comfort, left him indifferently satisfied. What language the mother vsed to the daughter to inuite her to the pollution of her bodie, and destruction of her soule, is not in me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue: I only come to the point, by the mothers mediation the brother is brought to the bed of his sister, she is vitiated, and his appetite glutted, yet not so, but that they continued their priuate meetings, in so much that custome bred impudence, and suspition certaine proofe of their incestuous consocietie. At length it comes to the eare of him that had contracted her, with attestation of the truth thereof: he, though he feared the greatnesse of <hi>Leucippus</hi> his knowne valor, and popular fauour, yet his spirit could not brooke so vnspeakeable an iniurie; he acquaints this nouell to his father, and certaine noble friends of his, amongst whom it was concluded by all iointly, to informe <hi>Xanthius</hi> of his daughters inchastitie: but for their owne safetie (knowing the potencie of <hi>Leucippus</hi>) to conceale the name of the adulterer. They repaire to him, and informe him of the businesse, intreating his secrecie till he be himselfe eye-witnesse of his daughters dishonor. The father at this newes is inraged, but armes himselfe with inforced patience, much longing to know that libidonous wretch who had dishonoured his familie. The incestuous meeting was watcht and discouered, and word brought to <hi>Xanthius</hi> that now was the time to apprehend them; he calls for lights, and attended with her accusers, purposes to inuade the chamber: great noise is made, she affrighted rises, and before they came to the doore, opens it, slips by, thinking to flie and hide her selfe; the father supposing her to be the adulterer, pursues her, and pierceth her through with his sword. By this <hi>Leucippus</hi> starts vp, and with his sword in his hand, hearing her last dying shreeke, prepares himselfe for her rescue, he is incountred by his father, whom in the distraction of the sodaine affright, he vnaduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assaulted and slew. The mother disturbed with the noise, hasts to the place where she heard the tumult was, and seeing her husband and daughter slaine, betwixt the horridnesse of the sight, and apprehension of her owne guilt, fell downe sodainely and expired. And these are the lamentable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Incest, the father to kill his owne daughter, the sonne his father, and the mother (the cause of all) to die sodainely without the least thought of repentance. These things so infortunately happening, <hi>Leucippus</hi> caused their bodies to be nobly interred, when forsaking his fathers house in Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salie, he made an expedition into Creet, but being repulst from thence by the inhabitants, he made for Ephesia, where he tooke perforce a citie in the prouince of Cretinaea,<note place="margin">

this despaire, for now is the time that the Deuils will exact their due. Those that persuaded me to this mischiefe, are readie to demand their Couenant. Therefore by a mothers loue I charge you, and by your filiall dutie I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure you, since the Sentence of may Soules perdition is irreuocable, that you will vse your best endeuour and industrie for the preseruation of my Bodie. This therefore I enioyne you, in stead of a Winding-sheet, sowe my Bodie in the skinne of a Hart, or Bucks Leather, then put me in a Coffin of Stone, which couer with Lead, and after bind it with Hoopes or Barres of Iron, to which fasten three strong Chaynes: If my Bodie thus coffin'd, lye three dayes quiet, burie me the fourth day, though I feare the Earth for my manifold Blasphemies will scarce giue entertainment to my Bodie. For the first two nights together, let there be fiftie Psalmes sung for me, and as many Masses for so many dayes; which said, shee gaue vp her last breath. Shee dead, the brother and sister were carefull to performe the mothers last Will, and did all things accordingly. The first two nights, when the Quires of Church-men sung Psalmes about the Bodie, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils with much ease broke open the Church doores, which were bolted, barr'd, lockt, and propt, and broke two of the Chaynes by which the Coffin was fastened, but the third remained stedfast. The third night, about the time when the Cocke begins to crow, the foundation of the Temple seemed to shake with the noyse of the Deuils who clamoured at the doore: one of the rest, taller in stature and more terrible in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance than his fellowes, knocked with more violence than those which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, till hee had broken the doore to shiuers; when stalking to the Coffin, he called the woman by her name aloud, and bad her arise and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: to whom the dead bodie answered, I cannot for these Chaynes. To whom he answered, Those shall be loosed to thy mischiefe; when tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them asunder as they had beene Linkes made of Rushes, hee snatched vp the Coffin, and carried it to the Church doore, where stood readie a blacke Sumpter-horse, loudly neighing, whose hoofes were diuided like Eagles tallons, vpon which he layde the bodie, hurried it away with see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ioy, whilest all the Quirristers looked on, and so vanished: Her shrikes and eiulations were heard foure miles off.

They are contracted by Proxie, and shee payes readie downe two thousand ounces of Gold for his freedome. This done, and <hi>Roland</hi> comming backe to Messana, he was so farre from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Contract, that he would not so much as see her, or confesse himselfe obliged vnto her in the smallest courtesie, who (had it not beene for her charitable loue and pietie) might haue languished in an vncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table durance all the dayes of his life. <hi>Comiola Turinga</hi> at this ingratitude much grieued; for she had not onely payd downe so great a summe, but that which most afflicted her, was, that the fame of her marriage being all ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread, the Contract being denyed, and by <hi>Roland</hi> abiured, must at least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to her perpetuall scorne, if not to the disparagement of her fame and vertue. To salue both, with what conuenience she could she was aduised to accite him into the Ecclesiasticall Court by Processe, and to plead the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Contract, and (which shee could easily doe) prooue it by witnesse. Which the friends and kindred of <hi>Roland</hi> hearing, persuaded him (to shun the common fame which went of his ingratitude) to reconcile the tongues of euill speakers, and to preuent all controuersies and troubles in Law, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of her as one that best deserued him. With much adoe he accepts of the motion. A publike confluence of friends and kindred at an appointed day are assembled, where when the bastard expected to heare her and her friends sollicite him concerning the mariage, she in that publike conuention first ript vp her courtesies, and with what a charitable and chast purpose she had done them; next she laid open his barbarous ingratitude, not to acknowledge them; and lastly, his corrupt and dishonest heart, in lying to God and her, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Besides, the one is <hi>Iuno</hi> the wife and sister of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the other are <hi>Minerua</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> his two daughters, so that of necesssitie in gaining one vncertaine friend, I shall purchase two most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant enemies; therefore (sayth he) I intreat you (Ã´ <hi>Mercurie</hi>) so farre to mediate for me to these goddesses, that since but one can conquer, the two vanquished will not bee offended with me, but rather to impute my errour (if any be) to the weakenesse of my humane sight, than to any premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and pretended spleene or malice.

To whom <hi>Venus</hi> replyde, If I be compelled to put off my virginall gyrdle, that which all young married men vse to vnloose from the wasts of their fresh and flourishing brides, before they can enter into the new Elisium, and of virgins make them women; why doest not thou then <hi>Minerua</hi> lay by thy helmet, by which (it may bee) thou hopest to seeme terrible to the iudge, and so awe him to thy will: thou oughtest to shew thy head and forehead bare as mine is, but perhaps thou thinkest with thy broad and threatening burgonet, to shaddow thy faint and blew eyes, which to thy pretended beautie will appeare no small or ordinarie blemish. Then satih <hi>Minerua,</hi> There lyes my helmet; &amp; <hi>Venus,</hi> And there my gyrdle; and so they presented themselues before him all three, naked: at which sight <hi>Paris</hi> beeing extaside, broke foorth into this acclamation, Oh <hi>Iupiter,</hi> thou monster-maker, and tamer, what spectacle is this? what pleasure? what delight? what pulchritude? what beautie is this in her? what regall state and maiestie?

Ã´ who shall then be vanquished, when euerie one is wotthie to ouercome? I haue enough of felicitie, for I swim in a vast and boundlesse ocean of rapture, and surfeit in a riot of superaboundant delacies. When no longer able to conteine himselfe from satiating his heigthned appetite with one of them at least (or had it been possible, with all) he desired that they would singly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto him, as not knowing how iustly to determine, when his two eyes were distracted three wayes at once.

Thou hast beheld me (Ã´ <hi>Paris</hi>) from the crowne to the heele, neither in all my bodie canst thou find the least blemish, then iudge me the fairest; Scepters, Crownes, &amp; Kingdomes, Potentates, Empires and Dominions are in my gift: I will first make thee Emperor of all Asia, of which thy father hath but a nooke or corner; and if that satisfie not thy am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Lord and Ruler of the world.

Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shee was proceeding, when he interrupted her thus; I haue no neede (<hi>Minerua</hi>) of martiall discipline or militarie prowesse: Asia is in peace, Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia &amp; Lydia without disturbance, my fathers Empire fearelesse of hostilitie, nor doe I despise your great and godlike offers, nor would I haue you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, but you may now put on your helmet, for I haue sufficiently beheld you all ouer. She departed, and smiling <hi>Venus</hi> lastly presented herselfe with
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:20365:234"/>
an a morous looke &amp; moouing affabilitie, thus saying, Behold me <hi>Paris,</hi> looke on me consideratly, and view me in all and euerie part exactly, let not thine eyes wander loosely but stedfastly dwell and insist vpon euerie lineament with iudgement. This Face, these Eyes, this Necke, these Armes (and spread them wide, in which hee could not chuse but wish himselfe lockt) these Paps, this Wombe, this &amp;c. and what thy eyes see not, let thy thoughts fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly apprehend. Hast thou not perused me ynough? yet consider mee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; what are kingdomes but cares? or thrones but troubles? what are battailes but bloodsheds? or victories but triumphs ouer slaughter? To loue and be beloued is content, and that conteines a kingdome in it selfe; to war and here to vanquish, combat and thus to come off, is honour without harme, and conquest without crueltie; nor is this feature on which thy eyes dwell with such admiration, the guerdon proposed thee for my victorie: but a Face fairer, Eyes brighter, Hands whiter, Flesh softer, Skinne purer, Hayre more imitating gold, and Lippes more liuely resembling rubies. Thinke on such kisses <hi>Paris, Hellens, Hellens</hi> of Sparta, she is the daughter of <hi>Leda,</hi> whom <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the shape of a Swanne deflowred; white therfore she must needes bee, and tender, as hatched by so beautifull a byrd. This is that <hi>Hellen</hi> whom <hi>Theseus</hi> thought worthie of a rape, and royall <hi>Menelaus</hi> of the <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidan</hi> familie, his Hymenaean contract: if thou fearest and doubtest to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this superaboundance of happinesse, loe I haue two children, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie</hi> and <hi>Loue,</hi> these I will deliuer vnto thee, who shall be captaines of thy Voyage, vnder thee their generall, <hi>Cupid</hi> my eldest shall inflame her, &amp; <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie</hi> shall make thee gratious and amiable in her eyes; I will more ouer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate the <hi>Graces</hi> to be companions with thee in thy iourney.

tooke her gentle proffer, and went with her vp the stayres: where they two being alone (and a Bed in the Roome) Beere being brought vp, shee began to offer him more than common courtesie, being so farre from modestie, that shee almost prostituted her selfe vnto him. Which hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, asked her in plaine tearmes, If these were not meere prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to incite him to Lust? which shee as plainely confessed. To whom he replyed, That since it was so, he was most willing to accept of her kind proffer; onely for modestie sake, hee desired her to shew him into a darker roome. To which she assented, and leads him from one place to another; but hee still told her, that none of all these was darke enough: insomuch, that shee began at length somewhat to distaste him, because in all that time hee had not made vnto her any friendly proffer. At length shee brought him into a close narrow roome, with nothing but a Loope-hole for Light, and told him, Sir, vnlesse you purpose to goe into the Coale-house, this is the darkest place in the house: How doth this please you? To whom he answered, Vnlesse (thou strumpet) thou canst bring me to a place so palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tenebrious, into which the eyes of Heauen cannot pierce and see me, thou canst not persuade me to an act so detestable before God and good men: For cannot he that sees into the hearts and reines of all, behold vs here in our wickednesse? And further proceeding, told her the heynous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of her sinne towards God, that her prostitution was in sight of him and his Angels, and the euerlasting punishment thereto belonging. Or if (irreligious as shee was) shee held these but Dreames and Fables, hee bad her consider her estate in this world, and what her best could be; a Whore: the name odious, the profession abhominable; despised of the indifferent, but quite abandoned of those confirmed in Vertue: That shee was in her selfe but a meere Leprosie, to destroy her selfe, and infect others, a Sinke of Sinne and Diseases. Or if her extraordinarie good fortune were such, to escape the Spittle and the Surgeon, yet shee was a continuall vasall to euerie Constable and Beadle, neuer certaine of her Lodging, if not in the Stocks, in the Cage, but the chiefest of her hopes in Bridewell, &amp;c. To conclude, hee read vnto her so strict and austere a Lecture, concerning her base and debosht life, that from an impudent Strumpet, hee wrought her to be a repentant Conuertite. Her Brasen forhead melted at his fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie zeale, and all those skales of Immodestie (like a Maske plucked off) fell from her face, and shee appeared to him in her former simple and innocentious life. When further questioning with her of her birth and countrey, shee freely confessed vnto him, That shee was borne in the North countrey, her father a gentleman, once of faire Reuenue; but being impouerished by peeuish Suites in Law, her mother first, and hee (whether by age, or griefe, shee knew not) soone after died. Shee being an Orphant, and left distressed, loth to begge of those whom her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had before relieued, finding charitie there cold, and willing rather to appeare base any where, than where shee was knowne, sold such small things as shee had, to come vp to London with the Carriers: where shee was no sooner allighted at her Inne, but shee was hyred by this Bawd (altogether vnacquainted with her base course of life) who by degrees trayned her to such base prostitution: but withall protested with teares, that course of life was hatefull vnto her; and had shee any friend, or kinsman, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:20365:236"/>
which in her soule she detested, she would become a new woman, desiring that one moneth of her leaudnesse might be forgot, for from that houre shee protested Chastitie all her life time after. Her apparant teares and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming penitence much perswading with the gentleman, he protested, If it lay in him, he would otherwise dispose of her according to her wishes; and withall charging her, That if hee sent vnto her within two or three dayes with money, to acquit her of the house, that shee would attyre her selfe as modestly as shee could possibly, not bringing with her any one ragge that belonged to that abhominable house, or any borrowed garment in which she had offended, but instantly to repaire vnto him, at his first sending: and this being agreed betwixt them, for that time they parted. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wonderous carefull of his vndertaking (because shee was now his new creature) came to a Matron-like gentlewoman, a kinswoman of his afarre off (with whom and her husband hee had familiar acquaintance, and by that meanes daily accesse to the house, who had prettie fine children, and were of a faire reuenue) and told her there was a ciuile maid (a kinswoman of his, lately come out of the countrey) who wanted a seruice, whom if shee pleased to entertaine, it might prooue a great good to her, and no lesse courtesie to him. Briefely, the motion was accepted, shee sent for, according to appointment, and (after he had tutored her in all things which shee should answere) accepted, and entertained. Her modest behauior and faire carriage, with her tender loue and diligence about the children, woon her in short time a good opinion of her maister, a greater affection from her mistresse, and a generall loue of the whole household; insomuch, that within lesse than a yeere shee was raysed from a Chambermaid, to be Waiting-gentlewoman, and the onely bosome friend of her mistresse: who falling sicke, euen to death, readie to expire her last, so much doted on her new seruant, that shee sent for her husband, and besought him (if it stood with his good liking so to dispose of himselfe) after her decease to make that woman his wife, and mother to his children; for one more louing and carefull hee should not finde, and search England thorow and thorow. The gentlewoman soone after dyes, hee is left a widower, and the charge of the whole house committed to our new Conuertite, with the bringing vp of his children. Which shee executed with such fidelitie, that hee casting a more curious eye vpon her youth and beautie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remembring his wiues last words, not knowing for the present how better to dispose of himselfe (Time, Place, and Opportunitie, all things furthering her preferment) hee contracted himselfe vnto her, and they were soone after married. But before any of these late passages happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I must remember you, that instantly vpon the preferment of this young woman, the gentleman who brought her this fortune, aduentured all his meanes vpon a Voyage, which miscarryed (for the shippe wherein hee sayled, was taken by the Spaniard, and hee almost a tweluemoneth kept prisoner in Lisbone.) But at length (by what meanes I know not) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ransomed, he came for his countrey, but so poorely and deiected, that hee was ashamed to shew himselfe to any of his friends: for hauing tryed some, and finding their charitie cold, hee was loth to make proofe of the rest; insomuch, that hee walked by Owle-light, without a Cloake, and scarce had honest ragges to couer him from nakednesse, or hide him from shame. It happened, that iust vpon his returne the old gentleman died too,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:20365:236"/>
and left her possessed of eight hundred a yeere during the minoritie of the children, but the thirds howsoeuer: and withall (so great and good opinion he had of her) that he made her full Executor. Now iust as shee followed the Herse to the Church (hauing diuerse suitors before her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands bodie was scarce cold) this gentleman by chance comming by, like the picture of the Prodigall (as I before relate him to you) shee casting her eye aside, had espyed him, and presently apprehended him to be the man he was, and whispering a seruant in the eare (willing to be truly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) bad him to fall into discourse with him, to enquire his name, his Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, with other questions, as she directed him, and so proceeded to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; but in any case to speake nothing as from her. The seruant fell off from the Trayne, and did as he was commanded, and without suspition of him that was questioned, brought her true word how all things stood. The next morning (by her appointment) came a gentleman very early to his Lodging (shee hauing taught him his Lesson before hand) who desired to speake with him, and first asked him his name, which (though loth) he told him: the other proceeded, that if he were the same man he pretended, he had heard of his worth and noble qualities, and withall, of his casualties at Sea; and not willing that any gentleman should groane beneath so great a burthen, told him there was a hundred pounds, bad him furnish himselfe with apparrell and other necessaries, and so was readie to take his leaue. The other extasied with so great a courtesie from a stranger, whom hee had not seene before, enforced him backe, to know what reason he had to be so cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, entreating him to consider what hope he had of future satisfaction, or at least to resolue him what securitie he demanded. The other answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That for the first, his courtesie was grounded vpon his worth; his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, was in his acknowledgement; and his securitie, in that he knew him honest, and told him some three dayes after he would call vpon him, when hee was habited like himselfe, to entreat his further acquaintance, and so presently left him. But troubled in his mind aboue wonder, to receiue such bountie from a man vnknowne, when all his kindred and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friends were ashamed of his acquaintance; yet tooke the benefit of the present occasion, and suited himselfe according to his former, not his present fortunes. When the gentleman came according to promise, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med glad to see this present alteration, and withall entreated him to walke abroad with him to dinner: hee (who could not denie him any thing) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med willingly to assent, not once demanding whither. In the meane time, the late widow had prouided a great Feast, whither shee had inuited all her suitors (who were not few) this gentleman whom shee had imployed (and knew no further of her mind) being one of the chiefest. Meat was vpon the Table, the guests readie to sit downe; now the last that came in, were the two new friends late remembred: In comes the widow, to bid them all welcome. This new made vp gentleman ignorant of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer had before happened, demanded of his friend, If it were not such a woman? who briefely told him all: How shee came a stranger to the house, and what a fortune by her good demeanure she had in a short time purchased; That shee was now a widow, had such and such meanes left, and all or most of those gentlemen (and himselfe amongst the rest) were suitors, and that their hope was, this day shee would make choyse of a husband. Whatsoeuer he thought, he said nothing for the present.
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:20365:237"/>
The widowes turne was to place euerie man according to his degree, or at least to our owne fancie: this new gentleman was neglected, and the stooles being furnisht, left standing at a bay window: She tooke place at the tables end only, leauing her husbands chaire emptie, when suddenly starting vp, Me thinks saith she, some one in this roome might be well spared, for we haue more guests than stooles. The gentleman at these words bit his lip, and was intreated to sit downe by his friends, but whilest they were straining curtesie, she proceeded, Is this a suitor too? no question some that either hath borrowed his clothes, or ingaged all his credit for this one new suit, in hope to gaine the widdow; but women are now adaies growne more wise. By whose acquaintance came he hither? Mine, answered his friend: then saith she, perhaps he wants a dinner, and hath not mony to pay for his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie: Well, he may sit downe amongst the rest; some of you there make him some small elbow roome. These words made him wish himselfe againe prisoner in Lisbone, or any where, saue where he was. This was sport to the rest, but torture to him, who much blamed her ingratitude, yet arming him with patience (the rather for his friends sake who brought him thither) he sate downe silent with an ill stomack, eating as little as he spake. All were merrie at the table, some of them making him their mirth the rather to please her. A Health went round to the widowes next husband: All pledged it gladly, hee enforcedly. At length rising from her stoole: Me thinkes (saith she) we are all merrie, onely that gentleman at the lower end of the Table is melancholy: but I know the reason, it is perhaps because he is placed so low; but if that be his disease, I haue for it a present reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: when walking to him where he sat, she pluckt him by the sleeue, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to remooue, for she had another place for him. Who desiring her to torment him no further, refused to rise: but shee would needs enforce him, the rest likewise persuading, as wondering what further sport shee would make with him. Well (saith hee) I am this day yours, but will be mine owne euer hereafter: And so being drawne by her to the vpper end of the chamber like a Beare to the stake, where her late husbands Chayre stood emptie: Now Sir (saith shee, with a more serious countenance than before) my new husband, sit here in my old husbands Chayre, and bid these your guests welcome. Still hee fretted, and they laught, as before: when she crauing pardon for so abusing his patience, openly protested, That this meeting was meerely for his sake, and to make them witnesses of their present contract: for if hee refused her to wife, shee vowed neuer to haue other husband; acknowledging, that all her fortunes (next to the Diuine Prouidence) came by his goodnesse (omitting the former circumstances) and that she knew no way better to expresse her gratitude, than to conferre them on him, by whom they first came. Thus the close proued better than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the banquet of Sweet-meats made amends for the harsh Feast, for they found this last (of all the other passages) to be only serious. They were there contracted (the suitors witnesses and soone after married. And thus his vertue and her conuersion had one ioint Reward.</p>
