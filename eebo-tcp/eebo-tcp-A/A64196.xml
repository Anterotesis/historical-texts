            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO PREVENT The Export of Bullion, FOR PURCHASING <hi>FLAX, HEMP, and LINNEN.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>ENgland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> being under one Government, and lying ſo near to each other, muſt partake in each others Fortune for ever. And the Land of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being ſo very productive of Flax and Hemp, and the People's natural Inclination tending to Spinning, would, with a ſmall Incouragement, ſoon give Life to the Linnen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory there; but at preſent, what to do with what they now make, they are at at a loſs, the overplus reſting uſeleſs (being cheaper made in other Parts, though not in <hi>England,)</hi> which is their only Hindrance to a more vigorous Progreſs therein, and neceſſitates the Improvement of their Lands, and their Labours in other Husbandry.</p>
            <p>It being conceived to be the Intereſt of both Kingdoms to propagate the Linnen Manufactory in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I humbly propoſe, That all Flax, Hemp, and the Manufactures thereof of the Growth of <hi>Ireland,</hi> may be Imported into <hi>England</hi> Duty-Free, which will be of many Advantages to <hi>England,</hi> for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That what <hi>Ireland</hi> produces, will abate the like Quantities from other Nations, which now do greatly occaſion the Ballance of Trade to our prejudice, for no one ſort of Commodity does ſo exhauſt our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as Flax, Hemp, and Linnen.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will employ their Lands and Hands, in Productions and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories different from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They being of our ſelves do purſue the ſame Modes, all they can, in Apparel, Houſe, Furniture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and would do more, might the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are able to make, be accepted in <hi>England,</hi> whereby the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quantities of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures (Woollen not excepted,) would be uttered there; in lieu whereof they are now conſtrained to produce ſuch Commodities as will beſt vend among themſelves, and procure beſt Returns from Foreign Parts.</p>
            <p>To ſet down the many Advantages it may be to both Nations would be too large for ſo ſmall a Treatiſe, and therefore I ſhall leave it here with the Wiſdom of our Legiſlators, to conſider whether it is, or is not, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>England,</hi> to encourage the Linnen Manufactory, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Import from thence Cuſtom-Free.</p>
