            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the border that encloſed the Sceans and made a frontiſpice to all the worke, in a ſquare Neech on the right hand ſtood two figures of women, one of them expreſſing much majeſty in her aſpect, apparelled in sky colour with a crowne of gold on her head, and a bridle in her hand, repreſenting Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: the other embracing her was in changeable ſilke with wings at her ſhoulders, figured for intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall Appetite, who while ſhe imbraceth Reaſon, all the actions of men are rightly governed. Above theſe in a ſecond order, were winged children, one ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on a furious Lion, which hee ſeemes to tame with reynes and a bit: Another bearing an Antique enſigne: the third hovering above with a branch of Palme in his hand, expreſſing the victory over the Perturbations. In a Neech on the other ſide ſtood two figures joyning hands, one a grave old man in a robe of purple, with a heart of gold in a chayne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, figured for Counſell; the other a woman, in a garment of cloth of gold, in her hand a ſword with a ſerpent winding about the blade, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting Reſolution, both theſe being neceſſary to the good meanes of arriving to a vertuous end.</p>
            <p>Over theſe and anſwering to the other ſide was a round Altar rayſed high, and on it the bird of Pallas, figured for Prudence: on eyther ſide were children with wings, one in act of Adoration, another hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a booke, and a third flying over their heads with a lighted Torch in his hand, repreſenting the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall light accompanied with Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and alluding to the figures below, as thoſe on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23416:4"/>Above theſe ran a large Freeſe, with a Cornice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in the midſt wherof was a double Comparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rich and full of ornament: on the top of this ſate Fame with ſpreaded wings, in act, ſounding a Trumpet of gold: joyning to the Compartiment in various poſtures lay two Figures in their naturall colours as big as the life; one holding an Anchor repreſenting ſafety; the other expreſſing Riches, with a Cornu-copia; and about her ſtood Antique vaſes of gold. The reſt of this Freeſe was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Children, with ſignificant ſignes to expreſſe their ſeverall qualities; Forgetfulneſſe of injuries, extinguiſhing a flaming torch on an Armor; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, with eares of Corne; Felicity, with a basket of Lillies; Affection to the Countrey, holding a Graſhopper; Proſperous ſucceſſe, with the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Ship; Innocence, with a branch of Fearne: All theſe expreſſing the ſeverall goods, followers of peace and Concord, and fore-runners of humane felicity: ſo as the worke of this Front conſiſting of Picture qualified with morall Philoſophy, temper'd delight with profit.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of the aforeſaid Compartiment in an Ovall Table was written.</p>

            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23416:4"/>But before I proceed in the deſcriptions of the Sceanes, it is not amiſſe briefly to ſet downe the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories from whence theſe Proverbs tooke their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall.</p>
            <p>For the firſt <hi>Melas</hi> and <hi>Arevanias</hi> of <hi>Argos,</hi> and <hi>Troezen</hi> conducted a common Colony to <hi>Habicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and there drave out the barbarous <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>Lelegi,</hi> who fled up to the Mountaines; from whence they made many incurſions, robbing and cruelly ſpoyling the Grecian Inhabitants, which could by no meanes be prevented.</p>
            <p>On the top of the right horne of the hill which ſurrounds <hi>Halicarnaſſus,</hi> in forme of a Theater, is a famous Fountaine of moſt cleare water, and exquiſite taſte called <hi>Salmacis:</hi> It happened that neere to this Fountaine one of the Colony (to make gaine by the goodneſſe of the water) ſet up a Taverne, and furniſh'd it with all neceſſaries, to which the Barbarians reſorting (entiſed by the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious taſte of this water, at firſt ſome few, and after many together in troops,) of fierce and cruell na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, were reduced of their owne accord to the ſweetneſſe of the Grecian cuſtomes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other <hi>Adage</hi> is thus derived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Citie of <hi>Thebes,</hi> anciently called <hi>Cadmia,</hi> had warre with <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> the Argive King, who raiſed a great Army of <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Miſſenians,</hi> and fought a battaile with them neere <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> where the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> were overthrowne, turned their backs, and fled into their City; the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> (not accuſtomed to skale walled Townes) aſſaulting furiouſly, but
<pb facs="tcp:23416:5"/>
without order, were repulſt from the walls by the defendants, and may of the <hi>Argives</hi> ſlaine: at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the beſieged making a great ſally, and finding the enemy in diſorder and confuſion, cut them all in pieces, onely <hi>Adraſtus</hi> excepted, who was ſaved by flight: but this victory was gotten with great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſlaughter of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> for few of them returned alive into their City.</p>
            <p>The alluſion is, That his Majeſty out of his mercy and clemency approoving the firſt Proverbe, ſeekes by all meanes to reduce tempeſtuous and turbulent natures into a ſweet calme of Civill concord.</p>
            <p>A Curtayne flying up, a horrid Sceane appeared of ſtorme and tempeſt: no glimpſe of the Sun was ſeene, as if darkeneſſe, confuſion, and deformity, had poſſeſt the world, and driven light to Heaven, the trees bending, as forced by a guſt of winde, their branches rent from their trunkes, and ſome torne up by the roots: a farre off was a darke wrought ſea, with rowling billowes, breaking againſt the rockes, with rayne, lightning and thunder: in the midſt was a globe of the Earth, which at an inſtant falling on fire, was turned into a Fury, her hayre upright, mixt with ſnakes, her body leane wrinkled and of a ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy colour, her breaſts hung bagging downe to her waſte, to which with a knot of ſerpents was girt red baſes, and under it tawny skirts downe to her feet: in her hand ſhe brandiſht a ſable Torch, and looking a Scanſe with hollow envious eyes came downe into the Roome.</p>
