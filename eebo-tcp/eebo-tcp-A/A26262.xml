         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Translator to the Reader.</head>
            <p>AMong the various Professors of the
Christian Religion, they who call
themselves <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> have
appear'd most zealous to spread abroad
their Superstitions in the far-distant, and
New-discover'd parts of the World. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be that the Curse of the <hi>Iews</hi> be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
'em, to be scatter'd or'e the face of the
Earth; or whether it be that their affinity
with Anti-Christ makes 'em more eager in
search of whom they may devour. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it be, certain it is, that the Jesuits and
other gadding Orders of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have for several years had a longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to settle themselves in <hi>China,</hi> as well as
in all the other parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Missionaries.</hi> This same zealous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
of these Missionaries has produc'd
the several Discoveries contain'd in the
ensuing <hi>Voyages;</hi> which in a Series of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
Kingdoms, have tack'd together
two Extremities of the World, that were
thought to lie disjoined from one another
<pb facs="tcp:100819:3"/>
before. A work of great importance for
the Advantages of Foreign Commerce
and Traffick, and becoming the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of all the <hi>European</hi> Princes.
However, because they could not be
transmitted to publick view, without the
interlarded Digressions and Intoxications
of <hi>Romish</hi> Superstitions, 'tis hop'd the
Reader will rather put a value upon what
he meets with full of weight and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
use, then mind the Impertinences
of the Writer; and look upon 'em as
the Flats and Sandbanks of some sorts
of Medly-Writing, which are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
just as our Sea-men shun the
Rocks and Shelves which they see before
their Eyes in Ordinary, though Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Navigation. For the Design of this
Translation was not to teach men the
way to Heaven, but to instruct 'em in
the several New-found Roads to <hi>China.</hi>

            <head>THE
Author's Preface.</head>
            <p>IT will not be improper in giving the Publick an
account of my Travels, to speak a word or two
about the Reasons that first induc'd me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
them. Some year ago the R. F. <hi>Verbirst</hi> of
the Society of Iesus, a famous Missionary in <hi>China,</hi>
acquainted his Superiors in <hi>Europe,</hi> that the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>East</hi> were in great want of Evangelical
Labourers; and that it would be easy to furnish
a considerable number of them, without exposing
them to the hazards that bad stopt the best part
of those who were going into <hi>China</hi> heretofore by
Sea. He show'd them that the <hi>Tartars</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
themselves Masters of <hi>China,</hi> has made a
Passage into that vast Empire through Great <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
and that it would be easy to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of the Commerce the <hi>Tartars</hi> had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
ever since with the <hi>Chineses,</hi> to introduce
the Light of the Gospel among both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>This Project prov'd the more acceptable, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that the loss of an infinite number of zealous
Missionaries, who had consummated the sacrifice
of their life, before they could reach the place of
<pb facs="tcp:100819:4"/>
their Mission, was sensibly regretted; and that this
way, though difficult in the beginning, did not
seem impracticable, since History mentions some
Travellers who have had the good fortune to reach
<hi>China</hi> by Land. But whereas the way thither
was not particularly known, I was pitch'd upon by
Providence, and by my Superiors, for the better
discovery thereof, and to get such instructions and
informations as were most proper to that end.</p>
            <p>I hope this Relation may prove serviceable to
such Missionaries who find themselves inclin'd to
carry the Gospel into those Countries; and that
charitable persons who are zealous for the glory
of God, will the more willingly contribute to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
so glorious, the execution whereof will daily
become the less difficult.</p>
            <p>Besides the advantage of those Missions which
was the principal aim of my Travels; my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will give several new insights into Sciences,
and particularly into <hi>Geography.</hi> I will give
an instance of it in this place. None had yet
been able to discover the exact distance of <hi>Peking.</hi>
It is true, that the last Relation of <hi>Siam,</hi> and
the Observations of the Stars, and of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
taken in those Countrys, and by the way, by
the Fathers of the Society of Iesus, sent thither
by his Majesty as his Mathematicians, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
show'd us, that our Geographical Maps
had plac'd the Extremities of <hi>Asia</hi> above 25 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
too far. But yet Mr. <hi>Isaac
Vossius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Var. obser. Lond. 1685.</note> who had already prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Sentiments about the
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asures of Longitude, taken
<pb facs="tcp:100819:4"/>
according to the Principles of <hi>Astronomy,</hi>
seem'd to distrust those kind of Proofs, and was
so far from allowing <hi>China</hi> to
be nearer,<note place="margin">Universal Lib. Tom. 8.</note> that he pretended it
lay even farther. The Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Siam</hi> not having been
able to convince him, he publish'd a small
Pamphlet to maintain his first Sentiments:
But Father <hi>Gouye</hi> Professor of
the Mathemathicks at the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Lewis le XIV.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Physic. &amp; Mathemat. Obser. Par. 1688.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
all his Reasons, in a very
solid manner, which satisfi'd
the Publick.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that both the Ancient and
Modern Astronomers have effectually made
use of the Eclipses of the Moon to determine
Longitudes; and those who are any wise vers'd
in those Matters, know how much we are oblig'd
to <hi>Galilee</hi> for the discovery
of the <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
and the value we ought to set
upon the Learned easy method the illustrious
<hi>M. Capini</hi> has given us to find out Longitudes
with certainty, in discovering the Emersions
and Immersions of those Stars.</p>
            <p>It is childish to say, that we will not find
wherewithal to fill up the other Hemisphere;
and since <hi>M. Vossius</hi> was no
better vers'd in the Principles<note place="margin">Riccioli's Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ograph. refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. Dudl. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. del mare.</note>
of <hi>Astronomy</hi> and <hi>Geography</hi>
as <hi>M. de la Hire</hi> observes with
<pb facs="tcp:100819:5"/>
reason, he might at least, to satisfie himself,
have taken the trouble to look upon Father <hi>Ric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciolis</hi>
Geographical Tables, or <hi>Dudly</hi>'s Maps.
<hi>Vossius</hi> was undoubtedly a great man, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
well read, nay, beyond any other;
but at the same time it is undeniable, that the
desire of appearing universal, often plung'd
him into gross Errors, in taking him out of his
Province.</p>
            <p>In fine, I am perswaded, that were <hi>Vossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
alive still, tho never so prepossess'd with his
Hypothesis, he would yield to the Proofs that
are set down in this Book. And indeed, I have
not only observ'd the Stars to take the Altitudes
of the Countrys where I have been my self: I
have also follow'd the Rules he has prescrib'd,
to discover the exact extent of every Country,
the which he prefers to Astronomical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations:
I have taken information from the
Inhabitants; I have spoken to them, I have
heard from them how many days they employ'd
in travelling to <hi>China,</hi> and how many Leagues
they travell'd a day: I have seen them go
from <hi>Moscow,</hi> and come back from <hi>Peking:</hi>
In a word, I have taken such precautions, that
I have reason to believe I have not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.
All my third Book is chiefly employ'd
in relating the different Roads the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
and <hi>Tartars</hi> use to travels into <hi>China;</hi> for
which reason I call this Book, <hi>Travel into
China,</hi> tho I have not had the happiness to reach
it my self, according to my expectation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100819:5"/>
I may add in this place, that tho' our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
in general obliges us not to be sparing of
our Lives and Health, and to run to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
bounds of the World, through the greatest
dangers, to the assistance of Souls that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
by the Blood of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and that
we are engag'd so to do by a solemn Vow; yet
people may the better rely upon the certainty of
the Way I have discover'd, by reason that this
Project has been approv'd and follow'd by the
Superiors of our Society, who have always a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
eye upon our Foreign Missions, as the most
essential, and most holy part of our Profession,
and are always cautious not to expose their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors
too rashly, without a reasonable ground,
thereby to derive some advantage for the good
of the Church, and for the propagation of the
true Faith. So that it may be inferr'd from
thence, that they would not have hazarded
Twelve of their Brethren, all Persons of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Merit, who are gone within these few
Months for <hi>China,</hi> and all of them by Land,
unless they had found some solidity in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs</hi>
and Instructions I have given them.
There are yet several others, who being mov'd
by these Examples, and the desire of suffering
much for God's sake, are disposing themselves
for the same Iourney, who are resolv'd to take
the Way of the <hi>Yousbecs,</hi> and of <hi>Thibets,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the design that had been propos'd to
me by the late Count <hi>Syri,</hi> which he would have
put in execution before this, had not Death stopt
<pb facs="tcp:100819:6"/>
him in the middle of his Glorious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
            <p>In order not to lose time, and to make that
Road the easier for those that shall follow them,
they go first to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they
will find Father <hi>Beauvollier</hi> my Companion of
Mission, who will be the Bearer of the King's
Letters to the <hi>Cha</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> and who will
conduct this Apostolical Company to <hi>Trebesond,</hi>
to <hi>Erzerum,</hi> to <hi>Irivan,</hi> and to <hi>Schamaki.</hi>
They will tarry some time in all those Cities,
there to get new Informations, and to establish
good Correspondencies, as also to leave two or
three of their Company there to serve towards
the Conversion of the People of the Countrey, and
to give Instructions to the Missionaries that
shall henceforward go that way. From thence
they are to repair to <hi>Hispaan,</hi> which is the
Metropolitan of <hi>Persia,</hi> where they shall desire
the <hi>Cha</hi>'s Protection, and deliver our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's
Letters to him, whose Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Zeal will be very material for the solid
Establishment of our Design.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Hispaan</hi> they will repair to <hi>Samar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kand,</hi>
or to <hi>Bokara,</hi> there to make the like
Establishment, while Father <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> who
has been chosen by the Emperor of <hi>China</hi> to
succeed the late Father <hi>Verbirst</hi> in his Place of
President of the Tribunal of the Mathematicks,
will use his utmost Endeavours to facilitate
their design in <hi>China.</hi> They may likewise in
that Iourney learn the Language of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neze-Tartars.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100819:6"/>
They are also in hopes to meet
in their way from <hi>Bokara</hi> to <hi>Peking,</hi> among the
<hi>Chineze-Tartars,</hi> some of those that have been
converted in coming to the Court of <hi>Peking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Road has been chosen preferably to that of
the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> both for the Reasons set down
in my Book, and because Father <hi>Grimaldi</hi> is
always diffident of those Schismaticks, and dreads
their appearing too much in <hi>China</hi> to the shame of
Christianity, which they disgrace by their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Brutality.</p>
            <p>Our Superiors design to send yearly some Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionaries
who shall follow the same Road, and stop
at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> at <hi>Trebizond,</hi> at <hi>Irze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
at <hi>Irivan,</hi> and at <hi>Schamaki,</hi> in the room
of those who shall be su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>iciently acquainted with
the Languages to continue the Voyage of <hi>China.</hi>
The <hi>Persian</hi> Tongue will also be of use to them,
since it may serve to convert the <hi>Chineze-Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi>
whose Conversion St. <hi>Francis Xavier</hi>
did not neglect. 'Tis much easier to bring them to
the true Faith, than those who are under the
<hi>Turk</hi>'s Dominion.</p>
            <p>They may likewise usefully imploy themselves
during their Iourney in bringing back the <hi>Greeks</hi>
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which some of them are
pretty well inclin'd to, as it appears particularly
by what I have related of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and
by the Relation from <hi>Julfa,</hi> which I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd
to this Book. <hi>Julfa</hi> is a Subburb of <hi>His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paan,</hi>

The prodigious number of those who have

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100819:8"/>
'Tis to succour and help forward such pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and happy Inclinations, that extream
diligence has been us'd to procure as many
Labourers as it was possible, to disseminate
the Christian Doctrine; either to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the room of those, who after they had
gloriously ran their Race, were no longer
in a condition, through their great Age,
or other Infirmities, to cultivate this flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Mission; or to increase their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
proportionably to the New Converts,
who are multiply'd to that degree, that
one Pastor is forc'd to take upon him the care
of several Churches.</p>
            <p>One of the most Zealous Missionaries of
<hi>China,</hi> now grown old under the Burthen
of Evangelick Fatigues, declar'd to me some
years ago, after a most sensible manner,
the conditions of those Missions in a Letter,
wherein he invited me to go along and bear
my share with him in those extraordinary
Imployments, which he was no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
alone to take upon him. <q>I am all alone,
said he, in a Province which is above a
hundred and thirty Leagues in extent, with
four or five Churches under my care, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of which had formerly a Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it; so that I am forc'd to travel
a great part of the year, not having any
one to whom to make my Confession at the
point of Death, by reason of the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100819:8"/>
that separates us: And not only my
self, but a great many other Missionaries
are reduc'd to the same condition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding the great care that
is taken to send from time to time new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits
of Evangelic Labourers, to uphold
and propagate the Faith in this vast King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
what with Pirates, Shipwracks and
Diseases, what with other inconveniences of
a tedious and tiresome Navigation, still
many more are destroy'd and miscarry then
safely arrive in the Country. I have been
told by Father <hi>Couplet,</hi> an Illustrious Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary,
whom all <hi>Paris</hi> beheld with so
much satisfaction after his return from <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
where he had resided above thirty
years; That he had made it his business to
make an exact computation of the number
of Jesuits who had set forward out of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> in order to undertake
the Mission he had quitted, and that he
had found that of six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
who had taken Shipping
for <hi>China,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Near four hunder'd Iesuits perish'd going to <hi>China.</hi>

Therefore to avoid for the
future the loss of so many
Missionaries,<note place="margin">A design to find out a new way by Land to <hi>China.</hi>
               </note> of which the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
and Kingdoms farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
will be a long time sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
a Resolution has been taken some few
years since, to find out a Passage into <hi>China</hi> by
Land. Nor was it a difficult thing to meet
with people who were willing to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
toward so great a Design. Among
others who presented themselves in order to
this new attempt, I my self was made
choice of, and I have had the consolation to
make it my business these five years together.
To this purpose it was that I travell'd all over
<hi>Turky, Persia, Armenia,</hi> the <hi>Southern Tartary,
Muscovie,</hi> both <hi>Prussia's,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia;</hi> that
I took Shipping several times in different
Seas of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia;</hi> and that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
my self, though with a great deal of
pleasure and delight, to all those Dangers
which I knew were not to be avoided by
those who undertook such laborious and
toilsome Voyages.</p>
            <p>Before my departure from <hi>Paris,</hi> I went
to <hi>Montmartre,</hi> to the end I might collect
together some Sparkles of that Sacred Fire
which St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> and St. <hi>Francis Xavier</hi> left,
even after their Death, as Reliques still suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to inflame the Hearts of their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Children. After which, in company
with Father <hi>Couplet,</hi> I went to <hi>Lion,</hi> where
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100819:9"/>
I was forc'd to quit him, and continue my
Journey to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> where I was to take
Shipping.</p>
            <p>There it was that God was pleas'd to give
me a tast of some parts of that Comfort,
before I left <hi>France,</hi> which formerly
St. <hi>Bernard</hi> felt, when he forsook the
World.</p>
            <p>One of my Brethren, already a Priest,
spurr'd on like my self with a desire of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting
him to the conversion of Infidels, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook
me at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> before my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in order to let me know his Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to share with me in the Toil and Labour
which I was about to undertake. Now in
regard he had for some time before prepar'd
himself, in pursuance of a zealous and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Life, for this Employment, I thought it
high time to procure him the happiness
which he had all along so passionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd;
which was, that we might be both
together more strictly united in the Bonds of
Grace, then we had been till that time by
the Ties of Nature. To which purpose
meeting in this Port with the convenience
of a Vessel of St. <hi>Malo's,</hi> bound for <hi>Cività
Vecchia,</hi> we embark'd, and after a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and quick Passage landing safely, we
continu'd our Journey to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>Charles de Novelle,</hi> who was then
General of the Jesuits, was readily induc'd
to grant us the favour which we requested
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100819:10"/>
of him. For he admitted my Brother into
the Society; and after several particular
marks of a Goodness really paternal, he
gave his Blessing to both of us. And no
sooner had we receiv'd it, but we hasten'd
to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> to embark our selves in a Vessel
that was bound for the <hi>East,</hi> in company
with a Man of War called the <hi>Thundring
Iupiter,</hi> the Captain of which had been dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin'd
by the King some years before, for
engaging, alone, four Pirates of <hi>Tripoli</hi> for
three days together, and putting 'em to
flight.</p>
            <p>Our stay in this City was longer then we
expected: However we lay not idle. For
in regard we were oblig'd to spend our
<hi>Christmas</hi> there, till the lading of both
Ships that lay bound for <hi>Cyprus</hi> were ready,
the Officers and Seamen lying a Shipboard
in the Road, found us business enough du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that Holy Season: For we confess'd
'em, and gave 'em, almost all, the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and because they were not permitted to
go ashore, we made a kind of a Floating-Church
of the biggest of the two Vessels;
where all the people being assembl'd, found
wherewithal to satisfie their Devotion, in
such Exercises of Piety as we took care to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
among 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100819:10"/>
Some days after,<note place="margin">Two Vessels set sail form <hi>Leghorn</hi> for the <hi>East,</hi> in 1685.</note> they gave
us notice that they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to weigh Anchor, and that
therefore we must hasten to
take our Places in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a fair Wind, which
serv'd the same day that we embark'd,
which was the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the year

            <p>Of all the Accidents that
cross'd us in our Voyage,<note place="margin">They are toss'd by terrible Tempests within sight of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
               </note>
none discomposs'd us so much
as a most dreadful Tempest,
which toss'd us most severely
within sight of the Coast of
<hi>Candy,</hi> after we had been
some days before as extreamly and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
becalm'd. This happen'd upon
the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> being St. <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Day,
that a <hi>Greek</hi> Wind rising about Midnight,
after the going down of the Moon, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
redness of which was a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
presage to us, found us a world of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and exercis'd the Skill of all the
Seamen for four and twenty hours together;
and in regard the Storm grew fiercer and
fiercer still as day began to break, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
the Sea to that degree, that in a short
time we could see nothing but Mountains
and Abysses of Water. All the while our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100819:11"/>
Vessel, which could hardly bear her Sprit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail,
tho it was almost quite furl'd up, was
so terribly toss'd by the Waves that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
beat upon her, and pour'd into her
without ceasing, that we look'd every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to have been swallow'd up.</p>
            <p>These terrible shogs, together with the
dreadful roaring of the Sea, and the outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
fury of the Wind, which would not
permit the Seamen to hand the Sails, and
stand at the Steerage, so extreamly astonish'd
our people, that every body abandon'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his Dispair, without minding any
Orders that were given; there was nothing
but hurry, alarum and confusion: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the Captain, who knew not
what course in the world to take, nor how
to make the Seamen obey his Command,
who stood all holding fast by some part or
other of the Ship, for fear of being crush'd
to pieces, or ding'd into the Sea, was
forc'd to commit himself for some time to
the mercy of the Billows, without any other
hope then that of being thrown upon the
Coast of <hi>Barbary;</hi> where if he could not
save the Vessel, at least he might save the
Mens Lives.</p>
            <p>In this deplorable Condition, at what
time the Image of Death, which appear'd
in the faces of all the forlorn Mariners,
and terrify'd me more then all the rest,
God inspir'd me with so much courage, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100819:11"/>
notwithstanding the consternation I was in,
I took advantage of the stupifying terror of
the Seamen, and caus'd 'em to bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of their Eternal Salvation, at a time
when they had no thoughts of any other. To
which purpose, after I had first of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
my self for all Events that could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
us, I endeavour'd to recover 'em out
of that same prodigious insensibility where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were, and to put 'em in mind of
the preservation of their Souls; the loss of
which concern'd 'em more then that of their
Bodies, which seem'd to be inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>I was very much overjoy'd to see several
of the Sea-men come and make their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
at my Feet, while others perform'd
several open and signal Acts of Contrition
and Conformity to the Will of God; to
Faith, Hope and Charity, as I had been
careful to infuse into their Minds. At the
same time I took the advantage of their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Inclinations, to admonish 'em to put
their confidence in the Holy Virgin, and to
make their Addresses to her at such a time
of eminent danger. In short, we soon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be sensible of her powerful Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in such a singular manner, that we
could no longer question but that she had
effectually interceded for us with him
whom Seas and Winds are bound to obey.
For no sooner had I brought 'em to promise
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100819:12"/>
me to make Confession, and receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
in honour of her, if e're we came
to be so happy as to get safe ashore; but we
began to be in hopes of that assistance which
we expected from above. All resum'd fresh
courage in an instant; and whether it
were that God made 'em look upon the
Danger to be less then it was, or whether
the long continuance of the Storm had made
'em less sensible, every one put themselves
forward to make good the Vessel against the
violence of the Waves that still tumbl'd
and toss'd it with an extraordinary
force; and at length the Wind being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
abated, the men absolutely recover'd
themselves, and the Calm which insensibly
return'd, put us in a condition to steer our
first intended Course.</p>
            <p>Which we did so prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,<note place="margin">After three days Voyage they come to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in <hi>Lerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> Road.</note>
that within two days
after we descry'd the Island
of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Land of which
appear'd so much the more
delightful to us, in regard
that but a little before we never thought of
seeing Land any more. Now because the
two Vessels that set sail from <hi>Leghorn</hi> had
appointed to meet in the Road of <hi>Lerneca,</hi>
we came to an Anchor there the 25th. of
<hi>Ianuary,</hi> which was the twelfth of our being
at Sea. There we thought to have met the
<hi>Thundring Iupiter,</hi> which indeed might well
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100819:12"/>
have been there before us, as being the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sailer, though the bigger Ship. But
the Tempest which had separated us at first,
had handl'd her so rudely, that after the
Men had thought they should have been
swallow'd up by the Water which she took
in on every side, she was forc'd to put in
by the way, and refit, before she could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake
us. However, being uncertain as
we were, what was become of her, and
designing to be assur'd of what we were to
trust to, we were permitted to put in to
<hi>Lerneca,</hi> and go ashore to refresh our selves,

War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lerneca,</hi> which was formerly a City of a
large extent, as may well be judged by the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness
of her Ruins, is now no more then
a Village seated about a quarter of a Mile
from the Sea, to the <hi>South,</hi> and inhabited by
several considerable and wealthy Merchants,
as being one of those places in the Island of
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> where the greatest Trade is driven.
The Fathers of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> have there a
very convenient Covent; and the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins</hi>
also a most delightful Mansion.
Which latter being <hi>French,</hi> whereas the
others are almost all <hi>Spaniards,</hi> we took up
our Lodging with the <hi>Capuchins:</hi> Nor can
any thing be added to the Entertainment
which they gave us, nor to the charitable care
which they took to recover us from our past
Hardships.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100819:13"/>
The Fertility of this Island
is so great,<note place="margin">The Beauty and Fertility of the Island of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
               </note> and there is such
an extraordinary plenty of all
things for the support of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Life, that there is not
perhaps any part of the World
where a man brought down by Sickness

Strength and Health. The Wines are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and all the Fruits delicious; the

general, whatever is to be
desir'd, either to supply the

Pleasures of a Voluptuous

such vast abundance, that this
Island may contend for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and Conveniency with
any other in the World.</p>
            <p>But in the midst of these great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
it wants fresh Water; there not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all the Island above one Spring that
is not brackish. This Fountain lies exactly
upon the Sea-shore; yet notwithstanding
the nearness of it to the Sea, preserves the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100819:13"/>
sweet and delicious Tast which distinguishes
it from the rest. I leave it to the Philosophers
to unfold this Prodigy of Nature, which tho
frequent enough, yet seems to have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a wonder in it.</p>
            <p>During our stay in this
Island,<note place="margin">The Curiosity of some <hi>French</hi> Passengers pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </note> an ugly Accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell
some Passengers that were
embark'd aboard our Vessel.
One day, that they were
walking upon the Sea-shore where the
<hi>Turks</hi> have a little Fort, but meanly guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
their Curiosity led 'em to enter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Place, where the Avenues were all
open, never considering how dangerous it
was to give the least suspicion to a People
that are so jealous of the Christians, and
look upon 'em as their most mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Upon this, a Soldier that was not
far off, observing 'em, after he had call'd
some of his Companions, ran to 'em in a
terrible chafe, belabour'd 'em with a great
Cudgel, and had certainly knockt out their
Brains, but for some Domestic Servants of
the <hi>French</hi> Consul, that happen'd to come
by in the interim by chance, who put a
stop to the Fury of the Soldiers; giving
them to understand, that they were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
altogether ignorant of the Custom of
the Country; that they dreamt no harm,
only thought they might have been allow'd
the same liberty, as is usually permitted in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100819:14"/>
               <hi>Europe,</hi> where it was a common thing for
any Body to enter into such Places which
they find unguarded, and without Defence.
But this business was not so put up; for the
Consul sent an Express to <hi>Nicosia,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the Brutishness of the Soldier, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he was order'd to receive a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Bastinado's.</p>
            <p>After some days Repose, the <hi>Thundring
Iupiter</hi> arriving, tho very much shatter'd
by the Tempest, we reimbark'd to set sail
for <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> in company with another
Vessel of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> that joyn'd us at <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
We set sail both together at the same time,
and at the same time also found our selves
by the favour of a fair Wind at <hi>Nore,</hi> just
against the Gulf of <hi>Alexandretta;</hi> near the
entrance into which was to be discover'd at
a good distance, a Point of Land running
out a great way into the Sea, and which
the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Canzir,</hi> or the <hi>Wild Boar,</hi>
because this Cape resembles perfectly the
Head of a Wild Boar.</p>
            <p>Before we doubl'd this
Promontory,<note place="margin">Two Vessels fall foul one upon another, through the Imprudence of the Pilot.</note> our Pilot being
desirous to give notice to the
Pilot of the other Vessel what
Course to Steer in the Night,
which was at hand, had like
to have destroy'd both the
one and the other, as well by Surprise, as
by Imprudence. For while he bore up too
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100819:14"/>
near the t'other Ship, to the end he might
be the better heard, not considering that we
sail'd with a side-wind, he quite lost the
Wind, which the Sail of the t'other Ship
depriv'd him of; so that the Current ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
brought 'em foul upon the other,
never was known such a terrible Out-cry
and Confusion among the Sea-men. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
they betook themselves to their
Booms to hinder the two Massy-bulks from
Bilging one against the other; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the motion of the Waves carry'd 'em
with great Violence, and for that their
Yards Arms and Cordage were entangl'd
one within another, never were two Ships
thought to be so near perishing. But at
length, by cutting the Masts, Yards, and
Tackle, they made a shift to get clear of
each other. After which, having refitted
their Rigging as well as they could, for
the short way they had to make, we got
safe into Port the next day, maugre all
the unlucky Accidents that had befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> which the
<hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Scandaroon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">We arrived at <hi>Alexandret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi>

in a very unwholesome
spot of Ground, by reason that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
with which it is every way surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
hinder the Wind from ventilating
and purifying the Air, which is extreamly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100819:15"/>
thick, and being heated and inflam'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Summer, causes many violent and
malignant Distempers. And notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Advice, which had been given us
before our Departure out of <hi>France,</hi> to make
but a very little stop there, we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to stay for Three whole weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till the Roads infested by the Soldiers,
that were continually upon their March out
of <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> were a little rid of
those troublesome Passengers.</p>
            <p>No sooner had we got ashore, but we had
the pleasure to see dispatch'd away, before
us, one of the Messengers, which they make
use of in those Parts to carry such Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
as they would have speedily made
known. For the doing of
which,<note place="margin">A Pigeon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch'd to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi> gives notice of the arrival of the two Ships.</note> their most usual way
is this. A Merchant of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi>
who desires to have
the most early Information of
what Merchandizes are come
from <hi>France,</hi> or any other parts,
takes particular care by an Express to send
away a Pigeon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that has young ones, much
about the time, that the Ships are expected
at <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> where he has his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent;
who, as soon as any Vessel comes
to an Anchor, goes and informs himself
of what Goods the Vessel has brought
most proper for his turn; of which, when
he has given a full Account in his Letter,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100819:15"/>
he fastens the Paper about the Neck of the
winged Courrier, and carrying her to the top
of a little Mountain, gives her her liberty,
never fearing her going astray. The Pigeon
which we saw let go, after she had soar'd
a good heighth to discover, doubtless, the
place, from whence she had been taken some
few days before, and push'd forward by
that instinct, which is common to all
Birds that have young ones, took her flight
towards <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and arriv'd there in less then
three hours, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that City be very near thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Leagues from the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence she
was sent. However they do not make use of
any sort of Pigeons to carry their Dispatches,
in regard that all Pigeons are not alike
proper for that Service. For there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sort of these Birds, which are easily
train'd up to this Exercise, and which as
occasion serves, are of extraordinary use,
especially for the swift management of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and where speed of Intelligence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
as in the Factories of the <hi>Levant,</hi> far
remote one from the other.</p>
            <p>This was the only piece of Curiosity
which we could observe during our stay in
this same first Port of the East. We would
willingly also have seen the Shore, upon
which 'tis believ'd that <hi>Ionas</hi> was thrown
by the Whale, that swallow'd him up: But
being inform'd, that it was very dangerous
to go too far on that side, by reason of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100819:16"/>
Excursions of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that there are any Ships arriv'd
in the Road, we satisfi'd our selves with
only seeing at a distance the Piramid that
was erected in remembrance of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
            <p>At length, the first <hi>Thursday</hi> in <hi>Lent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fixt upon for the day of our Departure,
there was a Caravan made up of about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Persons. They call a Caravan in <hi>Turky</hi>
any number of Travellers design'd to one
certain Place, and bound to keep Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
together for fear of being Plunder'd or
Murder'd by a sort of profess'd Robbers,
with which the High Roads are numerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
infested. Our Company therefore being
all ready, we set forward from <hi>Alexandretta</hi>
under the Guidance of a <hi>Turk,</hi> a very honest
Fellow, who perform'd the Office of <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van
Bachi,</hi> or Conductor of the Caravan, and
of whose Fidelity the <hi>French</hi> had a long time
had experience.</p>
            <p>Our first days Journey was but short,
for we lay at a Village call'd <hi>Beilan,</hi> not
above four or five Leagues from <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Morning we travell'd on by
Break of day, and cross'd the Plain of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
which is one of the most pleasant,
and most fertile that are to be seen in the
World. It is about five or six Leagues in
extent, intercut with an infinite number of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100819:16"/>
Rivolets, abounding in Pasturage, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Cattel which are there brought
to be fatted all the year long. The same
day we pass'd the <hi>Orontes,</hi> a small Stream,
the Water of which is very muddy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to a ruddy colour, and considerable
for nothing else but the Name.</p>
            <p>That Night we lodg'd in one of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
of the <hi>Curdes,</hi> from whom that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
now grown so numerous, is said to
have been originally deriv'd. Here our
People were forc'd to keep a good Guard
all Night long, for fear of being surpriz'd
by the Country People, that only subsist by
Thieving and Robbery.</p>
            <p>Our next days Journey was tiresom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
by reason of the rugged and stony
ways, no less tedious to the Horses then the
Men. We beheld as we past along, the
stately Ruins of those Ancient Monasteries,
where formerly so many devout Persons
led an Angelick Life. They also shew'd us
at a distance, the famous Pillar where <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
the <hi>Stilite,</hi> for forty years together
perform'd that rigorous Penance, which
astonish'd all the Religious Persons round
about. At length, after we had travell'd
quite through this small Country with
those extraordinary Sentiments of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the sight of all those Sacred Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
inspire into the most insensible,
we arriv'd betimes at <hi>Anjar,</hi> which is a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100819:17"/>
large Burrough, where our <hi>Caravan Bachi</hi>
receiv'd us into a House of his own, and
where he treated us with a little Rice boil'd
in Oyl, and some Fruits of the Country;
the time of <hi>Lent</hi> not permitting him to be so
liberal to the <hi>French,</hi> as he was wont to be
at other times.</p>
            <p>At last upon <hi>Sunday</hi> the
11th of <hi>March,</hi>
               <note place="margin">We arrive at <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
               </note> we arriv'd at
<hi>Aleppo,</hi> where we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by the Jesuits with
those Demonstrations of Friendship, as
made us forget all our past Hardships. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some few days repose, the Superior of
the Missions of <hi>Syria,</hi> giving me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the great want of Labourers almost
in all the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts, through the loss of
several excellent Missionaries, understood
so well how to engage me in all his Affairs;
that, notwithstanding my extraordinary
Inclinations to have hasten'd into <hi>Persia,</hi> in
order to my Grand Journey intended for
<hi>China,</hi> which I had had in my thoughts
for so many years, I could not refuse to go
for some Months into <hi>Curdistan,</hi> from
whence Father <hi>Roche</hi> had ply'd him with
importunate Letters, to let him know how
impossible it was for him to abide there any
longer without a Companion to ease him of
the great Burthen, that lay upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
every day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100819:17"/>
This sacrificing of my self cost me in
truth somewhat dear, as also for that I was
constrain'd to separate from my Brother,
who was design'd for the same reason to
another Mission, tho we had flatter'd our
selves that we should one day both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taste the sweet Comforts of manuring
those Fields, where both of us were in
hopes to reap the same Harvest. But when
a Man has once devoted himself to God,
to what purpose is it afterwards to be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of himself? So that I prepar'd to be
gone with a numerous Caravan, that was
mustering together, and within a short
time was ready to depart for <hi>Betlis,</hi> the
Capital City of <hi>Curdistan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the rest that made up this Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,
there was an <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchant, who
profess'd himself a <hi>Roman-</hi> Catholick, and
who under that Notion seem'd to be much
a Friend of the Jesuits. Now, in regard
that then I understood not any of the
<hi>Eastern</hi> Languages, I thought I could not
do better then to put my self into the
Hands of this Person, out of a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that his Religion, and his Love
for our Society would oblige him to take
care of me in this, the first of all my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</p>
            <p>It was in the time of a <hi>Lent,</hi> which the
<hi>Armenians</hi> observe with so much rigour,
that they make it a great scruple of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100819:18"/>
to feed upon Lettice, Fish and Oyl,
or to drink Wine. Therefore I thought
my self engag'd to comply with the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those people, who believe the whole
Essence of Religion to consist in these Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Observations, and to deprive my self,
as they did, of all those Refreshments of
Nature, which the Catholick Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
her Children. For this purpose, after
I had only made my Provision of Biscuit,
Dates, and some other dry'd Fruits, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a little Coffee, for a Journey of
above two hundred and fifty Leagues, I left
<hi>Aleppo,</hi> disguiz'd like an <hi>Armenian</hi> for my
greater security, and went with my Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> to the General
Rendevouz of the Caravan.</p>
            <p>It was a <hi>Thursday</hi> in the
Evening which the <hi>Turks</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> never begin to travel on a <hi>Friday.</hi>
               </note>
made choice of on purpose
to set forward, out of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Fancy very usual
among the <hi>Eastern</hi> People; who believe
that if they begin a Journey upon a <hi>Friday</hi>
Morning, it will infallibly draw upon 'em a
great number of Misfortunes during the
whole course of their Travels; though in
my Opinion the misfortune of passing a
whole Night so incommodiously as we were
constrain'd to spend the first Night, is one
of the greatest Hardships that a man can
well endure. There was no great fear of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100819:18"/>
not waking betimes in the Morning, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
'twas impossible for any body to sleep,
by reason of the horrible noise and hurry,
which cannot be at first avoided till every
body is well setled in his Geares.</p>
            <p>But at length the Caravan, composs'd of
about 200 persons, being ready by break of
day, we all together quitted the Cavern
where we lay, and after we had cross'd in
good order several Desart Plains of <hi>Syria,</hi>
where we had a view of the still famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Edessa,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Orpha;</hi>
we arriv'd at the Banks of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which
we cross'd over in a large Flatbottom'd-Boat,
over against a little City, by our
Modern Geographers usually call'd by the
Name of <hi>Birè,</hi> where this River, so much
celebrated in Sacred History, may be about
three hundred Paces broad.</p>
            <p>There, although too late, I found it to
be true, what a person perfectly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the <hi>East</hi> had told me; That upon
the Competitorship of several Guides that
usually present themselves, 'tis better to
make choice of a <hi>Turk,</hi> then a <hi>Christian</hi> of
the Country; the latter neither having
Authority to defend you, nor courage to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himself against the cruel Impositions
that are demanded of ye, nor that Fidelity
which is always observable in the other; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
when he has sworn upon his head
to conduct you safely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100819:19"/>
In a word; The <hi>Armenian,</hi> to whose
care I was recommended, before my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> began to make me sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
at our passing the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that he
was not the Person he was taken to be;
but that he minded much more his own
Interest then my Preservation or Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>For in regard the Ferrying
Places over Rivers are the<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding me to be an <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean,</hi> lay a great Imposition upon me.</note>
most critical Places in all
<hi>Turky,</hi> more especially for
Travellers, who are thought
to be laden with Riches, my
Conductor understood perfectly well to
make his best Advantage of this Humour
of the <hi>Turks;</hi> and not only drew himself
out of a great deal of Trouble at my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
as being to have paid a great sum
of Money for the Goods which he carri'd;
but informing against me, that I was a
Frank, ransom'd himself with his share of
my Money, which he divided with the
<hi>Turks,</hi> as the Reward of his Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and which I was forc'd to pay, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
my own Person, and Goods which
they had already seiz'd, out of their Clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>But this was not the only misfortune
which I underwent, during this Journey.
The Plains of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> into which we
enter'd, after we had pass'd <hi>Euphrates,</hi> no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100819:19"/>
less made tryal of my Health and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then they furnish'd me with occasions
sufficient to exercise my Patience. The
rigorous Lent which I was bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
enfeebl'd me every day more and
more; nor had I any Conversation with
any living Soul, for that no Body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
me, neither did I understand any
Body; and the Night which is usually a time
of rest, was to me a time of cruel Torment.
In a word, the Life of a Caravan, which
I had never made tryal of before, annoy'd
me so extreamly, that if God had not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour'd
me after a paticular manner, I had
infallibly sunk under the Burth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
first days that I found my self under
a necessity of accustoming my self to it.
Nor will it be amiss to give a short Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this same way of Caravan-Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>In the Morning you must rise before
break of Day, especially in the season that
the Heats are not very extream, then you
must Travel till Noon, or rather till you
come to some place where you may meet
with Water to refresh both Men and Horses:
there you must stay for about two hours,
till both are somewhat refresh'd, and then
you must be content to nibble upon a little
dry'd Fruit, for want of Time and Wood
to get any thing else ready, unless a little
Coffee, and that too with a great deal of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100819:20"/>
difficulty. After a stay of two hours, you
must get a Horse-back again, and so
Travel on till Night, that you meet with
a Place proper to Encamp in; which being
found, presently a kind of Entrenchment
is drawn round about it, and the Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
surrounded with Ropes, to which
the Horses are ti'd that belong to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan.
This done, the Baggage, and all
the Merchandize is carri'd into the middle
of the Place, close to which every Body
takes care to Range himself as near as may
be one to another, the better to take care
every body of what is their own, till Sleep
seizes 'em, which it does generally very
soundly, without the help of any Rocking.
This done, and every body having got his
Supper ready, which is seldom any more then
a Plate of Rice, a Carpet is spread, both
Table-cloth and Bed, upon which after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
they compose themselves to their Rest
till the next Morning, and then for the same
Course of Life again.</p>
            <p>But in regard those Plains,<note place="margin">The care of the Caravan to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Night.</note>
as desert as they be, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
pester'd with the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi>
that follow no other
Trade then that of Robbing

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100819:20"/>
For this reason, there is great care
taken to have good Centinels at different
Posts, who are bound to ride about all
Night long, hooping and hollowing as loud
as they can tear their Throats, thereby to
let the Enemy know that they are ready
to receive 'em; and to give notice to the
Caravan that they are diligent upon their
Duty.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding all the care that is
taken, I my self was a Witness, that there
past very few Nights wherein we were not
hotly alarum'd, and that we were not forc'd
to rise in disorder to repel these trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Guests, of whose Approach the least
noise you hear makes every Body suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
and of whom, one or other will
be sure to slip in among the croud, and
do his business under the Protection of the
Night.</p>
            <p>These Inconveniences to which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are every Night expos'd, together with
the excessive Rains, which we are forc'd
to endure many times in open Plains, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any manner of Covert or Shelter, from
the end of one days Journey to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of another, brought me down so
low, that I look upon it as a kind of a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
that I was able so long to undergo such
excessive Hardships; wherein however I
could not chuse but take some pleasure, in
hopes among so many hazards, and at the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100819:21"/>
expence of my Life, to advance the great
Work, which had caus'd me to quit <hi>Europe,</hi>
and whatever else I had most dear in the
World.</p>
            <p>God however was in mercy pleas'd to
afford me Comfort in a most singular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
after all the Extremities, to which I had
been reduc'd, and to encourage me to new
Sufferings, wherein I was about to engage
my self, by means of a pleasing and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Accident, that befel me at <hi>Diarbeker,</hi>
the Capital City of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> where we
arriv'd fifteen days after our departure from
<hi>Aleppo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This City is one of the most Populous,
and most Remarkable for Trade in all
<hi>Turky,</hi> seated in a most lovely Plain upon
the Banks of <hi>Tygre,</hi> which some confound
with <hi>Chobar,</hi> where the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
convers'd so familiarly with God. The
enclosure of the Walls, built by one of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Emperors, is still standing, and in
good Repair. The most considerable Trade,
which is there driven, consists in Red Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
Cloth, Cotten, and Goats Leather of
the same Colour, for which they have an
incredible utterance into <hi>Poland, Hungary,</hi>
and <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and other Countries, where
long Habits and Buskins are in fashion.
The Women, who are look'd upon over all
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire as meer Slaves, are
nothing at all troubl'd at it there. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

usually go a walking with the Christian
Women, with whom they keep an honest
and civil Correspondence. And, in a word,
all the People are sincere, and there is much
more Courtesy and Affability among 'em,
than among the common <hi>Turks</hi> in other
Provinces.</p>
            <p>And this it was easy for me to observe
from the very first moment that I enter'd
into the City. For I had no sooner made
my Appearance before the Receiver of the
Customs; but he, understanding that I was
a Stranger, and a <hi>French</hi> man, caus'd
me to be forthwith conducted to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> after I had
let him understand my Intention to lodge
there.</p>
            <p>Those Fathers, who have made an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Use of Physick, to settle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a Post so advantageous to the
Christian Religion, as appears by the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
Progresses they have made for near
these fifteen years together, receiv'd me
with so much Cordial Affection, and such an
overplus of Joy, that their Reception, so
full of Tenderness and Goodness, afforded
me much more Consolation, than the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of my past Miseries had dejected
me.</p>
            <p>But that, which contributed more then
all the rest, to make me look upon all my
Sufferings as nothing, was my meeting in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100819:22"/>
those Parts with Father <hi>Barnaby,</hi> a Jesuit,
then which nothing could be more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to me, as being the Person, with
whom I had long and passionately desir'd
to conser; to the end I might take such
certain Measures from his Lips, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of my undertaking, which
he approv'd no less then my self, and had
been one of those, who had giv'n me the
first Draught of. Now, in regard the
Fathers, in whose House we lodg'd, would
not discover us to one another, to the end
we might take the more delight in our
enterview, we met several times, and
talk'd together at the same time without
knowing each other, tho' we had formerly
liv'd both together in the same College:
whether our Countenances were really al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
after a long Separation; or whether
it were, that the Fashion of our Habits,
which we were oblig'd to change, and in
which we had never seen each other, made
us appear quite different from what we
were formerly. Nevertheless, by the force
of long Consideration, and attentive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
we began to recal each other
so well to mind, that we became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d
of our former Acquaintance. And
then it was, that we both abandon'd our
selves to those pleasing Transports of Joy,
that upon the like Occasions seize the
Souls of two Persons, whom the Love
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100819:22"/>
of Jesus Christ has strictly united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>After we had somewhat recover'd our
selves from the Astonishment of such a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
surprizal, and had given each other a
mutual Account of our past Adventures, I
put him insensibly upon the design, which
he had formerly propos'd of opening a new
way into <hi>China</hi> through <hi>Grand-Tartary,</hi> and
other Countries of <hi>Asia,</hi> which are so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
known in <hi>Europe.</hi> Now in regard the
had been extreamly zealous to know after
what manner his design had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in <hi>France,</hi> and whether it had been
approv'd by our Superiours, he could not
refrain from Tears, when I put into his
hands the Orders, which I had been entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to deliver him, and told him my mind
withal in these words; <q>At length, dear
Father, said I, Heaven has heard your
Prayers. You are the Person, whom Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
has ordain'd for that great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
of which you laid the design, and
here is the Person made choice of to be
the faithful Companion of your Labours:
More then happy, if you and I can but
discover this important Passage, or else
lay down our Lives in obedience to the
Call of God, which inspires us both with
the same desires for the Advancement of
his Glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100819:23"/>
No sooner did he understand these joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tidings, but he imparted to me all the
prospects of his Consideration upon such an
important design, and made me so deeply sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the great Advantages which might
be expected from it for the Establishment
of Religion, that he oblig'd me forthwith
to take a Resolution never to abandon the
Execution of this Enterprize whatever Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
should intervene to cross it, as being
then persuaded, as I am still, that Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Constancy would assure us of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Success.</p>
            <p>From that happy moment, we desir'd
nothing more then to see our selves in a
Condition to begin so pious a Work. But
in regard the Affairs of the Missions of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi>
call'd him to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of Heaven commanded me to
<hi>Betlis,</hi> we could do nothing further then
agree together, during our short stay at
<hi>Diarbeker,</hi> upon the ways and means which
it behov'd us to make use of the Execution
of our Design so soon as might be.</p>
            <p>All things thus agreed, he rejoyn'd his
Caravan, and I mine, both well inclin'd
on our parts, to leave nothing omitted that
might contribute to the accomplishment of
our Vows.</p>
            <p>Thus while he travell'd towards <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
I took the Road for <hi>Armenia;</hi> after I
had pass'd the <hi>Tiger</hi> the first time, over a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100819:23"/>
fair Stone-Bridge, about a quarter of a
League fron the City of <hi>Diarbeker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I was not so fortunate
the second time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A Machine made use of for the crossing of the River</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> that I was
to cross it in a Wind-boat,
which the People on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side of the River got
ready in a moment, so soon
as they saw the Caravan appear. This
Machine, which the People of the Country
make use of, not only to Ferry over the
<hi>Tiger,</hi> but also to-go by Water from place
to place between <hi>Diarbeker</hi> to <hi>Bassora,</hi> where
this River falls into the Sea, is no other
then a fastning together of several Goatskins
blown up, and join'd together on
the four Sides, with as many long Perches
ty'd very close together, and afterwards
cover'd over with several Branches of Trees,
that are carefully laid athwart.</p>
            <p>When our Boat was ready, it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
a good way above that place where
we staid for it on the opposite Shoar; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which the Waterman lanching and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into it, the Stream, which is very Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
whirld it down the River, and the
strength of the Pilots Oars brought it just
to our Feet. The Baggage was soon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
over, and then the Travellers got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Boat with every one his Horse's Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in his hand; the Horse being unsaddl'd
for the more easy convenience of Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100819:24"/>
I follow'd the Crowd, because I
would not be one of the last, but my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so hasty cost me dear. For not being
inform'd of the Precautions, which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd
me to observe in standing upon those
sort of Boats, I unfortunately set my Foot
upon one of the Borrachio's or Leathern
Goat-skin Baggs which was not cover'd,
not knowing that by pressing it in that
manner, I should cause it to sink. Upon
which one of the Boat-men perceiving the
false step I had made, without any more
to do, took me by force and flung me
back upon the Bank of the River, where
he fulfill'd his Revenge of my Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
which certainly was no Crime;
but God reserv'd another Tryal for me at
this Passage, which was much more harsh
and severe then that which I had suffer'd
already.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Tiger,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Author like to be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> which the
excessive Rains that year had
extreamly swell'd, not being
to be contain'd within its
proper Channel, makes a second by the
Inundation; which tho not so deep as the
true Channel, is very broad however, and
no less rapid then the real one. Now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body being got a Horse-back to foard
it in the place that was shew'd us, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the File of those that were got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But before I was got to the middle,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100819:24"/>
my Horse that was weak and weary in stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to resist the impetuosity of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that began to be too strong for him,
threw me into the Water, and the Stream
which I was not able to resist, carry'd
me a great way along with it: which had
it not done, I had immediately been trod
to pieces in under the Horses feet that
follow'd behind. Immediately the People
of the Caravan observing what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
me, threw themselves pell-mell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the River, <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> and
coming in time to my aid, drew me out
of the Water; which however was not the
last, nor the greatest Danger which I escap'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
upon this occasion, as you will find by the
sequel.</p>
            <p>When all the Caravan were got over to
the other side of the River, we descry'd a
Camp of <hi>Curds,</hi> to the number of Five or six
thousand Men. Now, in regard these wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
People are as formidable as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabs,</hi>
and for that they are no way inferior
to 'em in the Art of Robbing; we made it
our business to get away as soon as we
could out of their sight, to prevent their
falling upon us with a Party too numerous
for us to resist. Thereupon, as wet as I
was, and as much reason as I had to shift
me, my Conductor con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rain'd me to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Caravan, who to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from those Robbers that would
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100819:25"/>
have shew'd 'em no Mercy, were forc'd to
ride six whole hours together, to gain a
little Village where they were certain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
secure.</p>
            <p>There was no way, but to yield to neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and venture all at such a pinch as
this, considering that whatsoever Course
I took, I was equally expos'd to most ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Events. And indeed 'twas impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that any man should suffer more all
the while that we were travelling to our
Stage; the violent Shiverings, the cruel
Soundings wherewith I was seiz'd all the
way, in the coldest Season of the year,
made such violent onsets upon me, that
I never thought my self able to have held
out against so many Hardships and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses
at one time. But in the Evening,
being arriv'd at the place where we were
to stop for that Night only, I was carry'd
by good Fortune to the House of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
who became so mov'd with my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Condition, that he omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of whatever he could think of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to restore me to a little strength.
And God gave such a Blessing to his
Charity, that after I had rested for some
hours upon a Bed, I found my self the
next Morning strong anough to continue my
Journey.</p>
            <p>Hardly had we travell'd two Leagues,
but we found our selves engag'd in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100819:25"/>
Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> where the Snow
lay as high as a Pikes length. Now, in
regard those Mountains which we crost,
are not altogether contiguous, they leave
at the bottom, a narrow passage, through
which we rode for some time by the side
of a River that runs in the Vally, which
separates the two Hills. As I rode along,
I observ'd one thing very singular, tho it
happens every year, as the People of the
Country assur'd me. The Snow, which
the heat of the Sun began at that time to
melt, and whose heat the Reverberation
of his Beams very much augmented, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once to be dissolv'd, falls down with
such a headlong impetuosity, that besides,
that the Rapidness of the Flood ranverses
all the Houses which it meets with, it
forms a kind of a Mound in the midst of
the River into which it discharges it self,
which stops the Course of the Water for some
time; so that when the Water comes to
undermine that congeal'd Mass, it opens
a Passage through it, and makes an Arch
which serves instead of a solid Bridge to bear
Travellers, and Beasts of Burthen, and so
remains so long as the Cold and Frost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>
            <p>We were above eight days before we
could get clear of this dreadful mountainous
Labyrinth; where the ways were somtimes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100819:26"/>
so fill'd up with Snow, that our Horses fell
down under us every step they took, so
that we had employment enough to lift 'em
up, and load 'em again; insomuch, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But that which render'd our March mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Mountains, over which we
were forc'd to scramble, there being neither
Path nor Footstep to be seen, and some
that we were constrain'd to clamber, were
above a quarter of a League high. After

my self the soonest I could, to the end I
might be in a condition to taste the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of a Missionary, when he has the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to recover a lost Sheep into the Flock
of the Church.</p>
            <p>While I was labouring with all diligence
to procure this felicity to my self, we receiv'd
Orders from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to quit this Mission,
and to go and settle another at <hi>Erzerum,</hi>
where there were very probable hopes of
making greater progress then at <hi>Betlis,</hi> and
with less danger of being turn'd out of our
Employments, then in the Post where we
were; whence we were constrain'd many
times to part from one another to satisfie
the Bacha of <hi>Wan,</hi> who was desirous to
have some one of the Jesuits near him in the
place of his Residence, which was twenty
Leagues from <hi>Betlis,</hi> to attend him as his
Physician.</p>
            <p>For this Reason it was, that Father <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naby</hi>
went to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> there to lay before the
Superior General of the Missions, the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of such frequent Separations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which besides that they disturb'd the
whole Order of our Ministerial Functions,
were disadvantagious to the Christians of
the Country, among whom there was
more to be gain'd then among the <hi>Turks,</hi>
who lie under a moral impossibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
converted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100819:27"/>
But this order, how reasonable soever it
appear'd, did not a little perplex us, by
reason of the difficulty and danger in the
execution of it. For we were extreamly
belov'd over all the City; the <hi>Emir,</hi> who
was Chief Commander, had a great value
for us, and look'd upon us as people that
were very serviceable to him; so that we
could not hope that he would ever consent
to our departure. Therefore we thought it
not our best way to ask leave to be gone,
but rather privately to withdraw, without
imparting our Design to any living Soul.
But notwithstanding all the secret Measures
we took to conceal our Departure, the
Christians had notice of it; and presently
applying themselves to the <hi>Emir,</hi> to the
end they might the better engage him to
detain us, told him all they could to our
advantage, and more indeed then they
knew.</p>
            <p>For after they had laid before him the
Charity of the Missionaries, in respect of
their Sick People; their Ability in all sorts
of Sciences, their holy and exemplary Life,
they added, speaking of me, that there was
lately arriv'd out of <hi>Europe</hi> a most skilful
Clock-maker, who might be greatly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
not only to him, but to the whole
City. There needed no more to oblige
the <hi>Emir</hi> to call us before him. To which
purpose he sent one of his Officers for us;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100819:27"/>
from whom we understood the ill Offices
which the Christians had done us, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
us to stay among 'em; and while we
were expected at the <hi>Divan,</hi> our <hi>Armenians</hi>
a little over-zealous, kept the <hi>Emir</hi> in a long
Discourse concerning us; telling, among
other things, to convince him of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Vertue, That we were people
so reserv'd and circumspect in all our Words
and Actions, that ever since they knew us,
though they had frequently convers'd with
us, they never heard the smallest Oath
escape our Lips. So that how greatly soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Emir</hi> was prepossess'd in our favour,
he seem'd to be surpris'd at what they told
him; and in regard he had never convers'd
with any but <hi>Turks,</hi> or very wicked <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who have their <hi>Vovallah</hi>
continually in their Mouths,<note place="margin">The common Oath of the Country.</note>
he was so perswaded, that
that ill Habit was as natural
to us, as to himself, or them, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
he laid a Wager with one of those
that talk'd to him, of a Noble Turbant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a hunder'd Crowns, that he would
make us swear in his presence. No sooner
was the Wager laid, but we came into the
Hall of Audience, and the <hi>Emir</hi> perceiving
us, caus'd us to approach near his person,
and having order'd us to sit down in his
Divan, he put several cunning captious
Questions to us, to draw us imperceptibly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100819:28"/>
into the Snare, but all in vain; he could
never bring us to speak a language that had
to that time been always unknown to us.</p>
            <p>But he was more satisfi'd with me upon
the Subject of Clock-making, though I
knew no more of that Art, then every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
knows that will look to their Watches
themselves, or have learnt to make some
little amendments, when they are not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
out of order. I shew'd him one that
I had brought with me out of <hi>France,</hi> and
took it apieces Wheel after Wheel, that he
might take time to consider the different
Springs and Motions; and finding he had
a mind to it, I presently made him an offer
of it, being resolv'd to make use of it as
the means which Providence had put
into our hands to facilitate our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>In short,<note place="margin">The Emir gives us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</note> After I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
him that he would be
pleas'd accept it, which he
did without much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I confidently discover'd to him our
design of going to <hi>Erzerum,</hi> whether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
business call'd me in great haste. I
added, that in regard I did not sufficiently
understand the Language to travel securely,
that he would extreamly oblige me to let
my Companion go along with me; and
withall, that he would vouchsase me a small
Convoy. I minded not his scruples and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100819:28"/>
reluctancy at first, for I knew by his smiling
look, and condescending countenance, that
if I press'd him with a little more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I should easily obtain what I expected
from him. In short, whether it were that
my Present had dazl'd him, or that God
had mov'd his heart to favour us, he order'd
the Pass which I demanded to be drawn
up immediately; and sent me before my
departure, a Horse ready saddl'd and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dl'd,
worth double the Watch which I left
with him.</p>
            <p>After such an unexpected piece of good
success, we prepar'd to be gone with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Caravan, which had staid about
ten or twelve days at <hi>Betlis,</hi> till the <hi>Emirs</hi>
Custom-house Officers had discharg'd it, to
carry several sorts of Merchandize to <hi>Erzerum,</hi>
design'd for <hi>Persia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Journey lasted not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
eight or ten days,<note place="margin">Five Curds attach a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Caravan.</note> nor
did any thing happen consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
all the way, but one
small Accident at the Passage over <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>
Five <hi>Curdes</hi> that lay in ambush set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Rear-guard with that good fortune,
that they took away some Horses, and drove
'em before 'em through so many by-ways
and turnings, that it was impossible to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake
'em, and recover their Booty;
which oblig'd us to be a little more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and made the people, of which the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100819:29"/>
Caravan consisted, more wary how they
scatter'd one from another, then they were
before; so that every body rode in his rank
in good order; only the <hi>Turks</hi> retir'd three
or four times a day from the gross of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to say their Prayers by the Bank of some
Rivolet, if they met with any in the
Roads.</p>
            <p>Which gives me an occasion to say, That
the exactness which those Infidels observe
in their Prayers, has made me many times
bewail the Christians neglect of so pious and
holy a Duty. 'Tis a thing hardly to be ever
heard of, that a <hi>Turk</hi> who is never so little
devoted to his Sect, lets a day pass, without
performing this Religious Exercise at least
three or four times; and the omission of
it is look'd upon as a most heinous Crime
among 'em. Moreover I can testifie, That
two <hi>Turks</hi> happening to quarrel one with
another in the same Journey, after they had
revil'd one another with all the foul Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
imaginable, one of 'em put the other
to silence, by reproaching him that he had
not pray'd to God all that day. How much
were it to be wish'd that the same Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were able to touch the hearts of so
many Christians as we find in <hi>Europe,</hi> who
are so far from believing such a holy Practice
to be a Duty; that they think it a shame to
pay to God, that Worship is so justly due to
him. Now, in regard that Father <hi>Barnaby</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:100819:29"/>
had written to us, that he would be at <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerum,</hi>
I met him there at the end of my
Journey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Erzerum,</hi> or <hi>Arzeron,</hi> is a City of <hi>Turkey,</hi>
upon the Frontiers of <hi>Persia,</hi> seated in a
pleasant Plain, about seven or eight Leagues
in circuit, and border'd on every side with
little Hills that rise insensibly one above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
out of which three Rivers rise,
that I have seen, of the four that Holy
Scripture assures us to have watred the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restial
Paradise.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Nile,</hi> which rises out of the Mountains
of the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> were one of those
Rivers, as some Interpreters have conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur'd,
it is a very difficult thing to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
where that delicious Garden should
be, where God plac'd the First Parents of
Mankind. But certain it is, that a more
advantagious situation cannot be pick'd
out by Mortal Eyes, then that of this City
which we have made choice of for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of our new Mission. 'Tis near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
as big as <hi>Marseilles,</hi> encompass'd with
a double Enclosure of Walls, after the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
manner, with a little high seated Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel
that commands it. The Subburbs are
very large and well peopl'd: The Air is
wholsome; the Water excellent, and in
great plenty. In a Word, every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
to make it one of the best Cities of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100819:30"/>
But that which is most of all to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
and which above all things put us
upon resolving to settle there, is the vast
concourse of all Nations that trade in <hi>Asia,</hi>
more especially of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who have
a particular kindness for this City, which
was formerly the Seat of their Kings; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that to this day there are to be seen
the Ruins of the Palace where they kept their
Court, with some beautiful Remains of the
Patriarchal Church which they had built
in honour of <hi>St. Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I understood by Father <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> inclin'd to quit their Errors.</note>
who was got thithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
some days before us, the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
dispositions, which he had
found in the City, as well of
the <hi>Turks</hi> as <hi>Christians,</hi> to befriend our set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
among 'em, while both strove to
honour him with the Marks of their Esteem
and Affection. And it may seem a wonder
perhaps, that the Person, whom God has
made use of to lay the Foundations of this
important Mission, was once an unfortunate
Renegat, who seems to have been guided
to <hi>Erzerum,</hi> only to prepare the Hearts and
Minds of the People, by prepossessing 'em
as he did in our favour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100819:30"/>
This Person,<note place="margin">A Renegate srrviceable in the settlement of the Mission.</note> who had been
taken very young upon the
Sea, afterwards turn'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumetan,</hi>
had not so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
the <hi>Christian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but that he had preserv'd sufficient
Idea's of it, to make him understand the
falseness of that which either Interest or
Force had constrain'd him to profess. So
that when he understood who we were, he
made no scruple to discover the Motives
that had drawn us into <hi>Armenia.</hi> He gave
us several Visits, and made it appear by
the serious Discourses which he had with
us, concerning the Affairs of Religion, that
he was not so thoroughly convinc'd of that
which he prosess'd, and that a little thing
would make him embrace again the true
Religion which he had forsaken. But in
regard his time was not come, it seems as
if Providence only made use of him to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
our Functions, among a People by
whom he was as much esteem'd for his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
merit, as he was respected for his
Quality and Degree. And in regard his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
gave him free and easie access in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all Houses; he rais'd our Reputation so
high by those things which he publish'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where to our advantage, that we were
look'd upon by all the Inhabitants as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
persons. The <hi>Armenians</hi> more
especially were so sensible of our Zeal, to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100819:31"/>
prefer them before all other Nations of the
<hi>East;</hi> that after they had met together to
congratulate the happiness which we had
procur'd 'em, and to testifie their sincere
acknowledgment of so great a favour, they
caus'd our Names to be enregister'd, as also
the Year and Day of our arrival in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to preserve the memory of of it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,
in the publick Registers of the
Church.</p>
            <p>Such happy beginnings were afterwards
attended with so many Blessings, that we
were easily induc'd to acknowledge tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
God was pleas'd with the Post which we
had chos'n; for there followed a great
number of eminent Conversions; whole
Families abjur'd their Schisms and their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and a general Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
appear'd in all those who were reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
into the State of Grace. In a word
their Piety and Zeal distinguish'd 'em so for
above others, that were not so docible, that
the difference of their Lives and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that was to be observ'd in the ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
dawnings of their Conversion among 'em
seem'd a sensible proof to several of the tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
of our Religion. So that I had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
during a stay of Six Months that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
made at <hi>Erzerum,</hi> to see that growing

that I thought we had no reason to envy
the Primitive Ages of Christianity. But i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100819:31"/>
was not so much the number of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that compos'd it, which render'd it
considerable, as the Zeal with which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to be enliven'd. Their frequent
coming to the Sacrament, their assiduity in
Prayer, the Modesty, the strict union that
reign'd among 'em, a certain Air of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that diffus'd it self thoough all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
were the rising grounds that gave us
an easy and delightful Prospect of our good
success. So that I should have esteem'd
my self happy to have enjoy'd all my life
time, these savory Fruits of the Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Heaven, that had call'd me long
before, together with Father <hi>Barnaby</hi> to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
the Lands of <hi>Tartary</hi> o'regrown with
Weeds and Thistles, had not they oblig'd
us to renounce that Consolation, by enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
us to enlarge our Conquests, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the limits of the Kingdom of Jesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>Upon this consideration it
was that my Companion,<note place="margin">Father <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naby</hi> goes to <hi>Irivan.</hi>
               </note> after
we had left our Mission in so
good a plight, parted from me
for some time, with a design to
go to <hi>Irivan;</hi> where his presence was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
not only to confirm the settlement
there made some years before, but also to
take certain measures with the <hi>Indians</hi> and
<hi>Yousbecks,</hi> which usually resort thither, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the carrying on of our intended En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100819:32"/>
Besides, it requir'd four whole
Months to regulate all things rightly, and
to give me leasure to perfect my self in the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Tongue, which I had begun to
learn with good success.</p>
            <p>No sooner was I in a condition by my
self, to labour in the salvation of Souls, but
I receiv'd order to follow him. But some
few days before my departure, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Midnight we were surpris'd with an
Earthquake, so furious, that there was
hardly any body among us,
who did not believe himself
utterly lost.<note place="margin">An Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake at <hi>Erze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
               </note> I wak'd of a
suddain, at what time the
Beams and Girders of my Chamber were
all in motion; and I was afraid more then
once, that the Walls that seem'd to stoop
forward, would have buried me under their
Ruins: But there happen'd no ill consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this disorder. The Earthquake ceas'd
in half a quarter of an hour; though it
continu'd with a much more moderate
shaking for eight days together, precisely
at the same hour, that it began the first
time.</p>
            <p>In regard these sorts of Accidents are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
usual in <hi>Armenia,</hi> by reason of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
number of Mountains with which
that Province is cover'd; the People of the
Country have no other way to shelter and
secure themselves from the dreadful conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100819:32"/>
which they fear, but to leave the
Cities, and abide in the Fields under Tents,
till every thing be quiet: Yet sometimes
they are surpris'd, notwithstanding all the
care they can take. For in regard that the
Earth many times cleaves and opens with
the violence of the shogs of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
Matter, sometimes whole Villages
are swallow'd-up in those parts where the
motion is most sensibly perceiv'd; as they
told me it befel a Village about seven or
eight Leagues from the City. One time I
met with a Mathematician, that was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
intoxicated with <hi>Copernicus</hi>'s Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;
who was of opinion, that all these
Violent Motions extreamly favour'd the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of that Philosopher, who perhaps
would not have fail'd himself to have made
use of the same proof to have supported
his Opinion; granting, that these motions
were regularly made from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West;</hi> as it
is pretended, that they most generally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be.</p>
            <p>After I had assur'd my self for some time
that the Earthquake was absolutely over,
and that it was no longer to be feard, I
went to meet Father <hi>Barnaby,</hi> who only
waited for my company, to set forward
as soon as might be, to the end we might
get to the <hi>Caspian-Sea</hi> time enough to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
in the <hi>Muscovite</hi> Vessels, which usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make choice of the beginning of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
to return to <hi>Astrakan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:100819:33"/>
Now in regard the Snow was not yet
quite melted, and for that the Ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
extreamly bad, the Caravan to
which I had join'd my self, spent more
time to get to <hi>Persia,</hi> then they were usually
wont to do. I cannot tell whether the
great desire which I had to leave <hi>Turky,</hi>
made me think our Stage much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
then indeed it was; but I never tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
any Journey that seem'd more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to me then this; though knowing the
Language then much better then before,
naturally I ought to have found it more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
than any of the former. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
notwithstanding my extream Passion
to get clear of the <hi>Grand-Signior</hi>'s Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
I was just upon the point of reinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
my self anew, through the Villainy
of the Guards which we met upon the
Frontiers, where they usually lie to exact
the payment of the Duties going out, and
coming in. For some Christian Merchants,
who were returning out of <hi>Persia,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by some of their Acquaintance
who belong'd to our Caravan, that I was an
<hi>European,</hi> and a person in orders treated me
with so much friendship, and so kindly
caress'd me in the presence of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
who had stop'd both them and us for the
payment of our Toll, that they made 'em
suspect me to be some considerable Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and that there was something more
than usual to be got out of me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:100819:33"/>
These people therefore beyond expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
greedy of Mony, after they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
among themselves how they might
put me to trouble, briskly and in a rude
manner demanded of me wherefore, since
I carry'd no Merchandize along with me,
I was so desirous to go into <hi>Persia,</hi> whither
onely Trade could invite a Stranger. To
which I answer'd, That Affairs more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
then Traffick drew me thither,
concealing however the true Motive of my
Journey. This was enough to convince
'em that I was not a person to be spar'd, and
that it behov'd 'em to extort by main force,
what they could not do fairly and honestly.
Thereupon they endeavour'd to frighten me
by all the ways their invention could sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest;
to that purpose they thought they
should easily bring about their Ends, by
treating me as a Spie, and threatn'd to carry
me before the Basha of <hi>Kars,</hi> which is a
City of <hi>Turky</hi> upon the Frontiers of <hi>Persia,</hi>
who would be sure, as they said, to cut off
my head, if I did not take care to prevent
my Misfortune by some inconsiderable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
which was the only way to deliver me
out of their clutches.</p>
            <p>Now in regard I was well acquainted
with the Conditions of these People, and
besides deliver'd my self readily, I gave 'em
to understand by my Answers, that I was
better instructed in the Customs of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100819:34"/>
Country, than they imagin'd me to be;
so that within a moment after, I was pleas'd
to see 'em grown more calm. For when I
told 'em I was not so much afraid of the
<hi>Bacha</hi> with whom they menac'd me, because
some days before I had seen his head, which
was carry'd to <hi>Constantinople</hi> by a <hi>Kapigi-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi>
they presently chang'd their Battery,
and pass'd from threatnings to intreaties, to
obtain by civility what they despiar'd to get
by rudeness, teazing me without ceasing all
the Night long; but finding me as resolute
as they were importunate, they were forc'd
to let me go the next Morning with the
rest of the Caravan, which thirsted after
<hi>Persia</hi> with as much eagerness as my self,
in hopes to have to do for the future with
a People far more reasonable then those we
had left.</p>
            <p>In short, I observ'd soon after the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the one and the other; for I
no sooner set my foot upon the hithermost
Territories of the <hi>Cha,</hi> but I was accusted by
some Inhabitants of the Country, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a thousand Caresses, congratulated my
good Fortune in having escap'd the claws
of the <hi>Turks;</hi> for whom they have as great
an antipathy, as the <hi>Turks</hi> have a hatred
for them.</p>
            <p>And because they had had a confus'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Victory which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
had obtain'd over the Enemies of our
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100819:34"/>
Religion and theirs; I gave 'em a more
particular Relation of it; with which they
seem'd to be so well pleas'd, that they would
not fail to make Bonfires that Evening, to
testify their joy for the good success of the
<hi>Franks,</hi> whom God made his Instruments to
humble and confound a people that so justly
merited to be utterly exterminated. I was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
a long time of the Cause of this
strange Aversion which these two Nations
have one for another; but I learn'd it some
time afterward from a notable <hi>Armenian;</hi>
to whom I declar'd my wonder to see the
<hi>Persians</hi> so embitter'd against the <hi>Turks;</hi>
whom I thought till then more strictly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Ties of the same Religion.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore give an
account as near as I can, of
what I discover'd in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Animosity of the
one against the other,<note place="margin">The Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy between the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> and as</note>
to the difference of their Sentiments in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

which the <hi>Turks</hi> exercis'd upon the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
some years since, the sacking of their
Cities, the horrid Butcheries, which they
committed, without distinction, of all sorts
of Persons, in all Places through which they
pass'd, made such a deep impression in the
hearts of those miserable vanquish'd People,
that the remembrance of 'em still remain'd
fix'd in their minds. They could never
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100819:35"/>
pardon those who had no less inhumanly,
and barbarously us'd 'em, then if they had
been the declar'd Enemies of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and
the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> whose Doctrine nevertheless
they all along pretended to follow with as
much zeal and exactness, as the most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
among the <hi>Musselmen.</hi> And these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitterments
are much more corroborated
by that Idea which they have of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
whom they believe to be in an Error, in
point of Religion, though they differ one
from another but in two Heads; which
ought to excite our compassion so much the
more, by how much the more ridiculous
they seem to be.</p>
            <p>In the first place the <hi>Turks,</hi> whom they
call <hi>Sunni,</hi> own for real Prophets, three sorts
of <hi>Mahomets, Osman Abdid, Beker,</hi> and <hi>Omar.</hi>
The <hi>Persians</hi> dispute their Holiness, because
they put <hi>Ali</hi> to death, whose Disciples they
affirm themselves to be. Therefore in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
of that Murther it is, that every
time their Priests ascend to the top of the
Tower of the Mosque, to call the people to
Prayer, they always thunder out their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations
against the three unnatural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
that had no more respect and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for so holy a man as <hi>Ali,</hi> upon whom,
next to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> they look as their great
Master and Oracle. They invoke him in all
their Exigencies, and upon all occasions; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that they have these words conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100819:35"/>
in their Mouths, <hi>Martaz Ali;</hi> which
among them is one of the most holy and
devout Ejaculations they can make use
of.</p>
            <p>However some of 'em assur'd me, that
their Devotion for <hi>Ali</hi> began to slacken,
and that they made no scruple to address
themselves to <hi>Omar,</hi> since a little Accident
that fell out some years ago.</p>
            <p>A Person of Quality being one day stuck
fast in the Mire, together with his Horse,
call'd <hi>Ali</hi> to his assistance, and conjur'd him
with loud Supplications to help him out of
the Mud; but <hi>Ali</hi> was deaf to his Cries, never
minding in the least the unfortunate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the poor Gentleman: Who finding
his Prophet so insensible of his Adversity,
which he endeavour'd to make him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by his redoubl'd Lamentations, at
length in his despair address'd himself to
<hi>Omar;</hi> whose Name he had no sooner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
as loud as he could tear his throat,
but his Horse, no doubt, awaken'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
with the extraordinary noise of that
Barbarous Word, baul'd out with so much
violence, renew'd his Efforts, and giving a
spring, bounc'd clear out of the Mire where
his Master and he had stuck a long time. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>Ali</hi>'s unfortunate Votary, reflecting
upon what had pass'd, began to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd
with a hunder'd Scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ples of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and to be disgusted at the false confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100819:36"/>
which till then he had had in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Great Protector of his Nation. In this
Perplexity he repairs to one of the most
Learned <hi>Mollha</hi>'s that he knew, propos'd
his Doubts, and desir'd to be speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd:
Who being an Eminent Doctor,
when he had heard him, answer'd him
coldly, to confirm him the more in the Faith
wherein he saw him totterring, That he had
no reason to wonder at what had happen'd;
that <hi>Ali</hi> being a warlike Prophet, scorn'd
to be found in a place so unworthy of a
Conqueror, as that wherein he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
him: Whereas <hi>Omar</hi> being a poor-spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Fellow, as he well knew him to have
been, minded no other Posts than Sloughs and
Quagmires, where he might be able to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
miserable wretches that flung them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
blindly into his Arms.</p>
            <p>This Answer for the present setl'd the
Gentleman's discomposure of mind;
but afterward his Scruples twingd
him with greater violence then before, so
that he could not forbear abandoning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wholly to his first Motions of revenge
and despight, inveighing against <hi>Ali,</hi> and
every where proclaiming the Effects of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>'s
Potent Protection, who had reliev'd
him in such a desperate case of necessity.
However the common people continue their
Veneration to <hi>Ali,</hi> and abominate the other
three Prophets, of which <hi>Omar,</hi> being the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100819:36"/>
Person whose Memory is most detested, is
look'd upon as a Monster among the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who never use his Name but in their
anger and fury; as our Libertines have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the Devil in their hasty and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leric
Passions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Persians</hi> believe, that there
are several considerable Errors and Abuses
crept-in among the <hi>Turks</hi> in the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> the chiefest of which
concerns their coming prepar'd to Prayer.
Both the one and the other agree in this
Point; That no man ought ever to say his
Prayers without being purifi'd before hand;
but they do not agree upon the manner of
Purification. For the <hi>Turks,</hi> after they have
stript their Arms quite bare, let the Water
glide insensibly from their Fingers ends to
their Elbows; whereas the <hi>Persians</hi> begin at
the Elbows, and end at the extremities of
the Fingers: For which they cite the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which clearly sets
down the Practice of that Ceremony and
how it ought to be perform'd.</p>
            <p>These are the ridiculous Ceremonies
which I learnt as soon as I set foot in <hi>Persia,</hi>
which movd me so much the more, to see
that a Nation otherwise so docible, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
endu'd with Reason, yet so
blind and stupid in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100819:37"/>
But if I had a heart pierc'd through with
grief to find so many souls redeem'd with
the precious Blood of Christ, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
of their unhappiness, but intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
beyond expression, with a thousand fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
Stories and Prejudices; I could not
chuse but feel some consolation the nearer I
approach'd to <hi>Erivan,</hi> in seeing our Saviour's
Cross set up in the places adjoining to that
first City of <hi>Persia;</hi> where notwithstanding
all the Machinations of the Devil, Christ
has some adorers; whose Faith, tho strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sophisticated, however is not utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd.</p>
            <p>Of all the parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> where Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
still shines, with something of lustre, and
where the Profession of it is allow'd with
most Liberty, <hi>Ichmiazin,</hi> without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is the place; a large Borough of
the Upper <hi>Armenia,</hi> four little Leagues from
<hi>Irivan.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> usually call it <hi>Vch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Klisse,</hi> or the <hi>Three Churches;</hi> because that
besides the Great Church, from whence the
place derives the Name it bears, there are
two other very near it.</p>
            <p>The first is that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
within the Enclosure of
a fair Monastery,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ichmiazin</hi> the Patriarchal Seat of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians.</hi>
               </note> where the
Patriarch of the <hi>Armenians</hi>
has <hi rend="sup">c</hi> his usual Residence, in
society with fifty or sixty Monks that are
under his Government. It is consecrated
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100819:37"/>
to the <hi>Incarnate Word,</hi> which according to
common Tradition gave the Draught of it
to St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> Sirnam'd the <hi>Illuminator,</hi>
who was ordain'd the first Patriarch of the
<hi>Armenians</hi> by Pope <hi>Silvester,</hi> by whom he
was likewise acknowledg'd for his Father
and Master; and happy had she been, had
she preserv'd in the primitive Purity that
Religion which that Holy Apostle taught
her.</p>
            <p>The two other Churches distant from
the former about Eight hunder'd Paces
each, are nothing near so magnificent, nor
so well kept in Repair. They are dedicated
to two Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Virgins, <hi>Ripsima</hi> and
<hi>Cayanna,</hi> who fled into <hi>Armenia,</hi> during the
Ninth Persecution, and suffer'd Martyrdom
in the same places where those two Churches
are built.</p>
            <p>The great Church stands in the middle
of a large Court, round about which, in
the form of an Half-Moon, are built three
Piles of Lodgings, wherein are the Cells
of the Monks. The Treasury is very rich,
the Ornaments magnificent, the Place to
be admir'd, as well for the great number
of consecrated Vessels, of which some are
of Massy Gold, as for the vast bigness of
the Crosses, the Branches and Lamps, which
assuredly would be no dishonour to the most
stately Churches of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:100819:38"/>
In this place it is, where it would be of
great importance to settle a Mission, which
is passionately desir'd by the greatest part
of the Bishops of the Country. And two
Missionaries, equally Zealous and Learned,
that would but earnestly apply themselves
to unfold after a clear and methodical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the Doctrine of our Faith, would not
a little contribute to unite that Nation to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in regard that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
rather then Obstinacy retains 'em in
their Errors. This would be a work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Charity of those generous Souls
that seek with so much Care all Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
to signalize their Zeal and arde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From <hi>Ichmiazin</hi> I got to <hi>Irivan,</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

After we had both of us examin'd the

            <p>The Night before our Departure, about
Eight a Clock in the Evening, we were
surpriz'd with an Earthquake, the violence
of which gave us a smart Alarum. But in
regard it ceas'd almost in an instant, we
quickly recover'd our selves, and took it
for a lucky Augury of the good Success we
were to expect; perswaded, that Heaven
thereby was willing to shew us what Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
we must expect to meet with, and how
much it benov'd us to support and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100819:40"/>
our selves against the Efforts of Hell.
The first day's Journey was but small, for
we travell'd but four Leagues from <hi>Irivan,</hi>
and lay at a Borough, where an <hi>Armenian</hi>
Catholick receiv'd us into his House, and
entertain'd us after the manner of the
Country. But the joy we had conceiv'd,
that we were going to spread the Gospel
among the most Savage Nations in the
World, was not a little disturb'd the first
Night by an Accident altogether unexpected,
and which could not be foreseen. For we had
no sooner compos'd our selves to rest upon
Carpets laid for us, according to the fashion
of the <hi>Eastern Countries,</hi> but Father <hi>Barnaby</hi>
felt himself stung by a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> which had
crept insensibly into his Bosom as we lay
asleep. So soon as I heard him cry out, I
rose, and when I saw by the help of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the marks of that venomous Infect, I
gave my Companion over for lost; but I
soon recover'd my self out of my fears;
for after he had squeez'd the <hi>Scorpion</hi> it self
upon the place affected, which is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Remedy against the Mischief of the
Sting, and rubb'd the Part with a little
Treacle, he went to Sleep again as before,
and we rested so quiet that Night, that we
were in a good Condition to continue our
Journey next Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:100819:41"/>
The first Province we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,

that of <hi>Gurgistan,</hi>

of the Vigilance of the Governors of

disorders that are committed within their

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100819:41"/>
The <hi>Armenians</hi> have a very fair Monastery
built in an Island within this Lake, no less
commodious then delightful: And to this
place it is, that the Patriarch usually Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
such Monks as are stubborn and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
or such as he has any cause to be
jealous of. We rode along by the side of
this little Sea, for so the People of the
Country call it, a whole day's Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
After which, we enter'd into a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth
of Mountains, that part <hi>Persia</hi> from
<hi>Georgia.</hi> However, the crossing 'em did
not seem tedious; for tho' we were enclos'd
on every side, yet we had a continual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of several little Woods and Groves,
with which the Hills were cover'd; and of
a prodigious number of Pheasants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wild Fowle, which we put-up as we
rode along.</p>
            <p>But all these innocent Pleasures, which we
tasted by the by, were soon disturb'd by an
Alarum given us in a Christian Town, where
we made a stop. For some of the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
observing Father <hi>Barnaby</hi> and me so
little concern'd in our looks, where we had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the reason of the World to be afraid of
every thing, gave us notice to get away with
all speed, unless we intended to fall into
the hands of about forty <hi>Banditti,</hi> that had
been upon the Road for some time, and
were not far from us. We therefore took
the advantage of their charitable Advice,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100819:42"/>
and made all the haste we could to a Hill
which they shew'd us, as a place where we
might secure our selves.</p>
            <p>No sooner had we got to the top of that
little Hill, but we were immediately sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with a Troop of <hi>Armenians,</hi> some
with Slings, some with great Clubs; who
perceiving by the Confidence wherewith
we advanc'd toward 'em, that we were
not the Men they lookt for, receiv'd us
curteously. On the other side, we finding
they were impatient to know who we were,
told 'em, that we were Franks, Persons
in Religious Orders, and Missionaries, that
were going into <hi>Tartary,</hi> and thence into
<hi>China,</hi> with an intention to Preach the
Gospel.</p>
            <p>Thus when they understood the Motive
which induc'd us to undertake so perillous a
Journey, they heap'd Civilities upon us:
Some took our Horses to take care of 'em;
others brought us Refreshments; and in a
word, there was not any one that did not
strive to signalize himself by some Office of
Charity toward us. They inform'd us of
the Alarum that had been giv'n, and what
had constrained 'em to intrench themselves
in the place where we found 'em. They
told us, that certain Gentlemen of <hi>Georgia</hi>
had revolted from the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Tifflis</hi> about
fifteen days before; and not finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
strong enough to withstand the Force
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100819:42"/>
which he had sent to reduce 'em, they were
constrain'd to quit their Houses, and fly the
Country till the Storm was over; and that
because the greatest part of 'em wanted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to keep 'em, they were fain to fall upon
the Frontier Villages, where they ravag'd
and plunder'd without controul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
said they, being justly afraid of being
assaulted by these merciless Free-booters,
and losing those little goods we have, we
muster'd together in this place, which we
defend with such pitiful Weapons as
these. We gave 'em the best consolation we
could, during the small time we staid
among 'em, and after we had visited some
of their Sick, to whom we apply'd such
Remedies as we thought most proper to give
'em ease, we continu'd our Journey toward
<hi>Gangea,</hi> where we arriv'd the next day in the
Afternoon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gangea</hi> is one of the best Cities of <hi>Persia,</hi>
seated in a pleasant Plain about five and
twenty, or thirty Leagues long. The great
number of Rivers which meet there, and of
which the Inhabitants make use to water
their Gardens, that take up a good part of
the City, contribute not a little to render
the Soil round about it most delightful and
fertile. We arriv'd there in the middle of
the Spring, at what time never was any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
more grateful to my Eyes, then to see
a multitude of Houses seated among an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100819:43"/>
number of Groves and Thickets of
lovely Trees laden with Leaves and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which a most beautiful blooming Green
render'd yet more charming to the sight. So
that the <hi>Persians</hi> call this enchanting Corner
by no other Name, then that of the Garden
of the Empire.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bazars,</hi> or Market-Places which are
in the middle of the City, are the fairest
and most magnificent of all that ever I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in the <hi>East.</hi> For besides their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
extent, they are very well vaulted,
and there is a particular Quarter assign'd
for every sort of Merchandize. And because
the City of <hi>Gangea</hi> is most advantagiously
seated for Trade, there is a vast Croud of
Foreigners that always resort to it.</p>
            <p>At the same that we arriv'd there, an
overflowing Zeal for Religion had occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
a hideous hurly-burly in the City.
For the <hi>Persian Mollah</hi>'s, having declaim'd
against the three False Prophets mention'd
in the forgoing Book, provok'd the <hi>Turks</hi>
to that degree, that they betook themselves
to their Arms, tho they were but a small
Number, to revenge themselves for the
Affront done their most Holy Saints. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
some of the Mosquees, and were about
to have sacrific'd to their Resentment the
People there assembl'd to say their Prayers,
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Governor, who had timely notice of
what pass'd, had not put a stop to those
hot-brain'd Zealots.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:100819:43"/>
Three days after our Arrival at <hi>Gangea,</hi> we
departed with a small Caravan, consisting
all of Christian Merchants, whom Traffick
and Business hasten'd to <hi>Scamaki,</hi> and in
their Company cross'd the lovely Plains
that extend themselves almost from one
City to the other. The first day of our
Journey we pass'd the <hi>Kur,</hi> which rises
in <hi>Georgia,</hi> and after it has water'd seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Plains, convey'd plenty to several Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and enrich'd the Country with a
world of Sturgeon that are caught in it;
at length discharges it self into the <hi>Caspian</hi>
Sea.</p>
            <p>At the passing of this River, it was that
our <hi>Georgian</hi> Habit did us good Service.
For in regard the <hi>Turks</hi> take great delight
to signalize their hatred against the Monks,
whenever they meet with an opportunity;
more especially, where they know it is in
their power to be favourable or rigorous,
as they please themselves, they never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
any measure in Justice with those
whom they look upon as the declar'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of their Religion. And generally
they fall upon their Purses rather then their
Persons, being perswaded as they are, out
of their prodigious Avarice, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do a man greater Injury, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from him what they esteem and prefer
themselves beyond their own Lives. But in
regard they took us for other then we were,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100819:44"/>
they us'd us more favourable then we durst
hope for.</p>
            <p>We were not so fortunate
the next day, in meeting with
a <hi>Persian Chapar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An unlucky meeting with a <hi>Persian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
               </note> which is the

For in regard the State makes no
regular Provision of Horses for 'em; they
have a priviledg to dismount upon the
Road any Person whose Horse pleases 'em
better then their own. Now, tho we were
sufficiently inform'd of this inconvenient
Custom, we could not be so cautious, but
that we were surpriz'd by one of these
Couriers which the Kam of <hi>Schiamaki</hi> had
dispatch'd away about urgent Affairs. He
came powd'ring upon us in a Valley, where
we had stopp'd to bait our Horses, and
took the best of 'em, with which he was
just going to ride away. In this same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediless
Condition we took the usual course
which the unfortunate take in such unlucky
Accidents as these, and slipt a piece of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into the hands of this same troublesome
Messenger. Upon which he presently grew
sweet upon us, and having readily found
out a specious pretence to let us alone, he
rode away to seek some new Adventure in
another place.</p>

               </note> after all these

               <hi>Schamaki,</hi> which was formerly one of the
most considerable and best peopl'd Cities of
all <hi>Persia,</hi> is much decay'd from what it was
some years ago, when it was in a far more
flourishing Condition then now. For a
furious Earthquake that happen'd about
twelve years since, laid it almost utterly in
Ruins; overthrowing Five or six thousand
Houses, and killing so great a number of
Inhabitants, who were buried under the
Rubbish, that now it is not above half so

            <p>Besides the great number of <hi>Armenians,</hi>
which as they say, amounts to Thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;

of the Sea, together with the
Goodness of the Country, draws thither
from all Parts. This Concourse of so many
different Nations it was, which made us
earnestly wish there were a Mission settl'd in
this City, as being fully perswaded that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Zealous Missionaries would find in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
wherewith to repay the Labours
of their fervent Zeal. It seems our Prayers
have been heard since our departure thence,
so that we have now a Residence there, for
which we are beholding to the deceas'd
Count <hi>de Syri,</hi> who employ'd all his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

for an Establishment in that Place. And
he was pleas'd to lay the first foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

the <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Father <hi>Pothier</hi> was one
of the most accomplish'd Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionaries
in the <hi>East,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fat, <hi>Pothier</hi> Murder'd.</note> and was
one of those whom our King entrusted with
the Royal Presents which he sent about
ten years since to the <hi>Cha</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a Letter which he wrote in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Christians of <hi>Nachivan,</hi> who
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100819:45"/>
had a long time groan'd under the Tyranny
of some Governors that most heavily op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
'em. He drew a great number of
Disciples after him, at the beginning, by the
Charms of his edifying Conversation, and
by his sweet and affable Disposition and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour;
they came in Crouds to be instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and participate of the Divine Mysteries.
But a certain <hi>Turk</hi> of whom the Father had
hir'd a House, till the Governor had assign'd
him a Seat as he promis'd to do, grew so
jealous of the happy Progress of the Gospel,
and became so furiously mad to see his
House, which was really consecrated to
<hi>Haly,</hi> become a School of Christianity, that
he resovl'd to be reveng'd of the Affront
that was every day put upon his Prophet,

a passage into <hi>China,</hi> we hasten'd to the
<hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, three good days Journey from
the City of <hi>Schamaki.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This little Sea which is not
above Eight hunder'd Leagues
in compass,<note place="margin">The <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea describ'd.</note> to speak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is no more then a vast salt Lake, into
which above a hunder'd Rivers, not to
speak of an infinite number of little Rivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
discharge themselves on all sides, and
keep it continually fill'd with Water, which
She, by way of return, furnishes with so
great a Quantity of Fish, that in many
places you may take 'em up with your
hands without Net or Line. More especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in tempestuous Weather, when the Fish
forc'd on by the Waves, suffer themselves
to be crouded in Shoales into the Rivers,
where they are the more willing to abide, as
finding themselves shelter'd from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Agitations of the Sea.</p>
            <p>Besides this particular Remark, which I
had leisure to observe, during a stay of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
days, till we could meet with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porunity
to embark; I was not a little sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to see, the same day we were to have
set Sail, the Seamen employ'd to fetch fresh
Water out of the Sea, above two Leagues
from the Shoar. Now, in regard the thing
to me seem'd extraordinary, I had a mind
to taste the Water, which was as sweet, as
if it had been drawn out of a Fountain,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100819:46"/>
tho but a few paces from the same place it
appear'd to be more brackish then in any
Seas that ever I sail'd in. But my wonder
ceas'd when I consider'd, what a vast quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of fresh Water empti'd it self from all
parts into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Lake.</p>
            <p>But that which is more wonderful, is
this, to see this petty Ocean equally restrain'd
within the Bounds that Providence had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
it, notwithstanding the multude of
Rivers that fall into it, and which only
one would think should swell it to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as sometimes to overflow its Bounds.
This respectful Obedience to Providence it
is that has very much puzzl'd our Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and produc'd the Opinion among 'em
touching the Communication of this Sea
with some others, which she enriches with
her own plenty, when overstor'd her self.
Some have thought that the <hi>Black</hi> Sea, being
the nearest to it of any other Sea, makes
this advantage to partake of her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
store. But besides that this Opinion
is grounded upon no solid Reason, it seems
as if the Wisdom of God had plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two Seas, a long rigde of High
Mountains, for no other end, then absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to separate 'em one from the other.
But I have two Conjectures which make
me believe, that it rather discharges it self
into the <hi>Persian Gulph,</hi> how far remote soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100819:47"/>
it may seem to be, then into any other
Sea.</p>
            <p>The first is, because that in the Gulph
of the <hi>Persian</hi> Sea, to the <hi>South,</hi> over against
the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> there are two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Whirlypools, or deep Abysses,
which the <hi>Persian</hi> Vessels that set Sail from
that Coast, endeavour to avoid as much
as they can. And the noise of the Water,
which throws it self into that Gulp with
a surprizing Rapidness, may be heard in
calm Weather, so far off, that it is enough to
terrify all those who are ignorant of the
real Cause. The second Conjecture, which to
me seems to be of more force then the former
is grounded upon every years experience,
by which they who inhabit all along the
<hi>Persian</hi> Gulph, observe a vast quantity of
Willow-leaves at the end of every <hi>Autumn.</hi>
Now, in regard this sort of Tree is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unknown in the <hi>Southern</hi> Part of
<hi>Persia,</hi> which borders upon that Sea; and
for that, quite the contrary, the <hi>Northern</hi>
part which is bounded by the Sea of <hi>Kilan,</hi>
has all the Sea-coasts of it shaded with those
Trees; we may assure our selves with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
enough, that these Leaves are not
carry'd from one end of the Empire to the
other, but only by the Water that rowles
'em along through the Caverns of the
Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:100819:47"/>
Upon this Sea it was, which so many
particular Qualities render very remarkable,
that we embark'd in a <hi>Muscovite</hi> Fly-boat,
but very ill equipp'd. But the Season which
was extreamly proper for Navigation, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
all things that could be wanting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
we gain'd the <hi>Volga</hi> six days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we set sail from the Road of <hi>Nizzova,</hi>
which is one of the safest and most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
in all <hi>Persia.</hi> For besides the great
plenty of Wood in the Parts adjoyning,
which serves for the refitting and repairs of
shatter'd Vessels; there is a prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Towns and Villages, able to furnish a
numerous Fleet with all manner of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>After we had left the Sea, by the favour
of a fair <hi>East</hi> Wind, which carry'd us about
Sixscore Leagues in a little time; we found
our selves upon the <hi>Volga,</hi> before we knew
where we were. For in regard this famous
River discharges it self into the <hi>Caspian</hi>
Sea, through Seventy Mouths, as we are
commonly assur'd, and for that it still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
the Majesty of the Current for above
Thirty Leagues, after it has quitted the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs that close it on both sides, it
seems to dispute the Possession of its Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
with the Sea. So that the only Mark
to be assur'd that you are got into the River,
is the freshness of the Water, which he that
first discovers, receives the same Rewards,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100819:48"/>
as in other places the Seamen do that first
descry Land.</p>
            <p>No sooner were we got into one of the
Mouths, but our Vessel being deep loaden,
struck upon a Sand-bank, which the Pilots
had not the foresight to avoid. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
this Accident befel us several times
afterward during our Voyage, I rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
it to the Shallowness of the River,
which divides it self into too many Arms,
to be able to carry a Vessel of an ordinary
Burthen, then to the Seamen's want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>However it were, certain I am, that we
spent twice as much time in getting up to
<hi>Astracan,</hi> which lies not above Twelve or
Thirteen Leagues from the Mouth of the
River, then it took us up to Sail from <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
to the Rivers Mouth. Not that we were
thus equally perplext, but only till we had
got to the first place, where the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
have a great Fishery, which is one of the
best Revenues which the <hi>Czar</hi> has. There
it was that our Vessel had Orders to stop
for two or three days, till the Governor of
<hi>Astrakan,</hi> to whom we despatch'd a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to give him notice of our Arrival, gave
us leave to make forward. During that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time that we were oblig'd to stay, we
had good sport in seeing the Fishermen catch
Sturgeons, which is one of the greatest curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
that ever I saw in my Life: and the
manner of it is this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:100819:48"/>
The <hi>Muscovites,</hi> to make their best Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the great plenty of Fish, which
the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea distributes to all the Rivers
that fall into it, have driven in long Piles
of Timber, from one side to the other, in
one of the Channels of the <hi>Volga,</hi> which
they thought most proper for their Fishery.
Howerever they do not shut up all the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
so close, but that they leave one of
each side for the Fish to swim up the River,
and for the Vessels that return from <hi>Persia,</hi>
and other places; a little above this first Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricado
of Piles, they drive in others all a row,
in the form of a Triangle, into which the
Fish is easily carry'd by the violence of the
Stream; tho when he is in, 'tis not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him to get out, but even to stir
himself, as well by reason of the narrow
compass of his Prison, as because of the huge
bulk of his Body. In the mean time the
Fishermen, who keep beating the Water to
frighten the Fish into the Snare, visit their
Entrenchments made on purpose twice a
day, where they never miss of the Prey
which they look for; which done, they
thrust a great Hook through the Ears of the
Fish, and having drawn him up just above
Water, beat out his Brains with a great
Club, to prevent his escape, or doing any
other Mischief, should they preserve him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
in their Boats.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:100819:49"/>
After this, they carry their Prize to the
Banks of the Fishery, where they disembowel
the Fish, and take out the Eggs, of which
one single Sturgeon sometimes affords 'em
so great a number, as weighs above two or
three hunder'd Pound. This is that glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous
Substance, so well known in Foreign
Countries under the name of <hi>Caviar,</hi> which
they prefer before all the rest. They Salt
it very carefully, and put it up with great
care, to serve 'em in their Ragou's instead
of Butter, which is forbidden 'em during
Lent. As for the Body of the Fish, after
they have cut it into Quarters, they squeeze
out the Oyle, or else they pickle it up to
be transported into all the Provinces of the
Empire, or else into the Neighbouring
Kingdoms, where they have an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vent for it.</p>
            <p>But the pleasure that we took in this Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sport, was very much allay'd by the
inconveniencies of an Army of <hi>Gnats</hi> that
swarm upon the <hi>Volga,</hi> a little before and
after Sun set. Their Stings so terribly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both Man and Beast, that I am easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
induc'd to believe, that of all the Plagues
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Plague of the Flies was the most
noisome, and insupportable.</p>
            <p>Therefore to secure themselves from this
Vexation, Travellers wrap themselves over
head and ears with a little Tent which they
carry with 'em on purpose, so soon as they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100819:49"/>
begin to feel 'em sting. But in regard we
had made no provision against these formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Enemies, we lay at their mercy all
the while we staid in the <hi>Volga:</hi> So that
when we came to <hi>Astrakan,</hi> we should have
been taken for Leapers, or people that were
troubl'd with a Dropsie, but that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
were well acquainted with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Wheals and Blisters that disfigur'd
us.</p>
            <p>However this Martyrdom was at an end
after four days; for the Governor of <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan</hi>
having sent his Lieutenant to the Vessel
to do it the more honour, as belonging to
the Grand Duke, the Passengers had leave
to quit the Ship, and put our selves into a
Shallop, or kind of <hi>Gondola;</hi> the lightness
of which, and the dexterity of the Rowers
was such, that we quiekly got sight of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strakan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Astrakan,</hi> which the most exact Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographers
place in the forty eighth
degree of Northern Latitude; is a
City seated in one of the Islands of <hi>Volga</hi>
about thirteen Leagues from the mouth of
the River, whatever <hi>Struys</hi> says, who will
have it to be fifty Leagues remote from the
River's mouth. It is encompass'd with a
double Wall, without any other Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
only some few Tow'rs, half Musquet

are very fair ones, and the Garison is very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100819:50"/>
numerous. Now in regard the ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which that City stands is very gravelly
and low, the Summer heats are not to be
endured in that place; insomuch that the
people are oblig'd to bathe several times a
day. In the parts about it the Soil bears
all sorts of Fruits, and in great abundance;
nor does their deliciousness give way to their
plenty. More especially their Melons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for their most exquisite taste;
and it is as rare a thing to meet with a bad
or a wallowish Melon there, as it is unusual
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are call'd Karpous, or Water-Melons, tho

The Rind is of a lively green colour, but
the Pulp of a beautiful Rose-colour,
and full of juice, which cools as much as
it quenches drowth, and of which you may
eat your fill without any fear of surfeiting.
They have also a sort of Grape, of which
they make Wine, but sower, and no way
pleasing to the taste. All this while no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
person dares touch a Grape, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fruit, until the Governor of <hi>Astraka<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

has made choice of the best of every thing
for the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Table.</p>
            <p>Besides the Inhabitants of this City, who
for the greatest part are <hi>Muscovites,</hi> several
other Nations are intermix'd among 'em,
drawn thither by the conveniency of Trade,
and the sweetness of the Climate. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Armenians</hi> possess one of the Suburbs entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to themselves, and the <hi>Nogais Tartars</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which altogether resembles a City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sortifi'd with a Wooden-Rampart, and
having a Governour who commands there,
under the Orders of the Chief Governor of
<hi>Astrakan.</hi> Within that Enclosure stands a
Mosquee; but the Houses are for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part made of Bulrushes, of which there
may be about two thousand. Now in regard
it is the <hi>Muscovites</hi> interest to use 'em kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by reason of the good Service they do
'em in their Wars, therefore they treat 'em
rather as their Confederates, then their Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.
To which purpose they are allow'd
to share with 'em in the convenience of the
Market, that in the Morning is kept in their
Quarter; which is call'd <hi>Yourt;</hi> and with the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> in the Evening in the great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
place, in the middle of <hi>Astrakan.</hi> Much
more when they stand in need of Arms and
Artillery to defend themselves against any
Enemiy that comes to assault 'em, they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
'em, and assist 'em likewise to repel the
Assailants.</p>
            <p>It is not many years since the <hi>Calmuc-Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
put 'em to a great deal of trouble; and
that they came duly every Winter, by the
Favour of the Ice, to assault even in their
very Trenches. But since those <hi>Tartars</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
the fury of Fire-Arms, which they
know not as yet how to handle, they have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100819:51"/>
not adventur'd to molest 'em. And indeed
it is to the protection of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> that
the <hi>Nogais-Tartars</hi> are beholding for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and Tranquillity which they enjoy;
while their Enemies scar'd with the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Cannons and Musquets, let 'em
sit quiet. But tho the Hostilities between
the <hi>Nogais</hi> and <hi>Calmuc-Tartars</hi> are absolutely
at an end, the latter, which are a wandring
sort of people, forbear not still to adventure
every Winter into those vast Plains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Astrakan</hi> and the <hi>Caspian-Sea;</hi> where
by reason those Champian Countrys are not
so much cover'd with Snow, because they
lie more to the <hi>South,</hi> and nearer the Sea,
they meet with Food for their Cattel; the
preservation of which, as being all their
Substance and Riches, engages 'em to make
those Inroads.</p>
            <p>Which Annual Visits of above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
thousand men at a time, though they
be no way pleasing to the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are forc'd to suffer 'em, and not
only so, but to humble themselves to that
degree, as to make 'em Presents duely eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
year, to hinder their Incursions, which
they have reason always to be afraid of,
from such as are not restrain'd by the Laws
of Orderly Government, and Civil Society.
And these Presents thus continu'd out of
fear, being at length look'd upon by the
<hi>Tartars</hi> as an indispensible Obligation, are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100819:51"/>
demanded with so much haughtiness and
commanding fiercenss, that the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
must expect nothing but the utmost extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of War, should they once refuse 'em.
I was then at <hi>Astrakan,</hi> when this prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
multitude of Vagabonds was going to
take up their Winter Quarters. At what
time the Governor was no sooner inform'd
of their approach, but he sent one of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
to assure their Chief-tain, that he
would send 'em their usual quantity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
with all the speed that could
be.</p>
            <p>In a word; Some days after he sent away
several Waggons laden with Bread, <hi>Kar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou</hi>'s,
Srong-Water, and Tobacco, which
is the Present, or rather Tribute, which
serves to keep a good correspondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both Nations. Not but that the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> are able, if they pleas'd, to shake
off this kind of Yoke which they impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves, but because the <hi>Calmuc</hi>'s as
well as the <hi>Nogais</hi> are ready to lend 'em men
upon all occasions when they want 'em, they
are willing to purchase their friendship, tho
at the expence of their Reputation, and in
some measure of their Liberty.</p>
            <p>For this reason it is also that they caress
'em when they come to <hi>Astrakan,</hi> and that
they are not sorry nor disturbld to see 'em;
for as formidable as they are to the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
nevertheless the latter never scruple to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100819:52"/>
drive a Trade with 'em, either because of
the great quantity of Furs which they
bring, or the vast number of Horses which
they sell; both profitable Merchandizes to
the people of the Country.</p>
            <p>But they who without all question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
most to the flourishing condition of
this City, are the <hi>Indians,</hi> or <hi>Banians,</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as well as the <hi>Calmucs,</hi> whose Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they marry, because they cannot ally
themselves neither with <hi>Christians,</hi> nor with
the <hi>Mahometans</hi> of the Country; these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being very industrious, and holding cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
in almost all the Ports of the
<hi>Caspian-Sea,</hi> there are few sorts of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
that do not pass through their hands.
So that they have likewise their Quarter in
one of the Suburbs of the City by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
where they enjoy the exercise of their
false Religion with all manner of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>They hold the Transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Souls,<note place="margin">The Errors of the <hi>Banians.</hi>
               </note> which will not
suffer 'em to feed upon any
thing that has life, whether
Fish, Flesh, or Foul; and they have such
a respect for Cows, that if they know of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one that is to be kill'd for supply of the
Market, they will purchase it at a dear
rate, and redeem it from the Slaughter-House.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:100819:52"/>
Every Family breeds-up one with the
same indulgence as they do their Children;
no Creature can be more industriously
comb'd, more carefully fed, more cleanly
lodg'd, nor better look'd after when they
are sick.</p>
            <p>Another piece of Superstition they have,
never to eat but in private; and before
they touch the Victuals that is set before
'em, they throw some small part of it sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
into the Fire, the Air, the Water,
and upon the Earth, as an acknowledgment
of some Divinity conceal'd in every one of
those Elements.</p>
            <p>Whatever the reason of it is, we could
never get from 'em the least knowledge of
any of their Mysteries. We have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
several times to engage a <hi>Brackman</hi>
that travell'd with us out of <hi>Persia</hi> into <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
but he put us off still till we came to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strakan,</hi>
where he told us he should find his
Books; without the help of which, he
ingeniously confess'd, he could not answer
us.</p>
            <p>These are the most considerable Nations
which conveniency of Trade has brought
to settle themselves in <hi>Astrakan,</hi> the first
City of <hi>Tartary,</hi> where we arriv'd the <hi>20th</hi>
of <hi>Iune,</hi> two Months after our departure
from <hi>Irivan.</hi> We lodg'd in the Forreigner's
Caravan-sera, where we met with some or
other of all Nations in the World, among
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100819:53"/>
whom we learnt that some of 'em had made
several Journeys to <hi>Pekin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas no small comfort to
us to see that without going
any further,<note place="margin">A Merchant of <hi>Yousbecs</hi> gives 'em great sight as to their farther Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</note> we might be
thoroughly instructed in what
till then, notwithstanding
all our diligence, we could
only gain a confus'd and
obscure glimmering. This man was a
Merchant of <hi>Bokara,</hi> who having travel'd
four times from one City to the other, was
able to afford us a more certain Light.</p>
            <p>He told us then, that the Road of the
<hi>Yousbecs</hi> to <hi>China</hi> was neither so difficult, nor
so tedious as most people believ'd; that
there were indeed some Deserts to pass, but
that people suffer no more there then they
do in <hi>Persia</hi> or <hi>Turky;</hi> where notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great number of Towns and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
upon the Road, the Caravans never
mind the Habitations they meet withal,
provided their store of provisions holds
out. That the same care was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the security of that Journey, as
was taken in other Countrys of the <hi>East</hi>
where he had been, that the Caravans
should be always numerous and well guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and that there were to be found as
many Refreshments by the way, as in other
places. That we should meet in several
places with the <hi>Hordes,</hi> another sort of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:100819:53"/>
who were so far from doing any inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Travellers, that they took delight
to relieve and furnish 'em with Provisions.
Lastly, that money not being in use among
those wandring people, there was less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being robb'd then in the Territories
of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> where the <hi>Arabians</hi>
were no hindrance, in regard that men
would venture to trade, notwithstanding
their fears of being rifl'd by those Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds.</p>
            <p>As for the distance (added he farther)
I cannot exactly tell ye how far it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Bokara</hi> and <hi>Pekin,</hi> nor the number of
Towns or Villages through which people
usually pass; I can only assure ye, that we
got in two months to the Borders of <hi>China;</hi>
whether you take the <hi>South-East</hi> Road
through the Cities of <hi>Samarkand, Kaboal,
Kachemir,</hi> and <hi>Barantola,</hi> or go directly
<hi>East,</hi> through the middle of the <hi>Moguls,</hi>
who though Idolaters, are subject to the
King of the <hi>Yousbec</hi>'s that are <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first City of <hi>China,</hi> which you meet
with in taking the first Road, is call'd <hi>Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi,</hi>
where is the best Rubarb in the world.
From <hi>Soczi</hi> you must travel, a month before
you can reach <hi>Pekin,</hi> but if you take the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Road, the first City you meet with in
<hi>China</hi> is call'd <hi>Kokutan,</hi> built by the <hi>Chineses</hi>
on this side the great Wall, and strongly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100819:54"/>
fortifi'd to stop the incursions of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muc's;</hi>
and thence you have but fifteen days
journey to <hi>Pekin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to whichsoever of these two Cities
you happen to come, you will be oblig'd
to stay some time to manage your Business
with the Governor, so as to be permitted
to pass any farther, or otherwise you will
hardly get leave to enter the Kingdom. But
since the Emperor of <hi>China</hi> has set open his
Sea-Ports, there is not so much difficulty
to get admittance. But they who are desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to take more secure measures, apply
themselves to some <hi>Taiso,</hi> or Prince of those
<hi>Tartars</hi> that lie in the Road, and request
him to send an Embassador to <hi>Pekin,</hi> under
some pretence or other; which he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will do upon the allurement of some little
Present: And under the protection of this
Deputy it is, that the Merchants, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be all of his Train, enter freely into
<hi>China,</hi> and trade with all the security ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
            <p>This was that, which we learnt from this
same <hi>Tartar,</hi> upon whose Relation we had
the more reason to rely, because it perfectly
agreed with all the Relations which were
afterwards communicated to us both at
<hi>Astrakan</hi> and <hi>Mosco.</hi> A certain Monk of
good repute among the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> with
whom we got acquainted at <hi>Astrakan,</hi>
some days after our arrival, uvderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100819:54"/>
our design to travel into <hi>Tartary,</hi> shew'd
us a very curious Journal written by three
Merchants, who had travell'd from <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan</hi>
to <hi>Pekin,</hi> keeping the Road from <hi>Bocara</hi>
to <hi>Samarkand;</hi> in all which Journey they
had not spent above a hundred and eleven
days; and the Cities there mention'd were
exactly the same which I have already
nam'd. So that if we give but never so
little credit to the Sentiments of all persons
that I have consulted, and who could get no
advantage by cheating me, we must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
acknowledge that we have been a
long time in an Error, as to the certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from hence to <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is that, of which the Jesuits have
warn'd us within this little while to have a
care of. One among the rest, a Learned
Person, and well vers'd in Astronomical
Observations, perceiving by the favour of
<hi>Iupiter</hi>'s <hi>Satellites,</hi> that all the Ancient Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers
plac'd <hi>China</hi> more to the <hi>East</hi> by
about six hundred Leagues then really it is;
in regard, that counting the first Meridian
from the Island of <hi>Fez,</hi> they have plac'd
<hi>Pekin</hi> in the hundred and sixty fifth degree
of Longitude, whereas it ought to be only
in the hunder'd thirty second.</p>
            <p>According to this Calculation which is
somewhat corrected in the Great <hi>Planispheare</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the <hi>Observatory</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> it is easy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ermine
within a few Leagues at least, the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100819:55"/>
real distance between <hi>Bocara,</hi> which is now
the Capital City of the <hi>Yousbec's;</hi> and <hi>Pekin,</hi>
which is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>China.</hi> For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
as it is certain, that the first of
these two Cities lie in the fourscore and
twelfth Degree of Longitude, and the other
in the hundred thirty second, and that both
the one and the other lying very near the
forti'th Degree of <hi>Northern</hi> Latitude, as the
most exact <hi>Geographers</hi> agree, we must first
of all conclude, that the difference of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
between the one and the other is no
more than forty Degrees. Secondly, That
to go to both the one and the other, you
travel almost all along in the same Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel.</p>
            <p>Now in regard that every
Degree of the Equator of the
Earth consists of twenty
Leagues,<note place="margin">The distance of <hi>Bocara</hi> from <hi>Pekin.</hi>
               </note> and every League
of three thousand Geometrical Paces; it
follows, that every Degree of the forti'th
Parallel, containing no more then fifteen
Leagues, and nine hundred fifty nine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometrical,
the distance from <hi>Bocara</hi> to <hi>Pekin</hi>
in a strait line could be no more then about
six hunder'd and thirteen Leagues, and to
<hi>Kokutan</hi> the first City of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> four
hunder'd sixty three only,</p>
            <p>This being so, as it is easy for every one
to be convinc'd of it, there is no question
but that the way by Land to <hi>China</hi> is much
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100819:55"/>
more safe and short then to go by Sea, let
the Wind serve never so fair.</p>
            <p>I must confess that things speculatively
consider'd, appear always more easy then
they prove to be in practice, because we
cannot certainly foresee all the Accidents we
may meet with in long Journeys; nor do
I pretend to warrant the person that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
'em from all Events. But as I
have travell'd long enough in the <hi>East</hi> to
know what success a man may have; I dare
assure him after a long experience, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to me more easie in the practical part
then it appears perhaps to others in the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative.</p>
            <p>For not to speak of those, who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
attempted very near the same thing
with success, as <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Venetian, Benedict
Goez</hi> the Jesuit, and some others, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
arriv'd in <hi>China,</hi> by a way that was
but very little known at that time, and then
to come to a display that makes our way more
plain, by that little knowledge we have of
the <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries, which are the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to us, there is no dispute of the easiness
to go from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Bocara,</hi> or <hi>Samarkand;</hi>
from whence it is apparent by what I have
said, that there remains no more then a
fourth part of the way to each <hi>Pekin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Voyage from <hi>Marselles</hi> to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
is usually made in a Month; from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
to <hi>Teflis,</hi> and by the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100819:56"/>
but eight or ten days sail at most; from
thence to <hi>Erzerum</hi> is but seven or eight
more; from <hi>Erzerum</hi> to <hi>Irivan</hi> the most
heavy laden and encumber'd Caravans get
to their Journeys end in twelve or thirteen:
From thence to <hi>Tauris,</hi> the Ancient <hi>Ecbata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
of the <hi>Medes,</hi> much about the same time.
From this City, which is the second of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
for spaciousness and beauty, and which
is the resort and thorough fair for all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that traffick almost over all the East,
there are two different ways to reach the
<hi>You<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>becs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first, which is the shortest, leads to
the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> so well known to all
the world for the beautiful Silks which are
there wrought; and this Journey is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
in three Weeks; and being arriv'd
there, you may embark upon the <hi>Caspian-Sea,</hi>
the <hi>Southern</hi> part of which is call'd the
<hi>Sea of Kilan;</hi> from whence you may in a
strait line to <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>kara,</hi> enter the River <hi>Oxus,</hi>
which washes the Walls of it.</p>
            <p>The second Road lies through <hi>Ispahan,</hi>
the Capital of all <hi>Persia,</hi> and which, though
it be the longest, is however the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
and the most advantagious to
pass securely to the Prince of the <hi>Yousbec</hi>'s
Court. For in regard 'tis a usual thing for
that same <hi>Tartar</hi> Prince to send Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and for the King of <hi>Persia</hi>
to send as frequently his Envoy to <hi>Bokara,</hi> to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100819:56"/>
accommodate the Differences that arise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those two Princes, by reason of the
vicinity of their Territories, 'tis an easy
thing to slip into the Trains of those Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Ministers, when they return, or are
sent to <hi>Bokara,</hi> which is not above a month
and a half's journey from <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be any difficulty in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Journey, of which the distance
between the places deprives us of, 'tis to be
believ'd that the Providence of God, upon
which all Missionaries ought solely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
will be no less favourable to them
then to others, who perhaps had not those
elevated Motives which are usually the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
of Missionaries. Moreover,
though, there were as many Dangers to run
through, as <hi>Christopher Columbus</hi> had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to undergo upon the Score of Private
Gain, or Vain Honour; why should a
Minister of the Gospel fear to expose himself
for the glory of a God, who repays with
Interest the Services that are done
him?</p>
            <p>I owe this Justice to the deceas'd <hi>F. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naby</hi>
my Companion, that never man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
was more sensible of this noble Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
then he was; for this reason it was,
that when we understood after so authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
a manner, that there was an open pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from <hi>Astrakan</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> we had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thoughts between us, bt of joining
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100819:57"/>
with a numerous Caravan of <hi>Muscovites</hi>
that was then preparing to set forward for
<hi>Samarkand.</hi> But the noise of the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Calmoucs</hi> and the <hi>Yousbecs</hi> being
spread abroad, when every body wasprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
so zealously for this Journey, which
is usually perform'd in forty days, we found
our selves to our great sorrow disappointed
just at the very instant that our hopes were
elevated with the flattering probabilities of
speedy success.</p>
            <p>But as disconsolate as we were, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
fresh courage some few days after,
upon certain assurances of our Friends,
who had receiv'd advice from <hi>Mascow,</hi> that a
numerous Caravan of <hi>Chinese</hi> Merchants
was lately arriv'd there, that would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to return again into their own Country
by the end of Winter.</p>
            <p>This news being confirm'd to us by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
persons, we thought it our surest course,
without losing time, to take a journey to
<hi>Moscow,</hi> in pursuance of our first designs.
To which purpose, wanting nothing but a
Pass from the Governor, we apply'd our
selves to the <hi>Armenians</hi> that came along with
us out of <hi>Persia,</hi> to sollicit him in our behalf;
in regard the Vayvode was bound to have
a respect for 'em, well knowing the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the Court, which was to caress the
<hi>Armenians,</hi> as being the most proper Nation
in the World to bring a flouirshing Trade
into the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100819:57"/>
They on the other side overjoy'd with
this opportunity to oblige us, and to bear
us company to <hi>Moscow,</hi> where they thought
we might do 'em some service by means of
the Jesuits who have been settl'd there near
upon two years, spoke in our favour to the
Governor; and the more to induce him to be
speedy in his kindness, told him a thousand
things to our advantage, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
extoll'd us for our skill in Physick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that if we could get into the Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vod's
favour, by that means we might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
whatever we desir'd.</p>
            <p>The Governor, who was extreamly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of his health, thus prepossess'd of the
Abilities of my Companion, of whom the
<hi>Armenians</hi> had reported what strange Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his Skill several <hi>Bacha's</hi> in <hi>Turky,</hi>
and <hi>Persian</hi> Lords had experienc'd, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself presently that he was sick, and
to find a remedy for his Distemper, sent one
of his Officers to desire us that we would
give him a Visit. Now a Message of this
nature was the least thing that we dream'd
of, and it put us into much the greater
fear, because we had been inform'd before
we left <hi>Persia,</hi> that such sort of Enterviews
might prove very dangerous to us, for the
Reason which I am going to tell ye.</p>
            <p>Among the great number of Passengers
which we met in the Road of <hi>Wirzova,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we took Shipping for <hi>Astrakan,</hi> there
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100819:58"/>
was one, of whom it will not be expedient
to say any more at present, then that he was
of a Temper somewhat different from ours,
as being born without doubt in a Climate
much colder then that of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This person, with whom we were oblig'd
in point of decency and good manners to
contract a Friendship, would fain have had
us comply with his manner of living, and
drink Strong-water as freely as he did. But
in regard we must have put the same vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon our selves to have brought our
bodies to it, as it would have cost to get
rid of a bad Custom again, we thought we
might dispence with his Example which
would have led us too far out of the way,
since we did nothing to oblige him to be
conformable to ours.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, because he foresaw the ill
consequences of our Resolution, which
would oblige him to an uneasy abstinence,
more then he was willing to submit to, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
when he came among the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
he thought to have got his ends of us,
by laying before us the danger to which we
expos'd our selves, if we comply'd no more
with the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> then we had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant
to him.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Custom, said he, generally esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
in the Country whither you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to present Brandy and several other
stronger Liquors to all those that pay 'em
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100819:58"/>
Visits, and they are such jealous observers
of your receiving these marks of their
Friendship, that the refusal of 'em would
be look'd upon as a most bloody affront,
which they never fail to revenge with some
fatal mischief. True it is, added he, that
these sort of Civilities have a tincture of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism:
But what will you do with a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who believe themselves despis'd and
scorn'd, when they see you upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
and moreover admire so highly their
Intemperance as one of the Cardinal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
that there is nothing more common
in their mouths then this ridiculous Proverb,
<hi>Ne pian, ne sophi,</hi> He that will not drink, can
never be wise.</p>
            <p>Now tho these Maxims with which this
zealous Traveller would have prepossess'd
us, are commonly enough receiv'd over all
<hi>Muscovy,</hi> it must be acknowledg'd however
that they are not so universally authoriz'd,
but that there are some persons to be met
with of good understanding, who are so
far from approving, that they openly cry
down these bad Customs. But because we
were at that time but little vers'd in the
Manners of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> this horrid Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture
that was given us of 'em made
us believe, that being all <hi>Barbarians</hi>
alike, we should have much ado to escape
their hands, if to avoid doing any thing unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100819:59"/>
our Character, we should stick to
the Resolution we had taken.</p>
            <p>With this Resolution we follow'd the
Officer, not doubting in a short time but to
be the Martyrs of Intemperance. In short,
we were no sooner enter'd into a Chamber
where we were expected with impatience,
but the Vayvode after the first Compliments
were over, caus'd a pompous Train of <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastic</hi>
Liquors to be brought forth and set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, attended with an Equipage of Silver
Flagons, and some small enamell'd Glasses.
At the sight of these Formidable things my
Companion and I began to tremble, and our
fears redoubl'd, when we saw the Governor
take up a Glass and begin the Ceremony.</p>
            <p>While he was thus eagerly striving to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressus,
and putting us upon those things which
it was not the Custom to refuse any body,
we had the good luck to put a stop to his
Endearments, by the same means which we
had fortunately made use of in the <hi>East,</hi> to
hinder the infamous Debaucheries of the
<hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> For in regard we had
had a true portraiture of the Vavode giv'n
us, we laid before him, as one that was
strangely intoxicated about his health, that
there was nothing so venomous and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to Nature as those burning Liquors
which he swill'd up with so little modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
That it was easy to perceive by his
dry and scorch'd countenance, that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100819:59"/>
drinking had much enfcebl'd the Noble
parts of his body; that the continuance of
such a course of life would kindle in his
Bowels a Fire so violent, that all the
Physick in the World would not be able to
quench.</p>
            <p>There needed no more to disarm the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
and deliver our selves from the
Martyrdom with which our zealous Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
had threatn'd us. In the mean time
our imaginary sick Vayvode, who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
pleas'd with our reasons, was no
less desirous to make tryal of our Remedies.
To content him therefore, it behov'd us to
give him something, which when he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
he began to conceit himself so well, that
he perswaded himself, unfortunately for us,
that if he could but keep us within
call, he should become insallibly immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
            <p>Out of this Opinion it was, that he put
us off with trivial Excuses, and delay'd the
giving us our Letters of safe conduct for
near two Months together; nor was there
any thing but fear that was able to wrest it
out of out hands. However he heap'd
Civilities upon us every day; he would have
us continually with him; and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
us for the loss of our time, which
we would much rather have been spending
in the conversion of Infidels, he took de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in discoursing with us upon Matters
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100819:60"/>
of Religion, and sought with some kind
of eagerness to inform himself in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
between the <hi>Latins</hi> and the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
But notwithstanding all his Artifices, we
clearly saw that his main drift was to amuze
us, and that he had no other end in show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us so much kindness, then to make us
less sensible of the burthen of our Captivity.
We press'd him therefore several times to
grant us what in justice he could not refuse
us; and aftrr we had enhaunc'd, as much as
we could in modesty, the good Offices
which we had done both him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
we desird of him no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
then the liberty to continue our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
But our Solicitations and Intreaties
prov'd all in vain. He continu'd in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
not to let us stir, still colouring his
refusil with I know not what pretences.
We thought to mollifie him, and vanquish
his obduracy by the intercession of Friends
that we had made during our stay at <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan;</hi>
but all their endeavours prov'd fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
for they could obtain nothing of favour
in our behalf.</p>
            <p>So that when we were convinc'd of his
mischievous intentions, which nevertheless
proceeded only from a love of himself, we
resolv'd to spare him no longer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
finding him besides to be a person truly
timorous and pusillanimous, the character al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
of those that idolize 'emselves, we
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100819:60"/>
took the freedom to reproach him with
the ingratitude and severity wherewith he
repaid our Services.</p>
            <p>I know not whether this way of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
affected him, or no; but certain it
is, that he sent us the Pass, for which we
had been so long long, and so importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
soliciting. Upon the receipt of our
Pass, we agreed with a Merchant, who was
going by Water to <hi>Moskow,</hi> who promis'd
us two convenient places in his Hoy at a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Rate. But the same day, that we had
sent our luggage aboard, and were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
our selves; one of the Governor's
Officers brought us an Order to come
ashoar again, with an express Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on to all the Vessels in the Harbour not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us aboard upon pain of his indignation.</p>
            <p>This put us into a strange consternation;
however there was no remedy but Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and return we must to our old Post,
till Heav'n should be pleas'd to take our
Cause in hand.</p>
            <p>Well, during the time, that we were
thus compell'd to stay a second time at
<hi>Astracan,</hi> the objects of our sight, and
whatever struck our ears, was all doleful
and afflicting. For not to speak of the
dreadful Tempests, which more then once
we thought would have utterly overturn'd
the whole City, or at least have stifl'd the
Inhabitants, with a dismal Mist of thick
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100819:61"/>
and scorching Dust, which driven on by a
violent Wind, had envelopp'd all the City;
the frightful reports of Mortality and Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
alarum'd us every day; and a terrible
Bleeding at the Nose had like to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
me of my Companion: no hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
our Liberty by the means of the <hi>Polish</hi>
Ambassodor's returning out of <hi>Persia,</hi> whom
the Governor detain'd in a desart Island un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of putting a stop to the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
All these misfortunes abated our courage,
and cast us down in such a manner, that life
it self began to be a burthen to us. But God,
who suffer'd us to fall into this Abyss, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
us out of it by a means the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
by how much it seem'd alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
opposite to our designs.</p>
            <p>They who have the least knowledge of
the Religion of the Greek Church which
the <hi>Muscovites</hi> profess, well enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that the Priests and Monks, who
are the chief support of it, are utter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of all
that are united to it. Nay the excess of
their hatred is such, that if any person
happens to become a Convert to their Faith,
that was a Catholick before, their Doctors
Baptize him a second time, before they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him into their Communion, out of an
Opinion that that same second Baptism de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces
the Character of Catholick which was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>printed in his Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:100819:61"/>
However, notwithstanding this mortal
aversion, we found two powerful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors,
who made it a point of Honour
to obtain of the Vayvode that Liberty
which he had ravish'd from us. The first
was the Archbishop, or Metropolitan, as
he is call'd of the City where we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
We had paid him frequent Visits,
and he had always receiv'd us with great
demonstrations of Friendship and Esteem;
and when he officiated in publick, always
invited us to the Ceremony. The second
was the Superiour of the principal Monastery
of the Monks of St. <hi>Basil</hi> in <hi>Astracan;</hi> to
whom we had been in some measure ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
among other things, in expelling
a Worm out of his Body of an Ell and a half
long, by means of the <hi>Emetick</hi> Powder.</p>
            <p>To these two Persons in the midst of our
extremity, not knowing what courses to
take, we unburthen'd our hearts, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
some tears which the excess of our
grief drew from us. And that language,
which much better express'd the Sorrow
of our Souls, then ill-pronounc'd <hi>Sclavonian,</hi>
wrought all the full effect we could desire
in the minds of our two Mediators. For
away they went forthwith to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and so strenuously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laid before him
the injustice of his Proceedings, of which
they also threaten'd to inform the Court,
that he who was afraid of hampering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100819:62"/>
in Court-molestation, not only recall'd
his Prohibitions, but gave positive Orders
to the Masters of the Vessels to receive us
when and where we pleas'd our selves.</p>
            <p>Having paid our acknowledgment to our
Benefactors, we were altogether for leaving
a City that had caus'd us so much trouble;
and meeting luckily with a close Bark,
ready to depart for <hi>Saratof,</hi> we hir'd a
couple of places in it, and the Ninth of
<hi>Octob.</hi> was fix'd for the day of our departure.</p>
            <p>But before I go on with the Relation of
our Voyage, I cannot forbear to give an
account of a Tragical Accident that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
before our eyes in the <hi>Caravansera</hi>
where we lay, and where certain Foreign
<hi>Banians</hi> had hir'd Apartments. One of 'em,
who had formerly had a Quarrel in <hi>India</hi>
with one of his Countrey-men, who Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
out of <hi>Persia</hi> into <hi>Tartary</hi> with us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
him to Dinner, and entertain'd him
very handsomely, together with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of his Friends. Dinner being ended,
they sell to a Game at Chess, which is a
Game very common in the East, and no
less in fashion in <hi>Muscovy.</hi> While the
Gamesters were intent upon their Play, the
Person whom we spoke of, having laid up
in his breast a secret Animosity against the
new comer, who sate next him, and who
thought there had been a perfect Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
between 'em, drew his Dagger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceiv'd;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100819:62"/>
and after he had Stabb'd it Five
or Six times into his Body, never left him
till he saw his Bowels drop out of the deep
Wounds he had made.</p>
            <p>All that were present, equally surpriz'd
and consternated at such a strange peice of
Savage Treachery, rose from the Table
hastily to seize upon him; but the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
no way discompos'd, fixing upon
the most daring that Attempted to lay
hands upon him, Stabb'd him Three
times with his Dagger into the Reines,
and laid him sprawling upon the floor with
the first that was slain. The rest mistrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their inability to guard 'emselves from
the same misfortune, fled out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and cry'd out <hi>Murther.</hi> Upon which
the whole Quarter was in an Uproar, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
from those Persons that were
all in dismay, the Massacre that had been
committed. The rest of the City also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inform'd of it, throng'd together over-against
the Apartment where the Murtherer
stood his ground. They endeavour'd also
to get up to him, surround, and apprehend
him; but he, in a furious Posture with his
Dagger in his hand, so scar'd the Officers of
Justice, that there was not one among
'em that durst adventure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to lay hold of him.</p>
            <p>However, they found a way to force a
window, through which some Soldiers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into the Chamber where the poor
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100819:63"/>
Wounded Creatures lay, ready to expire
for want Assistance. Upon which, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
<hi>Indian,</hi> understanding by the noise
which they made in barrocading up the
doors which they had seiz'd, that there was
no way for him to escape; advanc'd to the
threshold of the door that open'd into his
Apartment, and putting himself into a
Posture to hold out the Siege as long as he
could; understood by the reproaches of his
own Friends, that he had not been so lucky
in his Revenge as he thought, since there
was some hopes of life in the two Victims
of his Resentment. Thereupon more
mad that he fail'd in his Attempt, then
anxious for the rigorous punishment that
attended him, he did that, which I should
hardly have believ'd, had I not been a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it my self.</p>
            <p>No sooner did he hear that death had so
long spar'd the persons, whom he thought his
Bloody hands had assuredly secur'd; but all in
transport and foaming with Rage, he laid
bare his breast before all the Multitude, and
clapping to it the point of the reaking
Dagger, <q>Since I have had such ill success,
cry'd he, as loud as he could baul, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
the Affront which I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiv'd, and lost the fairest opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of doing it, that ever I could hope
for; 'tis but just, that I should punish my
self without being beholding to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100819:63"/>
of Justice. Then thrusting the
Dagger into the lower part of his Belly,
Behold, said he, the course I ought to have
taken, to have render'd my Enemy hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of surviving me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, notwithstanding this desperate blow
was such as in all probability should in an
Instant have depriv'd him both of Strength
and Life; yet had it not that speedy
Effect, but he liv'd above two hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And that which appear'd more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
as well to me, as to many other
standers-by, was this, that we could observe
no more then some few drops of Blood distil
form a wide gaping wound, from whence
one would have thought whole Rivers
should have spouted.</p>
            <p>Fain would we have tri'd whether we
could have prevail'd with him to take the
advantage of the delay'd minutes of his
gasping Life, and all ways were us'd to force
him to surrender his Arms; and some of
the Soldiers presented their Muskets to his
Breast, threatning to Fire if he did not
yield; to whom, with an untamable fury.
 <q>Think ye, said he, poor spirited fellows,
that I, who have had the Courage to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
Death, as I have done, can be afraid
of your Weapons! Shoot if you dare.—
Behold me provided to receive your deadly
strokes. I have already prepar'd a free
Admission for your Musket Bullets, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100819:64"/>
this is my comfort, that I know, they will
but only finish the Work which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
my self.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This daring Language astonish'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's
Officers to that degree, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making any further trials, they resolv'd
to stay till that same Fire of a raging Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which still supported the furious Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in his anguish, was a little abated;
nor was it long before they saw the effect
of a calmer Temper, that in a short time
settl'd the Storms of his Heart, which so
many violent Agitations had been turmoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for some hours together. He perceiv'd
his Strength decay by degrees, and finding
himself as it were quite exhausted, his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
return'd to him in a very little time.
And then it was, that being perfectly come
to himself, he desir'd a Coach, that he
might be carry'd to the Governour, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for the double murder which he had
committed.</p>
            <p>The Coach being brought, he went into
it, after he had thrown away his Dagger,
which with a languishing Voice he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
for the ill Service it had done
his Master. Presently we clos'd with him, in
hopes to have infus'd into him thoughts of
Piety, and to have made him sensible of the
Goodness of God, from whom it was not
too late to hope for Mercy, even at the last
minutes of a departing Life. But how rare
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100819:64"/>
a thing is it, for a Man that ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s neglected
his Salvation when he was in vigorous
Health, to become sensible of it in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity!
For we could work no good up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this unfortunate Wretch, whom grief
and waste of Vital Spirits soon after quite
disabl'd from making any sericus Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon his desperate Condion; so that
we saw him to our unexpressible Sorrow,
expire, within a moment after had left the
Inn.</p>
            <p>About a day or two after this dismal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
we embark'd upon the <hi>Volga</hi> for <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w,</hi>
where we thought by joyning the
<hi>Chinese</hi> Caravan, to have made amends for
all the Troubles we had undergone during
the four Months that we were constrain'd to
stay at <hi>Astrakan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beginning of our Voyage was suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
anough; and if the Wind, as it was
at <hi>East,</hi> had continu'd favourable to us, we
had avoided many hardships that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd
us in the progress of our Journey.
But the Wind failing us a little above <hi>Ischor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi>
which is the first Town you come at,
after sixty Leagues sailing-up the River
from <hi>Astrakan,</hi> we were constrain'd to put
the Seamen ashore to tow the Vessel, in
regard we were depriv'd of the use of our
Sails.</p>
            <p>Now, in regard I had all along resolv'd
with my self not to say any thing in these
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100819:65"/>
sheets, which might be found in Authors
who have already given a clear Description
of the Countries where I travell'd after 'em,
I shall pass over in silence whatever I
might have observ'd concerning the Course
of the <hi>Volga,</hi> of which <hi>Olearius</hi> has made so
ample and so faithful a Relation in the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of his Voyages and Travels, and to him
refer the more curious that desire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
more fully of the particulars of this
famous River.</p>
            <p>After we had pass'd the little City above-mention'd,
we began to feel in good earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
the approach of Winter, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Climate, of which the Artick
Pole, toward which we were insensibly
advancing, made us sensible in spite of our
Teeth. And in regard we had not so well
fortifi'd our selves, as we ought to have
done before our departure from <hi>Astrakan</hi>
against the Cold, of which we thought we
should have had no occasion to be afraid;
that bitter Extremity which we endur'd
upon the Deck of the Vessel, where we
were oblig'd to remain Day and Night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numm'd
my Companion and my self to
that degree, that we thought we should
have been frozen to Death. For my own
part, my feet were become so stiff and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,
that I had no use of 'em for
three Weeks together; and besides, I fell
into an Ague at the same time, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100819:65"/>
me to that Condition, that I thought
verliy I must have laid my bones in the
<hi>Volga.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this while our Vessel slowly advanc'd,
and we approach'd still nearer and nearer
our wish'd-for Haven; but we found our
selves retarded by so many unlucky Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
that fell out, one upon the neck of
another, that we soon found there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else for us to rely upon, but only Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, which alone was able to
stop the course of our Miseries.</p>
            <p>The most dreadful of all was that which
be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>el us about four or five days Sail from
<hi>Czaritsa,</hi> which is the Second City, next
to <hi>Astrakan,</hi> which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

which was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Vessel, taking Fire,
caus'd such a furious Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration,
before there was any
possibility of mastering the Flame, that
notwithstanding all the care and diligence
that was us'd in such a threatning Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
there was no means that could avail
to quench it. Notwithstanding we were
surrounded with Water, and that the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
us'd all their utmost Efforts, the Fire
gain'd strength, and fasten'd so obstinately
upon the Unctuous Materials that fed the
fury of it, that every body began to think
it high time to shift for themselves, and had
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100819:66"/>
the good luck by the favour of the Long-boat
that attended the Vessel to gain the
Shore with their Persons, while the Bark
and Goods became a Prey to the matter
that had a long time fed the Flames.</p>
            <p>But this danger being thus
over,<note place="margin">In danger of being taken by the <hi>Calmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.</hi>
               </note> was but the beginning
of another, greater then that
we had escap'd. For it is usual
for several <hi>Hordes</hi> of <hi>Tartars</hi>
different from those that W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nter about <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trakan,</hi>
to infest the Banks of the <hi>Volga,</hi> at
the same Season of the year that we were
driven to these Extremities; besides, that
it was to be fear'd, lest the Flame of the
burning Vessel, which might be descry'd a
great way off, had given 'em notice of the
Misfortune which had befall'n us; a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Invitation for them, either to come
and rob us, or carry us away for Slaves,
which we had most reason to be afraid
of.</p>
            <p>The only way we had, was to lye close
among the Thickets and Under-woods
that lay round about us, till some of the
Seamen that were sent to <hi>Czaritsa</hi> in the
Long-boat, could bring us Provisions to
supply the want of what we had lost, and
get us such other Succour as we stood in
need of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:100819:66"/>
But notwithstanding the
extraordinary Extremities we
endur'd,<note place="margin">A <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> Officer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves us.</note> we soon found that
the Protection of Providence
is above all things. For after we had lain
for some time hid in these Wild Deserts,
only fit for the lurking holes of Savage-Beasts,
we perceiv'd at a distance a Vessel
that was sailing up the <hi>Volga.</hi> We were in
hopes that God had sent it on purpose to
make us amends for that which the Fire
had depriv'd us of. Presently my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
for I was hardly able to stir, together
with some of the Seamen that staid with
us, ran to the side of the River, to haile
the Vessel that was making up the River;
upon which the Commander sent away his
Skift immediately to know what was the
matter; and luckily for us, we understood,
that he belong'd to a <hi>Muscovite</hi> Collonel,
with whom we were acquainted at <hi>Astrakan,</hi>
and whom we had recover'd from a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Sickness which had constrain'd him to
call us to his Assistance. Immediately Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Barnaby</hi> went to wait upon him, and
after he had given him a brief Account of
the Misfortunes that had befall'n us, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obtain'd two Places for us in his Vessel,
which we were in hopes would carry us to
<hi>Saratof,</hi> with better success then the Vessel
we had lost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:100819:67"/>
With great delight we enjoy'd the fruit
of this lucky Accident, and we tasted with
so much the more pleasure, the comforts
of our good fortune, tho the cold Weather
augmented every day, by reason that the
dangers we had so lately escap'd were still
hovering before our Eyes, when a Tempest,
more terrible then the former, despoil'd us
of 'em of a sudden.</p>
            <p>Hardly had we sail'd two days together,
when a <hi>North</hi> Wind, no less sharpe and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
then violent and boistrous arose, and
in a little time stop'd the Course of the
<hi>Volga,</hi> by freezing up the River, which
staid us above Forty Leagues off from the
place whither we were bound, and expos'd
us to the same perils which we had so lately
escap'd.</p>
            <p>This new trial of our Patience, wherein
it pleas'd God to engage us, was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
more severe then the former. For
the Season could not be more inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
nor the Cold be more intollerable;
besides, that we were environ'd on every
side by several <hi>Hordes</hi> of <hi>Tartars,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
above five or six days Journey from
any City. Our Provisions were consum'd by
the Fire, and my Ague that held me every
day 18 hours, had reduc'd me to a very low
Condition of Body for want of good look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after; we had no Horses to continue out
Journey by Land, nor was I able to travel
a foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:100819:67"/>
Under the burthen of these Extremities,
after we had betaken our selves to Heaven
for Directions what course to take in these
Conjunctures equally dangerous, and full of
trouble and perplexity; Father <hi>Barnaby,</hi> who
had a Courage proof against the greatest
Difficulties, resolv'd to go with some Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
that were sent to <hi>Saratof,</hi> to hire as
many Sleds as were necessary, and to leave me
with the Collonel, and the Seamen that were
to defend the Collonel against the Assaults
of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> He took along with him a
little Bread bak'd in the Sun, and after he had
travell'd six whole days together thorough
ways no less difficult then full of danger,
he got quite tir'd and spent to the City whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we were bound.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all his care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
to procure us Carriage, it was above
twenty days after the departure of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
before they arriv'd to our Relief. For
the Ice not being yet hard and thick enough
to bear the Sleds, there was no body that
durst venture to set forward, tho you offer'd
'em never so much Money; so that we were
at length reduc'd to want of Bread, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
we had been very thrifty of
it; so that at length we were forc'd to live
upon a little Bran, and wild Apples, that
the Men went and gather'd in the Forests
adjoyning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:100819:68"/>
Tho this excess of Misery, together
with my Distemper, was enough to have
overwhelm'd me; the Providence of God,
who when he pleases, makes use of Mire
and Dirt to restore the Blind to their Sight,
made use of it then to restore me to my
Health. And at length, after we had a long
time waited in expectation of the Convoy,
it came when we least dreamt of it, and God
knows how delicious a dainty the Bread,
that was forthwith distributed among us,
was to Persons that had not seen a Mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in so many days. So that after we had
taken a little time to gather strength, we
prepar'd to set forward in the Sleds that
were provided for us.</p>
            <p>Hardly had we travell'd six Leagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Volga,</hi> which was frozen over, tho
very uneven, by reason of the Clods of Ice
that lay harden'd one above another, but
we were surpriz'd by a Troop of <hi>Tartars,</hi>
whom the hopes of Booty had drawn to
that place. They were about Sixty in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
mounted some upon Horses, others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Dromedaries. Presently they invested
our Caravan; but when they observ'd the
Fire-arms, with which our Convoy had tak'n
care to furnish themselves, they thought it
not convenient to attack us, but hooping
and hollowing as they drew off, they left us
to continue our Journey without giving us
any further trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:100819:68"/>
This was the only troublesom Accident
we met with in all the five last days of our
Journey; so much the longer by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eason of the
inequality of the Ice, which very much
weary'd our Horses, as also for that many
times the Ice broke under 'em. But because
the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who are accustom'd to such
Accidents, knew how to remedy those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences;
we arriv'd safe at <hi>Saratof,</hi>
without any loss by the way.</p>
            <p>Now, in regard my Companion had
wrote me word how kindly the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of the Chief Monastery of the Monks
of St. <hi>Basil</hi> in that City, had entertain'd
him, and the earnestness which that good
<hi>Muscovite</hi> had shew'd to send me all manner
of Refreshments, I went immediately to
find him out, as being the place of meeting
appointed me in his Letter.</p>
            <p>We staid eight whole days with this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<hi>Basilian</hi> to refresh our selves, who
besides that he let us have the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
Apartment in his Monastery, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
us also all other Conveniences that
he could think of. Nor did he limit his
cares to the time that he detain'd us with
him; he extended his Civilities also to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
our passage to <hi>Moscow,</hi> and to seek
out for us sure and faithful Guides to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
us full out three hundred Leagues that
remain'd for us still to travel before we could
arrive at that great City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:100819:69"/>
Now, in regard he was greatly esteem'd
at <hi>Saratof,</hi> he found us out two Guides,
such as we could never have found out our
selves; he agreed with e'm upon the price
of our Carriages, and would needs himself
bear one half the charges. And at length,
after he had recommended us to their care,
with as much earnestness as if we had been
his own Children, he took his leave of us,
and we on the other side were forc'd to take
our leaves of him, not a little sorrowful,
that it was not in our Power to shew him
those marks of our just acknowledgment
which it became us.</p>
            <p>The departure of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan,<note place="margin">We quitted the <hi>Volga</hi> at <hi>Saratof.</hi>
               </note>
with which we had
joyn'd our selves, being fix'd
upon the 10th of <hi>December;</hi>
we set out of <hi>Saratof</hi> all together in Sleds,
which the Snow, already thick and consoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
by the cold of the Weather, had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
smooth and slippery; so that of all the
Carriages that are made use of in <hi>Europe,</hi>
there are none that I know of to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with this of Sleds, for swi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tness and
convenience.</p>
            <p>This Machine,<note place="margin">Description of the Sleds in <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
               </note> which is
altogether in use over all the
<hi>Northern</hi> parts, consists of two
Spars of Timber, which are
as it were the Basis of it, and are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
plain'd under neath. These are joyn'd
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100819:69"/>
with several pieces of Wood laid athwart,
and surrounded on every side with the Bark
of a Tree of a sufficient thickness, and just
height to prevent the Snow from coming
in. The bottom, which ought to be more
solid, is plank'd very handsomely, and usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
spread with a Mat, or a Bears Skin, to
keep out the wet; and within this Sled
you may either sit or lye down, as you
please your self. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> usually
put their Beds in 'em, and lye in 'em almost
all unready.</p>
            <p>When you have made choice of your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
you are presently cover'd with a large
Carpet made on purpose, or with a furr'd Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlet
which you raise up, or else wrap your
self over head and ears in, as you have a
desire either to view the Country, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
your self to Sleep. This sort of Cradle,
which is about the bigness of a Man to lye
conveniently along, is drawn by a Horse
shod with Iron and Frost-nail'd, the Driver
holding the Reins in his hand, sitting at
the Feet of the Person that rides in the Sled.
Now, in regard this sort of Machine glides
without distinction over the Lakes, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
and Rivers, that lie in the way; a
Horse is so little tir'd with drawing, that
after fifteen or twenty Leagues, that they
usually travel every day, he shall be as fresh
at h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Journeys end, as when he comes out
of the Stable in the morning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:100819:70"/>
In such a Sled as this we travell'd from
<hi>Saratof</hi> to <hi>Moscow:</hi> The first three days we
spent in passing through a Desart above
Forty Leagues in length; where we met
with neither Tree, nor House, nor Cottage:
So that we were forc'd to carry along with
us our Wood, our Water, and our Forage,
which was a little burdensome to our Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
But this trouble was over, so soon as
we had gain'd <hi>Pinzer,</hi> a little Village some
few Leagues from this wild and uncultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Plain.</p>
            <p>The rest of our Journey was pleasant
and commodious enough; the Beauty of
the Weather not a little contributing to
render it delightful. For in regard the
Winter days are extremely serene and clear
in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and for that the ways beside are
as smooth as a Looking-glass, all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
make choice of this Season to drive
their Trade, and by that means avoid the
vast Expences they would be oherwise
forc'd to be at in transporting their Goods
from place to place.</p>
            <p>The Company that compos'd our Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,
was in truth of very great advantage
for the security of our Journey, because
the Roads are very much infested with
Robbers, that make no more of killing a
Traveller, then of rifling him; but it was
the occasion that we made frequent stops
by the way, where the Merchants have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100819:70"/>
to do; so that whereas it may be easily
travell'd in twenty days, it took us up five
whole weeks to pass between <hi>Saratof</hi> and
<hi>Moscow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We took care to get every night to some
good Town, that we might not be put to
lye in the open Air, which we never did in
all that tedious Journey, but when we
were engag'd in some of those dismal Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
which we could not cross in one day,
and then we endur'd very little Hardship
neither. For in regard the Sledds which
are rang'd round about a great Fire that is
presently kindl'd, are no less commodious,
and as well clos'd up from the Air as most
Houses you shall go into, you may sleep as
warm and as quiet as in a Stove, nay more
quietly then in a Countrey Stove, where
Men and Beasts being higgledy piggledy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
greatly hinder a man from taking
his rest.</p>
            <p>In this manner it was that
we crost over vast Plains,<note place="margin">The Countrey betwen <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan</hi> and <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow</hi> very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous.</note> of
which I can say nothing more
but that they were cover'd
over with Snow, and that of
necessity they must be extremely fertile,
considering the infinite number of Towns
and Villages which I observ'd in those parts.
'Tis true, that they were not always so well
peopl'd as now they are; but since the last
Wars which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> had with the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100819:71"/>
               <hi>Polanders,</hi> they took from 'em such an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number of people, that they had enow
to plant several Collonies, to whom they
gave both Liberty and Incouragement to
Till the Barren Lands between <hi>Moscow</hi> and
the <hi>Volga,</hi> which are now the best in all
the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Empire.</p>
            <p>Besides these People, whose Original we
could easily distinguish by the difference
which we observ'd between the Natural
<hi>Moscovites</hi> and <hi>Them;</hi> we found several
Towns and Villiages inhabited by <hi>Tartars</hi>
and Idolaters. The <hi>Tartars</hi> possess <hi>Cassimof,</hi>
which is a considerable Town through
which we past, and where there are some
Mosquees, wherein they Exercise their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
with as much freedom as in their
own Country; and the Idolaters live no
less quiet in the midst of that Darkness
wherein they are buried; no body trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
themselves, either to remove 'em from
their Habitations, or to instruct 'em bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>We were very much concern'd one day,
that we pass'd through a Borough belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those Infidels call'd <hi>Mordevates,</hi> for
the little care the <hi>Muscovites</hi> take, whither
Priests or Monks, of the salvation of those
wretched Idolaters who are setl'd in great
numbers in the very Center of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and
whom it would be an easy thing to bring
over to the knowledge of the true God.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100819:71"/>
We came thither the Evening before the
Festival of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
solemnize ten days after us, with as much
zealous observation as either <hi>Christmas</hi> or <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
Now in regard all the people of the
House which was appointed for us to lodge
in, seem'd to us to be in a manner out of
their Wits, it was easy for us to judge, that
the condition they were in, was the effect
of the Liquor which they had drank a little
too much to excess: So that when we saw
'em come to themselves, we could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to rebuke 'em for their intemperance.
But they believing they had a priviledge to
abandon themselves as they did to that ill
Custom for which we blam'd 'em, told us,
they knew us to be Strangers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did not consider perhaps that they had
been keeping the Festival of the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of <hi>Muscovy;</hi> to whom they never
found that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> pay'd ever any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Worship, then that which we seem'd
to disapprove, tho it appear'd that we were
Christians as well as they.</p>
            <p>How much it were to be wish'd that that
blind Nation had as much docility to suffer
themselves to be convinc'd of the truth of
the Gospel, as they have a proneness to
conform themselves to the corrupt Manners
of <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> and how commendable it
would be in the latter, if they were as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to make known to those Infidels the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100819:72"/>
Grandeur of the true God, as they are to
infuse into 'em, under the pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
their impious and scandalous Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims.
But the <hi>Muscovites</hi> look upon Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be no other then as a means to shoare
up their Politique Government, as they
have always done, and would never permit
their Politicks to give way to the Interests
of Religion.</p>
            <p>We flatter'd our selves that we should
meet at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>skow</hi> with all encouragement
and support, and we were so fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the Christian Religion which is
there profess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, would level all the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which had till then oppos'd our Designs,
that we thought our selves beholding to all
the dangers we had undergone, for bringing
us among a people by whom we thought
we should be soon assisted in the service of
that God, whose sacred word we were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to preach to the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Full of these thoughts we
came to the Capital City of
<hi>Muscovy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our arrival at <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
               </note> the spacious large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and extraordinary mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of which, when you behold it at a
distance, is one of the most beautiful sights
that ever I beheld in my life. Presently we
repair'd to the Jesuit's House, which the
<hi>Czar</hi> had setl'd about a year or two before,
in consideration of the <hi>German</hi> Officers, who
possess the chiefest Employments in the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100819:72"/>
               <hi>Czar</hi>'s Army, and whom those Princes
cannot be without, as not having Subjects
of their own that are capable of Military
Discipline, or to command the Soldiers of
which they stand in need. The Civilities
and Entertainment full of Tenderness and
Friendship, which we receiv'd from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which cultivated that new Mission,
were such, that nothing of addition could
make 'em more compleat; and by their
cordial reception of us, they gave us suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
to understand, that the Charity of
Jesus Christ makes no distinction between
the <hi>Parthian</hi> and the <hi>Scythian,</hi> but that it
embraces with the same affection all those
that are united to it in the same Mind and
Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now in regard they had already under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by Letters which we had written
to 'em, the Motives of our intended Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
they gave us notice very prudently,
that the first step we were to make in order
to the good success of our Designs, was to
pay our Respects to Prince <hi>Gallichin,</hi> who
was then Prime Minister of State, and to
let him see, according to custom, the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
which the Governor of <hi>Astrakan</hi> had
given us.</p>
            <p>How unwilling soever we were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in our Forreign Habit before that great
Chancellor of the Empire, we follow'd
their advice however; and that Minister
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100819:73"/>
who was a Person of great ability and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
instead of taking any exception,
seem'd extreamly well pleas'd to see us in
that condition. For when he understood
the reason that oblig'd us to disguise our
selves, and the design we had to travel into
<hi>China;</hi> he testifi'd a great kindness for us,
and assur'd us of all the Service that could
be expected from him.</p>
            <p>However,<note place="margin">Strangers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a rigorous Examination at <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
               </note> not to excuse us
from observing all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
from which no Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
whatever he be, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted,
unless he bear some
publick Character, he order'd
us forthwith to repair to the Chancery,
there to pass the usual Examination, and
punctually to answer the Officers of the
Chamber, whose business it is to take in
Writing the Depositions of all new-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>Therefore as near as it was to Night,
and as much need as we had of rest, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd
us to obey the Prime Minister's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
And no sooner were we enter'd the
enclosure of the Court of Justice where
our examination was to be taken, but we
found our selves surrounded by three or
four Registers, who after they had caus'd
us to sit down after the same manner as if
we had been really criminal, tir'd us to
that degree with so many ridiculous Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100819:73"/>
and so extravagantly from the purpose
for four hours together, that we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
lest they would have convicted us of
some Crime, of which however we knew
not our selves to be guilty. However it
were, after they had fill'd several sides of
Paper with the Answers which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from us, they gave us leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
about Eleven a Clock at Night to the
Father's House, who were more troubl'd
for us then we were for our selves; being
assur'd by the Testimony of our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
that we had no other Design upon
<hi>Muscovy,</hi> then to open our selves a way to
get as soon as we could into <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which being the only reason of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Moscow,</hi> the next day we went to
seek out our <hi>Chinese</hi> Merchants, to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by them in the different Roads, which
led to that great Empire; how long time
it would take us up; of the nature of the
people that lay in our way; and with what
safety we might travel over all that vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Country; and in a word, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of every thing that would forward
or obstruct our Designs.</p>
            <p>But those pretended <hi>Chineses,</hi> which we
had much ado to discover in that great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
where there are no less then six or seven
hunder'd thousand Inhabitants, were of
those sort of <hi>Tartars,</hi> that possess the most
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100819:74"/>
               <hi>Eastern</hi> part of that spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Country,<note place="margin">The Country of <hi>Kitay.</hi>
               </note> which is
call'd <hi>Kitay,</hi> which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
thought till now, to have been a
particular Kingdom, and whieh borders
upon <hi>China</hi> to the <hi>North-west.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in regard the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have made
considerable Discoveries on that side, and for
that they have built several Cities for the
security of the Collonies which they send
thither from time to time; they have also
drawn several of those wandring people to
the same Cities, where after once they
came to be fix'd, they began by degrees to
have a sense of the Benefits and Advantages
of Trade.</p>
            <p>The Merchants that we went to discourse
with were of this sort of Traders; and in
regard the <hi>Muscovites</hi> call all that Country
that lies beyond the <hi>Obi,</hi> by the name of <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tay,</hi>
and the people that inhabit it, <hi>Kitachi;</hi>
for that Reason most commonly those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are confounded with the <hi>Kitachi.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the <hi>Muscovites</hi> make a difference between
the one and the other, and very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how to distinguish <hi>Kitay</hi> from <hi>China.</hi>
When they talk of the former, which to
speak properly, is all that Country between
the <hi>Obi Volga</hi> of <hi>China;</hi> that is to say, that
spacious portion and the Earth call'd the
Great <hi>Tartary,</hi> which is divided into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
company of <hi>Hordes,</hi> every one of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100819:74"/>
which has his <hi>Kan</hi> or <hi>Taiso,</hi> they only mean
<hi>Kitay;</hi> but when they would have you to
understand that they intend <hi>China,</hi> they use
the same Expression which the <hi>Turks</hi> make
use of, who call it <hi>Ichim ma-Ichim,</hi> and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a Repetition as they do, give it the
Name of <hi>Kitay-Kitay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However it be, the Merchants who were
to us confirm'd for <hi>Chineses,</hi> though they
were only <hi>Tartars,</hi> gave us great insight in
to both Countries, which had been but so
obscurely known till very lately; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they Traffick as well with the <hi>Chineses</hi>
as with the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> and for that they
had been both at <hi>Pekin</hi> and <hi>Moscow,</hi>
both Roads were known alike to
them.</p>
            <p>Then again all the Particulars that they
told us were confirm'd by so many other
<hi>Muscovite</hi> Merchants that had travell'd
several times from <hi>Moscow</hi> to <hi>Pekin,</hi> that
I never made any question afterwards of
the easiness of passing from one City to
the other, were but the <hi>Muscovites</hi> a little
more tractable and good-natur'd then they
are, that to go from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> by
making choice of the Road of <hi>Arch-Angell</hi>
and <hi>Tobolsk,</hi> which is the General
Rendevouz of all the Merchants that
traffick thither, six Months at most
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100819:75"/>
would suffice for that Journey, which is
neither so long nor so difficult to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
as has been thought till now, as
it will be easy to convince the Reader, by
the farther Accompt which I shall give in

that they have had but very ill Success. Some

            <p>These people having been subdu'd by the

the Mountains and Rivers which divide
the Countrey, secur'd them from all As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
which the <hi>Muscoveites</hi> could make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
'em. And the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have made a
vast advantage of this Countrey since they
possess'd it, through the care which they

which they augment every day, by banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the places where those Creatures
are caught, not only the Malefactors of the

            <p>Now in regard this gainful sort of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of these precious Creatures has engag'd

to discover still more lovely <hi>Martins;</hi> they
have at length found out wherewith to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves in an Island of the River

Now then as to the man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
of Sable-Hunting it is
thus perform'd:<note place="margin">The manner of Sable-Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> There is a
Regiment of Soldiers sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Countrey where these costly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are found, which usually stays there
seven years. And every week a Collonel
commands a certain number of Hunters,
that seek 'em out in the little Islands to
which they retire. They kill 'em with a
kind of Cross-bow, for fear of spoiling or
endamaging the Furr, should they make
use of Fire Arms. Now in regard there
is an extraordinary diligence to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this sort of Hunting, the Officers are
permitted to let the Soldiers be concern'd
in it, and to divide with 'em the surplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
which they are bound to kill for the
<hi>Czars</hi> profit, which makes those employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
very considerable. For a Collonel
may get Four thousands Crowns in seven
years service, and an under Officer propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably:
But a common Soldier never gets
above Six or Seven hunder'd Crowns, tho
he be at all the trouble.</p>
            <p>Besides these Sable <hi>Martins,</hi> which are
very plentiful over the whole extent of this
vast Countrey between <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>China;</hi>
there is also another sort, which are of
equal Value, and no less Beautiful. These
are the Skins of Black Foxes, which are no

buy one, the owner will not let it go but
upon condition the Purchaser shall fill it
with as many Crowns as it will hold.</p>
            <p>Though ir is a long while, that this Trade
has been settl'd in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> 'twas none of
their faults, that it was not formerly as great
as it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> now. For, before the discovery of
these Sable-Martins, they were contented
all over the Kingdom with common Furrs;
and, unless it were the <hi>Ermin</hi>-Furr, which
only Persons of Quality made use of, they
knew no other sort. But since the discovery
of these Creatures so much sought after,
which fell by chance, rather then cunning,
into their hands; they have made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
such an eager thirst to satisfie their
Avarice at the expence of those, whom
they have found profusely fond of this
sort of Ornament, that they have
made no scruple to engage 'emselves in
those forlorn Countries, in hopes to find
wherewithal to enrich 'emselves.</p>
            <p>By the means of all these their irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Incursions, it was, that they laid open
several New Roads, which led 'em insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
into <hi>China.</hi> Now in regard, that those,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100819:78"/>
who have happen'd to hit upon the way to
the Borders of the Country, have every
one taken Roads quite different the one
from the other; so they have been able to
inform us which are those that are most
certainly to be depended on for security and
shortness. And here we shall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what the Relations which are kept
in the Chancery of <hi>Moskow</hi> more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
instruct us.</p>
            <p>The first Road that carries a Traveller by
Land into <hi>China,</hi> is that through <hi>India</hi> and
the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country; which the great
number of Robbers, and the vast Deserts
that are to be cross'd over, render very
dangerous, and almost impracticable. We
are beholding to the Jesuits for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it, whom those dangers have no
way discourag'd. The <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Astrakan</hi>
and <hi>Bokara,</hi> have sometimes taken this
Road; but then they have been very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to joyn with a numerous Caravan.</p>
            <p>The second is that which the Merchants
of <hi>Bocara</hi> take, who Travel through the
Cities of <hi>Samarkan, Kaboul, Kachemire,</hi> and
<hi>Tourafan,</hi> and several other Cities of the
<hi>Yousbecs,</hi> from whence they go to <hi>Barantola,</hi>
which the Residence of <hi>Dala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-Lama</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the most considerable of all the Cities
of the Greater <hi>Tartary.</hi> But this Road is
not a little difficult by reason of the Sands
that are to be cross'd, and because of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100819:78"/>
               <hi>Calmoues</hi> that infest the Roads But the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> make choice of this way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any scruple: And they have been often
known to fall down from <hi>Tobolsk</hi> to <hi>Bocara</hi>
through <hi>Cazan,</hi> on purpose to Travel
this Journey with the <hi>Yousbecks,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the easiness of going to <hi>China</hi> by
the River <hi>Ohi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is frequented by the <hi>Yousbeck
Tartars,</hi> by the Trading <hi>Calmucs,</hi> and the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> also. From <hi>Tobolsk,</hi> you ride
along by the <hi>Lakes</hi> that yield great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Salt near <hi>Irticks</hi> and <hi>Kama;</hi> after
which you Travel for some time by Water
upon the first of these two Rivers as far as
a City call'd <hi>Sinkamè,</hi> where you continue
your Journey by Land through the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of the <hi>Kalmouc</hi>'s and <hi>Moguls,</hi> as
far as <hi>Kokutan,</hi> which is not above
Eight or Ten days Journey, from the
Famous Wall which separates <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
from Great <hi>Tartary.</hi> Neither is this
Road without some difficulties, as want of
Water, and molestation of the <hi>Calmoues,</hi>
unless well provided to make a stout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
However, the <hi>Taiso Ajonka,</hi> who
is the <hi>Kan,</hi> or chief Captain of the Horde
of <hi>Tartars,</hi> who have no fix'd Habitations
but live after the manner of the Ancient
<hi>Scythians,</hi> might, if he pleas'd, secure this
way, and make it safe for Travellers, which
sometimes he will vouchsafe to do for the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100819:79"/>
sake of some little Presents. And from
<hi>Kokutan,</hi> you may enter into <hi>China</hi> through
many Gates of this great Wall.</p>
            <p>The fourth supposes, that you pass
through <hi>Tobolsk</hi> and go by Water upon the
<hi>Obi,</hi> and the <hi>Szelinga</hi> as far as the City of
<hi>Szelingui,</hi> from whence you Travel by Land
through the Countrey of the <hi>Monguls.</hi>
From this last-mention'd City it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Eight weeks time to reach the place
where the Kan of <hi>Bechroesaim,</hi> and the <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toussta-Lama</hi>
reside. From whom, by the
Intermediation of some few Civilities, you
may obtain Guides and Carriages, and a
good Convoy to carry you to <hi>China.</hi> This
Road the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have held ever since the
war between them and the <hi>Chineses</hi> near the
River <hi>Yamour;</hi> and it is the safest and most
commodious way of all the rest. Only
you must make provision of Water and
Wood in some places: And though you
may sometimes meet upon the Road with
Robbers, they are neither so Cruel nor so
numerous as in other parts.</p>
            <p>The fifth is that which the Envoy of
<hi>Muscovy, Spartarius</hi> made choice of for
<hi>China;</hi> and then you must pass through <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria</hi>
to get to the City of <hi>Nero-Zinki</hi> upon
the River <hi>Szilk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> after that you go to
<hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uri</hi> not far from the Kiver <hi>Naiunai,</hi> from
whence you continue your Road to <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
that lies upon the entrance into <hi>China.</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:100819:79"/>
The distance is equal from <hi>Nerc Zinski</hi> to
<hi>Dauri,</hi> and from <hi>Dauri</hi> to <hi>Cheria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you will believe this Relation, of
which I have thus far given a faithful Copy,
this Road is as safe as it is short; for that
from <hi>Nerc Zinski</hi> to the River <hi>Argus</hi> that falls
into the <hi>Yamour,</hi> you shall meet all along
with the <hi>Yachutchiki,</hi> or <hi>Martin-Hunters:</hi>
After which you pass through the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of certain <hi>Monguls,</hi> who are terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
afraid of the <hi>Muscovites.</hi> But it is not
probable there is now so much security, as
formerly, in passing through those <hi>Monguls;</hi>
for that Travellers at this time either
take a little higher through <hi>Albazin,</hi> and
fetch a compass to get from thence into <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
or a little lower, passing from <hi>Szelingui,</hi>
through the Territories of <hi>Beckroesaim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sixth is also through <hi>Nerczinski</hi> and
the <hi>Mongul;</hi> from whence you Travel on
to the Lake <hi>Dalai;</hi> or you may go from
<hi>Nerczinki</hi> to the Lake in one Week. There
you meet with the Emperor of <hi>China</hi>'s
Subjects, who have manur'd all the Lands
that lye about the Lake; from which you
may go in three Weeks to <hi>China</hi> upon Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
drawn with Oxen. Out of this Lake
<hi>Dalai</hi> it is, that the River <hi>Argus,</hi> a very fair
River, takes its rise. It is Navigable all
along, and carries you by Water to the
River <hi>Yamour,</hi> into which it falls. Near
the River <hi>Argus</hi> are several Mines of Silver
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100819:80"/>
and Lead; and there it is that a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Tayso</hi> whose Name is <hi>Sebdenkan</hi> resides,
who is bound to find Convoys for the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oovites</hi>
that Travel for <hi>China</hi> three times a
year, and to secure the Road that they
may Travel it in so much the shorter time.</p>
            <p>To all these Relations we ought to join
one more, which affords us a very ample
knowledge of all the People that inhabit
the Countries joining upon <hi>China,</hi> which
was imparted to us by a person of good
Reputation, who had it out of the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Moskow,</hi> and to which so much the
more credit may be given, because it agrees
exactly with the Annals of <hi>China</hi> which are
at the end of <hi>Confucius</hi>'s Philosophy, Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but a while since by Father <hi>Couplet</hi> the
Jesuit, and which is also conformable to
the Report of all such Travellers who have
try'd the greatest part of all those Roads
of which we have made a description.</p>
            <p>The first Nation is that of
the <hi>Bogdoi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Bogdoi.</hi>
               </note> by the <hi>Chineses</hi>
call'd the Eastern <hi>Tartars,</hi> and
whom the <hi>Monguls</hi> call <hi>Niouchi,</hi> or <hi>Nuchi.</hi>
Their Country is of a very large extent,
under several <hi>Tayso</hi>'s, or <hi>Kans.</hi> There is
in <hi>Bogdoi,</hi> a particular Province which the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> call <hi>Diutchari,</hi> and the <hi>Monguls
Diourski.</hi> It is seated between the Eastern
Seas, and the great Rivers <hi>Chingala,</hi> and
<hi>Yamour.</hi> The people that inhabit it, tho tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100819:80"/>
to <hi>China,</hi> were not formerly very well
known: For in regard they had no Prince
of their own, they were not look'd upon as
very considerable. Nor were they indeed
either truly known or fear'd, till they had
made an Invasion into <hi>China,</hi> and subdu'd
Six Provinces. At what time they had
made themselves absolute Masters of that
spacious Empire, had not the <hi>Yousbecks</hi>
come to succour the <hi>Chineses,</hi> or rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
the <hi>Bogdoi</hi> and settl'd themselves in
their Places.</p>
            <p>Which when they had done, they set
upon the Throne the Family of <hi>Ivena;</hi>
which after it had Reign'd till the Year
1368. was expell'd by the <hi>Chineses,</hi> who
then Enthron'd the Family of <hi>Tayminga.</hi>
That Family sway'd the Scepter peaceably
till 1644, at what time the same <hi>Diutchari</hi>
re-enter'd <hi>China,</hi> and at length utterly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
it. <hi>Chunchi,</hi> their Prince was the first
Emperor of that Nation, and the Chief of
the Family of <hi>Taitsingua,</hi> who Reigns at
present in <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all the Province of <hi>Bogdoi,</hi> you shall
meet with none but houses of Earth, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in the Province of <hi>Dauri;</hi> which people
drive a great Trade in Sables and Black
Fox-Skins, as likewise in <hi>Ginseng</hi> Roots:
But they are not rich in Cattel; their Horses
are very small; nor do their owners ever
shooe 'em. As for the people themselves,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100819:81"/>
they resemble altogether the <hi>Krim Tartars,</hi>
both in Features of Face, as in Stature and
Proportion of Body: But they are much
more Polite and Civiliz'd, by reason of the
Great Trade which they drive with the
<hi>Chineses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To speak properly, they are of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
yet you shall see several among 'em
that wear Crosses, which they call <hi>Lama</hi>'s.
And indeed they have a great inclination to
the Christian Religion, and there are not a
few who are already become Catholicks.
They have no kindness either for the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi>
or the <hi>Nestorians,</hi> because they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
succor'd the Western <hi>Tartars</hi> when
they were repell'd by the <hi>Chineses.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
since that time, the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> have
settl'd themselves in <hi>China,</hi> insomuch that
there are a great number of 'em at <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>king,</hi>
where there are Seven Mosques without the
City; and where they also speak the <hi>Persian</hi>
Language more commonly then that of
<hi>Turky.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Language of the <hi>Bogdoi,</hi> 'tis
very like the ordinary vulgar Speech that is
spoken in <hi>Persia;</hi> their Characters also very
much resemble one another; but they write
and read from the top downward like the
<hi>Chineses,</hi> and moreover they have above
sixty Letters in their Alphabet.</p>
            <p>The Rivers of <hi>Argus, Yamour,</hi> and <hi>Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala,</hi>
afford great Store of Rubies and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100819:81"/>
Pearles, which the People continually fish
for. Altho they are not ignorant of Guns
and Powder, yet they are not much in use
among 'em, whether their great Artillery
which is but very leudly cast, are too trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
to be mov'd from place to place, or
whether it be that they find no great Effects
of 'em, because their Powder, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of which they understand but by
halves, is but of little strength. And it is
observ'd, that the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who are become
Masters of <hi>China,</hi> begin to degenerate from
their ancient Valour.</p>
            <p>Next the <hi>Eastern Tartars,</hi>
lies a vast and spacious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to the <hi>West,</hi> which is
call'd <hi>Mongul.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Country of the <hi>Monguls.</hi>
               </note> It begins at
the <hi>Western Sourses</hi> of the River <hi>Yamour,</hi>
and extends it self to the <hi>Calmouc Tartars,</hi>
Westward, confining upon <hi>Turquestan</hi> to the
<hi>South-East,</hi> and upon <hi>China</hi> to the <hi>East,</hi> and
they are seperated from the <hi>Culmouc</hi>'s by
wide Desarts, which are as good as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ramparts. They have three Princes,
whom they call <hi>Kan</hi>'s or <hi>Tuiso</hi>'s, and who
are all three of the same Family; so that
they keep a good Correspondence together;
Civil Wars very rarely happen among 'em.
On the other side, they frequently send
Presents one to another, and when any
on of 'em is attacqu'd, the rest immediatly
arm to his Relief. The chiefest of these
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100819:82"/>
               <hi>Kans</hi> is call'd <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hetchinga,</hi> whose Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
border upon <hi>Bogdoi</hi> and <hi>China.</hi> But you
see neither Town nor Villages, only certain
Houses dispersed here and there, and those
very few in number. So that these <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guls</hi>
are continually making Incursions round
about the Lake <hi>Dalai,</hi> or into the Lands
that lye upon the River <hi>Szelinga.</hi> this <hi>Kan</hi>
has several <hi>Taiso</hi>'s under him, among whom
is the <hi>Becroesain</hi> Kan, who borders upon
the River beforemention'd.</p>
            <p>In these Territories it is, that the <hi>Coutousta
Lama</hi> has his Residence. This <hi>Coutousta,</hi>
who to speak properly, is no more then the
Vicar of the <hi>Dalaè-Lama,</hi> or <hi>Lama-Lamalom,</hi>
is the Patriarch of the <hi>Monguls,</hi> who adore
him like a Deity, as having an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Veneration for all the <hi>Lama</hi>'s. The
same <hi>Mongul</hi>'s keep a good Correspondence
with the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> by reason of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
to <hi>Siberia.</hi> They are naturally
very mild, and addicted to peace; 'tis very
rare to see 'em quarrel one with another;
or if any contest arises among 'em, the
<hi>Coutousta,</hi> who follows 'em whereever they
ramble, appeases the difference either by
his own Authority, or by such Judges as
he ordains among 'em whereever they cluster
together. They are very wealthy, especially,
in Cattel, and drive a great Trade with
the <hi>Muscovites.</hi> For their Country is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
with a great number of Rivers, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100819:82"/>
wonderfully enfertilize their Medows and
Pasturages, and all empty themselves into
the <hi>Szelinga;</hi> and would they but take the
pains to manure their Lands, they would
bear all sorts of Fruit.</p>
            <p>The Second <hi>Kan</hi> is call'd <hi>Octieroikan;</hi> and
the Third <hi>D'Ian-Gari;</hi> but in regard there
is no great Commerce driven with these
two last, they are nothing near so well
known as the former. The <hi>Monguls</hi> have a
great Antipathy against the <hi>Bogdoi,</hi> because
they made themselves Masters of <hi>China;</hi> but
they can do 'em no harm, because they are
not acquainted with the use of Fire-Arms.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Calmoucs</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Calmoucs.</note> possess all
that vast extent of Country
that lyes between <hi>Mongull</hi> and
the <hi>Volga</hi> as far as <hi>Astrakan,</hi> and they are

                  </gap>rdes,</hi>
which have every one their particular <hi>Kan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Principal of all these
<hi>Kans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Kan</hi> of the <hi>Calmoucs.</hi>
               </note> is he who is call'd <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiourtican,</hi>
who pretends to
be descended from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Tamerlain.</hi> He is very Potent, and
therefore forces the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and the <hi>Yous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becks</hi>
to pay him a certain Tribute, or else
he would be continually Harrassing their
Countries. 'Tis also reported that he is
very Magnificent, that he goes always clad
in White, and never eats but serv'd in Gold
Plate. We saw at <hi>Moscow</hi> a French Officer
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100819:83"/>
who had been in the Tent of this same <hi>Kan,</hi>
when he lay at <hi>Astrakan,</hi> at the Head of a
Hundred Thousand <hi>Tartars</hi> to demand his
Tribute, who confirm'd all that has been
said concerning his Magnificence, only that
he never saw him make use of either Gold
or Silver Plate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Calmoucs</hi> have no Cities nor fix'd
Habitations, but only live in Tents made
of Felts, which are very neat, and very
commodious; nor is there any Nation so
nimble at Camping and Decamping in an
instant as they, there being no Nation so
much accustom'd to it, in regard they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
stay long in a place, and are always ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Incursions.</p>
            <p>They are all Idolaters, as
well as the <hi>Mongulls,</hi> and all
the rest of the Nations of
<hi>Great Tartary</hi> as far as the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi>
and every one of these
Pagan Nations acknowledge for the Head
of their Religion the <hi>Dalaè-Lama,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Dalaè-lama</hi> Patriarch of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </note> or <hi>Lama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamalow,</hi>
except those of <hi>Bokara</hi> and <hi>Samar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kand,</hi>
who make Profession of <hi>Mahometism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Impostor has his Residence in the
Kingdom of <hi>Sanshut,</hi> which extends from
the <hi>Mongulls,</hi> the <hi>Calmoucs,</hi> and <hi>Turquestan,</hi>
between <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> to the <hi>Indies.</hi> The
Capital of his Territories is the City of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantola,</hi>
where there is a Temporal Prince
also call'd <hi>Deva;</hi> but the <hi>Dalaè</hi> lives in a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100819:83"/>
Fortress call'd <hi>Beatalaè,</hi> that stands very
near the same City. 'Tis not to be imagin'd
how he is in a manner worshipp'd over all
<hi>Tartary.</hi> They send from all parts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
his Benediction, and when he goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>China,</hi> he is receiv'd with more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Honours.</p>
            <p>The Jesuit <hi>Adam Schall</hi> us'd all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to disswade the Emperor from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to meet him, or to pay him any respect.
But the Emperor, as much convinc'd as he
was that the <hi>Dalaè</hi> was an Impostor, durst
not follow the Jesuit's Counsel, but after
he had heap'd upon him all imaginable Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Favours, sent him back loaden
with Magnificent Presents.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that the <hi>Dalaè</hi> never
dies,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tartars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Dalaè</hi> never dies.</note> but that he renews like
the Moon. To make this out,
so soon as the <hi>Dalaè</hi> lyes at
the point of Death, they that are about
him, make diligent search for a <hi>Lama,</hi> the
likest to him that possibly they can find, and
so soon as the Head of their False Religion
is dead, they set him up in his Room, and
carefully conceal the deceas'd Body, which
they affirm to be renew'd in his Successor.
<hi>M. Tavernier</hi> reports the same thing of the
King of <hi>Thebes;</hi> but there is some probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that he was misinform'd, he not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been upon the place, as the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:100819:84"/>
who make this Relation were, and who
drive a very considerable Trade with the
<hi>Tartars;</hi> from whom they learnt moreover,
that this <hi>Dalaè</hi> is never suffer'd to be seen
by any body, unless they are willing to pay
him all the Honours which they give him
themselves; prostrating themselves before
him, and adoring him as a God. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
adds, that the <hi>Chineses</hi> call the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
Totai,</hi> because they have not the Letter
<hi>R</hi> in their Language. Nor do I know why
we call 'em <hi>Tartars,</hi> seeing that in <hi>Poland,
Muscovy,</hi> and even in <hi>Tartary</hi> it self, they
abridge the Name, and call 'em only <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears by what I have
said of the Kingdom of <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chut,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Delaè-lama</hi> is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Presse-Jean.</hi>
               </note>
that the <hi>Dalaè-lama</hi> is
without all contradiction that
same Famous <hi>Preste-Iean,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
whom Historians have written so
variously. In a word, since that Title, and
whatever many Authors have said of him,
can be attributed to no Person more justly
then to this <hi>Dalaè-lama,</hi> 'tis more natural
to acknowledge him in this Country of
<hi>Asia,</hi> where he has always been, then to
seek him out in <hi>Habyssinia,</hi> where he never
was.</p>
            <p>'Tis also an understanding Observation
of <hi>F. Kirker,</hi> who in his Polite Piece, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Particulars of <hi>China,</hi> after he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100819:84"/>
the Manners and Customs of the
different people that encompass that wide
Empire, demonstrates the Ingenuity of the
<hi>Portugueses</hi> in the search which they have
made after this so extraordinary Prince, and
so well known in the world under the
Name of <hi>Preste-Iean,</hi> of whom they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
so many particular things.</p>
            <p>To clear this part of History which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
perplex'd, and at the same time
to undeceive those who may have suffer'd
themselves to be prepossess'd by all those
fabulous Tales that have been utter'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
as real Truths, they are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that while the <hi>Portugueses</hi> were in
search of the <hi>East-Indies, Iohn</hi> the Second
sent one of his Subjects, by Name <hi>Peter de
Coulan,</hi> to discover 'em by Land, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
charg'd him to inform himself where
that same <hi>Preste-Iohn,</hi> so much talk'd of in
<hi>Europe</hi> reign'd, yet not knowing in what
part of the World his Empire lay.</p>
            <p>The design of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Second was to
have made an alliance with him, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as he was, and according as he had
heard it reported, that he was a potent
Prince, and profess'd the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In obedience to his Princes Orders <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
de Coulan</hi> pass'd into <hi>Asia,</hi> and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a great way into <hi>India,</hi> where he learnt
many things of great importance and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity:
But notwithstand all his diligence,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100819:85"/>
he could not hear of <hi>Preste-Iohn,</hi> nor meet
with any body that could tell any Tidings
of him; only coming to <hi>Caire,</hi> in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
homeward, he heard, that in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi>
beyond <hi>Egypt,</hi> there reign'd a Rich and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Prince. Who every time he shew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in publick, had a Cross carry'd before
him, and that he was a declar'd Protector
of the Christians.</p>
            <p>Now in regard these Marks agreed with
the Character that had been given him, to
discover the Prince he was in search of,
there needed no more to perswade that
Traveller into a belief of what he most of
all things in the world desir'd to know. So
that he made no farther doubt but that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste-Iohn</hi>
was that same Monarch of the <hi>Abys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins,</hi>
and he believ'd it so truly, that
he wrote his Discovery into <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
without any farther Examination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Nor were they more scrupulous at
<hi>Lisbonne,</hi> where the news was receiv'd with
a great deal of joy and applause. Upon
which they who sail'd into <hi>Africa</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
years, prepossess'd with this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
contributed not a little to confirm it
by their Relations; so that as false as it
was, the Mistake was soon spread all over
<hi>Europe.</hi>

            <p>Now though this same stupid Error was
refuted by several learned persons, and tho
the falshood of it might be easily discover'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100819:85"/>
by what <hi>Damian de Goez, Nicolas Godigno</hi>
and <hi>Baltazar Tellez</hi> have written of it, as
being perfectly inform'd of every thing that
concern'd <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> where they had been
long resident, yet I cannot forbear to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
with <hi>F. Kirker,</hi> that the <hi>Latin</hi>
Chronology of the Kings of <hi>Habyssinia</hi>
makes no mention of <hi>Preste-Iohn;</hi> and
therefore all the Authors of any Antiquity
that have taken occasion to mention him,
still place him in <hi>Asia,</hi> tho they cannot agree
in what part of the World he reign'd, no
more then they can about the original of his
Name.</p>
            <p>A Modern Author imagins <hi>Preste-Iohn</hi>
to be a Corruption of <hi>Preste-Arkan,</hi> that is
to say, <hi>King of the Adorers.</hi> Others with as
little reason derive it from the <hi>Latin, Pretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Iahannes.</hi> Some would have it to be,
that as the Name of <hi>Caesar</hi> was common to
all the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, so <hi>Iohn</hi> was no
less common to these Princes we speak of;
and that they bore that Name in honour of
the Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> to which the <hi>Eastern</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
afterwards added the Title of <hi>Priest,</hi> or
<hi>Preste;</hi> not that these Kings were really dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifi'd
with the Sacerdotal Character, but
because they had usually a Cross carry'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'em, as Protectors of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Conjecture seems to me
more probable then all the rest, where he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100819:86"/>
says, That <hi>Preste-Iean</hi> was a corruption of
the <hi>Persian</hi> Word <hi>Prestegiani,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>Apostolic;</hi> that it was very likely that
the <hi>Europaeans</hi> who traffick'd into the <hi>East,</hi>
having heard confusedly of that Prince,
whom they heard frequently call'd <hi>Padischah
Prestegiani,</hi> gave him by chance the Name of
<hi>Preste-Iean,</hi> which sounded very like to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stegiani,</hi>
of which they understood not the
real signification.</p>
            <p>As to the part of <hi>Asia,</hi> where <hi>Preste-Iean</hi>
reign'd, methinks there is no reason to
doubt of it, considering what the Ancient
Authors have written. For upon a strict
examination it will be found, that the
greatest part of these Authors place him in
that vast Country which extends it self from
the <hi>Mogul,</hi> towards the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>North</hi> as
far as <hi>China:</hi> Which is that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which St. <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
sufficiently makes appear in the Third
Tome of his History, where speaking of the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> he observes that their Emperor sent
a puissant Army under the command of his
Son, to subdue those people that inhabited
the lesser <hi>India;</hi> which Conquest being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd,
the victorious <hi>Tartars</hi> advanc'd
against the Christians who inhabited the
Greater, or the Upper <hi>India;</hi> but that their
King call'd <hi>Preste-Iean</hi> by the Vulgar, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
drawn his Forces together, march'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
'em, and overthrew 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:100819:86"/>
This is also that which <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Venetian,</hi>
who knew the Country better then any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
tells us more distinctly, as having resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
several years at the Court of the Great
<hi>Kan</hi> of the <hi>Tartars:</hi> For the Kingdom of
<hi>Tenduc,</hi> or as others read it, <hi>Tanchut,</hi> this
Kingdom, I say, where <hi>Marcus Paulus</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>Preste-Iohn,</hi> is still in being, if we may
believe those who have travell'd through it,
and lies between <hi>China</hi> and the Empire of
the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> Which perfectly agrees
with the Sentiments of those who have
made <hi>Preste-Iohn</hi> to reign in <hi>Kitay;</hi> seeing
that as I have already observ'd, it is not to
be thought that by <hi>Kitay</hi> the Ancients
meant <hi>China</hi> only, or some particular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
it being sufficiently probable that they
comprehend under that name all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
that lies between <hi>Obi,</hi> the <hi>Volga,</hi> and
<hi>China,</hi> as the <hi>Muscovites</hi> understand it at this
day.</p>
            <p>The only thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that seems to raise some
doubt in what we have said concerning <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste-Iohn</hi>
is this; that <hi>Preste-Iohn</hi> and the
people under his subjection were Christians,
whereas the Country that lies between the
<hi>Mogul</hi> and <hi>China</hi> is now full of <hi>Mahometans</hi>
and Idolaters. But certain it is that things
were not always in the same posture as now
they are, but that the Christian Religion
once flourish'd in these barbarous Countries,
where now Infidelity prevails.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:100819:87"/>
'Tis known that St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> after the
Apostles had made a division of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
among themselves, departed from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
to cultivate those Unbelievers; that he
penetrated into the most remote parts of it,
and dy'd at length at <hi>Meliapor.</hi> And some
Authors have written, not without some
probability, that <hi>China</hi> it self receiv'd the
Gospel by the Ministry of that Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
However it were, there is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be made, in my Opinion, but that the
Faith might be dispers'd in Countries
more on this hand toward the <hi>West,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
there is a Country which the <hi>Moors,</hi>
profess'd Enemies of the Christians, still in
derision call <hi>Kiaferstan,</hi> or the Country
of the Infidels, the Inhabitants of which
are call'd Christians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to this
day; who tho they have forgot their Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Christianity, yet still retain certain Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
that sufficiently demonstrate what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
their Ancestors profess'd. For beside
that they baptize their Children, they have
painted in their Churches, and beare upon
their Foreheads three Crosses of a Red
Colour, being a Tincture squees'd out of
<hi>Sanders-Wood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho it might be true, that presently
after the Birth of Christ, the Gospel might
not be promulgated in these Barbarous
Countries, yet certain it is that it was
preach'd there in the succeeding Ages. The
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100819:87"/>
celebrated Monument that was found in
<hi>China</hi> in 1625. near the City of <hi>Siganfu,</hi> is
an invincible proof of what I say. For it
is observ'd, that Six hunder'd years after
Christ, the <hi>Syrian</hi> Priests having scatter'd
themselves all over <hi>Asia,</hi> had divulg'd the
Christian Law in the Extremities of the
World, where their Zeal for the Glory of
God drew 'em. And <hi>Hay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Author, who was of the Blood Royal of
the Kings of <hi>Armenia,</hi> testifies, That in the
Thirteenth Age, <hi>Tartary</hi> was full of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
that <hi>Cublai</hi> their Emperor embrac'd
the Christian Faith; and that his Brother
who had been a Christian for some time,
enter'd into a Religious War for the sake of
Religion, against the <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> won
<hi>Palestine</hi> from the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> reinthron'd
the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> being expell'd his
Territories by those cruel Enemies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
restor'd to peaceful freedom those
people whom the Infidels had proscrib'd
and banish'd, and rebuilt a great number of
Churches at his ow costs and charges; and
all this at the sollicitation of the Princess
his Wife, who glory'd in being descended
from one of the Three Kings that came
to adore Christ, when but newly born.</p>
            <p>This was the same <hi>Hae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on,</hi> who wrote to
St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> when he lay in <hi>Cyprus</hi> at the time
of his first Expedition for the recovery of
the Holy Land. St. <hi>Antonin</hi> also, in whose
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100819:88"/>
History may be seen that Letter of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
Prince, observes that St. <hi>Lewis</hi> sent him,
under the Character of Ambassadors, two

very rich Presents, among which was a
piece of the true Cross, and a Canopy of
State of an extraordinary value, upon
which were embroider'd in Gold, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Mysteries of the Life of Christ.</p>
            <p>This happen'd in the year 1256. and
about forty or fifty years after, that is to
say, toward the beginning of the fourteenth
Age, several <hi>Franeiscan</hi> Monks being sent to

Kingdom of <hi>Thibet,</hi> which is next to that
of <hi>Tanchut,</hi> and converted a great number

reports that the people had still an Idea of
the Christian Mysteries, tho confus'd and
corrupted; that they us'd among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a sort of Confessiion, feeble Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Faith which they had formerly
embrac'd, and which by degrees was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extinguish'd.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt then, after what has
been said, but that the Kingdom of <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chut,</hi>
not having been always Idolatrous as
now it is, the <hi>Delaè-Lama</hi> who at present
resides there, may be the true Successor of
the famous <hi>Preste-Iohn,</hi> who reign'd there
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100819:88"/>
formerly; and it is no less probable, that
that same Monarch happening to change
as the Religion corrupted, became sometime
after Head of a new Religion which dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
at last into Idolatry.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that he is not a Temporal
Prince; but that may be the effect of the
Wars and Revolutions that happen in all
Kingdoms. However it were, he is still in
high veneration among all the <hi>Eastern</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who acknowledge him for the Head of
their Religion. And that which is farther
remarkable is this, that he bears the Name
of <hi>Lama,</hi> which in the <hi>Tartar</hi> Language sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
a Cross: And the <hi>Bogdoi,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
<hi>China</hi> in 1644. and who are subject
to the <hi>Dalaè</hi> in all matters of Religion,
wear always Crosses about 'em, which they
call <hi>Lama</hi>'s also, and for which they have
an extraordinary Respect, which sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonstrates that they were formerly
instructed in those Mysteries, of which that
sign is in some measure an eternal Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</p>
            <p>Besides these different sorts
of <hi>Tartars,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Other <hi>Tartar</hi> People.</note> of which I have
spok'n, there are others who
are called <hi>Ostiaki, Bratski, Iacuti,</hi> and <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusi,</hi>
who are scatter'd all along the Lakes
and Rivers that lye between <hi>Siberia</hi> and
the Country of the <hi>Monguls.</hi> But in regard
they have all the same Physiognomy, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100819:89"/>
use the same Language as the <hi>Calmoucs,</hi> 'tis
very probable that they are only some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
<hi>Hordes,</hi> that having been domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by degrees, by conversation with the
<hi>Muscovites,</hi> at length became subject to
their Dominion. They are all swarthy
complexion'd, but more inclining to Olive-Colour
then Black. Their faces are usually
broad, falling in below, and jutting out
above; their eyes are small, but sparkling
and full of fire; their noses short and very
flat, with little hair either upon their upper
Lips, or Chins: Their Stature somewhat
above the common size, well set, and clean
limb'd, with an Air stern and resolute,
without any thing of Cruelty or Savageness.
Their Habits are for the most part all alike,
consisting of several Sheep-skins sow'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which they fit to their bodies in
the form of Vests, and gird about their
Wastes with a Cord, wherein hangs their
Bow and Quiver, with which they go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
arm'd. They shave their Heads to
the very Crown, where they preserve a
Tuft thick enough to make a double lock,
one of which hangs down before, the
other behind; having no other covering for
their heads, then a round Bonnet of the
same with their Habits, on the top of which
they wear a Tuft of Red Silk, or of some
other Colour: Which is the mark by which
you may distinguish the different <hi>Hordes;</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:100819:89"/>
every one having a particular Colour to
difference the one from the other. But they
that live in the Places where the <hi>Martins</hi>
are taken, make themselves Garments of
those Furs, as also of Dogs-skins, of which
they keep a vast number; and sometimes
they join both together, and make the one
serve for a Lining to the t'other, wearing
the Sables, tho the richer and more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
innermost, and the Dogs-hair outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most;
not believing it just, that the Dog
who stops and catches the Martin, should
be debas'd below the Martin, but that he
should be always preferr'd after his death
before his Enemy, which he vanquish'd
when alive.</p>
            <p>It may be easily judg'd by the Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which I have made of the different
sorts of <hi>Tartars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which inhabit all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
that lies between the <hi>Obi</hi> and <hi>China,</hi>
that the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> being assisted by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saques,</hi>
found no great difficulty in opening
a way from <hi>Siberia</hi> to this great Empire.
For in regard they met with no body that
would, or was able to dispute the Passage
with 'em; and moreover, for that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which they had subdu'd either by
mildness, or by force of Arms, had some
kind of Correspondence with all the <hi>Hordes</hi>
that are dispread on both sides, by their
means they have made all their Discoveries,
and at length have advanc'd by different
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100819:90"/>
Roads to the very Confines of <hi>China,</hi> where
they have also built some Fortresses, the
better to secure their Conquests.</p>
            <p>The farthermost of all
these Fortresses is <hi>Albazin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Albazin</hi> three weeks journey from <hi>Pekin</hi>

the present War between the <hi>Chineses</hi> and

other claim'd a Right to fish for the Pearls,
of which that River produces great store;
and hunt the Martins, that are very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in an Island of that River.</p>
            <p>But in regard of the vast distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that Frontier and <hi>Moscow,</hi> will not
permit the <hi>Muscovites</hi> to send Recruits suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
considerable to support a War,
which the nearness of it to <hi>China,</hi> renders
easie to the <hi>Tartars</hi> who are Masters of it,
the <hi>Czars</hi> thought it more expedient to
propound an Accommodation, then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an Army to all the Hazards and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
which of necessity they must undergo,
before they can get to the Confines of the
Empire. Nor did the <hi>Chineses</hi> refuse the
Proposals that were made 'em. They sent
an Ambassador a good way beyond the
Great Wall that separates their Territories
from the <hi>Western Tartars,</hi> and join'd two
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100819:90"/>
               <hi>French</hi> Jesuits with him, of the number of
those whom the K. of <hi>France</hi> sent about six
years ago to the extreme parts of the world,
to serve the Ambassadors as his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
but as yet we know not the success
of the Negotiation.</p>
            <p>If we may judg by a Letter which a
<hi>German</hi> Officer who was then in Garison in
a place upon the River <hi>Yamour,</hi> wrote to
one of his Friends at <hi>Moscow,</hi> who impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to us, 'tis very probable, that those
Affairs are more embroil'd then ever. But
in regard that Letter is before the last En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of the <hi>Muscovites</hi> to obtain a
Peace, and for that their Ambassador was
not then arriv'd at the appointed place of
meeting, there is little heed to be given to
what that Officer then wrote: however, it
gives us a good account how affairs stood
about four years ago. <q>We thought, <hi>said
he,</hi> that the Ambassador sent from <hi>Peking</hi>
some days since, was come with a design
to conclude a Peace with us: But we have
been surpriz'd at the Proceedings of that
Ambassador, who after he had stopt three
days near <hi>Albazin,</hi> without proposing any
thing, retir'd of a sudden. We make no
question therefore, that being arriv'd upon
the Frontiers with a great army, but that
the War will be soon rekindl'd, and prove
more bloody then before; so that we
stand very strictly upon our Guards, <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>But whatever may be the Issue of the
War, we may assure our selves by what I
have said, That the Road from <hi>Muscovy</hi> to
<hi>Chinae,</hi> is no <hi>Chimera</hi> nor impracticable
thing; and that it would be likewise the
most commodious and shortest way, were
there but never so little reliance upon the
<hi>Muscovi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es,</hi> who after several Journeys have
made themselves such absolute Masters of
all the Roads that lead thither, that they
take indifferently sometimes one and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another, according as their occasions
prompt 'em.</p>
            <p>I know, they did not presently accomplish
their design, and that it cost 'em a world
of Trials and Experiments, before they
could find out all the means to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others in their passage; but in
regard they spar'd for nothing to bring
about this Discovery, and that they have
been careful from time to time to send away
Supplies of Hunters to view and take an
account of Countries through which they
thought new ways might be open'd, they
have so levell'd and remov'd all Difficulties,
that they make no more of going to <hi>China,</hi>
then of travelling to <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strakan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Reflection, which some perhaps
would not vouchsafe themselves the leisure
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100819:91"/>
perhaps to make, when they imagin'd the
way from <hi>Moscow</hi> to <hi>Peking</hi> neither safe nor
easie, may serve to adjust and reconcile the
several Ruttiers or Cards that have been
drawn these several years ago; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
at the same time, after what manner
divers Ambassadors sent from one Court to
another, came to spend some more time
then others, in this Journey, which some
have finish'd in four or five months,
while it has cost others near eighteen.</p>
            <p>In short, The principal aim of the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
in these sorts of Ambassies having
always been to discover the vast extent of
Land that lies between their Territories and
the Empire of <hi>China,</hi> 'tis no wonder, if
they who were entrusted with this affair,
travelling as they did like true Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
rather then sedulous Ambassadors,
have shew'd less earnestness to arrive with
speed at their journey's end, then to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the nature of the Countrey through
which they travell'd, and the course of the
Rivers which they met with upon the
Road.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be thought, that 'twas in this
manner that the <hi>Knez Theodore Iacowitz

should make him turn out of the way so
much to the right hand, had he not had
private Orders rather to mind looking
after the Establishments all along the River,
then to treat with the <hi>Chineses,</hi> for whom
the <hi>Muscovites</hi> had little or no esteem at that
time.</p>
            <p>However it were, the Merchants who

to join the Caravans at <hi>Zobalsk,</hi> from
whence they duly set out every year.</p>
            <p>After all these convincing Proofs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations,
upon which I thought my
self bound to insist thus particularly as I
have done, I make no question but the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will abandon all the false Idea's which
he had conceiv'd touching the distance of
<hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ope</hi> from <hi>China,</hi> and suffer himself to be
convinc'd, that of all the ways that lead to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100819:92"/>
that flourishing Empire, that which the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
make choice of now-a days, is both
the safest and the shortest.</p>
            <p>But besides these Advantages, which
are not a little to be consider'd, the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of carriage contributes very much
to mitigate the Fatigues inseparable from
these sorts of Journeys. Usually you set
forward from <hi>Moscow</hi> toward the end of
<hi>February;</hi> and in regard the Snow by that
time is become more beaten and solid, by
reason of the great number of Sledds that
pass continually to and fro at that time, far
more then at the beginning of the Winter,
Travellers in less then three Weeks get to
the Capital City of <hi>Siberia,</hi> tho it be eight
hunder'd <hi>Wersts,</hi> or three hunder'd and fifty
<hi>French</hi> Leagues off.</p>
            <p>There they stay some time for the thaw,
to take the <hi>Sudais,</hi> or Vessel which carries
'em by Water in the Rivers which they
meet with on this side, and beyond the <hi>Obi;</hi>
which thaw if it happens later then usually,
then they continue their Journey by Land
till they come to a <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rde</hi> of <hi>Tartars,</hi> who
are call'd <hi>Ostiaki,</hi> and are subject to the
<hi>Muscovites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There they change their manner of carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and take a new sort of carriage much
more nimble and commodious then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
which are sent back to <hi>Tobelsk:</hi> For
whereas the Sledds made use of by the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:100819:93"/>
are always drawn by one Horse,
whose keeping is somewhat troublesome
and chargeable, to the other Sledd they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fasten a <hi>Reine Deer,</hi> such as the <hi>Samoedes</hi>
make use of in their Winter-Travels; and
to make 'em go more swift, they tie a great
Dog behind, that scaring the poor Beast
with his barking, sets her a running with
that speed, as to draw her Burthen no less
then forty Leagues a day.</p>
            <p>But that which is more
wonderful as to these sort of
Sledds,<note place="margin">Sledds that Sail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Land with the Wind.</note> they are also dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
along by the Wind some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
over the Land cover'd with Snow,
sometimes over the Ice of frozen Rivers, as
our Vessels, that sail upon the Sea. For
in regard the Country beyond <hi>Siberia</hi> is
open and extreamly level as far as Mount
<hi>Gaucasus,</hi> the people who inhabit it making
use of this advantage to spare their Beasts,
have so order'd their Sledds, as either to
be drawn along by the <hi>Reine-Deer,</hi> or else
to carry Sails, when the Wind favours
'em.</p>
            <p>This manner of Carriage is so much the
more commodious, in regard you meet
with no interruption in your Travels. For
as in a Barque you have recourse to Oares,
when the Wind slack'ns, or proves contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
so the Deer and the Dog labour when
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100819:93"/>
the Air is calm, but are put into the Sledd
when the Wind serves to drive it along.</p>
            <p>Thus, so long as the Ice continues to
bear, you come to the River <hi>Genessai,</hi> where
the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have built a City of the same
Name for the convenience of Travellers;
and there it is that you take Boat to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
the two great Rivers <hi>Tongusi,</hi> and
<hi>Augara,</hi> which rise out of the
Lake of <hi>Baikala,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Lake of <hi>Baikala.</hi>
               </note> and which
are commonly allow'd to be
<hi>500 Wersts</hi> in length, and
forty broad. 'Tis said, that the Water of
this Lake is extraordinary clear; and that
notwithstanding the depth of it, you may
clearly discern the colour of the Stones that
lie at the bottom.</p>
            <p>It is encompass'd with several high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
where the Snow lies all the Summer
long, as well as in the midst of <hi>Winter.</hi> And
doubtless this it is that constrains Travellers
to spend many times seven or eight days in
crossing it, tho it be not above eight Leagues
over. For this Lake being, as it naturally
ought to be, the general Rendezvouz
of various Winds that blow through the
hideous Rocks with which it is environ'd,
'tis to be thought that when they happen
to blow from several points at the same
time, they must put the Vessels which they
meet, to a great deal of trouble, and that
it requires and extraordinary forefight, or
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100819:94"/>
good luck, to prevent a stop for some
time.</p>
            <p>After you have quitted this Lake, if you
please you may enter into a River call'd <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
and then going still by Water, you
meet about fifty Leagues from the mouth
of it, with a City of the same Name, which
the <hi>Muscovites</hi> built to facilitate the passage
of their Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vans: or if you rather chuse to
land immediately after you have cross'd the
Lake, then you find your self among the
<hi>Monguls</hi> that lie to the <hi>South,</hi> of whom you
buy Mules and Dromedaries to continue
your Journey to the first City of <hi>China,</hi> to
which you come after fifteen days tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</p>
            <p>After this manner the most part of the
<hi>Muscovite</hi> Merchants travel, that traffick
with the <hi>Chineses.</hi> By which 'tis plain, that
all the Countries that were formerly but
confusedly known under the Name of the
Grand <hi>Tartary,</hi> are neither so desert, nor so
untill'd, as people to this day imagine; and
that the not taking the benefit that might
have been taken by a narrower search, has
been a considerable loss; those Countries
being water'd with a great many fair Rivers,
and furnish'd with so many valuable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
as are daily discover'd.</p>
            <p>Not to speak of Rubarb, Azure-stone,
and Castors, which are very plentiful among
the <hi>Yousbecks</hi> and <hi>Monguls;</hi> the Sables and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100819:94"/>
Black-Foxes that are taken all along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of <hi>Obi, Tongusi,</hi> and <hi>Angara;</hi> the Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seng-Roots,
the Pearls and Badian which
the River <hi>Yamour-</hi> affords, the Silver and
Lead-Mines near <hi>Argus,</hi> the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have
found out, more especially in the Lands that
advance more to the <hi>North,</hi> several other
Rarities, wherein they drive a considerable
Trade.</p>
            <p>Besides Furs of all sorts, which they fetch
from all Quarters, and of which the sale is
so great, that the City of <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

every year to the Grand Duke's Treasury
fourscore thousand Roubles custom, which
amounts to near Sixscore thousand Crowns
of <hi>French</hi> Money; they have discover'd a sort
of Ivory, which is whiter and smother then
that which comes from the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that they have any
Elephants that furnish 'em
with this Commodity (for
the <hi>Northern</hi> Countries are too
cold for those sort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that naturally love heat) but other
Amphibious Animals,<note place="margin">The <hi>Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi> furnishes the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> with <hi>Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </note> which they call by
the Name of <hi>Behemot,</hi> which are usually
found in the River <hi>Lena,</hi> or upon the
Shores of the <hi>Tartarian-Sea.</hi> Several teeth
of this Monster were shewn us at <hi>Moskow,</hi>
which were ten Inches long, and two in
Diameter at the Root: Nor are the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
Teeth comparable to 'em, either for
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100819:95"/>
beauty or whiteness, besides that they
have a peculiar property to stanch Blood,
being carried about a person subject to
bleeding. The <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> who buy
'em up, put a high value upon 'em, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a Scimiter or a Dagger Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t of this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ivory before a handle of Massy Gold
or Silver.</p>
            <p>But certainly no body better understands
the price of this Ivory, then they who first
brought it into request; considering how
they venture their Lives in attacking the
Creature that produces it, which is as big
and as dangerous as a Crocodile.</p>
            <p>They were beholding for
the discovery of this to the
Inhabitants of a certain Island,<note place="margin">The first Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that peopl'd <hi>America</hi> came out of <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </note>
out of which, if the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
are to be believ'd, issu'd
the first Colonies that ever
peopl'd <hi>America.</hi> And thus much we learnt
upon this subject from the Vayvode of
<hi>Smolensko,</hi> whose Name was <hi>Mouchim Pouck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi>
a person of as great a wit as a man
can well meet with, and perfectly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with all the Countries that lie beyond
the <hi>Obi,</hi> as having been a long time Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of the Chancery of the Government of
<hi>Siberia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he had ask'd us in a Discourse
which we had with him, in what manner
we thought that <hi>America</hi> came to be first
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100819:95"/>
peopl'd, upon the general Answer which
we gave him, grounded upon the common
Opinion; he gave us to understand that he
had a Conjecture more probable then any of
ours.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There is, said he, beyond the <hi>Obi,</hi> a
great River call'd <hi>Kawoina,</hi> into which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
River empties it self, by the Name
of <hi>Lena.</hi> At the mouth of the first River
that discharges it self into the Frozen-Sea,
stands a spacious Island very well peopl'd,
and which is no less considerable for hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Behemot,</hi> an amphibious Animal,
whose Teeth are in great esteem. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
go frequently upon the side of the
frozen Sea to hunt this Monster; and because
it requires great labour and assiduity, they
carry their Families usually along with
'em. Now it many times happens, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
surpriz'd by a Thaw, they are carry'd
away I know not whither upon huge pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Ice that break off one from another.
For my part, added he, I am perswaded
that several of those Hunters have been
carry'd upon these floating pieces of Ice to
the most <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>America,</hi> which
is not far off from that part of <hi>Asia</hi> which
juts out into the Sea of <hi>Tartary.</hi> And that
which confirms me in this Opinion is this,
That the <hi>Americans</hi> who inhabit that
Country which advances farthest toward
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100819:96"/>
that Sea, have the same Physiognomy as
those unfortunate Islanders, whom the
over-eager Thirst after Gain exposes in
that manner to be Transported into a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Climate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We might add to what the <hi>Vaivode</hi> told
us, that there are also in that part of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
several of those Creatures that are so
common in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> more especially <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
which might have been Transported
thither after the same manner. And this
Conjecture seem'd to me to be so much the
better grounded, in that it is frequently to
be seen in <hi>Poland,</hi> that such great pieces of
Ice keep whole and entire, from <hi>Warsaw,</hi>
till they come to fall a great way into the
<hi>Baltic</hi> Sea. But it would be requisite, for
the better confirmation and assurance of
a matter of this importance, to be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of the Language of those People
that so nearly resemble the Islanders in Face
and Body; for if there were any thing of
Affinity between their Languages, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
there should no farther question be
made of the Conjecture.</p>
            <p>We might have learnt many other Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of this <hi>Vaivode,</hi> who without doubt
is the most Accomplish'd Person in all <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
but that we were afraid of awaking
his jealousie by multiplicity of Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
And besides, we observ'd by some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100819:96"/>
which he made us, that he was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of creating himself trouble at Court,
where his extraordinary Merit had already
rais'd him many Enemies, and therefore we
forbore to press him any farther.</p>
            <p>Some People perhaps may wonder, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the great numbers of Rivers which
come from <hi>China,</hi> that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> take
no more benefit of the advantages that seem
to offer themselves for setling a more safe
and easie Trade then that by Land with the
<hi>Chineses</hi> and <hi>Iapanners;</hi> but in my opinion
they ought not to be blam'd for preferring
the course they take before any other. For
beside that they have but very little Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in Sea Affairs, they have met with
Obstacles never to be surmounted in those
Rivers, whose Names are hardly known in
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make out this yet more apparent,
you must know, that there are in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
that lyes beyond <hi>Siberia,</hi> four principal
Rivers that fall into the Frozen Sea, or the
Sea of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and into the Sea of <hi>Iapon;</hi>
not to speak of an infinite number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that discharge themselves into the
latter, as may be seen in the Map of <hi>Siberia,</hi>
which is a faithful Copy of that which is
preserv'd in the Chancery of <hi>Moscow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most Westerly of all these Rivers is
<hi>Obi,</hi> after which as you Travel to the East
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100819:97"/>
you meet successively with <hi>Genessai, Lena</hi>
and <hi>Yamour.</hi> But as considerable as they are
either for the abundance of Water, or the
extent of their course, there are so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
to surmount, if you go by
Water, and so many hazards to undergo
at the mouths of every one, that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
always rather chuse to Travel by
Land into <hi>China</hi> then to go by Sea.</p>
            <p>For to speak something in
particular of every one of
these Rivers;<note place="margin">The Mouth of the <hi>Obi</hi> dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> the <hi>Obi</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
dangerous at the
mouth of it, by reason of the horrid heaps
of Ice with which it is pester'd almost all
the year long; and the <hi>Muscovites</hi> still bear
in mind the misfortune of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi>
who by reason of their being engag'd too
far in the Frozen Sea lost several of their
Ships toward <hi>Nova Zembla.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The River of <hi>Genessai,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the inconvenience which
is common to it with the <hi>Obi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Genessai</hi> no less inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</note>
has one particular, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in Nine Water-falls, which the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
call <hi>Poroki,</hi> or <hi>Poroges,</hi> and are distant
several Leagues one from another; and
therefore because there would be a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of unlading the Vessel as many times as
there are Water-falls to pass, the Merchants
have reason sufficient to avoid all that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100819:97"/>
and take a more convenient Road.</p>
            <p>'Tis true the course of the River <hi>Lena</hi> is
more uniform, but the mouth of it is no
less difficult and dangerous to pass then that
of the <hi>Obi;</hi> for though it be not so much
pester'd with Ice, yet the great number of
Rocks and Shelves will afford no safety for
Vessels of very small Burthen; only some
flat-bottom'd <hi>Gondola</hi>'s will venture to pick
up certain black and white Fish which they
find among the Rocks, and make use of
for several occasions.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Yamour,</hi> which is the most Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly
of all, and falls into the Sea of <hi>Iapon,</hi>
though it have none of those annoyances,
that render the other Rivers unpassable,
yet in that part where it mixes with the
Sea', there grows such a prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Sea-Bulrushes, that you would take
the mouth of it for a real Forest. An Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle,
that might perhaps be remov'd were
the Rushes like those, which commonly
grow in our Rivers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the People have
assur'd me, that they are of such an exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
bigness, that a man can hardly grasp
one of 'em with both his Arms; by which
you may guess that it would be as great a
labour to clear that passage, as to cut down
and grub-up a whole Forest.</p>
            <p>However these Rivers, notwithstanding
they are so full of Obstacles and Difficulties,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100819:98"/>
yet are of great use to the <hi>Muscovites</hi> for the
more commodious crossing those vast Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
that lye between <hi>Siberia</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of <hi>China:</hi> For besides that they Travel
more easily over 'em, when they are Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
then they can by Land, where the
Roads can never be so level, they are much
more conveniently Navigable toward their
Sources, then toward the end of their
Courses. And though you may meet with
some Falls of Water in rowing upward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Stream, yet they are neither so
deep nor so dangerous as those that are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the mouths of the Rivers.</p>
            <p>But that which is more remarkable
where these Water-falls are, is this, that all
the circumjacent Air seems to be as it were
Embalm'd, casting forth such a pleasing
Fragrancy round about, as if the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Persumes had spread themselves over
all the adjoining Fields. If what those
Travellers assure us, from whom we learnt
these particulars, be true, 'tis no difficult
thing to unfold this Riddle. For they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that on the tops of those Rocks that
cause these Water-falls, there grow most
Odoriferous Flowers, and those in great
abundance. To which may be added, that
as ordinary Perfumes never diffuse their
Odours more powerfully then-when they
are frotted, or held to the Fire, so the Air
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100819:98"/>
being thus persum'd, diffuses a stronger
scent, being agitated and heated by the
motion of the Water precipitating with such
a rapidness, then that which exhales in places
where there is nothing but an undisturb'd
and quiet calm.</p>
            <p>Here it is that I ought to say something
of <hi>Siberia,</hi> had I any thing particular to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
concerning it; but there is nothing
remarkable that distinguishes it from the
rest of the Provinces of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> unless it
be the excessive Cold it is subject to, by
reason of the extraordinary elevation of it.
Moreover, as I have sufficiently observ'd how
the <hi>Muscovites</hi> won it from the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> I
have nothing more to add to what I have
said, but that any man may be easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
by the multitude of Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
that are in it, that that same Province
of <hi>Muscovy</hi> is not so wild nor so desert as it is
commonly thought to be.</p>
            <p>Moreover, what I have hitherto discours'd
concerning the different Roads that lead
to <hi>China,</hi> and the various Countries through
which a Traveller must pass in his way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are sufficient, if I am not mistak'n,
to give the Reader at least some Idea of the
greater <hi>Tartary,</hi> so little known to this
day, and concerning which no man dares
over-curiously inform himself in <hi>Muscovy</hi>
for fear of giving a Jealousie to that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100819:99"/>
on, the most distrustful and suspicious of
any other perhaps in the World; so that
we were forc'd to observe our measures to
discover that little which I have made known.
And 'tis very probable, that, had we come to
<hi>Moscow</hi> in a Conjuncture less favourable, we
had not learn'd so much. But in regard the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> werethen designing to send an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
into <hi>France,</hi> to sollicite the King to
enter into the League, which they were then
about to conclude with <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi>
against the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, we gave our
selves a little more liberty to obtain those
Informations we desir'd, then at another
time we durst have done.</p>
            <p>But as the Embassy encourag'd us to be
less reserv'd in our inquisitiveness, so the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> made use of it as a reason and
pretence to refuse the Passage we had been
requesting ever since we arriv'd at <hi>Moskow.</hi>
However, that their Ambassador might
be the better receiv'd in <hi>France,</hi> they made
it their study to find a fair pretence to be
civilly rid of us, and at the same time to
engage us to return back into <hi>France,</hi> there
to represent the advantages that might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue
to our Nation by a free Passage through
<hi>Siberia.</hi> Nor was it long before they met
with one to their wish. For having learn'd
by the Commissioners who examin'd us,
according to custom, that we were come
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100819:99"/>
out of <hi>Persia</hi> into <hi>Muscovy</hi> without any Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Recommendation, nor indeed
without any Passports; they told us, That
since they could not have any assurance in
us, in regard we had no Authentick
Testimonials, 'twas a great trouble to 'em,
that they were forc'd to refuse us, what
they plainly saw we requested only out of
our Zeal for the Glory of God, and the
Salvation of Souls; that they were deeply
sensible of all the Hardships we had endur'd
in so tedious a Journey, upon no other
motive then that of the Conversion of the
<hi>Chineses:</hi> But in regard they were oblig'd
by the Maxims of their State, not to grant
free Passage through their Territories, but
to Persons that they knew, we were not to
think it strange that they requir'd some As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances
from us before they allow'd us
that Permission.</p>
            <p>They added, to mitigate the extremity
of our sorrow occasion'd by this denyal,
that we had a fair opportunity to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France,</hi> for that they were just a sending
thither one of the Principal Lords of the
Court; and therefore if we would take
the advantage of going along with him,
he should make it his business when we
came home, to joyn with us, in order to
the procuring from our King such Passports
and Recommendations as were necessary
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100819:100"/>
for the success of our Enterprize.</p>
            <p>How much in vain soever we knew it to
be to signify the least reluctancy to their
complemental Proposal, we ceas'd not
however to press 'em with all the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
imaginable, not to expose us to so many
delays, and consequently to those great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
which they might so easily spare us;
that since they were convinc'd of the Kings
sincere Zeal for the Service of God, they
had no reason to question but that they
would do him a most acceptable kindness,
in facilitating the means for us to go and
Preach the Gospel in the remote extremities
of the Earth.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all this, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a precise Order to be gone, which
Prince <hi>Gallichin</hi> also imparted to us in the
<hi>Czar</hi>'s Name, there was no farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending;
we must resolve to depart, and
prepare our selves for a Voyage quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from what we had design'd some
years before. Nevertheless, we would not
Embark in company with their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor:
For in regard we mistrusted the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of his Negotiations in <hi>France,</hi> we
thought it our surer course to manage our
business by our selves, rather then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
him with us in the least.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, we went to wait upon
him before we left <hi>Moskow,</hi> nor was he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100819:100"/>
sorry to see us. And therefore being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to inform himself before his departure
of several things in relation to <hi>France,</hi> he
sent us Sleds about Ten a Clock at Night,
to the end he might discourse us more freely
at Night, and to avoid his being check'd
by the Court, which prohibits all the
<hi>Boyars,</hi> who have any Employments, to
have any Communication with Foreigners,
under any pretence whatever.</p>
            <p>We staid with him near Three Hours;
and in regard he ask'd us with a great deal
of Civility what course we thought was
most proper for him to take, to the end he
might be kindly receiv'd in <hi>France;</hi> we
told him frankly, That one of the surest
ways, was to shew an open-hearted genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
and impartial disengagement in all his
Conduct; without which, people under
his Character were never esteem'd in the
<hi>French</hi> Court; and there was no question
to be made, but that for want of these
precautions, his Predecessors had not met
with that satisfaction with which they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
themselves. But whatever we said,
we found him but very little enclin'd to
listen to us upon that Subject; and all the
while we were discoursing with him, his
People were busy below in the Court, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
several Waggons with Furrs, the sale of
which we knew to be the principal end of
his Ambassy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:100819:101"/>
Now in regard there is but very little
Money stirring in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> nor indeed any
at all to be seen but what comes out of
Foreign Countries; it behoves 'em there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
since they have not enough to Trade
among themselves, to fetch it in by the
Sale of their Furs of all sorts into Foreign
Parts, which is the best Revenue the <hi>Czars</hi>
have. For which reason it is, that they
cannot live without sending into remote
Countries a Numerous Troop of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
under the protection of an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador,
who, besides that he defrays their
Charges in all Countries where he goes,
frees 'em also from the Payment of Custom,
which would eat up a great part of their
Gains, were they oblig'd to pay the rigor
of what might be demanded from 'em.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the person, of whom I spake,
and who is one of the most considerable
Princes of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and one of the best
headpieces in the Empire, would not have
been sorry perhaps to have seen himself rid
of this same Train of Merchants luggage,
which he readily foresaw would be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to him in the conclusion; and, as he is
a person in love with Honour beyond the
common rate of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> he
would have been glad to have been
in condition to support his Character.
But the interest of the Court, to which it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100819:101"/>
behov'd him to sacrifice his own, would
not permit him to do otherwise then had
been practis'd all along. So that he was
oblig'd to put himself at the head of several
Merchants, who then assume the Title of
Gentlemen: A Title however, which they
can easily throw aside, when they are to
act the Pedlers in the Sale of their Skins.</p>
            <p>Two days after this Nocturnal Visit, we
departed from <hi>Moskow</hi> in company with a
<hi>Muscovite-Boyar,</hi> who was returning home to
his own house upon the Frontiers of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania;</hi>
and who, having been formerly a
Roman Catholick himself, preserv'd a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
still for us that were so.</p>
            <p>Yet, notwithstanding that the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
refus'd to let us pass thorow their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
we did not despair of reviving our
designs upon the Promise they made us, to
grant us the favour that we demanded, so
soon as they should understand, that our
King approv'd our enterprize. And with
this prospect it was, that my Companion
and my self took the way of <hi>Poland,</hi> in
company with the <hi>Muscovite-Boyar,</hi> already
mention'd, who shew'd us all the Civilities
imaginable upon the Road; no less kind to
a Dominican Fryer, that Travell'd along
with us, being entrusted with Letters from
the <hi>Cha</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> to the Pope and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:100819:102"/>
The Letter to the Pope was enclos'd in a
Purse of Cloth of Gold, and that to the
Emperor in another of Cloth of Silver.
And the substance of both was an Answer
to certain Letters, which those two Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
had written at the same time to the
<hi>Persian</hi> Monarch, exhorting him to take the
benefit of the success, wherewith God had
bless'd their Arms, to recover those Places,
which the Turk had wrested from the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
some years before. But the <hi>Cha,</hi> it
seems, was unwilling to regain his losses at
the expence of his ease and pleasure, to
which he sacrific'd all other considerations
in the world. Besides that, the <hi>Atamadoulet,</hi>
or Prime Minister of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire,
could by no means be induc'd to make War
against the <hi>Ottomans;</hi> whether it were, that
he were doubtful of the success, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were willing, that the Grand
Signior should think himself beholding to
him, for having diverted so furious a storm
from his Empire; And perhaps, more
then this, he was no less glad of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to testify to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Sultan, the
Devotion, which he had for the Religion of
the <hi>Sunni,</hi> as much a <hi>Persian</hi> as he was; and
notwithstanding, that the Duty of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
bound him to be, at least in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shew, one of the most Zealous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of <hi>Aly</hi>'s Sect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:100819:102"/>
But whatever reason the <hi>Cha</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi>
had, not to be swai'd by all the reasons which
the Embassadors from several of the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Princes laid before him; certain it is,
that his Answer to the last Letters, which he
receiv'd from 'em, imported no more, but
that there was still a vail before his eyes,
that hinder'd him from seeing clearly into
all those Affairs, that were propounded to
him. And this was the purport of those,
wherewith that <hi>German</hi> Dominican was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted,
in whose company we cross'd one
part of <hi>Muscovy, Lithunia,</hi> together with
the <hi>White-Russia,</hi> and parted at length at
<hi>Warsaw,</hi> where we arriv'd the <hi>12th.</hi> of
<hi>March</hi> in the Year 1686. about Eleven
Months after Father <hi>Barnaby</hi> and my self set

several years, in his <hi>Mission</hi>
into the <hi>East,</hi> and all the
Miseries he had suffer'd in the
Execution of the design that
had driven us out of <hi>Persia,</hi>
he was forc'd to renounce the Repose that
was offer'd him at <hi>Warsaw,</hi> to repair forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to <hi>Dantzic,</hi> in hopes of finding a
Vessel there, to Transport him over into
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas it was necessary, that one of us
should remain near <hi>Muscovy,</hi> in order to
be the better inform'd of the disposition of
those People in relation to us, that certain
notice might be given thereof from time
to time, it was agreed among us, that
while he should go to manage our Concerns
with our Superiors in <hi>France,</hi> I should tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in <hi>Poland,</hi> there to take other measures
to facilitate the Success of our Enterprise.</p>
            <p>In order to this, he left me, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
seconding our design, furnish'd him
with a Ship in the Port of <hi>Dantzic,</hi> ready to
set Sail for <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> where he arriv'd
safe after some days Navigation, and from
thence proceeded with speed towards <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he Negotiated our Affairs there,
with all the Success we could expect, I was
sufficiently employ'd at <hi>Warsaw,</hi> by the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100819:104"/>
of the <hi>French</hi> Inhabitants that are setled
there in great numbers. They having
been long desirous to have a <hi>French</hi> Jesuit
among 'em, to give them those Spiritual
Advices they could not easily meet with
in a Foreign Kingdom, I no sooner arriv'd
there, but they sent their Burguemaster to
me, to intreat me, during my abode in
that Royal City, to take the Conduct of
their Souls upon me, and more particularly
the Care of Preaching, which they had
been depriv'd of for many Ages. I accepted
that Employment freely, and continu'd it
until our Affairs were absolutely regulated to
undertake a second Voyage into <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Altho the earnestness those Zealous
<hi>Christians</hi> express'd for the Word of God, and
for all things relating to Salvation, took up
the best part of my time during my abode
among them, my Labour was very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd
and eas'd by the Holy Use they
made of all the Instructions they receiv'd
from the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> by my Ministry; and
I never was so sensible, as on that occasion,
how easily a Heart that has a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of <hi>Christianity,</hi> recovers out of those
disorders to which it had abandon'd its self,
when truly made sensible of the Duty of its
Profession, and of those Obligations unto
which we are engag'd by our Religion.</p>
            <p>But whatever Consolation I receiv'd from
the Zeal I observ'd in the Catholicks, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100819:105"/>
receiv'd another from above, which seem'd
yet more particularly to relate to my
Profession of <hi>Missionary,</hi> the main end of
which, is the Conversion of Infidels and
Hereticks.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Tsartoresky</hi> famous throughout all
<hi>Poland</hi> for his Virtue and Merit, whereby
he had acquir'd the Veneration of all the
<hi>Polanders,</hi> had a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Slave among his
Servants, into whom his Illustrious Master's
good Examples had inspir'd an inclination
to <hi>Christianity:</hi> but whereas this Vertuous
<hi>Palatin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Baptism of a <hi>Tartar.</hi>
               </note> could meet with no
body to Instruct that poor
<hi>Mahometan,</hi> for want of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
his Language, he was very
much troubled at his not being able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
the Pious Desires of his Servant, in
his good intention for the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of which till then, he had had but a
superficial Knowledge.</p>
            <p>As soon as he understood that I could
speak <hi>Tartar,</hi> he sent this half Converted
Infidel to me, desiring me to explain the
Mysteries of our Faith to him, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with all the Engagements that
are contracted by him that Embraces it.
I met with no difficulty to unseal the Eyes of
this poor Blind, whom the misfortune of
Birth, rather than obstinacy had kept till
then in Idolatry. He being of a very mild
disposition, I soon dispos'd him to receive
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100819:105"/>
his Baptism, which was perform'd on <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunday,</hi>
to the great satisfaction of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Master, who gave him his Liberty
as soon as he cast off the Bondage of the
Devil, who endeavour'd, by many reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Menaces to regain this precious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
from <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I receiv'd this information from this new
Convert's own Mouth soon after his Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
by the Waters of Holy Baptism,
the which I am the more inclin'd to believe,
by reason of the sincerity, and the candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Soul.</p>
            <p>Talking with him one day, about the
Happiness of his Condition, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God in calling him to his Church,
he told me with his usual simplicity, that he
had purchas'd it very dear, and that it had
like to have cost him his Life; after which,
having given me a small account of all the
violent Temptations he had undergone, while
I was most earnest to Instruct and fit him
for <hi>Christianity,</hi> he declar'd to me, that a
hideous terrible Phantasm had appear'd to
him several times, threatning to strangle
him, in case he persisted in his Resolution
of becoming a <hi>Christian.</hi> To this he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the said Apparition had frighten'd
him to that degree, while we were dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him by the usual Ceremonies of the
Church, to receive this first Sacrament,
that he would certainly have run away, had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100819:106"/>
I not been with him, and stopp'd him by my
Presence; but that all those horrid Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had ceas'd as soon as he was Baptiz'd,
and that he had found the saving Vertue
thereof, by the Peace and Tranquility it
had infus'd into his Soul, from that happy
moment.</p>
            <p>The Conversion of this
Infidel,<note place="margin">Abjuration of an <hi>Hungarian Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran.</hi>
               </note> was soon after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by that of an <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Lutheran,</hi> whom I had all
along taken for a Zealous <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic;</hi>
he was very exact in coming to all
my Sermons, and the regularity of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
answer'd the Idea I had form'd to my
self about him, before my being perfectly
acquainted with him. And therefore I was
strangely surpriz'd when he came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
me, at a time when I least expected
it, with the Error in which he had liv'd till
then, and his sincere Resolution of obeying
the Voice of God, which press'd him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to abjure his said Error: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he was fully instructed in all the Points of
our Religion, and seem'd very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in them, I had nothing to do but to
receive his Abjuration, and to prepare him
afterwards to Receive the other Sacraments
of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, I was not so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
taken up with the proper Functions of
my Ministry, and the Satisfaction I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100819:106"/>
thereby, as to neglect the furthering
the grand Design that had oblig'd us to
come into <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The necessity of keeping a Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Letters with my Companion, who
was in <hi>France,</hi> made me apply my self to
the Marquess of <hi>Bethune,</hi> to fix it with less
trouble. This Lord who has resided long
at the Court of <hi>Poland,</hi> convinc'd me in
that occasion, as well as in many others
that offer'd themselves in the Sequel, not
only of the Hereditary Affection of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
to our Society; but also of all the
Zeal, the greatest, and most <hi>Christian</hi> of all
our Kings can expect of his most faithful
Ministers.</p>
            <p>As soon as he was inform'd by a Letter I
wrote to him, with the motive for which I
begg'd his Protection, besides the assurances
he was pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to give me of it at that very
time, in the most obliging manner imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
he was moreover so kind as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the King of <hi>Poland</hi> with our design,
from whom he learnt such particular things,
concerning the way we design'd to discover,
that he engag'd me to come soon to the
Court, there to draw, as at the spring head,
the great and certain informations that
would have been so useful to us, had we
been able to overcome the obstinacy of the
<hi>Muscovites.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100819:107"/>
And therefore, as soon as it was known
in <hi>France,</hi> how much the King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
who is one of the most curious and most
knowing Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> seem'd to affect
this discovery, and what advantage might
be deriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from the proximity of his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
to <hi>Muscovy,</hi> in order to facilitate the
Execution thereof;<note place="margin">My Iourney to the Court of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to go to kiss his Hands,
and to implore his Royal
Authority, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of our Designs,
which he could second the better, by reason
that he had lately concluded a Peace with
the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> whereof one of the most
considerable Articles for Religion, was;
that the <hi>Czars</hi> should grant a free passage
through their Countries, to such Religious
as the King of <hi>Poland</hi> should be pleas'd to
send for the future, to Preach the Gospel
among the Infidels.</p>
            <p>These happy conjunctures which flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
our hopes so agreeably, occasion'd me
to quit <hi>Warsaw</hi> forthwith, to repair to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varow,</hi>
where the Court resided at that
time. The Marquess of <hi>Bethune</hi> presented
me to his Majesty, and procur'd me the
Honour of Kissing his Hands, soon after
my Arrival. I had the satisfaction to be
convinc'd, by my self, of all that I had
heard both in <hi>Europe</hi> and in <hi>Asia,</hi> of the
great Qualifications of that August Prince,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100819:107"/>
who is so much admir'd in all parts for his
Heroic Vertues.</p>
            <p>As he was no Stranger to the Design that
brought me to Court, he was so kind as to
begin the Discourse himself about the project
of our Journey into <hi>China</hi> by Land, and
he gave me such grand overtures to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
it, yet more advantageously than we
had been able to do; that I shall ever regret
the occasion, which Hell being broke loose
against us, has made us lose, of putting it
into Execution, where circumstances were
so favourable as they were at that time.</p>

that nothing can be added to the exact and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100819:108"/>
faithful Description he has given of all the
Countries and People he has discover'd in
his Journey: In my second Journey into
<hi>Muscovy,</hi> I had often the satisfaction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
my self, as to the Uniformity of
the Sentiments of all those I consulted on
purpose, to discover the truth of that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
They all agreed to the position of all
the Cities and Forts mention'd in the said
Map, which would be perfect, had the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Longitude and Latitude been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
set down. But it will be very difficult
ever to be certain as to that point, unless
the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who are not capable of
making any regular Observations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
would permit some Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
that has more skill than they have to
do it.</p>
            <p>Whereas, what I have already related,
in the preceding Book, as to the way the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> use to Travel into <hi>China,</hi> is
partly Extracted from the Memoirs the King
of <hi>Poland</hi> did me the favour to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to me, and that all that I have done
since, was only to get a confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
it would be needless to repeat it here,
since I can add nothing to it; but that the
World may the better rely upon the Truth
of what I have written, as to the facility of
Travelling into <hi>China</hi> by Land, which till
now had been look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d upon as impracticable,
by Reason that it has been examin'd and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100819:108"/>
approv'd of, by the most knowing Prince,
and least lyable to be impos'd upon, in the
World.</p>
            <p>All these Instructions which I immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sent to <hi>France,</hi> together with all the
other Informations, we had already receiv'd
from divers parts, on which we could rely,
induc'd our Superiors very much to favour
our Designs, in which they foresaw such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
advantages for the promoting of
our Religion. They being convinc'd, by
what his most Christian Majesty had lately
done for the Conversion of the Kingdom of
<hi>Siam;</hi> that we should not want the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Eldest Son of the Church,
they concluded, that the best way to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in our Enterprise, was to propose it
to that Monarch, who is so Zealous
for whatever relates to the Service of
God.</p>
            <p>They were not deceiv'd in
their Conjectures;<note place="margin">The King to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, grants us Patents, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to the Czars of <hi>Muscovy.</hi>

Besides most advantageous Passports, and

The <hi>Muscovites</hi> being the greatest For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malists

in the Letters that are written to the

are made to them in public whenever their
Names are mention'd; in so much, that
should the Memory of any Ambassadour, or
other, chance to slip in the least, in the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration
of all those lofty Titles, he would
expose himself to receive an Affront from
the Ministers, who had rather one should
take a Province of the State, than omit any
of those Qualities of their Master, which
they look upon as so many appurtenances of
the Crown.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>France</hi> not being ignorant
of their niceness upon that Subject, omitted
none of those Formalities, in hopes thereby to
engage them to be the more favourable to us.</p>
            <p>While Father <hi>Barnaby</hi> was
labouring on his side,<note place="margin">Order to associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate our selves to some <hi>Polish</hi> Iesuits.</note> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

could be thought on for the

I receiv'd Order from our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
to chuse out some Companions in
<hi>Poland,</hi> equally Zealous, and capable to
facilitate the Success thereof. It was no
hard Task for me to find out such in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
where our Society has two great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
Both the one and the other would
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100819:111"/>
have a share in that important design, and
offer a Victim a piece to God. Altho se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Jesuits had long aspir'd to that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we only pick'd out two, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
were worth many others.</p>
            <p>The first whom we took
out of the Province of
<hi>Cracovia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Character of the two Iesuits who were chosen to go Missionaries into <hi>China.</hi>
               </note> was call'd <hi>Zapol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski,</hi>
and had been extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
sollicitous for upwards
of Twenty Years together,
to go a Missionary into <hi>China.</hi> His Family
was one of the most Illustrious in <hi>Poland,</hi>
and he had possess'd the most considerable
Offices among us: Besides Philosophy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,
and Divinity, which he had
Taught many years with Credit; he was a
great Linguist, and particularly vers'd in
the <hi>Russian Tongue,</hi> to which he apply'd
himself most, in expectation of the occasion
that was offer'd him by us, the which he
had long been desirous of. He was Rector
to one of the chief Colleges in <hi>Prussia Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi>
when he was inform'd that we design'd
to call some Fathers of his Nation to our
assistance; whereupon he made such earnest
sollicitations at <hi>Rome,</hi> for leave to joyn
with us, and express'd so much Zeal to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the happiness of a Life altogether
Apostolical, which he had not been able
to obtain till then, that he got leave to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100819:111"/>
quit his Superiour's Place, in order to apply
himself wholly to an Apostolical Life.</p>
            <p>The Second was nam'd <hi>Terpiloweski,</hi> of
whom the Province of <hi>Lithuania</hi> made a
Sacrifice to God, which cost them very dear.
He was a Man of an extraordinary Merit,
he taught the Mathematicks in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Vilna,</hi> when he heard that I was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in getting some Travelling Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.
Whereas he stood possess'd of all
the qualifications that could be desir'd in
an accomplish'd Missionary; a known Vertue,
a Charming Sweetness, an Admirable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
for all handy works, a great deal of
Skill in Playing upon all sorts of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and in handling an Ingraver; I
excited him as much as possible I could not
to omit any thing in order, to obtain of
his Superiours, the favour of which his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
humilty made him to seem unworthy,
altho' he was very desirous of it; he did it
accordingly, and by reiterated Prayers, and
Supplications, he overcame all the obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
that oppos'd the accomplishment of his
Holy Desires.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Esclavonian</hi> and <hi>Russian</hi> Tongues
which those two Missionaries understood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
together with the <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
which Father <hi>Barnaby,</hi> and my self
spoke sufficiently, enabled us to cross all
<hi>Siberia,</hi> and all the Great <hi>Tartary,</hi> to
the Consines of <hi>China,</hi> without wanting any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100819:112"/>
foreign Interpreters, which was the reason
for which we engag'd <hi>Poland</hi> to enter into
our design, and to joyn with us in order to
discover that passage with ease, which in
the sequel would have prov'd so much the
more easie to all our Society, by reason
that it seem'd to secure us a Communication
with the most distant Countries in the
World.</p>
            <p>The happy disposition I met with on
the side of the <hi>Polish</hi> Fathers in Order to
promote the word of God, was no sooner
known in <hi>France,</hi> but they labour'd with all
the speed imaginable to obtain us all the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance

and more the execution thereof.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Barnaby,</hi> who knew better than
any Man what was necessary for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the new way we were going to
attempt, took care to provide abundance
of Trinkets, and a world of excellent Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
in order to present them to those <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi>
Princes, whose Protection we should
stand in need of: He was likewise provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with all manner of Mathematical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to observe the Longitudes of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Countries through which we were to
pass; in a word, he was furnish'd with all
things that could render our Journey of use
to Religion, and Sciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100819:112"/>
Being thus provided with all
things,<note place="margin">Father <hi>Barnaby</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barks at <hi>Roan,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to joyn us in <hi>Poland.</hi>

himself in the Society, in
order to dedicate his Life to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Missions.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as the season of the
Year was far spent, it being then about the
middle of <hi>November,</hi> I thought fit to depart
from <hi>Warsaw,</hi> where I had spent the best
part of the Year, to go to <hi>Dantzic,</hi> there
to tarry for my Companions, with whom I
hop'd to reach <hi>Moscow</hi> before the end of

Providence,<note place="margin">He is Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck'd with his Companions upon the Coast of <hi>Norway.</hi>
               </note> whose Judgments

            <p>Although this fatal Accident happen'd
while I was at <hi>Dantzic,</hi> where I had some
secret presages of it; I was not certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd

hinder'd me from taking such speedy mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
as were necessary to repair so great a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100819:113"/>
Loss. Notwithstanding the
violence of my Affliction at
the Confirmation I receiv'd of
it from <hi>France, Amsterdam,</hi>
and <hi>Hamburg,</hi>

               </gap>ce me to persist in, considering all the
oppositions we had met in it.</p>
            <p>The truth is, I found my self more at a
loss than ever; the fatal Shipwrack of our
Companions had also depriv'd us of all the
assistance they brought us. The ill recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Ambassadours of <hi>Muscovy</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in <hi>France</hi> through their bad Conduct,
made us fearful of an ill success at the Court
of <hi>Moscow,</hi> where they are us'd to Sacrifice
all to their resentment: The seeds of the
War which <hi>France</hi> has since wag'd against
<hi>Germany,</hi> with whom the <hi>Czars</hi> had lately
made a League, began already to allarm
<hi>Muscovy.</hi> All this, I say, seem'd to thwart
our Project, and to break all the Measures
we might have taken at a more favourable
time. However I did not give over my
hopes, tho' I had but little prospect for any,
and I began to act with the more confidence,
by reason that I was then convinc'd of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100819:113"/>
vanity of Human Succours, which I had
been deceiv'd in, in so many different occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

the Diet of <hi>Poland</hi> was held
at <hi>Grodno,</hi> which is a small

Count <hi>Syri,</hi> whom I shall

            </p>
            <p>Whereas he had been extraordinary
kind to me during my abode at <hi>Moscow,</hi>
where he arriv'd soon after us, I thought
he might prove of great use for the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of our Affairs, the rather because
he had always appear'd to me a great Votary
to our Society, and that he was very desirous
to be known to our Monarch, whose Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
he publish'd every where, with as much
affection as if he had been the most Loyal of

I should easily ingage him to enter more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
into my Projects.</p>
            <p>Having acquainted them both with the
misfortune of our Missionaries, and found
that they were really concern'd at it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
new Hopes for the reviving of our
ancient Project, or to contrive a new one
upon a better foundation, and perhaps more
advantageous than before.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Deputies the Court of <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi>
had sent to the Dyet of <hi>Poland,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Custom, had mention'd on several
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100819:115"/>
Occasions the discontents of their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
who were lately return'd from <hi>France,</hi>
and that besides they underhand spread a
Rumour of a Combat between the <hi>Czars,</hi>
and the Emperour of <hi>China</hi>'s Forces, in
which they pretended two Jesuits had been
taken by the <hi>Muscovites;</hi> I concluded from
thence, that those Reports were fore-runners
of the Refusal they design'd to make us of a
Passage through <hi>Siberia,</hi> altho' they had
promis'd it solemnly.</p>

and to avoid any cause

that we should be oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on the Capricio's of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi>
who never grant any thing, especially to
Strangers, unless compell'd to it by force, or
interest.</p>
            <p>This made me apply my self to Count
<hi>Syri,</hi> who having obtain'd the <hi>Persian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy
at that Dyet, was capable to protect us
in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> which he was shortly to go
through, and afterwards to open a secure
easie way for us by the Credit he had gain'd
in several parts of the <hi>East,</hi> as far as the
Kingdom of the <hi>Yousbecs,</hi> which is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into <hi>Tartary,</hi> which above all we
were desirous to discover.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:100819:116"/>
This Ambassador who was Originally an
<hi>Armenian,</hi> was carry'd very young into <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
his Family having been involv'd in
some Misfortunes, where he was bred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the King's Pages, 'till he was about
Eighteen or Twenty years of Age. As soon
as he began to know himself, he was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
with a desire of Travelling, which is
so natural to all those of his Country, and to
advance himself in the World by means of
the <hi>Asiatic</hi> and <hi>European</hi> Languages which
he had learnt with an extraordinary appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
To which end, having obtain'd
very advantageous Letters of Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Their Majesties of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to
several Persons of Quality in most King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
he Travel'd through <hi>France, Italy,</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> and finally arriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in <hi>Poland,</hi>
where he soon made himself known both by
his Wit, and his agreeable Behaviour, which
did not in the least savour of a Stranger.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> who
was then about sending an
Ambassador to the <hi>Port</hi> about
Affairs of Consequence,<note place="margin">His Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> made
use of Count <hi>Syri</hi> on that occasion, because
he spoke both the <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Polish</hi> Tongues,
and oblig'd him to accompany his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The Court was very
well pleas'd with his Services on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and for an acknowledgment sent him
soon after to <hi>Moscow,</hi> and afterwards into
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100819:117"/>
               <hi>Persia,</hi> where he discharg'd the Trust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon him incomparably well.</p>
            <p>Finally, the War which the Emperour,
the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Republick of
<hi>Venice</hi> have wag'd against the <hi>Turk</hi> for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight years last past, having induc'd
these Princes to send an Embassy to the <hi>Cha,</hi>
to sollicit him to enter into their League,
and to make him sensible of the advantages
he might draw from thence to recover such
Places of his Empire as the <hi>Ottomans</hi> had
formerly taken from him; Count <hi>Syri</hi> was
likewise chosen for that important Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and sent to that Emperour with the
Quality of Plenipotentiary from the Pope,
and all the Princes of the League. As all
those Honourable Imployments serv'd to fix
his Reputation in all those Courts, where he
always made a very considerable Figure,
they also prov'd very profitable to him: For
whereas the Embassies of <hi>Europe</hi> are only ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourary,
those of the <hi>East</hi> are as Profitable,
as Honourable.</p>
            <p>That which contributes most
to render those Commissions
advantageous,<note place="margin">The Embassy of <hi>Persia</hi> is very advantageous to those that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</note> is the Trade of
the <hi>Levant,</hi> which the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi>
are so fond of; the
which is easily and safely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by those who are in the Retinue of
an Ambassadour; who besides his having all
his Charges born, either in Money, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100819:117"/>
as soon as ever he enters upon the
Territories of the Prince he goes to Treat
with, until he gets out of them again, is
never liable to any Duties whatever.</p>
            <p>For that Reason, the Merchants, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Muscovites,</hi> or <hi>Armenians,</hi> are very
Sollicitous for those Occasions, and are very
grateful for the advantages they receive by
the Protection that is given them.</p>
            <p>Altho' Count <hi>Syri</hi> was not
insensible to Interest in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Embassies the King of
<hi>Poland</hi> Honour'd him with,<note place="margin">The Zeal Count <hi>Syri</hi> express'd in all his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassies for the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> I
must needs declare to his praise,
that he apply'd himself as
much to maintain those of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and of his Prince, as he did his
own.</p>
            <p>The Boldness he discover'd more than
once at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and elsewhere, in taking
away from the Infidels, unhappy Christians
who had been so-weak as to renounce their
Faith, is sufficiently known to all the Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries
that are dispers'd in <hi>Persia;</hi> and I
my self know how haughtily he us'd some
of the Prime Officers of the Court, who
made him Propositions in the <hi>Cha</hi>'s Name,
which perhaps would have shaken a Heart
less possess'd with Christianity than his was.</p>
            <p>This sincere Zeal for the Catholick Faith,
induc'd him to settle a Residence of Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
at <hi>Schamaki,</hi> to labour towards the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100819:118"/>
Conversion of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and other
Schismatick Infidels, which Trade drew in
shoals into that City.</p>
            <p>The same Zeal likewise induc'd him the
last time he was sent into <hi>Persia,</hi> to desire
the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to Authorize his Design
of procuring Settlements for Apostolick La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
throughout the whole extent of the
<hi>Cha</hi>'s Empire, where any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>opes should be
found of labouring successfully towards the
Saving of Souls, of which he carry'd many
along with him into the <hi>Levant,</hi> who have
since dispers'd themselves in all parts, where
they expected a proper Harvest.</p>
            <p>But, as sincere as his Zeal
appear'd to me,<note place="margin">Sincere Piety of Count <hi>Syri.</hi>
               </note> I should not
have regarded it, had it not
been accompany'd by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
equally regular, and edifying; and
indeed I may affirm, after having made it
my business to study him with all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
imaginable, that I never observ'd
any thing in him but what was very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and worthy of a good Christian. He
has done me the savour to discover his most
secret Thoughts to me, and to make me the
depository of his Conscience for a whole
Twelvemonth, and that knowledge he has
given me of his heart, obliges me to declare
that I have seen but few Persons of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
more devoted to God, or who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
themselves more fervently to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100819:118"/>
He confess'd himself regularly once
a Month, and approach'd the Holy Table
as often; and that always with such lively
marks of Faith, and with such a deluge of
Tears, that it would have inspir'd the most
insensible with Devotion.</p>
            <p>Tho Count <hi>Syri</hi> is hardly known in
<hi>France,</hi> I nevertheless think my self oblig'd,
as well out of a sincere desire to publish the
Truth, as out of gratitude, to give this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of his Vertue, since that besides his
having gain'd the esteem of all those that
knew him by his Merit, I am particularly
indebted to him for considerable Obligations.
For besides his Generosity at <hi>Astrakan,</hi> where
he offer'd to pay our Ransom himself, to
redeem us out of the hands of the <hi>Calmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being inform'd that we had been taken by
them in crossing the <hi>Volga,</hi> he express'd so
much Zeal afterwards for the furthering the
execution of our design, which the loss of
Father <hi>Barnaby</hi> had quite overthrown, that
I cannot forbear incerting in this place the
obliging Endeavours he made at my request,
to secure the success thereof.</p>
            <p>Being convinc'd by all the
favours and kindnesses I had
receiv'd from him during my
abode in <hi>Poland,</hi>

that they were suitable to his own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Therefore I told him, that since he
desir'd to make himself known at the Court
of <hi>France,</hi> he could never hope for a more
favourable occasion to succeed therein, than
that which offer'd it self at that time; and
that none being so capable to assist us as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,

Being inform'd, that your Majesty, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to have near your Person, and in your
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100819:121"/>
Dominions, a considerable number of Learned

send you six Learn'd Mathematicians Our
Subjects, to show your Majesty what ever is
most curious in Sciences, and especially the
Astronomical Observations of the Famous
Accademy we have establish'd in our good
City of <hi>Paris:</hi> But whereas the length of
the Sea Voyage, which divides Our Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
from Yours, is lyable to many accidents,
and cannot be perform'd without much time

out of a desire to contribute towards Your

of the same Father Iesuits who are Our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians,
with Count <hi>Syri,</hi> by Land,
which is the shortest, and safest way, to the
end they may be the first, near your Majesty,
as so many Pledges of our Esteem and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and that at the return of the said Count
<hi>Syri,</hi> we may have a faithful account of the
admirable and most extraordinary Actions
that are reported of your Life. Whereupon
We beseech God, to augment the Grandeur of
Your Majesty, with an end altogether happy.

While these new advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
were preparing for us in
<hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Father <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vollier</hi> comes to joyn with us in <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </note> to make amends for
those we had unfortunately
lost, I heard with a great
deal of Joy, that one of the
Missionaries who was design'd to accompany
Father <hi>Barnaby</hi> was happily sav'd, he not
coming to <hi>Roan</hi> till some days after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
and that he was coming by Land
to me in <hi>Poland.</hi> It would have been a
great pity to have lost at once two such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Men. If I had the same liberty to
speak of Father <hi>Beauvollier,</hi> whom Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has Sav'd by a kind of Miracle, as of
the first, whom Death has unfortunately Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd
from Us, I should joyfully publish
the things I have seen him do while I had
the satisfaction to Travel in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and if I may be allow'd to draw
happy presages from the sequel of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle-ship,
by the marks of the Heroick Zeal
he has demonstrated in the beginnings, I
will be bold to say, that he will prove one
of the most Illustrious Instruments to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>As to what relates to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Barnaby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Father <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s Character.</note> whom I may
speak of at present, without
fear of being suspected of
Flattery, I am oblig'd to declare out of
Justice to his Memory, that he was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100819:122"/>
one of the most accomplish'd Missionaries,
perhaps that ever travell'd into the <hi>East.</hi> He
had a surprizing faculty of Learning Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
and an undaunted Courage to go
through the greatest dangers.
He had apply'd himself to the
Study of Physick,<note place="margin">Physick is of great use in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Missions.</note> altho' he
had no inclination to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fully perswaded by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that it was one of the best means to
succeed in his Functions, among People
that only receive Eternal Truths, according
as they receive Temporal Benefits. He us'd
it effectually in two Missions he establish'd,
the one in <hi>Curdistan,</hi> and the other in <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
where his quality of <hi>Physician</hi> gave him
more Credit than the most Authentick Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials
could ever have done; and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of that Science in which he had acquir'd
a great deal of Skill, he Baptiz'd a great
number of Children, who soon after depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to increase the number of the Angels.</p>
            <p>Among all his Successes, God put him to
many Trials, and made him tast the Fruits
of that Cross which he Preach'd with so
much Zeal. He was strip'd several times
by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and the <hi>Curdes;</hi> while he
was Labouring for the Conversion of the
<hi>Iasidies,</hi> he had the happiness of being twice
Imprison'd for maintaining the Cause of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> and was often Abus'd, and
Cudgel'd for the Glory of his Name: In
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100819:123"/>
fine, to sum up all in one word, he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
ended the Sacrifice of his Life, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
himself as he did, to the excess of
his Charity, which far from being extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
in the Waters that swallow'd him
up, became the more fervent and purer, in
order to deserve, as we have reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that Recompence which God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to all those who expose and lose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for his sake.</p>
            <p>The Diet of <hi>Grodno</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up much about the time I
receiv'd notice of Father <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vollier</hi>'s

                  <hi>I</hi> depart from <hi>Grodno,</hi> after the breaking up of the Diet to meet Father <hi>Beauvollier</hi> at <hi>Warsaw.</hi>
               </note> I
repair'd to <hi>Warsaw</hi> to receive
him, and to take certain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
with him for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

arriv'd there much about the same time; and
I cannot tell which of us receiv'd more Joy
at our meeting, after having formerly laid
the foundation of the same design, which
brought us so happily together again.</p>
            <p>After some days repose, which he stood
extreamly in need of to refresh himself of
the Fatigues of his Journey, and to apply
some remedy to the swelling of his Legs,
occasion'd by the excessive Cold he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd
in crossing <hi>Holland, Germany,</hi> and
<hi>Prussia,</hi> we apply'd our selves jointly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
those of our Nation, until our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which Count <hi>Syri</hi> had appointed to be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100819:123"/>
about the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> by reason
that the Instructions for his Embassie were
not ready yet, and that he could not receive
the dispatches he expected from the Court of
<hi>France</hi> till about that time.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
our Superiors design'd to
take the advantage of Count
<hi>Syri</hi>'s Embassy to send several
Missionaries safely into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>

               </note>
we receiv'd Orders to
take some along with us
from <hi>Poland,</hi> besides those

who were sensible, that our Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>France</hi> had very much drein'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to supply the Missions of <hi>China</hi> and
of <hi>Siam,</hi> which had been lately establish'd,
were so much the rather inclin'd to second
our design, by reason that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
at that very time that the Prince of
<hi>Iveria</hi> desir'd to have some Learned Jesuits
in his Territories, the Government where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he was going to reassume again, after
some Years absence.</p>
            <p>This Prince, whose Name
is <hi>Archilla,</hi>

               </note> had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> altho he
was Originally a <hi>Georgian,</hi> for
the peaceable injoyment of
the Kingdoms of <hi>Iveria</hi> and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100819:124"/>
               <hi>Mingrelia,</hi> which were his by right. The
Châ of <hi>Persia,</hi> to purchase whose favour he
had chang'd his Religion, was pretty favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to him in the beginnings, and tho'
he afterwards return'd to his former Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
he did not torment him near so
much, as he did other petty Kings his Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals.
But his insatiable Lust for Women,
inclin'd him at last, no longer to have any
of those regards he had formerly had for
him; for being resolv'd at any rate, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
that Unhappy Prince's Wife, whose
Beauty had been very much commended to
him, he troubled him as much afterwards,
as he had been kind to him till then.</p>
            <p>At first, he us'd fair means to obtain his
Desires. From Mildness and Promises, he
proceeded to Threats, and from that to
open Force and Violence; insomuch, that
<hi>Archilla,</hi> who was not strong enough to
oppose the Forces which the <hi>Châ,</hi> being full
of indignation at his refusal, had caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to
advance to take him, was oblig'd to fly
with the Princess his Wife, to the Confines
of his Kingdome, which were most distant
from <hi>Persia;</hi> but they did not remain long
in quiet there: For the Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more Inamour'd than ever, having
cunningly ingag'd the Grand Seignior
on his side, whose Territories are adjoining
to the King of <hi>Iveria</hi>'s, on that side towards
the Black Sea, obtain'd some Forces from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100819:124"/>
him which easily surpris'd that fugitive
Prince, and conducted him to a Castle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>Turk,</hi> where he was kept a
while.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
with whom they would
keep some measures,<note place="margin">The Princess of <hi>Iveria</hi> marches at the head of some Gentlemen to rescue her H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sband out of Prison.</note> lest the
thing should make too much
noise, being strangely exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by a proceeding so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
without losing time,
assembled some Gentlemen her
Subjects, with whom she forc'd the small
place where her Husband was kept Prisoner,
and notwithstanding all the resistance the
Souldiers could make, carry'd him away,
and put him at liberty. After this bold
Action, they were both sensible, that they
could no longer tarry in their Kingdom,
without exposing themselves to an inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ruin. Therefore having abandon'd
their Kingdoms to the mercy of the two
Princes, of whom they are, as it were,
Tributaries, they sought a Refuge in <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
where they were very well receiv'd
by the <hi>Czars,</hi> who having assign'd them a
Palace in the Metropolitan of their Empire,
have maintain'd them there about three years
with a pretty deal of magnificence.</p>
            <p>At that time Prince <hi>Archilla</hi> discover'd
the happiness of those Soveraigns who have
Christian Subjects. The Extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100819:125"/>
the <hi>Muscovites</hi> pay their Emperours,
whom they look upon as being real Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
convinc'd him fully that the Christian
Religion which he had abandon'd to ascend
the Throne, preferably to all others, inspires
those Sentiments of Veneration that are due
to a Lawful King; for which reason, being
very much sollicited by his People to return
to his Kingdom, in which they promis'd to
defend him against the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> with
whom they were not very well satisfy'd, he
made great applications to the Patriarch of
<hi>Moscow,</hi> to obtain some Missioners from
him, upon whose Zeal he depended very
much for the safety of his Restoration.</p>
            <p>Being perswaded that the
absolute dependance he had
observ'd in all the <hi>Muscovites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He desires the Patriarch of <hi>Muscovy</hi> to get him some Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries.</note>
in relation to their Great
Dukes, was an effect of the
Unity of the Religion that is
profess'd in all their Dominions, he thought
that if he could once put things upon the
same foot in <hi>Iveria,</hi> and <hi>Mingrelia,</hi> where
there are several different Sects, he might
make himself as Independant as they were,
and make use of the Loyalty and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of his Subjects, whom he was in
hopes of reducing all to one and the same
Faith, as of a strong Bulwark against the
attacks of all the Neighbouring Princes. But
he mistook the Genius of the Patriarch, in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100819:125"/>
asking him for Evangelical Labourers.
There was not one to be found in all <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
tho' it abounds so very much in
Priests. After his refusal he apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the <hi>German</hi> Jesuits who were at <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi>
who made no such difficulty of getting
some for him, as the Patriarch had done,
whose insensibility prov'd more advantageous
to that Prince, than his Zeal would have
been.</p>
            <p>Upon this Occasion,<note place="margin">Some Iesuits are destin'd out of <hi>Poland</hi> for the Mission of <hi>Iveria.</hi>
               </note> some
<hi>Polish</hi> Jesuits associated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with us, to pass into
<hi>Persia,</hi> in Count <hi>Syri</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
who having receiv'd all
the Expeditions for his Embassie, left <hi>Warsaw</hi>
at the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> in order to
reach <hi>Moscow</hi> about the time that the Ice
and Snow render the Road of <hi>Astrakan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
and convenient.</p>
            <p>We advanc'd as far as the
Frontiers of <hi>Lithuania,</hi>
               <note place="margin">We advance to the confines of <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
               </note> where
we had appointed a Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to the rest of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
who were dispers'd up and down,
and who had sent us word they would be
there at the appointed day: Yet
what-ever precautions we had taken, he
whom we wanted most was not there; we
tarry'd some days for him, and Count <hi>Syri,</hi>
notwithstanding the numerous attendance he
was oblig'd to carry along with him, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100819:126"/>
to stop to afford him time to come up
to us, but in vain, for we heard that that
Father whom we were loth to lose, was
fallen Sick at <hi>Vilna,</hi> and that he was not in
a Condition to follow us.</p>
            <p>This Accident troubled us so much the
more, by reason that the Missionary we
wanted was one of those that were most ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to us; besides, he had all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Instruments, and several other
Curiosities that had been sent us out of
<hi>France,</hi> in the room of those things the Sea
had depriv'd us of.</p>
            <p>However, there was no other Remedy
than to beg of Count <hi>Syri,</hi> whom in reason
we could not stop any longer, nor expose
our selves to so much Charge, to give me
leave to repair to <hi>Vilna,</hi> there to take up
our Sick Brother in case he were any thing
better, or at least to fetch our Mathematical
Instruments, while he went forward himself
as far as <hi>Smolensko,</hi> where I knew he would
be so kind as to tarry for us, in case he did
not find the <hi>Muscovites</hi> inclin'd to receive
us.</p>
            <p>This Resolution being approv'd of, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
with speed to <hi>Vilna,</hi> and Count <hi>Syri</hi>
advanc'd slowly towards <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at <hi>Smolensko,</hi> where the Governour,
who was a Man of Honour, receiv'd him
incomparably well, and promis'd him to be
very kind to us upon his account, and to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100819:126"/>
furnish us at our arrival with Guides, and
what-ever should be necessary to follow
him.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Syri</hi> being satisfy'd with the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of that <hi>Vaivode,</hi> continu'd his March
towards <hi>Moscow</hi> with our other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
being perswaded that when-ever we
should appear, we should be favourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
and as speedily dispatch'd, as he had
assur'd me we should, by his Letters.</p>
            <p>My Journey to <hi>Vilna</hi> prov'd useless; for
the Person I went to seek there, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
sooner than he expected, went from
thence the very day I arriv'd there: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I overtook him fortunately at <hi>Minsko,</hi>
which is one of the most considerable Cities
in all the black <hi>Russia,</hi> about 30 <hi>German</hi>
Miles from <hi>Vilna;</hi> after which we cross'd
the huge Forests that lye between <hi>Minsko,</hi>
and <hi>Cazin,</hi> which is the last City of <hi>Poland</hi>
on the Frontier of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> where a little
Brook divides the two Countries.</p>
            <p>In that Journey I had the
satisfaction to see that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
quantity of Bees,<note place="margin">Abundance of Bees in the Forests of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania.</hi>
               </note> which
composes part of the Wealth
of the <hi>Lithuanians.</hi> I cannot
imagine by what Instinct those Animals
chuse those obscure Parts, since <hi>Virgil</hi> orders
them to be plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with so much Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection;
but there are few Forests on that
side, where one does not find many Swarms of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100819:127"/>
them; that which in my opinion draws them
thither, is the conveniency of the Hives
they find ready made in the hollow of the
Trees, where they could not be safe, were
not care taken to secure them from the
Bears.</p>
            <p>Those Cruel Beasts, that
are passionate Lovers of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,<note place="margin">The Bears wage a cruel War against those Animals.</note>
are very troublesom to
the Bees, and prejudice the
Peasants, for whom they work
considerably. However they
secure them by making kind of Fence
round about the Trees they are in, with
Spikes at top of them, or by covering the
hole they come in at with several Branches
of Thorn; which, without stopping their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
secure them from the cruel Enemy, that
persecutes them.</p>
            <p>As the Forests of <hi>Lithuania</hi> furnish the
Inhabitants with Honey, and Wax, they
also yield them abundance of Skins, and
Furs. Elks, Foxes, and Bears are as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
there as in <hi>Muscovy;</hi> and, would the
<hi>Polanders</hi> make War to those Animals, as
the <hi>Muscovites</hi> do, they would soon take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
part of their Neighbours Trade.</p>
            <p>The Objects, that offer
themselves to Travellers,<note place="margin">Bears are friends to Men.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commonly the Subject of
their Discourse; seeing a Bear
pass before us, I enquir'd about several curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100819:127"/>
things relating to that Animal. I heard
in the first place; that, as wild as he appears
to be, he is Naturally a Friend to Man.
Besides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Example of the Child, that was
Suckled by a Bear in the time of the Late
Queen of <hi>Poland, Louise Maria,</hi> I was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd,
that the same Prodigy happens often,
and that Children are often found in their
Caves without the least hurt, tho' they have
lain there several days. They also shew'd
me the Academy, where they are manag'd,
before their being led through the Cities of
<hi>Europe,</hi> as they commonly are. It is a
Town call'd <hi>Samourgan,</hi> where they are
taught what we see them practice with so
much dexterity, and as it were Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But that, which appear'd
most surprizing to me,<note place="margin">How Bears commonly pass the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and
which I cannot forbear rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
is the manner, how those
Animals commonly pass the
Winter. They pretend, that about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of that cruel Season, before the
ground is cover'd with Snow, they nibble a
sort of Herb, which stupifies them to that
degree, as casts them into such a profound
Sleep, that they remain altogether insensible
for several Months of the Year. They told
me moreover, that the Vertue of that Herb
had been discover'd almost in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100819:128"/>
the Coffee-Herb had been observ'd,
the effect of which is contrary to this.</p>
            <p>A Peasant of <hi>Lithuania</hi> going about the
beginning of Winter to visit his Bees, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a she Bear with three or four young
ones coming under a Tree, a top of which
he was got; he imagin'd at first she had
only brought them to that Place, to give
them a share of the Honey she expected to
find in the hollow of the Tree he stood
upon. In this opinion, which made him
much more apprehensive for his Life, than
for his Swarm, he study'd carefully all the
motions of the Bear, fixing his eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
upon her; however, he recover'd his
Spirits a little, seeing her imploy'd under
him, in pulling up a kind of Herb she often
presented to her young ones, after having
eaten some her self. But his fear vanish'd
quite, when he preceiv'd that little Flock re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into the Wood the same way it came.
He came down a little after, and being cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to know what Herb it was that had
intic'd the Animal, that had frightned him
so much to that place, he gather'd some of
the Leaves of it, which he chew'd going
home. He had no sooner done so, but he
found himself seiz'd with such a drowsiness,
that being no longer able to stand, he laid
himself down upon a Hay-cock to sleep.</p>
            <p>In the mean time his Family being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
at his stay, of which they could not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100819:128"/>
guess the Cause, went in search of him.
Some days after they found him in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
place, but so fast asleep, that all
the Cries, Shakings, and Agitations they
tormented him with for a long while, could
hardly awaken him. However, they did
awake him at last with a great deal of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and then he inform'd them with the
Cause of the obstinate drowsiness that had
seiz'd him, which he found to be the effect
of the Herb he had discover'd.</p>
            <p>As to this Story, which People are free
to credit, or to reject, it is not improbable
but that Simples may be found yet stronger
than Opium, the Vertue of which is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
known in the World: And since
God has given to all Animals whatever is
necessary for their maintenance, and for the
preservation of their Being, why may not
he as well have imparted to the Bear, which
is no less the work of his hands than the
Hart, or Lyon, the knowledge of an Herb
that may supply the Prey, the Cold and
Snows deprive him of during the Winter.</p>
            <p>Our first Care at our arrival

account of our arrival, and to desire him to
remember his promises to the Ambassador
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100819:129"/>
from whom we had been separated by an
unexpected accident. Notwithstanding this
<hi>Vaivode</hi>'s being very much a <hi>Gentleman,</hi>
he durst not answer us, having receiv'd po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Orders from the Court, to oppose our
entrance into <hi>Muscovy.</hi> What ever pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
instances Count <hi>Syri</hi> made to Prince
<hi>Gallichin,</hi> to give us leave to come speedily
up to him, to continue his Voyage, which
he could not do without us, that Minister
amus'd him with fair words, assuring him
that he had sent an Express to fetch us, and
to bring us a Passport from the Court, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which we could not move. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this, and all the Interest
that could be made from all parts, the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
had determin'd and were resolv'd to
refuse us, not only the passage of <hi>Siberia,</hi>
which we had formerly requested of
them, but also the entrance into their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.</p>
            <p>However in spite of all their
precautions,<note place="margin">An Envoy from <hi>Poland</hi> takes us along with him to <hi>Moscow.</hi>
               </note> and the vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they made us indure for
three weeks together, during
which time, they left us at
<hi>Cazin</hi> without any Answer,
Providence offer'd us an occasion to reach
<hi>Moscow,</hi> which prov'd so much the more
welcome to us, by reason that we had lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

long, in the uncertainty of what we
had to hope or fear. A <hi>Polish</hi> Gentleman,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100819:129"/>
nam'd <hi>Lazinski,</hi> pass'd through <hi>Cazin</hi> while
we were there, going to <hi>Moscow</hi> with the
Character of Envoy from the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
He freely offer'd to Conduct us to
<hi>Moscow,</hi> and lest the <hi>Muscovitos</hi> might put
us to any trouble, he told them we were his
Chaplains, as indeed we were during all the
Journey, in which we should not have had
the satisfaction of saying Mass, had not we
been in his Company.</p>
            <p>The favour we receiv'd
from this <hi>Polish</hi> Minister,<note place="margin">The <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> having notice of our March, order Count <hi>Syri</hi> to depart immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from <hi>Moscow.</hi>

the Court of <hi>Moscow,</hi>
and it was not long before
they express'd their resentment
of it to us. They began by
taking away from us our
main supporter, upon whom
we had grounded all our hopes for the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of our Enterprize, I mean Count <hi>Syri,</hi>
whom they oblig'd to depart from <hi>Moscow,</hi>
as soon as they heard that the Envoy <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinski</hi>
had taken us under his Protection.
However, the first was allow'd to take the
Jesuits he had brought out of <hi>Poland</hi> along
with him, and the reason why Father <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vollier</hi>
did not follow him, was because I
entreated him to tarry for us, being very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
what Fate would attend our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:100819:130"/>
When we arriv'd at <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They sent us the same Order some days after.</note>
we were yet more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
convinc'd, that they
were resolv'd not to spare us,
for two days after our arrival
the <hi>Czars</hi> sent a <hi>Pristave</hi> to Father <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vollier,</hi>
and my self, (it is the Name of the
Officer that carries their Orders) to order us
to depart, and quit their Dominions, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that if we were so bold as to take a
Sanctuary either at the Envoy, or Resident
of <hi>Poland,</hi> they would find a way to force
us from thence, and to oblige us to do that
which perhaps we thought to elude by the
protection of those two Ministers.</p>
            <p>This violent proceeding
surpriz'd us a little,<note place="margin">The Resident of <hi>Poland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us under his Protection.</note> but it did
not abash us quite, we went
immediately to the <hi>Polish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
call'd <hi>Dominc d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
who all along publickly declar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
our Protectour, to Consult him upon
the measures we should take, and to entreat
him to imploy the credit of his Character,
to shelter us from the storm that threatned
us. The only expedient this Minister could
give us in those troublesom Conjunctures,
was to shew the Letters our Great Monarch
had honour'd us with for the <hi>Czars,</hi> assuring
us that they were so prepossess'd with the
Grandure and Power of our King, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
since the taking of <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100819:130"/>
they had just receiv'd notice of; that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the discontent of their Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours,
they would infallibly revoke the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
we had receiv'd from them, if we made
them sensible, according to the hopes we
had given them of it two years ago, that
his Majesty really Authoris'd our Designs.</p>
            <p>The Sequel convinc'd us
that he had Councel'd us well:<note place="margin">They alter their Behaviour, hearing that we had Letters from the King.</note>
for Prince <hi>Gallichin</hi> was no

an Excuse for the ill treatment we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
and promis'd to give us a particular
Audience to make amends for what was
pass'd.</p>
            <p>This first Minister of State,<note place="margin">Prince <hi>Gallichin</hi>'s Character.</note>
who was of the Illustrious
Race of the <hi>Iagellons,</hi> was

Strangers, and particularly the <hi>French,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Noble Sentiments he had observ'd
in them, were very consonant to his own;
for which reason, it was rumour'd that his
Heart was as much <hi>French</hi> as his Name. It
was no fault of his, that we did not receive
all the satisfaction he made us hope for, the
first time we had the honour to speak to
him; and had he been absolute Master, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100819:131"/>
not oblig'd to keep great Measures with all
the <hi>Boyars</hi> who were concern'd in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Affairs, he would willingly
have granted us the Passage of <hi>Siberia,</hi> and
have facilitated our entrance into <hi>China,</hi> out
of respect to <hi>Lewis le Grand,</hi> whose Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
he was, to that degree, that I have often
been told that he caus'd his Son to wear his
Majestie's Picture in the form of a Cross of
<hi>Maltha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We waited upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
introduc'd by the Resident

               <note place="margin">He gives us a particular Audience.</note> on the day he had

that never any Affair was so long under

            <p>However, not to omit any thing, that

I cannot forbear relating, in this place, some
things we were Eye-witnesses of, while we

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100819:132"/>
               <hi>Boyars,</hi> concerning the passage we came to

               </gap>
the precautions that had been prescrib'd
to us.</p>
            <p>I have already hinted,<note place="margin">An Envoy from <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> does us ill Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the Court of <hi>Moscow.</hi>
               </note> that
one of those, who did us the
most diskindness with the
<hi>Czars,</hi> and their Ministers,
was the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>'s
Envoy, who came to
<hi>Moscow</hi> some days before us. This Deputy,
whose Name is <hi>Richer,</hi> a <hi>Calvinist</hi> by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and confequently a sworn Enemy to
the Jesuits, had been sent to the Court of
<hi>Moscow</hi> by the present Elector, to carry the
<hi>Czars</hi> the News of his Exaltation, upon the
Elector his Father's Death, lately happen'd.
He was charg'd with two different Letters,
with orders to deliver them in two different
Audiences: But he, instead of the two
draughts he stood in need of for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
unfortunately took a Duplicat of
the Letter the Elector writ to the two <hi>Czars,</hi>
to acquaint them with his Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ltation; he
deliver'd the said Letter to them in the first
Audience he had with all the usual Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
at that Court. Some days after it,
having another Audience, he deliver'd his
second Letter; but the Court was very
much surpriz'd, to find, that the last was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a repetition of the first, and more yet to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100819:132"/>
be inform'd of the Exaltation of the
Son, without any notice of the Death of
the Father.</p>
            <p>This mistake, which occasion'd some
Laughter at the Court, was a just Subject of
Mortification for the Envoy of the New
Elector; but it did not hinder them from
expressing a great deal of kindness to him,
by reason of the agreeable propositions he
came to make to the <hi>Czars,</hi> in the Elector
his Master's Name, on the occasion of the
Princes <hi>Radz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her Second Husband, one of the <hi>Palatin</hi> of
<hi>Newburg</hi>'s Sons, instead of Prince <hi>Iames</hi> of
<hi>Poland,</hi> to whom she had been promis'd.
The King of <hi>Poland,</hi> out of a just indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

his Knowledge, contrary to her former
Engagement, being necessitated to express

way to be reveng'd of the affront, both he,

            <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
with the King's Design, and being
oblig'd by the strictness of his Alliance with
the said Princess, to oppose what ever might
be attempted to the disadvantage of his

and Defensive with <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and
this was the real Motive for which this

            <p>However, a very great distinction was

Rouillé,</hi> who was put to Death at <hi>Moscow,</hi>
while we were there, whose end equally
Glorious and Tragical, I cannot forbear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
here.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman, was about 25 Years of
Age, of one of the best Families in <hi>Brabant;</hi>
he was very well Shap'd, had a very quick
Understanding, and was of a Charming
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100819:133"/>
Disposition. The desire of seeing, and of
being acquainted with <hi>Europe,</hi> had induc'd
him to Imbark upon a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship, which set
him down at <hi>Archangel,</hi> from whence he
Travell'd to <hi>Moscow,</hi> where he soon got ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Father <hi>Beauvollier,</hi> who came
there a little before me.</p>
            <p>This Father, who had always made an
advantageous use, for the Glory of God, of
the Mathematicks, which he is very well
vers'd in, easily insinuated himself into the
mind of this Gentleman, and ingag'd him
so far by his winning Behaviour, that he
afterwards inspir'd him, with whatever Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
he pleas'd. He begun by represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, what continual dangers Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
expose themselves to, and the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they lay under, of clearing their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in order, to be above all the accidents
that might surprise them. After which,
having persuaded him to make a general
Confession, he engag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him so cunningly
into all the Exercises of solid Piety, that in a
very short time, he made him a New Man,
altogether different from what he was
before.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding the regularity of his
Conduct, he had the misfortune to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in a contest, which at one and the same
time occasion'd his Ruine, and yet prov'd
the source of his Happiness. He happen'd
to have a dispute with an unfortunate <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:100819:134"/>
whose Name was <hi>Schuts,</hi> who, to
Marry a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Woman, he was foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fallen in Love with, had made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of committing a double Apostacy, in
quitting a very Reform'd Order, in which
he had Liv'd long, and in renouncing the
Catholick Faith which he had profess'd all
along.</p>
            <p>After some words that had pass'd between
them in the heat of their Dispute, this Brutal
Apostate drew out a Sword to run the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bander</hi>
through, who was come to visit him
without any ill design. The last avoided
his violent thrusts, as much as he could, and
endeavour'd to dis-arm him, in hopes of
calming his mind; but not being able to do
it, and finding himself more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd,
he took hold of a Pistol, that
hung in the Room where this Tragedy was
Acted, wherewith he shot him through.</p>
            <p>This being done, this Gentleman, less
Criminal than Unhappy, being sensible that
it was impossible for him to get out of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi>
immediately judg'd that he was ruin'd,
however he got out of the House, with a
a great presence of Mind, and about two in
the Morning came to Father <hi>Beauvollier,</hi> to
whom he made a general Confession of all
his Life to dispose himself to all the Events
he had Reason to fear.</p>
            <p>At break of day, the Judges being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
with what had happen'd, sent out
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100819:134"/>
Officers to apprehend him. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
taken and carry'd to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
where he was Examin'd according to
Custom. However, they could not well
Condemn him to Dye, by reason, that the
Person he had wounded, who Liv'd two
days after he receiv'd his Wound, had
absolutely clear'd him, declaring sincerely,
that by his own obstinacy he had drawn
this Fate upon himself. Therefore they were
oblig'd to defer their Judgments upon the
matter, in expectation of new Informations.</p>
            <p>While things were thus in suspense, two
sorts of People imploy'd themselves to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Pardon for this Guilty Unfortunate.
The <hi>Polish</hi> Resident, seconded by all the
Zealous Catholicks, us'd this utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
to represent this Gentleman's Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
to the Emperors and to the <hi>Boyars.</hi>
The <hi>Muscovites</hi> were likewise desirous to
save him, but to their own advantage, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
him to embrace their Schism, and
serve in their Armies. However, the efforts
both of the one and the other prov'd success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
by reason of the steadiness of that truly
Christian Soul, and by the Cabals of the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who engag'd the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> in their Party, whose
Credit was too great at that Court, for any
body to cope with him.</p>
            <p>This Passionate Minister being inform'd,
with how much Courage the innocent Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100819:135"/>
had rejected the Propositions that had
been made to him about changing his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the Generous disdain he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
for all the advantages that had been
proffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to him, in case he would turn
<hi>Roux,</hi> being moreover sensible of the small
regards the Court express'd for the <hi>Polish</hi>
Resident and Envoy, cunningly made use
of the conjunctures which he judg'd favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to Sacrifice to the Resentments of the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> the Life of that
poor Gentleman, whose Religion made his
greatest Crime.</p>
            <p>What ever pretence the first could have
to desire his Death, and what ever Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
their Minister had inspir'd them with,
in a Sermon he preach'd on purpose to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
them to vengeance, they appear'd less
eager of it than these who were resolv'd at
any rate to make him pay for a favour they
had formerly done him, taking him then to
be one of their perswasion, which Errour he
undeceiv'd them of Couragiously, declaring
to them, that he was a true Son of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church.</p>
            <p>The Envoy of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> at the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of those dangerous Enemies, prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and obtain'd a Sentence of Death against
this poor stranger, at a time when he,
and all his Friends were most in hopes of a
Pardon. His Condemnation being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
after a Conference the Deputy had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100819:135"/>
held with Prince <hi>Gallichin,</hi> it was not hard
to judge that it was the effect of his pressing
Sollicitations, to which they consented, the
rather because they had lost all hopes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
with a Person who had appear'd all
along insensible to all the advantageous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
they had made to him, to perswade
him to change his Belief.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding the injustice of this
Sentence, he did not complain so much of
it, as he did at their Cruelty during his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment:
He had often desir'd leave to
see his Confessor, in whom he had an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Confidence, the which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
deny'd him: insomuch that he could
only conferr with him by Letters, and even
that, they endeavour'd to deprive him of
with great Inhumanity.</p>
            <p>The very day he was Executed, he writ
one to Father <hi>Beauvollier,</hi> in which, after
having given him an account of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and the interior Sentiments God had
inspir'd him with during his Imprisonment,
he acquainted him with the assurances he
had receiv'd of being soon put at liberty:
But our joy was very short liv'd, for while
we were rejoycing about it, we heard, with
an incredible surprize, that he was going to
the place of Execution, there to be Beheaded
in the quarter of the <hi>Germans;</hi> pretty near
the House where his misfortune had guided
him some days before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:100819:136"/>
Father <hi>Beauvollier</hi> being more surpriz'd
and concern'd thereat, than any other, ran
out immediately, arm'd with his Crucifix,
and having crowded through an infinite
number of People that fill'd up all the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
he threw himself (notwithstanding all
the opposition of the Souldiers) into the
Sledge in which his Illustrious Patient lay.
Whatever his Guards could do to oppose his
Zeal, and to oblige him to retire, he
overcame their obstinacy, shewing them the
Sign he had arm'd himself with, and giving
them to understand that he design'd nothing
but to perform the last duty towards his dear
Penitent.</p>
            <p>He found it much more difficult to defend
himself against the secret attacks he resented
at the sight of an Object so full of pity; but
whereas he had no time to Lose, he forc'd
himself to prepare his Generous Friend to
Die, who was the more sensible at that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview,
by reason that he had not expected
it. The secret Testimony of his Conscience
having altogether clear'd and satisfy'd him
as to the cause of his Condemnation, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
the Father who accompany'd him, that
the Death he was going to suffer, was so far
from frighting him, that it afforded him a
real Consolation, in hopes that God would
be pleas'd to accept of it, not only as a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to his Justice, for all the Sins he had
formerly committed; but also as the most
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100819:136"/>
sensible proof he could give him of his Love
and Fidelity.</p>
            <p>Being thus Penetrated with the most
lively Sentiments, the Holiness of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
he professes can inspire a Christian
with, he began his General Confession anew,
altho he had lately done it in two different
recounters; and having ended it with
Marks of a really Penitent Heart, he dispos'd
himself by several Religious Acts his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
reminded him of, to the Sacrifice he
soon after consummated, with a presence of
Mind, and Devotion, which drew Tears
from all the Spectators.</p>
            <p>When he came to the place of Execution,
he came modestly out of his Sledge, then
kneeling down, he repeated the Devout Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
his Confessor fortify'd him with.
Finally, having thus dispos'd himself above
an hour and a half long to this last action of
his Life, he was desired to make himself
ready to receive the stroak of Death. He
immediately got up, without being surpriz'd,
and having himself taken off a large Vest of
Brocado he had on, he deliver'd it to the
Executioner, who allow'd him yet as much
time as he desir'd to assure the Spectotors
that he dy'd a Son of the Catholick Church,
out of which there is no Salvation; and to
protest that he heartily forgave all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to whom he did not impute his Death
so much, as to his sincere Zeal for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100819:137"/>
in which he would persist with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of God, to the last moment of his
Life.</p>
            <p>Having said this, he turn'd to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor,
and thank'd him for all his Charitable
Cares, and for all the Salutary Instructions
he had been pleas'd to give him from the
happy moment in which he was first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with him; he desir'd him not to
leave him, till after his Execution, and to
continue his fervent Exhortations to him,
until he had deliver'd up his Soul into the
hands of his Creatour: After which, step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
into a small Retrenchment that was
made on purpose, he laid himself down upon
the ground that was cover'd with Snow, and
plac'd his head upon the Block, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Stroak he receiv'd soon after,
pronouncing the Sacred Names of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sus,</hi>
and <hi>Mary,</hi> the sound of which was heard
through his Wound, even after his Head
was divided from the rest of his Body.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to express how much noise
his Death caus'd in <hi>Moscow,</hi> and how much
every body was Edify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by the Zeal Father
<hi>Beauvollier</hi> express'd on that occasion: It
appear'd sufficiently by the applause he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
coming home again: Altho' every
body was concern'd at the unhappy destiny
of this young Gentleman, yet they esteem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
him happy to have ended his Life in the
hands of a Person who had given him such
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100819:137"/>
holy dispositions; and nothing perhaps ever
gave more Lustre to the Roman Religion,
than this Example of Piety, and Charity,
which for a long while was the whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the City, which sensibly convinc'd
all those who were Witnesses of it, how
happy it is to live in a Religion, in which
they Dye so Holily.</p>
            <p>There was Reason to believe that this
Death would appease, and altogether stifle
the sentiments of Vengeance that Party had
appear'd so unjustly animated with; but
they resolv'd to add Ignominy to their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty;
and to that end prevail'd with
Prince <hi>Gallichin</hi> that the Body of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd,
on whose Memory they would fix
Infamy, should be expos'd three days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a Publick Place, but the Zeal of the
Catholick prevail'd over the Fury of the
<hi>Lutherans.</hi> The <hi>Polish</hi> Resident being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated
at the obstinate malice of those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of our Faith, went to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
Minister, and urg'd such strong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to him, to revoke those Orders, that
he could not refuse leave to remove the sad
Object, which was instantly transported to
the House of the Jesuits, where it was kept
until it could be Buried Honourably.</p>
            <p>In order to do it with all the Magnificence
that was judg'd necessary to check the Envy
of the Cabal, a day was chosen in which all
those who were considerable among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100819:138"/>
might assist at the Funeral Pomp.
None was thought so proper as that of the
Purification of the Virgin. I Celebrated the
Mass that day, and the King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s
two Ministers, together with all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Officers that serv'd in the <hi>Czars</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
accompany'd with all the Persons of
Quality among the Strangers, honour'd my
Sacrifice with their presence. The After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
was Consecrated to pay the last dues to
our Illustrious Friend, whose edifying Death
had so much honour'd our Faith. His
Corps being lay'd in a sumptuous Coffin,
was carry'd to the place of Burial, with all
the Ceremonies practis'd in Catholick Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Buried in the Church-yard that is
common to all Christian Foreigners.</p>
            <p>The thing which seem'd
most particular to me in that
Action,<note place="margin">An extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary event at his Burial.</note> and pass'd for a kind
of Miracle, was the surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
ease that was met in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Grave into which we were to lay
those precious Remains, which was very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.
As the Cold is very violent at
<hi>Moscow</hi> in the Winter time, it hardens the
ground to that degree, that it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to move it on any occasion whatever;
insomuch that there is an absolute necessity to
heat it with a considerable quantity of Wood,
long before one begins to digg it. Those
Precautions had been omitted out of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100819:138"/>
at the Burial of this young Man:
Yet notwithstanding the Grave-diggers that
were imploy'd, far from meeting any resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the ground, found it as soft as if it
had been moisten'd many Summer days by
the most favourable Showers. Altho' I
would not affirm this to be altogether Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous,
yet at the same time I dare not
contradict the Opinion of all the Spectators,
who believ'd that God by his extraordinary
Event, had been pleas'd to express how
much he delighted in the generous Confession
of his Servant.</p>
            <p>The same motive that had
engag'd the Envoy of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Envoy of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> thwarts our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</hi>
               </note>
to espouse the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
oblig'd him to thwart
our Designs, and to break all the measures
we had endeavour'd to take, to secure the
success thereof: He easily gain'd his ends,
reminding the <hi>Muscovites</hi> with the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of their Ambassadors in <hi>France,</hi> and
in representing to them, how prejudicial the
Conquest of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was to the
League they had lately concluded with the
Emperor, as well as by making them jealous
of the Quality of Mathematicians, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
had Honour'd us with.</p>
            <p>All these seeming plausible Reasons, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
the <hi>Boyars</hi> at last, to declare against
us, and to refuse us a passage, the hopes of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100819:139"/>
which, had engag'd us to such Charges and
Fateigues. This was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of all the Deliberations of
the Council,<note place="margin">The Council re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to grant us a passage thro' <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
               </note> which we were
inform'd with at the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
where the first Secretary,
who had summon'd us by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the Court, told us with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Voice, returning us our Letters of
Mathematicians, that the <hi>Czars</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us, for Reasons we could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of, to retire forthwith out of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and to make our selves ready to
go with the same Deputy who had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
us to <hi>Moscow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these Orders were very
pressing, and that we were forc'd to submit,
we made a new effort with the Friends we
had about Prince <hi>Gallichin,</hi> who represented
to him how prejudicial this would prove to
<hi>Christianity,</hi> and even disadvantageous to
the Reputation of the Emperors, who seem'd
to confess their weakness, in chusing for the
Victims of their Resentment, two Poor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
who had no other end, in their
long Pilgrimage, than the Conversion of
Infidels; nor other Interests to mannage,
than those of the True God, whose Word
they were going to Preach to the end of
the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:100819:139"/>
The Prince was mov'd by
those Reasons,<note place="margin">Prince <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin</hi> interceeds for us, but in vain.</note> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he had a great deal of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
he us'd all his interest
to prevail with the <hi>Boyars</hi>
to alter their minds: But
they, thinking, perhaps, that their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
were concern'd in it, kept obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
to their first Resolution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to hearken to any Propositions made
on our behalf.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that, had he been mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make use of his own Authority on
that occasion, he might easily have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
from the <hi>Czars,</hi> the revocation of
the Orders we have mention'd: But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
already too many Enemies against
him, he was oblig'd to sacrifice us, for
fear of imbroiling himself the more, and
of being involv'd into more troubles than
he daily met with already, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the high Post he possess'd, which
was not capable to secure him from the
<hi>Shaft</hi>'s Envy.</p>
            <p>We were very sensible, at that very
time when he labour'd to obtain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
we desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d, that he had a great deal
of reason to behave himself prudently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
every body, and not to take too
much advantage of the Credit he deriv'd
from his Place of Prime Minister, nor of
the consideration the Eldest of the <hi>Czars</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:100819:140"/>
express'd for him, as well as the Princess
<hi>Sophia,</hi> whose Creature he was.</p>
            <p>This were a proper place to unravel
the divers Intrigues of that Princess, who,
during the Minority of the two <hi>Czars,</hi>
her Brothers, took possession of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in which she has continued for
some years, by means of that faithful
Minister; but I have bounded my self
to speak of nothing but what is essential
to the Relation I am writing; besides, the
Publick will soon receive a particular Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
of whatever relates to the present
State of <hi>Muscovy;</hi> therefore I shall only
mention here, the different Events I have
been an Eye Witness of, to satisfy the
Reader, with the Reasons that have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
us from succeeding in the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a way by Land into <hi>China,</hi> which
we had undertaken, and with the Sequel of
our proceedings, after the <hi>Muscovites</hi> had
refus'd to allow us a passage through their
Territories.</p>
            <p>Whatever inclination Prince <hi>Gallichin</hi>
had to favour our Designs, he could not
possibly do it, under his present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and two vexatious Accidents
that befell him, much about one and the
same time; hinder'd him from declaring
for us, as openly as, perhaps, he would
have done at another time.</p>
            <p>The first was by a private Man, who
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100819:140"/>
having flung himself into his Sledge, as
he was going to the Palace of the <hi>Czars,</hi>
threw himself upon him, and seiz'd him
by the Beard to stab him. While he was
drawing his Dagger, which stuck in his
Girdle, as the <hi>Muscovites</hi> commonly wear
them, the Princes Servants, who follow'd
the Sledge, ran up to him, and stopt
him just as he was about sticking it into
his Breast. And yet this Wretch was
not in the least daunted, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
seem'd more inraged, having miss'd
his Blow, than he was before; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regarding the consequences of his
pernicious design, he made many vain
efforts to put it in execution; but finding
that it was in vain, since he was overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd,
he alarm'd that Prince, as much by
his insolent seditious discourse, as he had
frighten'd him by his Resolution in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking
him. <hi>Infamous Tyrant,</hi> said he
to him, with an Air both Fierce and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
<hi>since I have been so unfortunate as to
fail in this attempt, to deliver my Country
from the most horrid Monster, that ever was
bred in it, by making thee a Sacrifice, know
that some happier hand than mine will be
found, and that among upwards of three
hundred Citizens, who pitty the People, that
is daily oppress'd by thee, some will take bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
measures than I have done.</hi> He was
not permitted to go on; but was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100819:141"/>
dragg'd to Prison, where he was
Executed, to avoid making too much
noise, after having been forc'd by the
Rack, to declare the number and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Accomplices.</p>
            <p>This Out-rage was follow'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which made an end of convincing
this first Minister of the extraordinary
danger, to which he was daily expos'd,
by his great Elevation. Some days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his departure for the Army, a cover'd
Coffin was found at his Palace Gate, with
a Note in it, containing these words:
Gallichin, <hi>unless the Campaign thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to open, prove more successful than the
former, thou canst not avoid this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those Menaces which prov'd as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fatal Presages of the misfortunes that
he fell him afterwards, oblig'd him to
stand continually upon his Guard, and to
avoid doing any thing that might displease
the <hi>Boyars</hi> in the least, who underhand
set those Instruments at Work, which
press'd him so close, after his return
from <hi>Krimea,</hi> that finally they caus'd him
to be banish'd into <hi>Siberia,</hi> where to this
hour he leads a languishing shameful life.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate Success of our Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
may partly be imputed to those vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
proceedings, since they hinder'd the
Prince, who had been favourable to us
all along, from opposing the decision of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100819:141"/>
the Council against us, the which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
very unreasonable, even to such
among the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who knew the
Motives of our Journey.</p>
            <p>However, we were oblig'd to submit
to the Orders we had receiv'd, and to
take new measures, not only to go back
to <hi>Poland;</hi> but also to follow Count <hi>Syri</hi>
into <hi>Persia,</hi> from whom we daily receiv'd
fresh assurances of his sincere Resolution,
to be our Conductor to the Place we were
bound for, in spight of all the efforts of
the <hi>Muscovites</hi> to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Having no longer any hopes of re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
our affairs in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> we turn'd
all our thoughts on our return: Yet we
were oblig'd to tarry a fortnight longer
at <hi>Muscow,</hi> for fear of exposing our
selves to the Injuries we dreaded by the
way; the very <hi>Polish</hi> Envoy, whom we
were to accompany, looking upon it as the
safest way to secure himself.</p>
            <p>It was about the time the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> keep their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval,<note place="margin">Horrid excesses committed in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> at the <hi>Carnaval.</hi>
               </note> which may be stil'd
the time of the most excessive
Debauches, and of the most
enormous Crimes. The use
of Flesh is not allow'd of at that time, they
only use Butter, wherewith they commit
horrid excesses, and having melted it,
drink it as if it were a most delicious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100819:142"/>
Neither are they sparing of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and other Liquours of that kind:
Insomuch that all <hi>Muscovy,</hi> at that time,
is a wretched Empire, expos'd to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Vices. Violences, Persidiousness,
and Treasons, are committed in it Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously,
and woe to those Strangers, who
appear abroad at that time, without being
very well guarded.</p>
            <p>The disorders were yet much greater
formerly, and Murders more common,
than they are at present; however, I was
inform'd, that the first Night of those
brutish Rejoycings, to the end of which
we were oblig'd to tarry; above forty
Persons were kill'd in the City of <hi>Moscow</hi>
only, and that the People, who out of a
strange Impious Superstition, draw good
or ill Omens for that year, according to
the number of those that are Murder'd
at that time, seem'd dissatisfied with the
inconsiderableness of that small number,
which was nothing, in comparison of the
preceeding years.</p>
            <p>At that very time the

               <note place="margin">Marriage of the youngest <hi>Czars.</hi>

to all the City by the sound of the great
Bell, which is one of the finest in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100819:142"/>
World. It contains about 20 Foot Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
40 in height, and at this very time
a Cubit in thickness, altho' they have been
oblig'd to take away 40000 pound of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
from it, to make it sound. As it is
extreamly Massy, the only way to sound
it, is to strike upon it with a Hammer,
which is seldome done but on <hi>Twelfth-day,</hi>
which is the greatest day of the year a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> or when the Prince
Marries.</p>
            <p>The Marriage of the <hi>Czars</hi> is seldom
published until it be perform'd, by reason
of the danger that would attend the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
of it sooner. For whereas it is
an establish'd Custom among them, never
to make any Alliance with a Foreign
Crown, they are oblig'd to chuse a Wife
in their own Dominions, among the
Daughters of their Subjects: But as the
Person they make choice of, is expos'd to
the Envy of the others, the vexation they
receive by that preference, inflaming them
to a desire of vengeance on their Rivals,
as well as on the Prince, by whom they
are refus'd; they are necessitated to take
the Precautions I have mention'd to avoid
those misfortunes that are but too frequent.</p>
            <p>The young Prince, within a few days
after his Marriage, was seiz'd with the
Falling-Sickness, a Distemper that is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
to all his Family. It was look'd
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100819:143"/>
upon at first, as an effect of the Jealousie
of the several Families that had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the Honour to which they
aspir'd, but this accident not being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with any other ill Consequences,
they continu'd the rejoycings that are
common on those occasions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Polish</hi> Envoy, finding <hi>Muscovy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
to its former Tranquility, set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for <hi>Poland;</hi> we accompany'd him
to the confines of <hi>Lethuania,</hi> from whence
we proceeded to <hi>Warsaw,</hi> where we met
a Protector, Heaven had rais'd us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
all our pass'd Sufferings, who
by his Credit open'd a way for us, as far
as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he caus'd us to be
Conducted, with as much Generosity as
good Fortune, as will be seen by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of this History.</p>

            <p>IF the constancy God inspires amidst the
greatest Misfortunes, that seem most
to oppose our designs, is a sensible
proof that God approves them, we
have a great deal of reason to believe,
that the discovery of a way to <hi>China</hi> by
Land, which we had undertaken, has
been agreeable to him, since, that far
from being disgusted, by all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
we have met in it, we never had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100819:144"/>
hopes of Success, than at the time
when they seemed altogether desperate.</p>
            <p>After the refusal we had from the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
we had but one resourse for the
execution of our Project, which was to
follow Count <hi>Syri</hi> into <hi>Persia,</hi> whose good
Intentions, seconded by his admirable
Qualifications, promis'd us a more pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous,
and more certain Success, than
that we had flatter'd our selves with till
then.</p>
            <p>Indeed,<note place="margin">Our perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy.</hi>
               </note> it was a very
great risque, to venture on
so long a Journey, after all
our pass'd Fatigues; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
dangers seem'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
our enterprize of going for <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
at a time when the War between
the Christians and the Infidels, seem'd to
shut up all the Avenues thither; but
what can be impossible, when seconded
by the Grace of God, we abandon our
selves to the care of Providence? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the dangerous conjunctures
of that time, we took our measures to
pass into the <hi>East,</hi> and to leave no means
unattempted to succeed therein.</p>
            <p>We apply'd our selves at
first to the Emperour's Envoy,<note place="margin">The Emperour's Envoy refuses us Passes.</note>
call'd <hi>Ierowski,</hi> who was at
<hi>Warsaw</hi> at that time, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he would not refuse us the Pass-ports
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100819:144"/>
we wanted to go to <hi>Vienna,</hi> from whence
we might easily repair to <hi>Buda,</hi> and from
thence to the first City, possess'd by the
Grand Seignior, upon the <hi>Danube.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Political Reasons having hinder'd
that Minister from favouring our Designs,
Heaven fortunately inspir'd us with the
thoughts of applying our
selves to the Great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of <hi>Poland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">We apply our selves to the Great General of <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </note> whom we
only knew by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and admirable things,
we had formerly been told,
and were still daily publish'd about him.
The Civility and Kindness he express'd
to us, the first time we had the honour to
speak with him, soon convinc'd us of the
truth of those reports; and we had lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to discover in the sequel, during
two Months time, in which we conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with him, that his Reputation, tho'
great, was much below his Merit.</p>
            <p>This Lord, the most love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">He receives us very kindly.</note>
and the most belov'd of
any in <hi>Poland,</hi> being inform'd
with all our past Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and with the Motive which made
us apply our selves to him, made us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sensible, from that very moment, that
he took a great deal of Interest in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
and how much he desir'd we should
rely upon him for the execution of our
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100819:145"/>
Enterprise. <q>My dear Fathers, said he,
embracing us, being <hi>French-Men,</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,
and Missionaries, as you are, you
need not question but I will be proud
to serve you: Whatever vexation you
have received from the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> by
the refusal of the Passage you desn'd of
them, I cannot be displeas'd with them,
for the trouble they have occasion'd
you, since it affords me an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to serve you. As the only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
your Zeal requires, is to put you
in a way to reach <hi>Constantinople,</hi> assure
your selves, that I will get you thither.
If you have no business here, prepare
your selves to go to <hi>Leopold</hi> with me,
and there we will take all necessary
measures for the Jonrney you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
for the Glory of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' Father <hi>Beauvollier,</hi>
and my self,<note place="margin">We follow him to <hi>Leopold,</hi> where he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd us two Months, at his Palace.</note> were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tired with the fatigues of
our return, and stood in
want of rest, we receiv'd
new Vigour, upon the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
assurances our generous
Protector was pleas'd to give us, and we
follow'd him full of Joy and Confidence
to <hi>Leopold,</hi> which is the place of his usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Residence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:100819:145"/>
As soon as we came there,<note place="margin">He dispatches two Couriers to secure us a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
               </note>
he dispatch'd two Couriers,
the one to the <hi>Hospodar</hi> of
<hi>Woldavia,</hi> and the other to
the Bashaw of <hi>Caminiec,</hi> who
were best able to favour our
Passage at that dangerous time.</p>
            <p>Besides his Application to
remove all the difficulties
that stood in our way,<note place="margin">We receive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary marks of his kindness, during our abode with him.</note> he
extended his care to our
Persons, with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
kindness. Being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that we had suffer'd
considerably in our last Voyage of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
he omitted nothing that was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to restore us to our former Health,
in order to enable us to perform that we
were shortly to undertake.</p>
            <p>He entertain'd us in his own Palace,
in which he gave us a fiue conveniont A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
and would in no wise permit us
to Lodge with our Fathers, that are settl'd
at <hi>Leopold.</hi> We remain'd there about two
Months, in expectation of the return of the
Couriers; during which time, we sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
discover'd the singular favour we had
receiv'd from Heaven, in the Potent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the incomparable Palatin of
<hi>Russia,</hi> whose Holy Example serv'd as
much to animate our Zeal for the Service
of God, as his Eminent Qualifications,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100819:146"/>
to challenge our admiration of him.</p>
            <p>This Illustrious General,<note place="margin">Character of the Great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note>
whose Heroick Actions have
render'd his Name as formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
to the Enemies of the
Faith, as venerable in all
<hi>Europe,</hi> possess'd, to the highest degree,
all the advantages of Mind and Body, that
may concur towards the forming of an
accomplish'd Heroe. His Air is Noble,
his Port Majestick, his Heart Great, his
Genious Incomparable, his Humour A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
his Behaviour Charming; he
is Learn'd, Curious, Magnificent, Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
Prudent in all his Military Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Undaunted in Danger, Bold in all
his undertakings for the good of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the advantage of the State.</p>
            <p>But that which surpasseth all his Noble
Qualifications, is, the solid Piety he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses,
the which he joyns so admirably
to the Functions of his Place, that he
passes for the Bravest and most Religious
Lord in <hi>Poland</hi> He daily allows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
two or three hours for Prayer, he
hears several Masses every Morning, he
employs a considerable time in reading
of Books of Devotion, he often partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates
to the Holy Misteries, and always
disposes himself to that great Action, by
a Rigorous Fast. Altho' he is a severe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
of Vertue, his Conversation is sweet
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100819:146"/>
and ingaging: He argues incomparably
well upon all Subjects, insomuch that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body delights in his Conversation;
he loves to be among the Learn'd, and
is seldom without some about him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, he delights in discoursing of
Mathematicks and History. We have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
had the honour to pass the best part
of the Night with him, to observe some
Constellations, and some Planets, with
several fine Mathematical Instruments he
sometimes employs. Besides all this, he
has a very particular Respect for our
King.</p>
            <p>Having thus described some of the
Vertues of the Illustrious <hi>Iablonowski,</hi> no
body will be surpriz'd at the high Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
wherewith Heaven rewards his
Merit, and has given him the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
Family, that can possibly be
seen. Besides, the two Palatines of <hi>Plock</hi>
and of <hi>Posnania</hi> his Daughters, who are
two Models of Vertue for all the <hi>Polish</hi>
Ladies to imitate, he has three Sons, who,
like their August Father, are the delights
of all <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two first have already some of
the most considerable employments in
the Army, where they distinguish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
not only by their Bravery, and

by their Regular Christian Behaviour,

from the Incomparable Palatine, her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
I do not in the least wonder at

            <p>While we began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

Protection of our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Benefactor, we were
inform'd, with a great deal
of trouble, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
Envoy, I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mention'd, us'd all his Interest to
cross our designs, and to create Jealousies
about us. He was not satisfied with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
refus'd us the Passports we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
of him, but he us'd, moreover, his
utmost endeavours, both by word of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100819:147"/>
Mouth and in Writing, to ruin our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
with the Great General of <hi>Poland.</hi>
Nay, more, he prevail'd with Persons of
great Note to do the same. They did all
they could to perswade him that we were
dangerous Spyes; and publickly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that we had taken the exact Plan of
the strongest places in <hi>Poland,</hi> to make a
present of them to the Grand Seignior.</p>
            <p>But all their attempts prov'd vain, the
Person they went about to perswade, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
too much Sence and Generosity to
be impos'd upon by them. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their earnest Sollicitations, the
Motives of which we did not discover till
we came into <hi>Moldavia:</hi> We still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
new favours from the great Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
of <hi>Russia,</hi> who, far from forsaking
us, daily loaded us with fresh Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
being fully perswaded that their Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity
against us was very ill grounded.
He sufficiently testify'd, on all occasions,
that his Sentiments were much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
for us, than those they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to inspire in him; and that he
was very well satisfy'd with the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Intentions, by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
care he took to secure us the Passage,
which his Zeal for the Glory of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
him to procure for us.</p>
            <p>The two Couriers, we had expected so
long, being arriv'd with the most favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100819:148"/>
answers we could expect, the Great
General thought it more proper for us to
go by the way of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> than that
of <hi>Caminiec,</hi> whether he judg'd the first
less dangerous, or whether he did not
confide so much in the Basha, with whom
he had no great acquaintance, as he did
in the Hospodar, whom he look'd upon
as his particular Friend.</p>
            <p>The Sequel soon made
us sensible,<note place="margin">God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over us, in the Choice the Great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Poland</hi> mad for us, in the choice of the way of <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia,</hi> instead of <hi>Caminiec.</hi>
               </note> that this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
was a very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
effect of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God over us: For
soon after our arrival at
<hi>Yassy,</hi> which is the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> we
heard that some <hi>Armenians,</hi>
who had not been able to
joyn us to pass from <hi>Poland</hi>
to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had unfortunately met
a Party of <hi>Tartars,</hi> near <hi>Caminiec,</hi> who
had plunder'd them, and beaten them to
that degree, that they remain'd half dead
upon the spot.</p>
            <p>Besides these Judicious
precautions, which testify'd
the Zeal of our incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Benefactor for the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of our Journey,<note place="margin">His obliging care, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> have us safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
               </note> he gave
us many other sensible proofs
of his goodness, before our departure.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100819:148"/>
He did not only Equip us, and give us
whatever was necessary to defray
the Charges of our Journey, but he
oblig'd us, moreover, to take one of his
Servants along with us, to be our Guide
and Interpreter as far as <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
and a Guard of thirty <hi>Moldavian</hi> Troops,
whom he charg'd not to leave us, until
they had conducted us to the Hospodar.
He writ to that Prince, and other Persons
who could facilitate our Journey, in such
a manner, that we were received every
where, as if we had been his Children.</p>
            <p>But as considerable as all these favours
were, nothing made more impression up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, than the Tenderness and Affection
he express'd to us at parting: It wrought
so powerfully upon us, that it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for us to express our gratitude to
him, for all his extraordinary favours, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than by our Signs and Tears, to
which this Noble Lord shew'd us that he
was not insensible.</p>
            <p>Being thus loaded with
the Liberalities of the great
Palatin of <hi>Russia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Having cross'd <hi>Pokutia,</hi> we arrive at the confines of <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia.</hi>
               </note> and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by several of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
we cross'd part
of <hi>Podolia,</hi> and of <hi>Pokutia,</hi>
and lastly arriv'd at the Castle of <hi>Iablo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now,</hi>
from which the Illustrious Family of
the <hi>Iablonowski</hi> derives its Name. There
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100819:149"/>
we took the Guard which accompany'd
us to a small City of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> call'd
<hi>Campolongo,</hi> which the Great General has
made himself Master of, since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the War between the <hi>Poles</hi>
and <hi>Turks,</hi> to keep the <hi>Moldavians</hi> in
awe, and to hinder them from making
Incursions upon his Lands.</p>
            <p>Before we reach'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">We cross the Forest of the <hi>Boukovines,</hi> famous by the glorious actions of the Great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note>
we were oblig'd to
engage our selves in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Forest of the <hi>Bouko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
the extent of which
contains above forty Leagues,
the same which has been
made so famous by the
great Victories the Great
General of <hi>Poland</hi> gain'd there, some
years ago over the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi>
which came with numerous Forces, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Sultan <hi>Galga,</hi> with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to make an Irruption into <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Passage of the Forest
is very difficult,<note place="margin">The Passage of it is dangerous and uneasie.</note> the Roads
are bad and narrow, and
the Ground is soak'd every
where by a foul. Marshy
Water, which renders them almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.
However, we were necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to pass through it, and to follow
those oblique disagreeable Roads, the
end of which I thought we should never
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100819:149"/>
have seen. But the illness of the Way
was not the thing that troubled us most;
the surprize of the Thieves alarm'd us
yet much more: And as soon as we were
got a pretty way into that horrid Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
we discover'd several Separate
Bands of them; but our Conductors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
known to them, their Companions
no sooner perceiv'd them but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd.</p>
            <p>Thus we got safe out of the <hi>Boukovines,</hi>
and enter'd into the Plains of <hi>Moldavia,</hi>
where we Travell'd some time with more
satisfaction, than we had done in the
gloomy Forests we came out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moldava</hi> is one of the

in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Description of <hi>Moldavia.</hi>
               </note> There
are great Plains water'd by
divers Rivers, the chief of which is
the <hi>Moldava,</hi> which has turnings and
windings, not unlike the <hi>Seine;</hi> and
seems, throughout its whole extent, to
carry Plenty every where. Those Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
would certainly render those Plains
very Fruitful, and would contribute to
make that Province one of the Richest in
<hi>Europe,</hi> were it less expos'd to the Insults
of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars;</hi> but the Forces,
that the one and the other of them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually

have destroy'd it so much, that it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100819:150"/>
lies unmanur'd in many places, for want
of Inhabitants to Cultivate it, especially
in the Eastern part, which confines to

            </p>
            <p>Having cross'd those
Plains without any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Our arrival at <hi>Yassy,</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan of <hi>Moldavia.</hi>
               </note>
we arriv'd at <hi>Campolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
where we took a fresh
Guard, which Conducted
us with as much Fidelity and Success as
the first, to the Metropolitan of <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi>
When we came near to it, we
sent our Interpreter before, according to
our Orders from the Great General of
<hi>Poland,</hi> to present our humble Respects
to the Hospodar, until we were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to do it our selves.</p>
            <p>We really expected much from the
Recommendations of the Grand General,
and the Letters he had given us for that
Prince; but yet had we been able to foresee
the effect they were to produce, we should
have begg'd that Palatin to moderate his
kindness, and to spare us a little more.
The <hi>Hospodar,</hi> who had more regard for
the pressing Letters of the General, than
for our Character of Religious, put no
bounds to his Respects; and I question
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100819:150"/>
whether he could have done more to the
Ambassadors of the greatest Prince on
Earth.</p>
            <p>As soon as he had notice
of our arrival,<note place="margin">How were we receiv'd by the <hi>Hospodar.</hi>
               </note> he assign'd us
a convenient house, and the
same day he sent us one of
his Secretaries, to Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
our Arrival, and to let us know
that he was impatient to see us. The next
day he sent us his Coach, and a Guard of
fifty Souldiers, together with the Lord
Chancellour's Son to be our Interpreter:
We were Conducted in this manner to
his Palace, where the <hi>Hospodar</hi> expected
us. All the Militia was in Arms in very
good order, from our Lodgings to the
Court. Being alighted, we found two
Gentlemen who tarry'd for us to lead us
to the Audience. They lead us under
the Arms up a pair of Stairs of about
thirty steps, and so into the great Hall,
where the Barons of the State did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Assemble. There were a great
many of them there at that time; we sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
them as we pass'd along, and then
went up to the Prince's Closet, at the
Door of which we met the Master of
the Ceremonies, who introduc'd us.</p>
            <p>As soon as we appear'd,<note place="margin">The Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we had with him.</note>
the <hi>Hospodar</hi> arose from his
Throne, and stept forward
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100819:151"/>
to receive us. He entertain'd us with all
the Civility imaginable, above two hours
long.</p>
            <p>We made our Compliment to him, to
which he answer'd in a very obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
after which, having commanded us
to sit down, he turn'd the Conversation
upon the Conquests of our King, of
which we gave him a particular account,
wherewith he was very much delighted,
as it appear'd by the obliging words he
spoke to us, as we were going; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
then to have forgot his Rank and
Dignity, <hi>Dear Fathers,</hi> said he to us,
<hi>since the King, whom you have the honour to
belong to, and under whose Influence you
are going to Preach the Gospel to the utmost
extremities of the World, is so accomplish'd
a Monarch, that he challenges admiration
from all the Earth, I beg your Friendship
as a Favour, that I may have the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the future, to reckon among my
Friends two Subjects, and two Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
belonging to so great a Monarch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We did not expect to receive such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
at that Prince's Court; and though
we had foreseen it, we could not have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
it, considering the great Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
he had receiv'd from the
Great General of <hi>Poland,</hi> who had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to him, and to all the Officers of his
Acquai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100819:151"/>
Children, and to be as tender of us as of his
own Eyes.</p>
            <p>It was the <hi>Hospodar</hi>'s Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to receive us as he did,<note place="margin">The true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the <hi>Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spodar</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us as he did.</note>
thereby to cover the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
he was framing against
<hi>Poland,</hi> the which we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
soon after our arrival,
notwithstanding all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions
to keep it from our knowledge.
I will relate the reality of this Intrigue in few
words, the which this Envoy <hi>Ierowski</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to keep us ignorant of, by opposing
our passage through <hi>Moldavia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantin Cantemir</hi> Hospodar of <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
being conscious of the piece of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
he had been guilty of four or five years
ago towards the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> fear'd with
reason, that should his Territories once be
subjected to that Crown, the King would
be reveng'd of the infidelity he committed
during the Campaign of <hi>Budziac:</hi> He had
promis'd the King, who advanc'd as far as
<hi>Iassy,</hi> the Metropolis of his Territories, to
take an Oath of Allegiance to him, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
to acknowledge his dependancy on
<hi>Poland,</hi> and to supply his Army with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Provisions: But while he amus'd
that Prince within a League of the City by
the Deputies he continually sent to him, he
fled another way with the Inhabitants, who
carry'd away whatever they could remove.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100819:152"/>
The King enter'd the City with his Army,
which committed great Spoils there, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
it to the miserable Condition in which
we have seen it.</p>
            <p>This violence of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
tho just,<note place="margin">The Emperours makes Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, to put themselves under Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> contributed
very much to incense the <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davians</hi>
against the <hi>Poles,</hi> and
particularly a considerable
number of <hi>Grecians</hi> who are
the chief Boyers of that little
Court. They willingly hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
to the Propositions that were made to
them from the Emperour, by a Deputy who
was sent thither on purpose, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
each other an inviolable secrecy, which
they swore upon the Holy Gospel. The
<hi>Hospodar</hi> oblig'd the Illustrious <hi>Mir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> Lord
High Chancellour of the State, to take the
same Oath, altho' both he, and all his
Family, and the Great General of <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
his Kinsman seem'd very much affected
to the Interest of <hi>Poland,</hi> but he could not
oblige him to Sign that Treaty, without
reiterated menaces of cutting-off his Head, and
to extirpate his Family, which is the most
considerable in that Province.</p>
            <p>This Treaty,<note place="margin">Articles of the Treaty between the Emperour, and the <hi>Hospo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar.</hi>
               </note> which had
been lately concluded, and
which all the <hi>Boyars</hi> had been
oblig'd to Sign, consisted of
five Articles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:100819:152"/>
I. The first was, that <hi>Moldavia</hi> should be
under the Protection and Dependancy of the
Emperour, for which tke <hi>Hospodar</hi> should
be oblig'd to pay him a Tribute of Fifty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Crowns.</p>
            <p>II. The Second, That the Emperour should
furnish him a sufficient Body of Men to
force the <hi>Poles</hi> out of <hi>Campolongo,</hi> and
other Places of <hi>Moldavia</hi> in which they
kept Garrisons, and that he should assist him,
whenever he should be ingag'd in War against
<hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. The Third, That the said Emperour
in his Treaty of Peace with the <hi>Port,</hi> should
oblige the Grand Seignor to set the <hi>Hospo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi>'s
Eldest Son at Liberty, whom he kept
as an Hostage at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. The Fourth, That the Principality of
<hi>Moldavia</hi> should be Hereditary to the Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
of the <hi>Hospodar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. The Fifth, Finally, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
should allow the Schismaticks the free
Exercise of their Religion, and that he should
never press the <hi>Moldavians</hi> to be re-united to
the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:100819:153"/>
This Treaty was just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
when we arriv'd at
<hi>Iassy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Agent who manag'd this Treaty, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at our Arrival.</note> and the Agent who had
been imploy'd about it, was
very much concern'd at our
coming there, lest we should
disabuse the Court from all the false Reports
he had spread against <hi>France,</hi> to gain his
Ends the better. And indeed we did so,
even before we had heard any thing about
the Treaty, and discover'd the falsity of the
News he had spread that the <hi>French</hi> had been
totally Defeated near the <hi>Danube,</hi> thereby,
as he thought, to give a greater Idea of the
Emperour's Power.</p>
            <p>We had the satisfaction to see that Court
absolutely undeceiv'd in what related to
<hi>France,</hi> during our short abode there, and
to inspire them with Sentiments very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from those they had before our Arrival.
And this without doubt was the Reason
which induc'd the <hi>Hospodar</hi> to treat us yet
more respectfully, and with greater kindness
at our last Audience, than he had done at
the first. I am apt to believe that his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
at that time put him to a great
loss at present: But the Evil is done, and I
doubt it will not be long before he finds the
effect of it, and that the <hi>Polanders,</hi> or the
<hi>Turks,</hi> to punish him for endeavouring to
withdraw from under their Dominions, will
totally ruine that wretched Principality, the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100819:153"/>
which without having had any War, is at
present the most ruinated Province in
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Hospodar</hi> detain'd us
a Week at <hi>Iassy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Hospodar</hi> gives us Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for the <hi>Seraskier</hi> of the <hi>Turks.</hi>

the <hi>Serasquier,</hi> who was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd

We receiv'd them at last at the coming out
of the last Audience the <hi>Hospodar</hi> was pleas'd

            <p>While we were imploy'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

that he preserv'd the same tenderness for us,
which he had formerly given us such signal
proofs of. Altho' it proceeded from a Heart
a little too prepossess'd in our Favour; I
cannot forbear incerting it here, to avoid
the just reproaches I should be liable to, should
I suppress any of the Favours we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

the General of <hi>Poland</hi>
gave us,<note place="margin">We cross the remainder of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and arrive at the <hi>Turkish</hi> Camp.</note> of the continuance of
his kindness, supported us in
all our Journey. We departed
from <hi>Iassy</hi> with the Convoy the <hi>Hospodar</hi>
gave us, and after four days March we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at <hi>Galatz,</hi> which is a small Town Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> where we found a
Bark ready, which conducted us safe to the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Camp, which was about 5 hours di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from thence.</p>
            <p>As soon as the <hi>Seraskier</hi>'s Lieutenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
notice of our arrival, he assign'd us a
House in the nearest Burrough to the Camp,
and sent some <hi>Ianissaries</hi> to secure us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100819:155"/>
the injuries we might have receiv'd
from the Souldiers of the Army. He us'd
us thus Civilly, because he had been inform'd
by our Convoy that we were <hi>French-men,</hi>
and that the King had done us the Honour
to send us with the Quality of his Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians.</p>
            <p>The next day the <hi>Seraskier</hi>
from whom we had desir'd
an Audience to deliver the
Letters we had receiv'd from
the <hi>Hospodar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Seras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kier</hi> gives us an Audience.</note> sent us a <hi>Chaoux</hi>

<hi>Turkish</hi> Horses Richly Harnass'd, to conduct
us to him, and thereby to evidence the great
Respect the <hi>Ottomans</hi> bear to our Great

            <p>As we had been oblig'd to disguise our
selves, to pass more securely through all
those Schismatical Infidel Countries, where
our Cloathing would have expos'd us to
many affronts, we found our selves once
more engag'd to play a part that did not
please us, the which we retain'd no longer,
than while we judg'd it proper to advance
the Work of God, which we had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
            <p>We went in State, being conducted by
the General's Officers to deliver the Letters
we had receiv'd from the <hi>Hospodar</hi> of <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia.</hi>
The <hi>Seraskier</hi> who expected us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Tent, surrounded by all his <hi>Icoglans</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:100819:155"/>
Richly attir'd, receiv'd us with an air altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grave and serious, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and having answer'd our
Complement pretty civilly, he told us that
he had order'd his <hi>Kiaia</hi> to give us satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in what we had to propose to him.
We were better pleas'd with
the reception of this Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army,<note place="margin">We Visit his Lieutenant.</note>
than with the <hi>Seraskier</hi>'s. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and an Apostate,
he treated us with all the Civility imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
He presented us at first with the usual
Liquors, and Perfumes; he was very well
pleas'd with our Letters of Mathematicians,
and having some Skill himself in Geometry,
and Astronomy, he oblig'd us to entertain
himself a considerable time, and propos'd
some questions upon those Matters to us.</p>
            <p>While we were imploy'd
in explaining them to him, a
young Man enter'd his Tent
in great heat,<note place="margin">A vexatious Adventure, which happen'd to us in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Camp.</note> who having
kiss'd his Vest, deliver'd some
Letters to him from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raskier,</hi>
that had been intercepted some
days before near <hi>Kaminiec,</hi> the which he
had receiv'd that very moment. They had
been taken from a <hi>Polander,</hi> disguis'd like a
<hi>Tartar,</hi> and they having observ'd a Crown
in the Seal, imagin'd streight that they
came from the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100819:156"/>
we, who were lately come out of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's

the Contents of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seraskier</hi>'s Secretary, who was a
wretched Renegado, came into the Tent
where we were, with this wicked supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and shew'd us those Letters, and would
needs have it that we were acquainted with
the Secret that was hid under Ciphers which
he did not understand. He us'd his utmost
endeavours to discover the Mystery thereof,
he put several odd questions to us, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
nothing that he thought might put us to
a loss. However, we clear'd our selves,
notwithstanding all his Malicious Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and having acquainted the <hi>Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how much our profession was oppos'd to all
Worldly Intrigues, which we had long
since forsaken, to apply our selves intirely to
the Service of the true God; we told him, to
disabuse him quite, that those Letters came
from the King our Master's Ambassadour in
<hi>Poland,</hi> and that they were written to him
that he was sending to the Port, who would
be very much surpriz'd to hear that the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
who carry'd them had been thus unjustly
stop'd. We acquainted him at the same
time, in presence of the Secretary, with the
difference of the Coronets that are us'd in
<hi>Europe</hi> upon Coats of Arms, and explain'd
to them in general the manner of using Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
which they seem'd very well pleas'd
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100819:156"/>
with; and it also made them sensible that it
was impossible for us to unravel the Mystery
of the Cyphers they saw, which caus'd so
much jealousie in them.</p>
            <p>However, notwithstanding
they seem'd satisfy'd with our
Sincerity,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> being jealous of us, confine us.</note> this unhappy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
created a thousand

we sent a Sloop to her to mind her of her

'tis most likely, by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Country: After
which we weigh'd our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors,
and put out to Sea with a favourable
Wind, which in a short time enabled us to
double the <hi>Golden Cape,</hi> and to discover the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100819:163"/>
Isle of <hi>Argentiere,</hi> where we Anchor'd, in
order to inquire about the Fleet of <hi>Algier,</hi>
which we had all along been in dread of,
not having as yet been able to hear any
thing about the Conclusion of a Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that Republick and <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We remain'd two whole
days in that Road,<note place="margin">We meet the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet</note> and could
not put out to Sea until the
Second of <hi>November,</hi> upon
which, being favour'd by a fair Wind, we
pass'd by the Isles of <hi>Sapienza,</hi> having met
the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet by the way, Steering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Coron:</hi> having pass'd the Golf of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
we discover'd the point of <hi>Sicilly</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
night. However, we were somewhat
disquieted all Night, about a Fire we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
at a distance; some imagin'd it was
the Lanthorn of a Ship that Conducted
some Squadron, which oblig'd us to stand
upon our guard, and to prepare our Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
in case of need: Others on the contrary
affirm'd, that this Fire proceeded from <hi>Mount
Gibel,</hi> which was within ken; but the next
day we discover'd the falsity of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
when we came over against the
Cape of <hi>Passaro.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> keep a
Garrison there in a kind of Fort, which they
have built for the security of the Coast, and
as soon as they discover any Ship, they are
oblig'd to light Beacons from space to space,
to warn the Country People to precaution
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100819:163"/>
themselves against the Pirates that land but
too often there.</p>
            <p>While we doubled that Cape, <hi>M. de
Persin</hi> put on the Signal to give notice to the
Barks, and the <hi>Tartane</hi> to draw near to his
Ship, to be in a posture of defence, in case
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gallies should appear. Some
time after we discover'd the
Isle of <hi>Maltha,</hi>
               <note place="margin">We pass over against <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha.</hi>
               </note> which lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
20 Leagues from Cape
<hi>Passaro.</hi> We met with a
Storm in that place, which
was follow'd with some Whirlwinds, and
great Claps of Thunder, after which the
Wind becoming favourable to us, we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as far as the Isle of <hi>Panteleria,</hi> which
notwithstanding the smallness of it, yields
very considerable Revenues to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
who are Masters of it. We remain'd two
days in sight of that Island, being surpriz'd
by a great Calm there, occasion'd by the
extraordinary heat of the weather; but a
Southerly Wind happily arising, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
our Course, and soon after discover'd
the Cape of <hi>Bonae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a point of <hi>Africk</hi> where
there is no Fort,<note place="margin">Precauti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ns of those of <hi>Tunis</hi> to desend their Coasts.</note> but those of
<hi>Tunis</hi> keep a Beacon there for
the security of their Ships, and
of the Inhabitants of the
Country, which a <hi>Maharbou</hi>
or <hi>Dervich,</hi> who makes Penance there, takes
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100819:164"/>
care to kindle, to give notice, by as many
fires as he makes, of the number of Sails he
discovers.</p>
            <p>On the left hand of this Cape, stands the
Fort of <hi>Galipa,</hi> scituate upon a very high
narrow Promontory, almost inaccessible,
where the Cannons that are very numerous,
are capable to defend the place from all
parts, and to hinder the approaches of the
Enemy. While we were considering all this,
the South-East-Wind encreas'd to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that we did run about three Leagues
an hour, and we soon lost sight of the Isles
of <hi>Sembrow.</hi> Had it continu'd, we had soon
come within sight of <hi>Sardinia;</hi> but about
Midnight it turn'd to North-West, and
tormented us strangely all the remainder of
the Night.</p>
            <p>This tossing and rowling
of the Ship which agitated us
by turns,<note place="margin">We are oblig'd to put into <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> by stress of Weather.</note> discompos'd us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly,
and the Contrary
Winds, which from time to
time occasion'd Whirlwinds, took from us
all hopes of doubling the Isles of St. <hi>Peter</hi> so
soon as we had expected, and the Wind still
rising more and more, insomuch that we
could no longer resist it, we were oblig'd to
put into <hi>Barbary,</hi> which we did on the <hi>14th</hi>
of <hi>November,</hi> and dropt our Anchors over
against <hi>Portofarine,</hi> which is a pretty good
Haven, and where the small City of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100819:164"/>
same name, is pretty well Situated to shelter
Ships from the great North-west, and West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly-Winds.
It is built at the foot of a high
Mountain, upon a Peninsula, where the
Ships may Ride securely. It belongs to those
of <hi>Tunis,</hi> whose Capital City is not above 7
Leagues from thence, and there is no other
way to it but through <hi>Goletta,</hi> where the
Famous City of <hi>Carthage</hi> formerly stood;
from whence you enter into a fine Lake,
upon which <hi>Tunis</hi> is Built.</p>
            <p>The North-West-Winds, which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencals</hi>
call <hi>Mistral,</hi> oblig'd us to remain in
that Road the <hi>15th,</hi> and <hi>16th.</hi> However
we did not remain idle there: Some of our
Men went into a small Island, where while
some were shooting Pidgeons, which were
very plenty there formerly, others imploy'd
themselves in Fishing with Success. They
took a Sea-Calf, which they wounded with
Fire-Arms, and then made an end of him
with Stones. The Flesh of it not being
eatable, they only took the Skin to make
Muffs and Pouches with it. They brought
it aboard with the Head fix'd to it. The
Skin was about the largeness of a small Oxe's
Hide: The Hair of it was extraordinary
thick and smooth, blackish at the top, with
two large whitish spots under
the Flanks,<note place="margin">A Sea Calf is taken.</note> it had no sign of
a Tail, and the four Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were limited with the four
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100819:165"/>
Finns, which this Animal equally uses in the
Water, and on the Shoar, where it often
spoils the Vines. Every one of the Finns
was arm'd with five pretty large black Nails.
The foremost appear'd considerably, whereas
the hindermost were hardly seen, being
cover'd with the Skin, and much smaller
than the first. The Head resembles that of
a Lyon, or a Leopard, excepting only that
you can see no Ears it has. I us'd my utmost
Endeavours to discover the Conduit of Sound,
and could not discover it until I had laid the
head quite bare, and then I perceiv'd two
small hairy Conduits, within three or four
fingers breadth of the Eye, which abutted to
two little holes almost imperceptible, which
I discover'd with a Probe upon the Skin. Its
Tongue is very short and thick, the Jaws
and Nostrils are like a Bulls, whose Bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it imitates exactly, as I was told by those
who took it, and heard it as it was strugling
for Life.</p>
            <p>While we were thus agreeably imploy'd in
our Ship, we discover'd four Sail coming
from behind the point of the Mountain which
covers the Road where we had Anchor'd,
which frighten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d us at first; but we soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
our fright, seeing them keep very
close to the Shore; whereby we sound that
they were only Privateers. And indeed it
was only a Squadron of four small Ships
belonging to <hi>Tunis,</hi> which were going to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100819:165"/>
               <hi>Porto-Sarino,</hi> with a Prize they had taken,
which our <hi>Adventurer</hi> would have regretted
Eternally, had he not been Inform'd soon
after, that a Peace was concluded with
<hi>Algier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We heard the next day that
<hi>Mezzomorto</hi> Dey of <hi>Algier</hi>
had pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Cruising thereabouts, he was carry'd to <hi>Porto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farino,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Tunis,</hi> where he
was kept a while.</p>
            <p>The next day being the

               <note place="margin">We reach <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and Anchor before <hi>Cagliari.</hi>
               </note> we put to

<hi>Sardinia,</hi> after having
discover'd the Isle of <hi>Guerite,</hi> otherwise call'd
<hi>Fratelly,</hi> by reason of two small Points that
are discover'd from afar. At Night the
Wind fail'd us, and then turn'd against us to
a North West: However, we still endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to continue our Course, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
a great Sea that tormented our Ship
exceedingly, we made a shift to reach the
Cape of <hi>Poule,</hi> near the Gulf of <hi>Cagliari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were oblig'd to tarry all the Night at
the Cape, for fear of coming too near the

into the Gulf, there to Anchor and to refit
our Ship which was much disabled by the

on the dismal Adventure
of <hi>Mezzomorto</hi>'s Wife, the
same who pass'd before us two or three days
before. That Queen was Daughter to the
President of <hi>Cagliari,</hi> who was sending her
under the Conduct of one of her Brothers
into <hi>Spain,</hi> there to be Marry'd to one of
the Grandees of the Kingdom. They were
no sooner got out of the Port, but they were
surpriz'd by the <hi>Algerines,</hi> who having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
them without any difficulty, carry'd
their Prize directly to <hi>Algier.</hi> The young
Slave pleas'd <hi>Mezzomorto,</hi> who omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on his side to gain her. She made use
of that Dey's kindness for her to obtain leave
for her Brother to go back to <hi>Sardinia</hi> there
to fetch their Ransom, which that Prince
granted her; but still without discontinuing
his pursuits, against which this Generous
Heroin defended her self bravely. Finally,
the Brother came back, after some Weeks
absence, and paid the Ransom that had been
agreed on, for his Sister, and for himself;
which being done, this young Maid, who
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100819:166"/>
till then had express'd so much bravery of
Mind, seeing the Ship ready to set Sail,
chang'd her resolution all of a sudden, and
turn'd <hi>Mahometan</hi> to Marry the Dey, who
is at present as well as her self, Chastiz'd for
her Insidelity, and his Abjuration of the
Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>The following day being the <hi>20th,</hi> we
put out to Sea again, in order to endeavour
to reach the Isles of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a hundred Miles distant from us. The
Wind having been long uncertain, at last
became favourable for us, and we doubled a
considerable part of that great Island before
Night, but it soon turn'd about again, and
made us pay severely for the short repose we
had enjoy'd part of the day. Never was
any Ship more agitated by Wind and Sea
than ours was at that time, or expos'd to
more frequent Whirl-winds, and never did
any Man take more pains than M. <hi>de Perin</hi>
on that occasion. Heaven rewarded him the
next day for his assiduity and vigilancy, for
the preservation of those that had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his Charge.</p>
            <p>It was on the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> being the
day of the Presentation of the Virgin, that
we discover'd about break of day a Ship, at
sight of which we immediately prepar'd for a
Combat. When we came within ken, we
putout our Colours to oblige her to discover
her self; but she not answering our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100819:167"/>
we fir'd some Guns at her which made
no Execution, by reason that we were at
too great a distance. The Wind driving
her upon us against her will, she endeavour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
to deceive us by putting out <hi>French</hi> Colours;
but we soon discover'd the Cheat, by her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to avoid us, and to Steer another
Course. We began anew to fire briskly
upon her, whereat they being extreamly
daunted, she made a contrary motion to what
she had done till then. Whereupon we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
pull'd in all our Sails, to allow her
time to surrender; she was no sooner come
up to us, but our Captain commanded the
Patron to put out his Long-Boat, and to
come on board of him. The Wretch obey'd
and confess'd that he was a <hi>Majorcan,</hi> and
that his Ship was a good Prize. Monsieur
<hi>de Perin</hi> receiv'd him very kindly; and in
order to secure his Prize the better, he caus'd
all the Money, and all the Men that were in
her to be brought on board his own Ship,
and sent some of his own Men in their room,
with an Officer to conduct her during the
rest of the Voyage.</p>
            <p>Tho' this Encounter was very happy, we
could not forbear pitying the Fate of one of
the Passengers that was taken on Board that
small Ship. It was a Man of 70 years of
Age, who having made great Efforts to
raise the Ransom of an only Son, who had
been long a Slave at <hi>Algier,</hi> had embarqu'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100819:167"/>
himself at <hi>Majorca,</hi> in hopes of freeing him
securely. The misfortune he had had of being
taken and strip'd twice by Privateers before
in going to <hi>Algier</hi> upon the same account
had not discourag'd him, and he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither again with Joy and Confidence,
when he unfortunately fell into the hands of
an Enemy he little thought on.</p>
            <p>After this Expedition, we made up to the
Gulf of <hi>Palma,</hi> there to tarry for an Easterly
Wind, which we stood in need of, and to
allow the Sea time to Calm. All things
happen'd according to our desires, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had a very quiet night where we rode,
the next day being the <hi>22th,</hi> an Easterly
Wind arose, which having carry'd us by the
three Rocks that are over against that Gulf,
which are call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Having happily pass'd the Isles of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and of <hi>Casica,</hi> we discover'd the Coast of <hi>Provence.</hi>
               </note> and the

of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in an instant. We
lost sight of them the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
night, and found our
selves at break of day at the
Extremity of <hi>Sardinia.</hi> That
very day we pass'd the Mouths of <hi>Boniface,</hi>
where our Ship was very much tormented by
a great Sea; but finally, we got happily
out of them by a favourable Wind, which
having enabled us to double the Isle of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sica</hi>
in a short time, we discover'd the Coast
of <hi>Provence.</hi> However, notwithstanding our
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100819:168"/>
carnest desire of coming soon ashore, we
were oblig'd to sustain the rage of the N. W.
Winds for some few days, and to tarry at
the Isles of <hi>Yera,</hi> until the Sea was grown
calmer, so to continue our Course safely.
Finally, the Sea being calm'd, tho not so
soon as we desir'd it, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at <hi>Toulon</hi> on St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi>'s
day,<note place="margin">We arrive at <hi>Toulon</hi> the <hi>30th</hi> day after our departure fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It may be easily concluded from the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sincere Relation I have given of my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
that those who dedicate themselves to
an Apostolical Life, must make provision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the disquiets that attend their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
I leave to the Learned and
Zealous the liberty of judging of the design
that has been form'd for several years of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
a passage by Land into <hi>China,</hi> thro'
the Great <hi>Tartary,</hi> and other Countries, into
which the Lights of Faith have not yet been
able to penetrate.</p>
            <p>I am sensible that most of those who only
Judge of things by the exterior part, will
perhaps Condemn my long Travels, since
they have been of no use to the principal end
I did propose, and that I have never had the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100819:168"/>
happiness of seeing those happy Countries,
the Spiritual Conquest of which, had so much
flatter'd my hopes: But besides that, I find
a great Consolation in the Example of the
Apostle of the <hi>Indies,</hi> whom Heaven thought
fit to stop, when he thought himself nearest
to it: I am sure, that those who will reflect
on the different ways through which God
Almighty's Providence has been pleas'd to
lead me, will be oblig'd to confess that all
my Misfortunes have perhaps serv'd as much
to advance the Glory of his Name, as the
most happy and most easie success could have
done.</p>
            <p>And tho' we have not met with that full
Harvest, we expected to gather in our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
after being arriv'd to the term of our
Mission, yet we have convinc'd our selves by
the small taste we have had of it; of the
pleasure one injoys in Christning an Infidel,
in Instructing an Idolater, in Converting a
Heretick, and in gaining a Sinner; the more
than Paternal Tenderness of the great Master
whom we serve, having afforded us those
occasions, to apply our selves more fervently
to his Service.</p>
            <p>But tho' we had not found all those super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Consolations amidst all our Fatigues,
the happy Tidings we have receiv'd since of
the particular Blessings Heaven has been
pleas'd to pour upon our Travelling Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
who have expected us long in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>

us for all our past Labours, and makes
us sensible that we have not been stopt in the
midst of our Career, without a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Providence. It will appear evidently
by the Comfortable Letter we have receiv'd
from <hi>Hispaan,</hi> from one of those fervent Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionaries
whom God seems only to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd

a Jubilee was granted us, from our
Holy Father, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the

to make use of that favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
to set forth the Authority of his
Holiness, to the utmost of our Power, and
at the same time, to Establish several Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of our Holy Faith, in a City, which
we may call the <hi>Geneva</hi> of the <hi>Armenians,</hi>
and the Seat of their Heresie. In order to
succeed in an Enterprise so necessary for the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100819:170"/>
Glory of God, and so advantageous to all
Christians, whether Catholicks, or Hereticks;
we concluded, that our best way, was to act
jointly with all the Missionaries, that are
numerous in this place; and particularly with
Monsieur <hi>Pidou,</hi> Titular Bishop of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
who in Quality of Apostolical Vicar, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
his Holiness's Person in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

            </p>
            <p>In order to take just measures, and to do
all things with Order and Edification during
that Holy time; we thought fit to divide
the Exercise of the Jubilee, in the three Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Churches that are at <hi>Iulfa,</hi> the first
and most Ancient of which, is ours, not only
free for the <hi>Francs,</hi> whose Parish it is, but
also for the <hi>Armenians</hi> who frequent it. The
second is, that, which they call here, the
Church of the <hi>Cherimanis,</hi> who are five
Brothers, the chief Catholicks, and most
considerable <hi>Armenians</hi> of the Country. The
Church is Officiated with a great deal of
Zeal and Prudence, by the R. R. F. F. the
<hi>White Fryars,</hi> the Provincial of which, whose
Jurisdiction extends as far as the <hi>Indies,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
in this place. The third, is that of the
Reverend Fathers the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> which is
vacant by the Death of a Religious, who
was an <hi>Armenian</hi> by Birth, come from <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benner,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>Samson</hi> Missionary of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100819:170"/>
               <hi>Hamadam,</hi> has taken the care of that Church
upon him, until it be provided for.</p>
            <p>All things being thus regulated by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Approbation of every body; we pitch'd
upon the first Sunday in <hi>Lent</hi> to make the
overture of the Jubilee, and the third to close
it. But first, we got his Holiness's Bull
Translated into the <hi>Armenian</hi> Tongue, and
we made three Copies of it, which we A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd,
with his Holiness's Coat of Arms in
Gold, to please the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who have a
great Veneration for those kind of Bulls,
when they come to them from the Pope, or
from the Patriarch, and they call them Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Benediction.</p>
            <p>The Overture of this Jubilee should of
right, have been perform'd in one of the
<hi>Franc</hi> Churches, to make the <hi>Armenians</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that they ought to expect all their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as from
the Spring-head: But whereas, the main end
of this Jubilee, was to make, both the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Catholicks, and Hereticks, whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
we aim'd at, sensible, that the <hi>Francs</hi>
and the <hi>Armenians,</hi> were but one and the
same in Jesus Christ; we made no difficulty,
to allow the <hi>Armenians</hi> to have that Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
made in their Budding Church, and to
conclude it in ours, provided, that while a
Function should be perform'd in one Church,
all the Missionaries should assist at it, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100819:171"/>
assemble all the Catholicks of both sides
there.</p>
            <p>Thus the Overture of the Jubilee was made
on the first Sunday in <hi>Lent,</hi> being the 24th
of <hi>March,</hi> in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Catholick
Church of the <hi>Cherimanis,</hi> where a world of
People repair'd from all parts, to assist at
the Reading of the Letter of Benediction,
of the Holy Pontif of the Universal Church,
and to learn at the same time, whas was to
be done, to profit of the Favour he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to all Christians. The <hi>Latin</hi> Clergy,
compos'd of twelve Missionaries, all with
their Copes on, and as many <hi>Franc</hi> Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
all with Surplices, having the Lord
Bishop of <hi>Bagdat</hi> at the head of them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
there on one side, and on the other
the <hi>Armenian</hi> Clergy, compos'd of three
Priests, four or five Deacons, and abundance
of Children, imploy'd in the Service of that
Church, having at their Head two <hi>Vertabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,</hi>
Catholick Arch-Bishops, who declar'd
themselves of late, for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>This Solemnity began with High Mass,
which was Sung in <hi>Latin,</hi> with Dean and
Sub-Dean, by my Lord of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> assisted
by the other Missionaries, and our Scholars,
who on that occasion, did all things with as
much Exactness, Regularity, and Decency,
as if it could have been done in one of our
Cathedrals in <hi>France;</hi> at the Offertory, the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100819:171"/>
Arch-Bishop <hi>Michel,</hi> who resides in the
Church of the <hi>Cherimanis,</hi> advanc'd to the
middle of the Altar, and put his Holinesse's
Bull upon his head, after which he read it
with a laudible voice, and explain'd it in
few words: In the next place the R. F. <hi>Hely</hi>
Provincial of the R. R. F. F. the White
Fryars, who possesses the <hi>Armenian</hi> Tongue
perfectly, made a very fine Sermon, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the importance thereof more at large,
and at the same time to inform the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who are lately come to our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
what a Jubilee is.</p>
            <p>The Explication of the Bull being ended,
the Arch-Bishop took it into his hand again,
and made every body kiss it, and put it
upon their heads out of respect, beginning
by the Clergy, and ending by the <hi>Franc</hi>
and <hi>Armenian</hi> Catholicks. The Mass ended,
and the Benediction of the Holy Sacrament
given by my Lord of <hi>Babylone</hi> concluded
that first action, which was one of the most
Solemn of the Jubilee, by the sincere and
indissoluble Union it created between the two
<hi>Franc</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Churches, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of the Hereticks, and extream joy
and satisfaction of the Catholicks.</p>
            <p>The next day being the <hi>Monday</hi> of the
first week in <hi>Lent,</hi> all the Service was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
in our Church, which was as well
adorn'd as ever I saw any in <hi>France,</hi> with
great Tents of <hi>China</hi> Satin, Damask, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100819:172"/>
Tafeta, which set it off incomparably well.
In the morning I sung High Mass there,
the which was follow'd by the Benediction
of the Holy Sacrament according to Custom.
In the Evening after <hi>Complyne</hi>
was Sung,<note place="margin">Part of the Popish Even Song.</note> the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Provincial of the White
Fryars made an excellent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
upon the marks of the
true Church, at which abundance of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
were present out of Curiosity. The
Controversie was held in the form of a The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
maintain'd and defended by the same
Father, and Combated by the Assistants.
My Lord Bishop Argumented first, I was the
second, and Father <hi>Cherubin</hi> of the Order of
St. <hi>Francis</hi> was the third, and all in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi>
Tongue. The manner of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things debated on both sides by way of
Syllogisms was very agreeable to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<hi>Armenians</hi> in that City, who have a
great deal of wit, and are capable of those
kind of Disputes, particularly by reason that
their Litteral Tongue, as well as the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian,</hi>
does not want necessary Terms for
that way of Arguing. The Controversie
being ended, the R. F. <hi>Gaspar,</hi> a White
Fryar, Preach'd upon the Enormity of the
Mortal Sin, and after Sermon, this second
day ended with the Benediction of the Holy
Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:100819:172"/>
On the <hi>Tuesday</hi> every body repair'd to
the Church of the R. R. F. F. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,</hi>
Administred by Monsieur <hi>Samson</hi> in
the absence of those Fathers, and every
thing was done there as it had been done at
ours, excepting the Controversie. In the
Morning High Mass was sung there: The
Benediction given. In the Afternoon the
<hi>Complyne</hi> was Sung. The R. F. <hi>Cherubin</hi>
Preach'd upon the importance of Salvation.
The Benedictioa follow'd as in the Morning,
which ended the day.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Wednesday,</hi> which was the third
day of the <hi>Armenians</hi> Great Fast, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to the Church of the <hi>Cherimanis,</hi> there
to Celebrate the Ceremony of the Ashes,
which we thought fit to give them, in order
to use them incensibly to the Holy Practices
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Samson,</hi>
who has an excellent Tallent for Languages,
explain'd that Ceremony to them by a very
fine Sermon. After which my Lord Bishop
of <hi>Bagdat</hi> perform'd the Ceremony of the
Ashes, and Administred them to every body.
High Mass was Sung with Dean and Sub-Dean,
by our R. F. Superiour, and all
being ended, <hi>Coga Mourat,</hi> who is the third
of the <hi>Cherimanis,</hi> would needs treat the
Missionaries, as <hi>Coga Marvara</hi> his Brother
had done the preceeding <hi>Sunday:</hi> That
which afforded most matter of Consolation
in those two Banquets of Devotion, was,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100819:173"/>
That these Gentlemen, out of humility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
would needs serve us at Table them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
with their Children, who are the
Chief of that City, and all made Gentlemen
by the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> out of consideration
of the Services their Ancestours have done to
the Crown. The Repast being ended, we
went back to Church, where Father <hi>Hely</hi>
made a Controversie, as he had done before
with us, about the State of Souls after Death.
This Controversie was necessary to Cure the
<hi>Armenians</hi> of their Errour, in believing that
the Souls after the separation neither go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to Heaven, nor Hell, nor yet
in Purgatory; but that they are preserv'd in
a certain place which God assigns them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
at the Day of the Universal Judgment; they
are sent to their Eternal Abode, either Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
or Unhappy, according to the Merit of
their Actions. The Controversie was very
Solemn again, my Lord Argumented in it
as before, and after him our R. F. Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
and the R. F. <hi>Gaspar</hi> White Fryar.
The Benediction being given, and the
Complyne ended, every body retir'd.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Thursday, Friday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi>
High Masses, and Predications were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
as before, still with a great Concourse
of People, insomuch that there was a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Preaching twice a day, as had been done
the <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Tuesday</hi> before, and as we
did all the following week. On the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:100819:173"/>
which was the day on which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was to be perform'd in our Church,
the Arch-Bishop <hi>Michael Vertabiet</hi> Preach'd
about the Wrath of God, which extends so
far as to Condemn a Soul to the dreadful
Pains of Hell On the <hi>Friday</hi> the R. F. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
of the White Fryars, Preach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d upon
the Torments of the Damn'd, and the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Hell Fire against the Errour of the
<hi>Armenians,</hi> who are of Opinion, that after
some time God will have mercy on the Souls
that are in Torment, which they ground
upon some Traditions of their own, and the
Translation of their Fathers, whereby they
are taught that Jesus Christ by his Holy Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and by his Triumphant Resurrection
has vanquish'd and destroy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Hell. This
Sermon was Preach'd in the Church of the
R, R. F. F. <hi>Dominicans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following day which was the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
I Preach'd in the Church of the <hi>Cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis,</hi>
the terrible but yet certain truth of
the small number of the Elect, which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
every body; so much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I shew'd them that it was not only to
be understood of the Insidels and Hereticks,
but also of the Christians and Catholicks. I
observ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in this place, what I had formerly
observ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in <hi>France,</hi> in my Missions among
the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> that the best way to Convert
Hereticks and Schismaticks, is to Preach E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Truths to them, and the terrible
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100819:174"/>
Maximes of our Religion; which being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to them plainly, but yet pathetically,
strikes them, and obliges them to declare
here, what I have often heard them say in
<hi>France:</hi> Our Ministers and our Vertabiets
deceive us, and we have never heard this
from them.</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Saturday</hi> I did what I had done
before. I went from House to House to
Inculcate what had been said in the Churches,
and to dispose every body to gain the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee.
But I went particularly among the
Slaves, and other abandon'd Persons, to the
end that both Rich, and Poor, Blind, and
Lame, all might participate to that great
Banquet of the Father of the Family, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
was preper'd for all. They began to bring
Women to me who desir'd to be Converted,
and who having never been Confess'd by
any Catholick Priest, were willing to make
their Abjuration in the Tribunal of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>The second Sunday in <hi>Lent,</hi> which was
also the second Sunday of the Jubilee, was
very solemn, by reason of the Office that
was perform'd in the Church of the R. R.
F. F. <hi>Dominicans;</hi> High Mass was Sung
there by my Lord of <hi>Pidou,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Preach'd an Excellent Sermon upon
the Subject of Receiving the Sacrament un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily.
That Prelate is sufficiently known
in <hi>France,</hi> both by the Greatness of his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100819:174"/>
Birth, and by the Missions he has made
in <hi>Poland,</hi> especially at <hi>Leopold,</hi> where
jointly with the Famous <hi>Clement Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Theatin,</hi> his Master, he has establish'd
a very fine College, maugre all opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for the instructing of the <hi>Armenians.</hi>
As this Prelate is perfectly acquainted with
the Errours of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> having
read all their Books, besides his being very
well vers'd in their Tongue, he Combats
their Superstitions in a way which they can
no wise answer. The Devotion was great
on the day that Prelate Preach'd. A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
was held in the Afternoon upon the
particular Judgment, and the rest as before.</p>
            <p>The next day, being Pope St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s
Day, so much Reverenc'd by all the Eastern
Nations, and even by the <hi>Armenians,</hi> whose
Schism and Heresie he Condemns, absolutely
ordering all People to submit to the four
first <hi>Oecumenical</hi> or General Councils, and
consequently to that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in the
same manner as they submit to the four
Evangelists: We thought it Very necessary
to render the Name and Memory of that
incomparable Doctor of the Church yet
more Famous in a Place where his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
could be of use. Therefore his Festival
was Solemniz'd with all the Pomp that could
be in our Church; where all the Religious
assisted with their Copes on, and our Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100819:175"/>
in Surplices, as the Seminarists are in
<hi>France.</hi> High Mass was Sung by Monsieur
<hi>Samson,</hi> and Celebrated with all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
and Exactness imaginable. And
whereas he speaks the <hi>Armenian</hi> Tongue
perfectly well, he made a very moving and
very pressing Sermon about the Love and
Charity we ought to have towards our
Enemies. He shew'd a Crucifix, and drew
Tears from all the Auditors. The rest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
as before.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Tuesday</hi> there was nothing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wednesday</hi> was Famous by a solemn
Service we made for the Souls of the Dead,
in order thereby to Establish the Truth of
Purgatory, which the <hi>Armenians</hi> reject. We
had erected a Monument in the middle of
the Church, very neat, and very full of
Lights. The Altar was cover'd with Black
Velvet and Satin. The R. F. Provincial of
the White Fryars Sung High Mass upon it,
and Preach'd about Purgatory. He shew'd
that the practice of Praying for the Dead,
was very necessary, and Holy. After which
the Solemn Absolution was pronounc'd round
about the said Monument, and all ended with
the Benediction of the Crucifix, which was
expos'd, as it is Customary, in several of our
Churches in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:100819:175"/>
All these Ceremonies being practis'd with
Majesty and Devotion, move the <hi>Armenians</hi>
extreamly, and inspire them insensibly with
Love for our Holy Religion. For which
Reason, they say that <hi>Rome</hi> is above all, and
that they see nothing like it among them;
they confess freely, as I have already observ'd,
when they hear us Preach, that their Verta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biets
who are Reverenc'd among them as
their Chief Doctors, cannot do it; thus by
degrees they fall off from them, and join with
us, out of Esteem and Affection.</p>
            <p>The Morning Service being thus ended,
a Controversie was held in the Afternoon,
about the same Purgatory. The <hi>Armenians,</hi>
who had relish'd the preceeding Disputes,
came to propose their difficulties themselves,
to the end, that they might not have any
thing to reproach themselves with upon that
Subject. Finally, to show that the Union
we desir'd to Establish between the <hi>Latin</hi> and
<hi>Armenian</hi> Church, was not only an Union in
relation to Living Persons, but that it ought
also to extend to the Dead; we went all in a
Body to the Church-Yard, to pray upon the
Graves of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Catholicks. The
<hi>Armenian</hi> Priests, who Officiate at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church of the <hi>Cherimanis,</hi> perform'd
at the Graves of ours, what we had done at
theirs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Thursday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> pass'd as usually,
excepting, that my Lord Preach'd on the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100819:176"/>
               <hi>Friday</hi> at the <hi>Cherimanis,</hi> upon the Subject
of Receiving the Sacrament Worthily; and
at Night, the R. F. <hi>Hely,</hi> made another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
upon the two Kinds, which the
<hi>Armenians</hi> pretend ought to be Receiv'd at
the Holy Communion, and upon the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that lies upon the Catholick Priests, to
put Water into the Chalice at the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Mass. The <hi>Armenian</hi> Priests
and the other Assistants, propos'd their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
upon the Article with more heat than
before.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Saturday,</hi> the concourse of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was very great in the Church of the
R. R. F. F. <hi>Dominican,</hi> but especially of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi>
Catholick Women, being drawn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the report, that the <hi>Armenian</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
where to Sing Mass, and to perform
a Solemn Service there. It was perform'd
with all the Majesty their Church is capable
of, which indeed, neither wants fine Musick,
nor fine Ceremonies, as I have often seen it
my self, especially at <hi>Iehmiarin,</hi> which is
their Patriarchal Church, where their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
and other Arch-bishops and Bishops
Officiate, with an Order and Exactness, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
inferior to that which is practis'd in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Churches of <hi>France.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
Preached upon the Subject of Back-biting
and Reviling.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Saturday,</hi> abundance of People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to take the Sacrament at the <hi>Cherimanis;</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:100819:176"/>
but the most Solemn Action of all the Jubilee
was, the last which was perform'd in our
Church, for the conclusion of it, we took all
necessary measure to render the general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
that was to be perform'd the most
Solemn that possibly could be, and to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize
the Procession of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that was to conclude all with Success,
Pomp, and Devotion. In order whereunto,
we Adorn'd our Church beyond what it was
before, and took from the other Churches,
all the Ornaments that could contribute to
render that Festival the more Solemn. As
for the out-side, we dispos'd the walks of
our Garden in such a manner, that the Holy
Sacrament might pass very conveniently
through them. At the same time we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
all things necessary to make a Volly
of Shot, with the Muskets and small pieces
of Ordinance, of a reasonable size, which
we fortunately found among our <hi>Francs:</hi>
We caus'd a very fine Canopy to be made,
adorn'd with a fine Curtain of green Damask,
supported by four painted sticks, adorn'd with
four fine knobs ont he top, without mentioning
the neatness of the Altar we had Erected in
the middle of the Garden, to serve as a
Repository or Resting place for the Holy
Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The Report of this Solemnity, assembled
such a prodigious number of People, betimes
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100819:177"/>
in the Morning, that our Church was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
fill'd up; in so much, that we
were oblig'd to place Ladders, for People to
get up into the Galleries. In the mean time,
the Missionaries were imploy'd in all parts
to Confess People. The time of the Service
being come, those that were to Officiate,
where plac'd in such a manner, that the
<hi>Latin</hi> Clergy was on the Right, in the
Quire, and the <hi>Armenian</hi> Clergy with two
Vertabets and an Arch-Bishop, on the Left;
both the one and the other were Dress'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Custom of their Country,
with Surplices, Stoles, and Copes. The
Spectacle charm'd every body. High-Mass
was begun with more Solemniry than ever.
The Bishop Officiated with the Deacon and
Sub-Deacon: When they came to <hi>Gloria in
Excelsis,</hi> it was first Sung in <hi>Latin,</hi> and
then in <hi>Armenian:</hi> The Epistles and Gospels
were Sung in the same manner. After our
Creed, an <hi>Armenian</hi> Priest made a Solemn
Profession of Faith, in the Name of all the
Members of his Church, sounding the Name
of <hi>Alexander</hi> the VIIIth, whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
as their Chief and Pope: That being
done, our young Scholars Sung their Himns
in <hi>French,</hi> and the young <hi>Armenians</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
them in their own Tongue. This
variety of Singing of Hymns, and Praises
offer'd to God, lasted as long as the Mass,
in so much, that every body Triumph'd with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100819:177"/>
Joy to see that Union, which had never been
seen before in that City, where besides their
Natural Aversion to the <hi>Francs,</hi> they are
the most obstinate in their Heresie of any in
all <hi>Armenia.</hi> But the general Communion
which was perform'd at the same time, was a
spectacle capable to rejoice the very Angels.
The young Children, both <hi>Armenians</hi> and
<hi>Francs,</hi> were the first that drew near the
Holy Table, and after them, the Men and
Women separately. During all this time,
the Church sounded with <hi>Franc</hi> and <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Hymns. Never was so much Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

in <hi>Iulfa,</hi> or in all <hi>Armenia.</hi> The <hi>Francs</hi>
and <hi>Armenians,</hi> Embrac'd each other mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
with all the Testimonies imaginable
of a sincere Kindness and Union. Publick
Prayers were made for all Christian Princes;
in fine, notwithstanding all the opposition
of the Heretical <hi>Vertabiets,</hi> who continually
Exclaim'd and Preach'd against us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
all those Excommunicated who should
come to our Assemblies; above two or three
hundred <hi>Armenians</hi> Communicated at this
Jubilee. There were also several general
Confessions, and I receiv'd some of them,
which gave me a great deal of comfort. As
soon as the general Communion was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
I went away with my Surplice and
Stole, to conclude the Jubilee by a Sermon,
upon the Subject of Relapses; in which, I
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100819:178"/>
show'd them, that that Sin is the greatest
Sin in the world, and that which is the most
opposite to the Glory of God, and to the
Infinite Goodness of our Saviour, to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Church, and to the Salvation of
Mankind; in a word, the Sin, which of all
Sins, makes us most despicable in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to the Infidels and Hereticks: At the
end of the Sermon, I made use of the Idea
<hi>Moses</hi> us'd, to remind all these fervent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
of the Promise they had just made
to God; placing the <hi>Franc</hi> Catholicks on
one side, and the <hi>Armenian</hi> Catholicks on
the other, pronouncing to them, the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
and Benedictions contain'd in the
Book of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> The Sermon and Mass
being ended, we began to dispose our selves
for the Procession.</p>
            <p>It was contriv'd in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
An <hi>Armenian</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Novices, or such as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to the Priest at Mass.</note> 
               <hi>Acolyte,</hi>
bearing a fine Banner, march'd
at the head: He had two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Armenian Acolytes</hi> at his
sides, dress'd according to the custom of their
Church; after them, came a <hi>Franc Acolyte,</hi>
bearing a fine large silver Cross: He had
two other <hi>Franc Acolytes</hi> at his sides, with
Surplices on, bearing two fine silver Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks;
after which, came the <hi>Armenian
Acolytes,</hi> Deacons, and Sub-Deacons, and after
them our <hi>Acolytes,</hi> with lighted Wax-Candles.
The Priests follow'd in the same order, with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100819:178"/>
Copes on. Two <hi>Armenian</hi> Vertabiets pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Holy Sacrament, one of them was
an Arch-Bishop, follow'd by two <hi>Acolytes,</hi>
casting Incense continually before it. My
Lord Bishop of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> carry'd the Holy
Sacrament under a Rich Canopy, supported
by four Catholicks, two of them <hi>Francs,</hi> and
the other two <hi>Armenians,</hi> all four the most
considerable of their Nation. When the
Procession appear'd in our Garden, which is
one of the finest in <hi>Iulfa,</hi> the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was saluted by a volly of small Shot,
and of Ordinance plac'd to that end. It
continu'd in this Order as far ar the Altar,
we had Erected in the middle of the Garden,
where after a little rest, we gave the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Holy Sacrament, and then we
had a second discharge of our Artillery.
Finally, we went back to the Chuech, while
the Air was fill'd with the <hi>Latin</hi> Hymns,
and <hi>Armenian</hi> Canticles, which succeeded
each other. The Procession being come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, and the Solemnity was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
by a third Benediction of the Holy
Sacrament, and a third discharge. There
never was a greater concourse of People. nor
more earnestness express'd, than there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
that day, to see Jesus Christ Triumph
in the middle of his Enemies. The Women
who are extremely reserv'd here, forgot the
custom of their Country in some measure on
that occasion: For being Transported with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100819:179"/>
the same Zeal that mov'd <hi>Zachy,</hi> when he
mounted on the wild Fig-Tree, they clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
upon the Lattices that are fix'd
against the walls of our Garden, to behold
that Edifying Ceremony, the like of which
they had never seen. Indeed, I can affirm,
that I never saw so comfortable a fight in
my Life before, and the Tears of Joy which
I spilt on that occasion, made me forget all
the Sufferings we had undergone in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Persecutions.</p>
            <p>All things having succeeded so well, we
thought fit to conclude all by a Treat we
made for the <hi>Armenian</hi> and <hi>Franc</hi> Clergy,
in order to keep them in an indissoluble
Union. But it was a very modest Treat,
altogether like to those of the Primitive
Christians, in which a thousand Blessings
were given to his Holiness, and to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church. Finally, the Zeal of that day was
so great, that after Dinner we were oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
to Sing Vespers solemnly, at which I desir'd
Monsieur <hi>Samson</hi> to give us one Sermon
more, to satisfie the Auditors who desir'd it.
He Exhorted them to preserve and maintain
the Union that had been made. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
was follow'd by the Benediction of the
Holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Thus pass'd our Jubilee. I may say without
Lying, that comparatively, I have never
seen any better perform'd in <hi>France.</hi> The
number of those who Confess'd themselves,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100819:179"/>
and took the Sacrament, has been very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
considering the Country in which
we are. Several Persons are come to us to
abjure their Errors. Those who were only
Catholicks out of Policy before, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
us that they were really Converted.
We have had the satisfaction to see a perfect
Union among them. The good Party has
been extreamly strenghten'd. Two of the
seven Vertabiets that are at <hi>Iulfa,</hi> have
declar'd for us, and a third is a true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
at the bottom of his Soul. Our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are surpriz'd, to see the Blessings that
God pours upon us, after so many Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they have rais'd against us, in order to
ruin us, and drive us out of <hi>Iulfa.</hi> The
<hi>Calanier</hi> our mortal Enemy begins to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Natur'd: The great Vertabiet of this
City can hardly harm us for the future, and
we do not question, but we shall be able to
Establish the Kingdom of Jesus Christ here.
Finally, the next day after the conclusion of
the Jubilee, which was the day of great Saint
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> Protector of our Church, the <hi>Cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis</hi>
sent me word that they were resolv'd
to build us a larger Church, and that they
would provide for it themselves: This News
rais'd our Joy to the utmost degree, and that
it was encreas'd the next day, when the
chief of those Gentlemen confirm'd his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to me, assuring me that in few days he
would come to us himself to take proper
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100819:180"/>
measures about it; in order to which,
Brother <hi>Balee,</hi> who is an excellent Architect,
will be very useful to us, either to give us a
good draught, or to help towards the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of it in Execution. Blessed be the Son
who turns all things to his Glory, and to the
Advantage of his Servants.</p>

Mogul, to China over Land,
by Benedict Goez.</head>
            <p>UPON the Relation of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi>
mention'd in <hi>Xaverius</hi>'s
Letters, <hi>Pimenta,</hi> Father Visitor
of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> sent notice thereof to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Spaniard.</hi> They hearing of such
a mighty Christian Nation, the Vice-Roy
of <hi>India</hi> was Commanded to follow <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta</hi>'s
Directions, who employ'd <hi>Benedict
Goez,</hi> a <hi>Portuguese</hi> Jesuit in that Discovery:
Furnish'd like an <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchant, and
changing his Name to <hi>Abdula Isai,</hi> which
latter appellation signifies a Christian. Thus
obtaining the Great Mogul <hi>Achabar</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents to his Vice-Roys, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100819:185"/>
as also to the Neighbouring Princes,
he departed in Company with one <hi>Isaac</hi> an
<hi>Armenian,</hi> from <hi>Lahor</hi> the sixth of <hi>Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
1603.</hi> Every Year there is a Caravan
of Merchants that pass out of these parts into
the Kingdom of <hi>Cascar,</hi> about 500 toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for their better defence against Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
With these he joyn'd himself, and in a
months time came to <hi>Athec</hi> in the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Lahor.</hi> After the passing of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and a months stay, he came in two
months to <hi>Passaur,</hi> from whence Travelling
to a certain small Town, they met with a
Hermite, who told 'em, that about 30 days
Travel from thence lay the City of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherstam,</hi>
into which no <hi>Saracen</hi> might
be permitted entrance; but <hi>Ethnicks</hi> might
enter except into their Temples. He tasted
also of their Wine, of which that Countrey
was very fertile. They likewise go to their
Temples in Black.</p>
            <p>In the place where they met the Hermit
they stay'd 20 days, and were forc'd to
hire 400. Souldiers of the Governour for
their defence. in 25 days they Travell'd
from thence to <hi>Gtrideli,</hi> the Merchants keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arm'd upon the tops of the Hills, and
the Carriages in Valleys, to prevent Thieves
that are accustom'd from the tops of those
Hills to stone the Travellers: However,
they were assail'd, and many wounded by
those Robbers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:100819:185"/>
After 20 days more they came to <hi>Cabul,</hi>
where they stay'd eight months. At this
place there happen'd into their Company
the Sister of <hi>Mahomet Can,</hi> King of <hi>Cascar,</hi>
by whose Country they were to pass toward
<hi>Cathay.</hi> She was call'd <hi>Agehane; Age</hi>
being an Honourable Title annex'd to her
Name, as a Pilgrim to <hi>Mecca,</hi> from whence
she was then but newly return'd, and being
in some want, borrow'd 600 Ducats in
Merchandize of <hi>Goez,</hi> which she afterwards
repaid in Merchandize more proper for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thay:</hi>
That is to say, in a kind of Marble,
by some call'd <hi>Iasper,</hi> by the <hi>Chineses Tuscé,</hi>
which is of two sorts; the one taken out of
the bottom of the River <hi>Cotan,</hi> by such as
Dive for it, as they do for Pearls, being like
to great Flints: The other, meaner, and
drawn out of the Mountain call'd <hi>Consangui
Cascio.</hi> The Solitariness of the Place, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from <hi>Catan</hi> 20 days Travel; and the
hardness of the Stone which they mollifie
with Fires over the place, make it very dear:
And the Merchants that purchase this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of the King, carry along with 'em
a Years Provision for their Labourers.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cabul</hi> they went to <hi>Ciarcar,</hi> where
the <hi>Mogull</hi>'s Patents, by virtue of which
they hitherto had been Tribute-free, were
neglected by the unruly Borderers; from
thence to <hi>Parua,</hi> the last Town in subjection
to the <hi>Mogull.</hi> After five days stay, they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100819:186"/>
pass'd in 20 days over exceeding high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to the City of <hi>Aingharan,</hi> and in 15
days more to <hi>Calcia,</hi> where the People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> After a Journey of
ten days more, they came to <hi>Gialalabath,</hi>
where the <hi>Bramins</hi> exact Custom, granted
'em by King <hi>Bruarate.</hi> Fifteen days after,
they got to <hi>Talhan,</hi> where by Civil Broils,
they were stay'd for a Month, the <hi>Calcians</hi>
being in Rebellion. From thence they
Travel'd to <hi>Cheman,</hi> under <hi>Abdulahan</hi> King
of <hi>Samarhan, Burgavia, Bacharate,</hi> and
other Confining Kingdoms, where the <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
rob'd 'em of a great part of their goods.
After 8 days troublesom Travel they came
to <hi>Badascian,</hi> where they were fleec'd a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time; neither were they free at <hi>Ciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciumar,</hi>
which was their next Resting Place;
from whence in ten days they arriv'd at
<hi>Serpanel,</hi> a Desart place, and 20 days after
to <hi>Sarcil,</hi> a Country full of Villages. In
two days Journey from thence, they reach'd
<hi>Ciecialith,</hi> a Mountain all cover'd with
Snow, where in six days Travel many of
the Company perish'd with cold.</p>
            <p>From thence they attain'd to <hi>Tanghetar,</hi>
in the Kingdom of <hi>Cascar,</hi> and in 15 days
after to <hi>Iaconich,</hi> which Journey was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
so tiresom, that <hi>Goez</hi> lost six Horses.
From thence he went to <hi>Hiarchan</hi> the Royal
City of <hi>Cascar,</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> 1603. a Mart
Famous for Concourse of Merchants, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100819:186"/>
variety of Merchandize. He Presented the
King with a Watch, a Looking-Glass, and
other European Presents, and thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
his Letters Patents for furtherance of
his Journey.</p>
            <p>From thence he went with the Caravan
<hi>Basha,</hi> who purchases his place of the King
at a dear rate, about the midst of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
1604.</hi> to <hi>Iolci, Hancialix, Alceghet,
Hagabateth, Egriar, Marcetelec, Thalec,
Horma, Thoantac, Mingrieda, Capetalcol,
Zelan, Sarc Guebedal, Cambasci, Aconsersec,
Ciacot-Acsu in</hi> 15 days; a very tedious way
over Stones and Sands. In this Journey they
pass'd the Desart of <hi>Carcathay.</hi> Thence

               </gap>ere it was that he learnt first of all that
<hi>China</hi> was <hi>Cathay.</hi> At his departure from
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100819:187"/>
               <hi>Cialix,</hi> the Governour gave him Letters of
Pass, and inscrib'd him a Christian, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his desire; at which a Mahumetan
Priest very much wonder'd, assirming, that
theirs with the Region, shifted also their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>In 20 days they came to <hi>Pucian,</hi> then to
<hi>Turphan</hi> a Fortify'd City; thence to <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth,</hi>
and so to <hi>Camul,</hi> the last City of the
Kingdom of <hi>Ciales.</hi> In nine days we came
from <hi>Camul</hi> to the Northern Walls of <hi>China,</hi>
where they stay'd 25 days, expecting the
Vice-Roy's Answer for their admission, at a
place call'd <hi>Ciaicuon.</hi> And then being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Walls, they came in one days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to the City <hi>Socieu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the space between <hi>Cialis,</hi> and the
Borders of <hi>China</hi> is subject to the inroads of
the <hi>Tartars,</hi> which is the reason that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Travel in the day time in great fear,
looking out ever and anon, to see whether
the Coasts be clear, and Travelling in the
Night with great silence and Secresie. They
found several <hi>Saracens</hi> slain in the High
way. The Countrey People they seldom
kill, but Rob them of their Cattel: As
for Corn and Rice, they hold it food for
Beasts, and not for Men; and feed upon
Flesh, living a hundred years.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Saracens</hi> in these parts are effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and might easily be subdu'd by the
<hi>Chineses,</hi> if they would attempt it. On the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100819:187"/>
West parts of <hi>China</hi> stands a Wall, rais'd on
purpose to exclude the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and two
fortify'd Cities with strong Garrisons, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their Peculiar Vice-Roy, and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates;
<hi>Canceu,</hi> the Capital of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<hi>Scensi,</hi> and <hi>Soceu,</hi> which is divided
into two parts; of which, the one is Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by <hi>Saracens,</hi> who Trade there for
Merchandize; the other by the <hi>Chineses,</hi>
whom the <hi>Saracens</hi> there call <hi>Cathayans.</hi>
Every Night the <hi>Saracens</hi> are enclos'd in
their own City, in other things like the
<hi>Chineses,</hi> subject to the same Laws and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.
Neither may any Foreigner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to his own Country, who has liv'd
there Nine Years. Every sixth Year Seventy
two Commissioners come according to an
Ancient Custom, to pay a kind of Tribute
to the King: This the pretence, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
is to enrich themselves with Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
as being maintain'd under that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
during their stay, at the King's
Charge.</p>
            <p>Into <hi>Soceu, Goez</hi> came at the end of the
Year 1605. and there met with other <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi>
returning from <hi>Pequin,</hi> who inform'd
him of the Jesuits there residing; adding
withal, that the King did not Sell, but pour'd
without measure a daily allowance of Money
into their hands. Which I mention the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to shew, that a Man must be sparing
of Credit to <hi>Saracen</hi> Travellers, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100819:188"/>
But <hi>Goez</hi> could not in a long time
certifie these his Fellows of his Arrival, as
being ignorant of the <hi>Chinese</hi> Names, and
it was some Months Journey from <hi>Soceu</hi> to
<hi>Pequin,</hi> and the Winter Cold is there very
extream. However, in that bitter Season,
they sent one of their Converts a <hi>Chinese,</hi>
call'd <hi>Iohannes Ferdinandus,</hi> who after a
tedious Journey found <hi>Goez</hi> lying on his
Death-Bed, when he brought him the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the Society. Eleven days after
he dy'd, not without suspicion of Poyson gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of his Goods: Besides, that
they have a Custom, that if any one Dies
by the way, his Goods are shar'd among the
rest. His Companion the <hi>Armenian</hi> was
sent from <hi>Pequin</hi> to <hi>Macao,</hi> and thence into
<hi>India;</hi> and being taken by the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
in the way to <hi>Sincapura,</hi> was Redeem'd by
the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and return'd to <hi>Ciaul,</hi> where
he still Lives, as our Author <hi>Trigautius</hi>
affirms.</p>

Letter to the Emperour of
Russia.</head>
            <p>TO the Lord, Emperour, and Grand
Duke. The Gold'n King receiv'd
your Letter. In former times (Great
Lord) it came to my Hearing, that your
Princely good Embassadors, sought out a
way or passage to come to me; since
which time, it is now thirteen Years;
but then the People of <hi>Iskicgi, Tubents,
Mattara,</hi> and black <hi>Kolmacks,</hi> would
not suffer your Princely good Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
to come to me. Since that time,
ten of your Majesties People are come to
me, and I have sent to you <hi>Ickmen
Kickenga,</hi> to do Obeysance to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100819:190"/>
and see your Princely Eyes, whom
your Majesty vouchsaf'd to do their
Obeysance, and see your Princely Eyes.
And to me, you sent of your Grace,
three Cups of Silver, a Bow, a Sword,
two Guns, and two Garments; all which,
you. Princely Favours I have receiv'd,
and what shall be proper for your Majesty
from hence, I will furnish you withal.
I am farther to request of your Majesty,
in regard the Embassadors do pass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us in a very miserable and poor
Condition, by Reason there are now some
small Wars between us and the black <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks,</hi>
and for that there are but very
inconsiderable Garrisons at <hi>Tobolsko,</hi>
nor in the Castles of <hi>Tomo, Tarko,</hi> or
among the <hi>Barban</hi> People; now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if your Majesty will favour me, and
defend me, with these People, from <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rakula,</hi>
and be pleas'd to enter into a
War on your side, as I am engag'd on
mine, that matter will be remedy'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, and all Kindnesses continue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us. By which means and by your

and they are return'd to me again out of
<hi>Cathay.</hi> Also (Great Lord) there is
come to me, the <hi>Zurchad</hi> of <hi>Labaia,</hi>
and I have sent you together with my
Presents, the said <hi>Turchan Labar,</hi> and
<hi>Kitibacshij Anchaij,</hi> and with them ten
Men, with two Men of <hi>Sirgos.</hi> By
their Letter you will understand, that
there is sent to your Majesty, three Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards
with their Claws, a red and yellow
Damask upon a Gold Ground a piece of
Velvet, and an Ambling Horse. And
I am humbly to request your Majesty, if
it be your Majesty's Pleasure to do the
favour, to grace me for your own Honour,
with a Garment of Cloth of Gold, and of
divers Colours, fine Garments of fine
Cloth, a Head-piece, a Shirt of Maile,
a Sword, a Bow, twenty Guns, a Flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon

become Renown'd and Famous every
where; therefore it is, that I do Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to your Majesty, because many
Kings of many Countries have spread
abroad the Fame of your Majesties Name
far and near. And I request, that Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors

if it be your Majesties favourable Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
I desire you to dispatch these my

            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. the 23d of <hi>September,</hi> in
the Emperors Dominions at <hi>Soldata,</hi> a
<hi>Cosack</hi> of <hi>Siberia,</hi> Nam'd <hi>Euashko Petlin,</hi>
being Examin'd concerning his Travels,
made the following Report. The last
year, <hi>said he,</hi> being the Year 1619. the
<hi>Boyaren,</hi> and <hi>Vayvod Knez Euan Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowick
Koorockin</hi> sent him from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of <hi>Tomo,</hi> together with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<hi>Andrashko,</hi> to conduct the <hi>Altine</hi>
King's Embassadors, as also to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kingdoms of <hi>Cathay.</hi> They went
from the Castle of <hi>Tomo</hi> about the 9th of
<hi>May,</hi> and Travell'd from <hi>Tomo</hi> to <hi>Kirgis,</hi>
with much expedition, in ten days; in
which <hi>Kirgis</hi> Reigns a <hi>Kan,</hi> who is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Emperour's Majesty, whose
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100819:191"/>
Name is <hi>Nemi,</hi> and who gave them Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
and Postage. Through this Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Kirgis</hi> they Travell'd half a day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and reaching to the Dominions of
<hi>Mutalla,</hi> came to the <hi>Altine</hi> King, who
gave them Provisions, allow'd 'em Postage,
and dispatch'd 'em from thence. After
which, they Travell'd through his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
for five weeks together, and reach'd
the Country of <hi>Sheremugali,</hi> were Reigned
a Queen call'd <hi>Manchika,</hi> who order'd
Provisions and Postage to be allow'd 'em.
In this Country of <hi>Sheremugali,</hi> or <hi>Shero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogula,</hi>
they Travell'd four days, and
then came into the Dominions of <hi>Catay,</hi>
call'd <hi>Crim,</hi> where stands a Wall built of
Stone fifteen fathoms high, by the side of
which Wall they Travell'd ten days, and
saw several petty Towns and Villages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Queen <hi>Manschika;</hi> but in all
those ten days they saw no People upon
the wall. At the end of those ten days,
they came to the Gate, where lye very
large pieces of Ordnance, discharging
Shot as big as a Man's Head. This Gate
is guarded by a Watch of three thousand
Men, and Merchants come with their
Goods to Traffick at the Gate, and bring
their Horses to sell to the <hi>Catay</hi> Men;
but are not permitted to come within the
walls, except very few at a time. Thus
their whole Journey from <hi>Tomo</hi> Castle
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100819:192"/>
to this Gate, took up twelve Weeks, besides
some days that they stood still; and from
the Gate, to the great Empire of <hi>Catay</hi>
ten days, and so arriv'd at the City or
