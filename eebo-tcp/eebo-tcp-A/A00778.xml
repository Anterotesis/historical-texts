            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For ſuch a thing is it to cleaue vnto the Lorde with a faithfull heart, that the Bride may forget to trim her ſelfe the day ſhe is maried, and the mother her Jnfant ſhe bare of her bodie, and eſteemeth full deere, before the Lord of heauen can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſuch.

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your ſelfe therefore in all truth of hart, before the iudging eyes of a mightie God ſtill more &amp; more, as you do alreadie, an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable maintainer and furtherer of his truth. A ſhield and defence to all the godly in their griefes and diſtreſſes.

And finally as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle ſayth, if there be any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, if there be any praiſe, to God, or to Prince, to Countrey, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

For there is no praiſe ſhall continue as this, there is no wiſedome that may bee compared to it.

It was begun in your Honors hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, being that part of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme that then fell to my courſe, both the lawe and faith hauing bene expounded before, the one by

my ſelfe, the other by my fellowe that followed: &amp; becauſe it could not at that time be gone forwarde withall, J haue ſince, as J could, layd it downe in this ſort, if it pleaſe the Lord for the good of mo. VVho all ſhall welcome it by thus much more (as they did the other) by how much it bringeth counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from your Honors both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and is a gift deriued euen from your ſelues vnto them. The Christian Reader els whoſoeuer, I ſhould wrong too much, if I ſhould not comfortably hope, he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it well, ſince alreadie he hath ſhewed his loue in the like reſpect.

Yea then are they lawfull, and right in deede, when they ſerue to this purpoſe in ſinceritie, and not to any outward ſhewe in hypocriſie. And thus much of them.</p>
            <p>Now on the other ſide, as theſe be helps vnder God to quicken vp our Spirites in prayer, if we bee dull, and to make vs pray zealouſly and earneſtly: ſo are there impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments alſo that hinder vs and make vs that wee cannot pray with ſuch affection as we ought. As the contraries of theſe that I haue ſpoken of, A proude hart puft with conceit of merit, an ignorance, or at leſt not a through conſideration of the thing, or thinges we begge, a leaning to ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ouermuch, a dulnes in the ſeeking of Gods promiſes, &amp; ſuch like, which I may not nowe ouer againe folow at large.

            <p>This great folly then of many in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world that delight to pray in a ſtraunge tongue, &amp; not onely ſo, but boldly (to ſay no worſe of them) defende that they can pray with as right an affection thus, as otherwiſe, hath firſt God againſt it in his word moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the voyce of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">

Let vs ende then this poynt of the practiſe and iudgement of men with that decree of Pope Innocent the third in the Councel of <hi>Laterane,</hi> about the yeere of our Lorde <hi>1200.</hi> that in ſuch Cities as ſhould bee concurſe of people of diuers nations, the Biſhop ſhoulde take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that euery people ſhould haue a Paſtor of their owne language, which might ſerue them, and miniſter vnto them in the ſame. A thing very worthy obſeruing, that euen with the Pope himſelfe the trueth of this cauſe, that prayers ought to be vnderſtood, ſhould preuaile.</p>
            <p>We haue ſeene then God, and wee haue ſeene men againſt this great corruption and hinderance of our prayer, and men both in practiſe and iudgement. What if
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1629:29"/>
we ioyne nowe for concluſion of all verie open reaſon againſt it? It may doe good. For truely euen this ſtriketh ſo deepe in in this behalfe, as any Chriſtian heart may feare euer to come before the Lorde with prayer in this order. For it is not one, and a verie ſingular vſe of our prayers, to ſtrengthen and frame our faith by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of mercies aſked and receiued at our God his handes. It working euer in vs a truſt, an hope, yea, an vnſpeakeable comfort, that he will be as he hath beene, being no changeling in himſelfe, and that whome he hath heard ſo graciouſly, ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely, and ſo often, with graunt of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, thoſe hee will euer heare, and ſtill heare in their right and lawfull prayers, to the prayſe of his mercie, and the ioye of them his ſeruauntes in their diſtreſſes? Now this ſingular vſe and profite as I ſay of prayer are they depriued of, that vſe to pray in a ſtraunge tongue, for if any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular benefite be giuen them, they knowe not whether it hath come at their intreaty, or no, becauſe they know not what they haue prayed for, and ſo receiue they no ſure and certaine teſtimonie of the Lords helpe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1629:29"/>
and goodneſſe to them, to the comfort of their hartes at all times when they ſhall néede againe to call vpon him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this be a bleſſing to haue true expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, nay thouſands of experiences of the Lordes ſwéete fauour to vs, then muſt it needes be a daungerous thing to our faith, that robbeth vs of all and euery tryall of our God. Therefore let but euen reaſon ſpeak in this cauſe, and it will conclude vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our conſciences thus, that foraſmuch as petitions knowen of vs to bee made by vs to the Lorde, and of him graunted to vs, (which is done when we vnderſtande our prayers) doe ſtrengthen our faith in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort euer to reſt vpon the Lord, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie (which is when we pray in a ſtrange tongue) doth weaken the ſame, and rob vs of that comfort that groweth by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, therefore it is profitable to pray in the one, and moſt dangerous to praie in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Againe, is not the remembraunce of <hi>Caligulaes</hi> fact in this reſpect moſt fit, and preſſeth anie honeſt mind in the world with ſight of fruitleſſe labour in ſuch kindes of praiers? <hi>Caligula</hi> the Emperour ſet gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den leaues before his gueſtes, and all other

But prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is a ſeruice and a great ſeruice, therefore due and moſt due to the Lord for euer.

            <p>
               <hi>Yea Sir, but you knowe their anſwere in this matter, if they bee charged, they doe not denie they ſaie, but Chriſt and onely Chriſt is mediatour of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not of interceſſion, and that which they aſcribe to holy ſpirites, it is onely to make interceſſion for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeede they ſo anſwere, but alaſſe in vaine. For it is but a ſhifte deuiſed of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to deceiue our ſoules by, if wee receiue it, and that may appeare both to them and vs, if we haue care to ſee the truth. For hath it firſt anie warrant in the worde? If it haue let them produce it, if not, let them knowe that euen for this cauſe it faulteth, and we reiect it. For if this bee graunted that men may frame diſtinctions at theyr
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1629:40"/>
pleaſures, there is not the truth to bee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med but it may be ouerthrowen. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is one reaſon agaynſt it, it hath no warrant in the worde. Secondly, was not the high Prieſt in the lawe mediator in figure, both of expiation by ſacrifices, and of interceſſion by prayers? That is, more plainly, did not he both offer the ſacrifice &amp; make prayer? And what was this but in ſhadow to ſhew that ſo in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both theſe things ſhould bee conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one man alſo, euen the man Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; he that was mediator of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould alſo be mediatour of interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To diuide theſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is to make the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die not anſwere to the ſhadowe, neither the truth to the figure, which may not be. For looke whatſoeuer was typically ſhewed Chriſt ſhould do, that hath he truelie done and performed, and to affirme otherwiſe is great impietie. Thirdly, theſe two are both duties of the mediatour, and in truth none can be a mediator, vnleſſe he performe both theſe things, namely both redemption and interceſſion. Now of two duties or partes of the office of a mediatour, ſhall we make two ſorts of mediators. Truely it is euen
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1629:41"/>
all one, as if becauſe man conſiſteth of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and ſoule, as of two partes that make but one whole, we ſhould ſay there are two ſortes of men, one conſiſting of bodie, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſoule, which were a trimme ſpeech. Or agayne, becauſe the Prince hath power ouer body and goods, and they both are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the prerogatiue of his kinglie office, therfore of two things belonging to one perſon, we ſhould make a diſtinction of perſons, &amp; ſay, there are two ſorts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, one hauing power ouer body, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hauing authoritie ouer goods. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo it is in this matter of a mediator, whoſe office conſiſteth in both theſe duties, as parts of the ſame, to redeeme the people and to make interceſſion for them. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo in the ſcripture before named, how vtterly Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> diſliked that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heriticke, who in a certaine place made the Biſhoppe a mediator betwixt God and the people, and how he ſayd that if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould haue done ſo, no man would haue abid him, neither haue looked vpon him as vpon an Apoſtle of Chriſt, but as vpon a very Antichriſt, Truely <hi>Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> neuer thought the Biſhop was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator

of redemption or ſaluation, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euen there, by that learned father <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> is moſt plainely ouerthrowne this fooliſh diſtinction which we ſpeak of.

Wherefore let the fruit of all this bee a reformed iudgement, foraſmuch as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God alone by Chriſt hath warrant &amp; comfort, and the other hath none, but when God ſhal awake vs, moſt fearefull diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, being a plaine and dreadful robbery of God of his true and due honor. If you can finde as playne proofes and proppes to your conſcience that others bee ioyned in this authoritie and office with Chriſt to make interceſſion for vs, as nowe you haue ſeene that Chriſt is, then hearken to them, but if not, thinke vpon your God that ſhed his precious blood for you, and he that hath ſo loued you, and done ſo much for you, grudge him not his due glory, neither match his creatures with him cheeke by cheeke, without good warrant, for hee is a iealous God of his honour, and hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told vs that his glory he will not giue to another.

            <p>
               <hi>Yet one thing more I pray you aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me in this matter, and that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the dead: may they bee prayed for of vs after they are departed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No in deede, vnleſſe we will preſume in zeale and affection aboue any warrant of the worde of God, and ſo pull vpon vs (as wee haue heard before) both ſinne and the rewarde therof. For we haue no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement any where to doe it, being yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely commanded to pray for the liuing, and to doe ſuch dueties alſo for the dead as are fit and allowable, as to burie them, to mourne moderatly for them, and ſo as may become men and women that haue hope of their reſurrection and life eternall, to bee faithfull performers of their laſt willes, and ſuch like: Wee haue no example of any in the Canonicall Scripture that euer did it: wee haue no promiſe to be heard if we doe it: no puniſhment threatned if wee doe it not. And is not this a great nakedneſſe of an action to haue none of all theſe: yea ſuch a nakedneſſe as ſhould touch and preſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1629:47"/>
man or woman liuing that deſire to pleaſe God by true and right obedience? Truely it is. And we are not able to name any one thing that God hath in good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to haue his children doe, but it either hath all or the moſt of theſe. It hath a commaundement, it hath a promiſe, it hath example, it hath puniſhment threatned if not done, &amp;c. Wherefore let vs conſider it, and not be caried away with vayne ſhiftes. We vſe to ſay, we doe it for good will, and if it doe them no good it doth them no harme. But is there any true goodwill which is not allowed by God? Should not his liking and allowance bee the rule and guide of vs and all our doings? If then we can finde where hee biddeth vs ſhewe our goodwill in this ſorte, vſe it and feare not: if we cannot, neuer thinke that is goodwill which wanteth the Lordes ſtampe vpon it, vnleſſe you will affirme that GOD con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth good dueties to our Brethren, which God forbid. Then conſider againe, that albeit it neither hurt nor profite them, yet in truth it hurteth vs that doe it, both becauſe it is an action without warrant, and therefore not of faith, and ſo ſinne: and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1629:47"/>
becauſe alſo it confirmeth and proppeth vp that lewd opinion of Purgatorie, ſo dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie to the truth of God &amp; the comfort of his children. Therefore if we will ſhewe goodwill to our friendes departed, let vs ſpeake of them as men and women in the hands of God, and in ſuch comfort as that they neede not any prayers of vs, departed in a true faith, and therfore now poſſeſſors of the promiſe, euen of ſuch ioyes as no eye hath ſeene, no eare hath heard, neither any hart bene able to conceiue of. For thus to hope of them is like friendes to hope of them, and thus to ſpeake hurteth not our ſelues. Our phraſes may be as eaſely, God hath had mercie on him I truſt, as GOD haue mercie on him, he is with GOD I hope, he is at reſt from his labours, he hath finiſhed his courſe: or any ſuch like. If wee will a little at firſt labour to forget a bad cuſtome when it ſeeketh to come vpon our tongues ſo readily: Then for the place in the <hi>Machabees,</hi>

are ſuch, as neuer haue, neither can bée truely anſwered by any aduerſarie. I pray you let it not greeue you both to heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and very diligently to marke them.

In the ſecond booke he is aliue againe, and writeth let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>36.</hi> yeeres after he was dead. Can both theſe be true? If not, then marke the credite of this booke. Not vnlike to this is that which is written of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his death. In the firſt booke it is ſayd,<note place="margin">

Theſe be greater contrarieties tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I truſt any man, that feareth GOD, will thinke may be in bookes whereof the holy Ghoſt is author. And therefore you ſee wee doe not without great cauſe refuſe to learne our faith out of theſe Bookes. If mens iudgements bee regarded of vs, we heare and ſee what the Fathers thought. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, Epiphan, Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> reiect theſe bookes in this ſorte, as not to be rules of faith.

But <hi>Auſten,</hi> they ſay, affirmeth them Canonicall. O why ſhould not loue of truth baniſh all cauilles? <hi>Auſten</hi> doth ſo: and in the very ſame place that they alleage, ſayth the contrary. How then is <hi>Auſten</hi> contrary to himſelfe? No, their owne eyes ſee as well as we, if they will, that when he calleth them not Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, he taketh the worde ſtrictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and meaneth they are no groundes and rules for our faith: when hee calleth
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1629:49"/>
them Canonical, he taketh the word large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and meaneth they are ſuch as may bee read in the Churches for examples of the great and marueilous paſſions and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the Martyrs. Beleeue not me, but heare himſelfe. Firſt, that they are not Canonicall. <hi>In Machabaeorum libris, &amp;c.</hi> Although there may ſome thing bee found in the bookes of the <hi>Machabees</hi> meete for this order of writing, and worthie to bee ioyned with the number of miracles, yet hereof wee will haue no care: for that wee haue intended only to touch a ſhort rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of the miracles contayned in the bookes of holy Canon. See how he ſaith, they are not Canonicall, and therefore hée will not accept of the miracles in them. Againe, <hi>Haec ſupputatio non in ſcripturis ſanctis, quae appellantur Canonicae, ſed in alijs inuenitur, in quibus ſunt &amp; Machabaeorum libri.</hi> This reckoning is not founde in the holie Scriptures that are called Canonicall, but in certaine other bookes, among which are the bookes of the <hi>Machabees.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch teſtimonies might bee alleadged out of this Father, but theſe ſuffice in this treatiſe. Now that they are Canonicall,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1629:50"/>
heare himſelfe againe. <hi>Libros Machabaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eccleſia habet pro canonicis, propter quorundam Martyrum paſſiones vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes atque mirabiles.</hi> The Church accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the bookes of the Machabees as cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, (not for the aucthoritie and weight of trueth) but for the great and meruailous paſſions, and perſecutions of Martyrs therein contained. And againe, that ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that beareth the name of the Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees, is receiued not vnprofitably of the Church, ſo that it be read and heard with ſobrietie, ſpecially becauſe of thoſe Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bées that ſuffered ſo cruell torments for the law of God. Wherfore by his owne words now on both ſides repeated, <hi>Auguſtines</hi> minde is playne, namely that theſe bookes alleadged in proofe of faith, they are not Canonicall, but to be read vnto the people in the Church for example of life, in this ſence ſaith hee, they are Canonicall, and may be thus read, ſo that they be read ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlie. And what is this, but that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers haue alſo ſaide, as <hi>Ierome.</hi> The Church readeth the ſtorie of <hi>Iudith,</hi> the booke of <hi>Tobie,</hi> and the bookes of the Machabees, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Church receiueth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1629:50"/>
not theſe bookes as the Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Cyprian, <hi>Haec omnia legi quidem in eccleſijs voluerunt, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tamen proferri ad au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem ex his fidei confirmandam.</hi>
               </hi> All theſe writings our Fathers haue allowed to be reade in the Church, yet not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged for authoritie, to confirme the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our faith. Wherefore to goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in this you ſee our reaſons, why wee allow not any proof of doctrine out of thoſe bookes, and therefore not of prayer for the deade. Other reaſons moe are aleadged by the godlie learned, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ight by mee now, but that theſe ſuffice here.</p>
            <p>Next, our anſwere toucheth the matter it ſelfe, and we ſay that prayer for the dead, ſought to be proued out of this place of the Machabees, is contrarie to the reſt of the Scriptures, and therefore we dare not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe it. For no trueth and lawfull thing is contrarie to any Scripture, but agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as receiuing warrant, and lawfulnes thence. Secondlie, that though Iudas had ſo done (which is not likelie he did, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer this place hath béene corrupted to that ende, becauſe it is contrarie to the cuſtome of the Iewes, euen to this day, to pray for

               <hi>But the Scripture calleth Chriſt our brother, how is he then our Father?</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1629:65"/>
and hee is our brother by reaſon of manhood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet am I not ſatiſfied. For thus me thinke is reaſon againſt you. He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth vs into fauour for Chriſt, and graunteth our petitions for Chriſt, that is not Chriſt himſelfe. For there is a manifeſt diſtinction of perſons implyed in it: but this father here whom we call father in this Lords Prayer, receiueth vs &amp; heareth vs, and helpeth vs for Chriſt: and therefore this father in this place cannot be Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You trouble your ſelfe in an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and you doe not diſtinguiſh as wee needes muſt doe to keepe a truth in theſe cauſes. I tolde you before there are two natures in Chriſt, &amp; diuers ſeuerall things in that one perſon in reſpect of thoſe ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall natures. Now you muſt conſider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that in Chriſt there is a nature of Godhead, and an office of a mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, he and his office are ſeuerall things, yet he one Chriſt. Then concerning your <hi>maior propoſition,</hi> true it is that he that receiueth vs into fauour and heareth and helpeth vs for Chriſt is not

Chriſt himſelfe in that one reſpect, but in an other he is. For Chriſt as mediatour is hee for whome wee are receiued, heard and helped: but as GOD it is he alſo that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth, heareth, and helpeth. So doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of things ſeuerally to bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aunſwer your doubt, and leaue Chriſt included in this word and name of Father in this Prayer, aſwell as any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

Thus is not the Lorde in the reprobate and wicked. For what is it to be in a place rightly and fully, but as in his own proper place there to rule and raigne, &amp; to exerciſe his power to the good of the place: which the Lord doth not in the wicked. Thus was it tolde the people,<note place="margin">

This well conſidered giueth a light to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe places of Scripturs, where it is ſaid, the Lord is neere or far of, telling vs they are meant not of his eſſence, but of his grace, which grace when it is mercifullie offered to men and women by the worde preached vnto them, by bleſſings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts beſtowed vpon them able to moue a heart of ſteele to thinke of a gracious God that giueth ſuch giftes,<note place="margin">

So ſinne dyeth, grace liueth, and wee loue him, feare him, truſt in him pray to him often, and in all our wants, with ſuch like.

of power, of grace, and of glory, as alſo of which of them the petition is meant. So now what we pray in plaine words: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus much, O Lord ſubdue vnto thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie all power of Satan in vs by any meanes: ſubdue our ſinfull fleſh and all the wicked luſts therof, to the inlarging of thy kingdome here vpon earth,<note place="margin">

               <p>Now is not this brought to paſſe but by meanes, and therefore as we pray for the thing that the Lord would graunt it, ſo pray we alſo incluſiuely for the meanes that in mercy they may bee giuen to the effecting of it.

The next day the Chriſtians, although thus admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, yet flocke thither in more plentiful ſort than at other times, yet runne headlong as it were and in great haſt, as men affraide to come to late to dye. Amongſt all, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines noted a certaine woman, ſo haſtely and with ſuch ſpeede to runne out of her houſe, as that ſhee ſtayed not either to ſhut the doore of her houſe, or to put on her clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes as womanhoode woulde, and in her armes a litle infant. When hee ſawe it, he commanded to call her to him, and being come, aſked her whither ſhe made all that haſt. Into the field, ſaith ſhe, wher the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians meet. And haſt thou not heard, ſayth he, that the chief Captaine is going thither, to put to the ſworde all hee findeth there. Yes, ſaith ſhe, I haue heard it, and therfore I make haſt that I may be there when hee commeth. And what wilt thou do with this yong babe, ſayth he. Take it with me alſo, ſayth ſhee, that if the Lord will, it may be vouchſafed martyrdome alſo. When the Captayne heard this, he ſtayed his courſe, commanded his charet to turne, and to the Emperour preſently he goeth, told him, if it

To apply then all this to God ſo farre as our queſtion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, let vs vnderſtand, that that euil which is a puniſhment inflicted by God for ſome former euill we may ſay that God willeth.

                  </note>Concerning the ſecond diſtinction how God may bee the author of the action, and yet not of the euill any way in the action, ſée by theſe ſimilitudes. The Sunne light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his hote beames vppon a dead carcaſſe cauſeth a ſtrong and loathſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, yet is not the Sunne either vnſwéete it ſelf, or the cauſe of that vnſwéetenes, but the carion it ſelfe. For if the Sunne were the cauſe, then euer the like cauſe, the like effect, but wee ſee it is not ſo, but contrary, when it lighteth vppon ſweete hearbes and odoriferous flowers, it draweth out of them great ſweetenes and pleaſaunt ſmels. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the earth wee all knowe with her ſap and moyſture, feedeth and nouriſheth al the trees, plantes, and rootes that are, yet is not that earth cauſe why this tree bringeth a bitter fruite, and that hearbe or roote a bad taſt, but the nature ſeuerall of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things themſelues is the cauſe of that. Thirdly the pure worde of the Lorde is preached or read, and one ſauoureth and gathereth to life, an other to death and deſtruction, is
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1629:125"/>
now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word cauſe of thoſe ſeuerall effects, or the creatures themſelues bleſſed or not bleſſed with Gods holy Spirit. Thus may the Lorde then bee author of an action and yet not of the euill in the action, and ſo hee ſéemeth to will euill, when yet in trueth he doeth not.</p>
               <q>What is now his reueiled will?</q>

Fourthly, becauſe the Lord muſt euer haue a Church, but that cannot be without food, gouernment, peace, health, and ſuch like: therefore it is lawfull to aſke them. Laſtly, becauſe the aſking and expectation of theſe thinges is a notable exerciſe of our faith,

hope and truſt in Gods promiſes. For we cannot aſſure our ſelues of theſe corporall goods, neither aſke them, except we bee in Gods fauour, and feele in our ſelues good comfort of his good will towards vs. By aſking therefore wee exerciſe our faith to beleeue the Lord to be our good God: from which goodneſſe of his wee looke for theſe things, ſo farre as they may be good for vs. Otherwiſe the Lord might ſay to vs, you are none of that number that I promiſed theſe things vnto.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord hath pleaſed ſo to call it, firſt, to note out vnto vs our mortalitie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding eſtate, if he ſhould not euen dayly feed vs. Secondly, to teach vs, that it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dayly to aſke what dayly we neede, and not to make our praier at once for a yeres, or many yeeres prouiſion, becauſe wee woulde take our libertie to praie no more.

               <q>What Secondly?</q>
               <p>Secondly it teacheth vs the long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Lord, wonderfull and vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able towards mankind. Whereby hee bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and beareth with vs wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

In that precious bloud is the father pleaſed and ſatiſfied for al our ſinnes, if wee lay holde of it: and for our workes they carie greater corruption in their bones and bowels, than that ſo pure a God ſhould bee pleaſed with them, or ſo vggly ſinnes euer purged by them.</p>

would haue wiſhed themſelues accurſed of God, to haue gayned to their brethren ten thouſande worldes, or any worldly good whatſoeuer, but to gayne them ſpirituall good they did it: and therefore much more are wee to care for the ſaluation of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren than for their glorie in this earth, if we will imitate them. <hi>Dauid</hi> would neuer haue guſhed out teares to ſee them want wealth, but to ſee them want grace he did. Wherefore let vs learne how to loue our brethren wel: let vs learne what moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and diſpleaſeth God: what moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and hurteth our neighbours, and more hartely pray for the remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſinnes than for any worldly good.

               <q>Nowe do you put me in mind of a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which I only alſo will aſke you. Namely what comfort there is for a frayle creature that after repentance and purpoſe neuer to offende ſo any more, yet ſhall fall againe, euen into the ſame fault, of frayltie, not of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice?</q>
               <p>Surely you name a very notable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our moſt vile corruption, that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely profeſſing our repentance for any bad behauiour, and vowing to the Lorde, and with our ſelues, that no more wee will do ſo, yet contrary both to promiſe and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we fall againe into the ſelfeſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſinne.

Wherefore with deſire to ſtand, and al poſſible indeuour againſt ſuch ſecond fals, let vs heare yet what the Lorde ſayth, if in our great weakenes wee doe fall, I meane into the ſame offence againe after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For we ſee the Prophets in euerie place exhort men to repentance, not which had once offended, but which with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate contempt of God had not ſtayed to runne into all kind of wickednes, &amp; which after a ſhewe of repentaunce, yet returned to their ſinnefull courſe agayne, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremy</hi> of all other is full of places, if you liſt to read any, Agayne the Lorde in his law would haue dayly ſacrifices offred ſometime in the name of the whole people, ſometimes in the name of a priuat perſon, aſwell for offences committed by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as for voluntary tranſgreſſions and falles, which aſſuredly ſhoulde not haue bene done, except there had bene mercy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for ſecond faults.

                  </note> Thirdly in the Pſalme we very playnely
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:1629:184"/>
ſée that God was intreated to forgiue moſt hypocriticall and obſtinate ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And nowe in the tyme of his Goſpell his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is not ſtreyted or diminiſhed, but euen nowe alſo more playnely it is proclaymed to the worlde, that at what tyme ſoeuer a ſinner ſoroweth from his heart, there is pardon with the Lorde, without exception againſt often committing of the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. When the Lord inioyneth vs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue our brethren ſeuentie times ſeuen times, doth he meane newe offences only, ſuch as they neuer committed agaynſt vs before, or hee meaneth all, whatſoeuer, or how often ſoeuer fallen into by their frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? And if ſo, doth he require more mercy of man than he the God of mercy wil ſhew? or ſhall the creature excell the creator in any goodnes? God forbid. Sée it therefore and be with comfort moſt aſſured of it, that if wee ſinne not ſeuen times, but ſeuentie times ſeuen times againſt his maieſty, and euen in the ſame thing, and ſo often with weeping eyes and ſobbing ſoule fall at his feete for mercy to ſo great frailtie, there is mercy with him and pardon to true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſpirituall, that cannot bee ſpoken of, that God woulde haue his children ſo ſure of the pardon of their ſinnes, euen of all their ſinnes, without exception, whereof hee giueth them a diſlike &amp; true abhorring, as that he would haue it an article of their fayth ſo that they ſhould not be ſound chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians if they beleeued it not. Laſtly euen this petition of the Lordes prayer, crauing dayly forgiuenes of dayly treſpaſſes, dare you reſtrayne it to treſpaſſes committed onely before repentance, and exempt all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond falles after ſuch repentance and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to amend? the Lord forbid. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take it alſo with the former as a ſure proofe of pardon alſo for theſe offences. So doe you ſee what anſwere your queſtion hath out of Gods booke, onely therefore beware preſumption, beware looſenes, beware negligence, and due care to auoyd

theſe ſeconde falles, ſay not God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and therefore I will ſinne. For as hee is gratious to a ſorowfull ſinner: ſo is hee dreadfull to a preſumptuous offender, and frailtie ſhall finde mercy, when boldnes ſhall find iudgement and wrath for euer.</p>
               <q>Surely I ſee it is a great comfort to a Chriſtian conſcience, that the Lord hath put into our daylie prayer this petition, and it mightely aſſureth vs of his mercie.</q>
               <p>In deede it is ſo, but yet this appeareth nothing ſo much as it would if our eyes ſawe, or our harts felt what loathſomneſſe lodged in vs, and what iuſt matter of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall confuſion wee haue both in bodie and ſoule, if mercy were not.

And I ſay when the Lord granteth it, for moſt aſſuredly wee haue it not of our ſelues, nay wee flatter and deceiue euery man his owne hart in this point, we thinke all is well with vs, and wee knowe not our ſelues. But what are we? O my beloued, my heart vnderſtandeth not the ſinnes of man, and therefore my tongue cannot lay them open before you.

Knowe wee then our comfort herein if the Lorde euer pleaſe to trie vs thus. Election is a thing reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſteps, and whoſoeuer wil ſurely and ſafely find it out muſt keepe the ſame. For as it were a madneſſe if I deſired to climb a ladder, to ſeeke to ſet my foote at firſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the higheſt ſtep, ſo ſhall it be if I ſeeke out my election firſt before I looke vnto other things. And as there the higheſt ſtep is truly troad vppon at the laſt, if I begin at the loweſt, and ſo goe vpward: ſo is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection certainly found if we keepe the like order. This ſpirituall ladder then ſtandeth thus. <hi>Whome the Lord electeth before all time, them doth he euer call</hi> in time, either at the morning, at the ninth houre, or eleuenth houre, or ſome houre.

then are we in him and he in vs, yea, euen ſo ſurely as it is certaine that the bearing bough is not broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the tree, which if it were, it could not beare.

And if I finde that the God of mercie by his perpetual ſpirit hath wrought in me a chaunge, that whereas once I walked after the fleſh, that is, was ruled, guided, and gouerned by my corrupt nature, now it is not ſo, but the holy Ghoſt leadeth me into a feruent loue of God, and a true hatred of euill, then is the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inferred by the very ſpirit of truth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, I am in Chriſt Ieſus, and there is no condemnation to me, nor for me.

O what are the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſinne then for a ſeaſon, when ſwéet meate ſhall haue ſo ſoure a ſauce?

                  </note> that <hi>without faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God,</hi> and therefore concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning manner, no action can pleaſe GOD, though it were neuer ſo glorious, except it proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an hart purified by faith. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> offered both ſacrifices, the one pleaſed, the other not.

So thouſands mo then in thoſe daies, and now in ours, that one day ſhall knowe with wo what it is to haue outward ſhew without inward faith.

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:1629:217"/>
confeſſing truly, that we notwithſtanding all our workes are vnprofitable ſeruants. The want of this made the Phareſies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions abhorred,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke. 17.10.</hi>

                  </note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, an adulterer, to faſt, to giue tithe truly of all we haue, are good things, but to doe theſe in pride and conceit, with boaſting and bragging, and without humilitie, alas the Lord abhorreth it, and ſendeth vs away like proud praters, not like Chriſtian prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to his heauenly maieſtie. Thirdly, it is required that we haue hope. For although we ought to be humble, yet not ſo throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en downe muſt we be, but that ſtill we reſt aſſured of accepta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with God for Chriſt, although not for the worthyneſſe of our worke: and in that hope offer cheerefullie our obedience to the Lord. Thus teacheth <hi>Peter</hi> when he ſayth:<note place="margin">

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:1629:218"/>
of. Fourthly our actions muſt bee done in loue both to God and man. For if we could ſpeake with tongues of men and Angels, if we haue no loue we are but as ſounding braſſe, and tinckling Cymballes. Yea though wee feede the poore with all our goods and giue our bodies to bee burned, hauing no loue, it ſhall profit vs nothing. Laſtly, all our works words and thoughts ſhould reſpect the Lords glory, and not our owne. For if wee do any thing to bee ſeene of men, <hi>verely</hi> ſayth our Sauiour <hi>they haue their reward.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math. 6.5.</hi>
                  </note> And thus doe you ſee nowe which is true ſanctification and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes of life, ſuch as will truely moue to vs our election and future glorification with Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt in the kingdome of heauen. Euen woordes, deedes, and ſecret thoughtes thus warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both for matter and manner as hath bene ſhewed. Thinke of theſe rules and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelues by them.</p>
               <q>My heart conſenteth to all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a true Sanctification, and right obedience, but yet giue mee leaue to queſtion for my moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. What now if theſe things be in
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:1629:218"/>
a man or a woman with great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſhall therefore their woorke be reiected, and yeld no comfort co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their election?</q>
               <p>God forbid. And therefore thus much take with you further y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> exerciſing your ſelf in things commanded, &amp; doing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this maner as hath bene ſayd, ſo nere as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord inableth you, wreſtling according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your fayth euery day to bee leſſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and more righteous, though y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> perfect righteouſnes which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law requireth be not found in you by reaſon of your weakenes, yet are you counted in the ſight of GOD Sanctified, holy and acceptable in Chriſt Ieſus, and ſo Sealed vp to the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And that I may not ſay it to you, but proue it, conſider I pray you the example of S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, who though hee were ſo ſanctified and borne a newe as that thereupon hee might ſafely and ſurely conclude his election for euer, to inherite heauen by Chriſt, yet felt he and found hee very many imperfections in himſelfe, and ſayth playnely:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom. 7.15.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I alow not that which I do. For what I would, that do I not, but what I hate that doe I.</hi> Againe when I

would do good, I am thus yoked, that euill is preſent with me. Againe, <hi>In my minde I ſerue the lawe of God, but in my fleſh the lawe of ſinne. O wretched man that I am</hi> therfore, <hi>who ſhall deliuer me from the body of his death</hi>: with ſundry other ſpeeches to the ſame ende in that place. Whereby I ſay wee are playnely taught that humane imperfection is farre from prouing any thing againſt our true ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Yea this is the true perfection of of them that are borne anewe, to confeſſe with the Apoſtle that they are imperfect. And to our great comfort let vs note it, that this Apoſtle, ſanctified thus imperfectly, &amp; groning vnder the griefe of ſundry wants and weakeneſſes, yet ſo aſſured himſelfe of his election, by ſo much as hee had, that in the next chapter he is not afrayd to breake out thus, <hi>I am perſwaded that neither death nor life,</hi>

                  <hi>Angels, nor principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor powers, nor thinges preſent, nor thinges to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall bee able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> See then, and neuer forget it, that ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:1629:219"/>
though but in part and with much want, yet is accepted with God &amp; man, and ought yeld that man and woman that hath it ſuch a comfortable perſwaſion as this, namely, that nothing ſhall be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from their God. So that they be not negligent in harty hungring ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more. Which euer is to be ſearched for carefully in our ſelues. For euen ſo did this Apoſtle if you marke it. <hi>I delight</hi> ſayth he, <hi>in the lawe of God concerning the inner man.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>verſ. 22.</hi>
                  </note> And as long as he found ſome meaſure of grace, and an heart that ſtill wiſhed more, and ſighed for more, and delighted in good, ſo long was hee cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full touching his eſtate with God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>verſ. 23.</hi>
                  </note> albeit till his dying day he ſawe another lawe in his members rebelling againſt the lawe of his minde, and leading him captiue to the law of ſinne, which was in his members. This example then is notable to this end, and let vs not forget it. Would God alſo the contrarie were more earneſtly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than it is, namely, that if ſome meaſure of holy conuerſation, together with a mind moſt feruently wiſhing more, and euen grieued for want of more, yeld me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſoules
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:1629:220"/>
comfort, that neyther lyfe nor death, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing ſhall ſeparate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Lord, what will, neither any meaſure at all, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any deſire of any, nor anie griefe for want of any, or for huge flouds of vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe that ouerflowe vs both bodie and ſoule, our words, our works, our thoughts or lookes, and all things wee doe: I ſaie what will this yeelde to the conſcience one daie, but euen a dreadfull blow, that as the other neuer, ſo we euer are appoynted and red to be ſeparate from Chriſt Ieſus. O then take heede betimes, and cutting off e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day by the ſwoorde of Gods giuen grace, iniquitie, and ſinne, lette vs hunger and thirſt to ſerue GOD in holyneſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all the dayes of our lyfe, and by fruites of a true new birth <hi>to make,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath tolde vs, <hi>our election ſure.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>2. Cor. 12.</hi>
                  </note> Another proofe to your queſtion, that imperfections in our newe birth and ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not diſcourage vs, is the ſame Apoſtle againe, troubled in another place ſo grieuouſly with his owne concupiſcence that pricked in the fleſhe the meſſenger of Satan, that he beſought the Lorde thrice that it might departe from
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:1629:220"/>
him. The Lordes aunſwere as we know was this, that his grace was ſufficient for him. For through weakneſſe his power was made perfect. Playnly teaching vs &amp; graciouſly chéering vs, that for our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections he will not reiect vs. It is one thing to haue ſinne raigning in vs, and an other thing to haue it dwelling in vs. The one we are forbidden, the other we ſhall be ſubiect to whileſt wee liue.

<q>O, but the children of God are ſubiect many times to ſuch a dulneſſe and deadneſſe in compariſon of ſweete rauiſhing motions that they haue felt, that Satan catching and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his opportunities is readie to perſwade that ſurely nowe they are fallen away, and GOD hath giuen them ouer.</q>
Moſt true it is, and yet all for the beſt.

For ſurely, if we had not ſuch alterations and chaunges, we ſhould thinke that grace were nature in vs, wee ſhould not eſtéeme of that ſweete power of the ſpirite as wee doe, when after a dulneſſe it returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, neyther any way bee thankfull as now we are.

For to let paſſe the former part, ſo plainly taking away diſtinction of Iewe or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, of bond or free, in affirming that al that the father giueth him ſhall come to Chriſt, what nation or language ſoeuer they bée of, how ſweet is the ſecond part to a ſinfull ſoule groaning and ſighing vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of iniquitie, ſore laden and euen preſſed downe with thoughts, words, and deedes in the ſight of the Lorde damnable? For what might be your caſe, looke at your ſelf: Haue you read in the lawe, that if God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

into iudgement with you, ſinne is ſo great, that you are but gone? Doe your tranſgreſſions pricke you, and looſe courſe of life begin to ſting you? What then? are you dead, and wil you not liue? are you ill, and will you be no better? Smarteth your ſoule within through the deepe wounde of ſinne, and will you haue no eaſe? O yes full faine, ſay you, but my ſinnes, my ſinnes are ſo out of meaſure, great and horrible, that I feare the Lord hath caſt me off, and hath no mercie for me? Ah <hi>deuell auant.</hi> Doth my Sauiour ſay here, he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me, and is not a very great ſinner, I caſt not away. No, no Satan, my God and Lord, my Chriſt and ioy ſpeaketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely of any man, of any woman, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſe, he that commeth vnto mee, bee he Iewe, be he Gentill, be he bond, be he frée, Greeke or Barbarian, and what ſinne or ſinnes ſo euer hee bee troubled for, how weake and fraile ſo euer, how poore &amp; vile ſo euer, yea be his ſinnes mo than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heares of his head, mo than the ſand of the ſea, ſo that his heart fayle him with <hi>Dauid</hi> for them, yet if he come to him, he is welcome, he is accepted, and hee will not caſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:1629:228"/>
O ſoule awake then, be of good cheare within me, caſt away the mourning wéede, and hearken to thy moſt gracious GOD, may you ſay. Sorrowing and ſighing for that which is paſt, as my duetie is to him will I go, knowing that he is the ſame ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, to day, and for euer. His pitie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth not, his mercie fadeth not, others haue found it, and why ſhould I doubt of it? Neuer came ſinner with ſorrowe and faith but hee was accepted, and his owne mouth in this place ſayth it, <hi>No man that commeth to me will I caſt away.</hi> Nay ſee further comfort here by theſe wordes. Were it ſo that my heart were as it were cloſed vp for a time (the Lords will being in this ſort to exerciſe me, humble mée, and trie me) that I could not beléeue, nor pray, nor ſorrowe nor feele any comfort, yet if euer there was a time wherein I could doo theſe things, and did them in and with a feeling of ſweet aſſurance of Gods fauour in Chriſt to my poore ſoule, that time doth tell mee that the Father hath giuen me to Chriſt, and that I did come to him then, and nowe I heare that he that commeth to him hée caſteth not awaye neuer, neuer.

Therefore bee of good comfort, his ſpirite is not gone, it is but hidden, and with-held for a time, as fire couered with aſhes, it wil come agayne doubled and increaſed.

Happely wee may ſay the Lorde hath ſhot one head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe arrowe at vs, to quicken vs, &amp; awake vs out of earthly &amp; worldly ſecuritie, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely an arrowe with a heade, that hath ſomewhat pearced, let it be two or three, or twentie, alas this is not the number of the Lordes archers, this is not to feele the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Lord and his battels, euen all his battels ioyned together againſt vs. I pray you therefore ſtill marke <hi>Iobs</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and your meaſure, and yet <hi>Iob</hi> loued.

or elſe looſe his deſire: to be pinched in his wages, enuyed and maliced by his owne fleſh, driuen to depart without any farewel, purſued after, vexed with wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full accuſations and charges, to haue the wife whome hee loued, not altogether vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in iudgement of religion, his bed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by his eldeſt ſonne, his daughter ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed and taken away, a horrible murder committed by <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> vpon that quarell, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſolde, but as hee thought, murdered by a wilde beaſt, with many mo very bitter and ſmarting temptations, if you marke the ſtory?

Truely wee muſt

Now, if thoſe worthies of the Lorde, for ſo many and ſo great euilles, not of one or two men, but euen almoſt of the whole people made a conſcience yet not to eſtraunge themſelues from the Church, ſhall not you and I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate too much to our ſelues, if wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to doe it in theſe daies?

you muſt forbeare, nay refuſe and vtterly abhorre al receyuing of the Supper of the Lord but with a choyce company of ſelect and holy ones. But is this true nowe that other mens ſinnes neuer conſented to by me do defile mee, if I receyue with them? God forbid. The flat contrary is a ruled caſe in diuinitie &amp; was ere wee were borne amongſt the learned and godly of al times. And as it were with one voyce they haue affirmed it in this and ſuch like ſort: That a Chriſtian man ſhould be ſory and grieued if he ſee that moſt holy Sacrament abuſed of any wicked and bad ones which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto it, and indeuour as much as in him lieth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if may not be ſo, but yet may he not himſelfe depriue himſelfe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor withdrawe himſelfe from the Church, but both take it for a true Church notwithſtanding this blemiſh, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in her ſocietie and felowſhippe ſo long as the worde is preached, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adminiſtred therein, without any ſeparation from it for this cauſe. And the proofes hereof haue partly beene aledged before in the examples of the godly Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches, Prophetes, Apoſtles, and Chriſt

himſelfe. In the Church of <hi>Corinth, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, Epheſus</hi> and others, wherein though there were great blemiſhes, as hath beene ſhewed, yet were they neuer commaunded one to auoyd an others company at thoſe exerciſes that the Lorde in common inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all, and left not to their libertie to vſe or not vſe: They ſeparated themſelues carefully from thoſe crimes and faultes that they rebuked and diſliked in others, but from their Churches and holy exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they ſeparated not themſelues, but entred into their Synagogues at al times, whereſoeuer they came, and when they were at prayers, prayed with them, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them, and partaked with them in commaunded dueties, neither were they once hurt by their ſo doing. Then further may we adde in this matter of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants that which truly we ſhould not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh or conſider, but very earneſtly thinke of.

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:1629:263"/>
againſt it fully. In theſe wordes of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſayth he, two things are to be noted. Firſt that to eate the bread of the Lord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthyly, is not to communicate in their company that are vnworthy, but not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prepare our ſelues, and to weigh our owne faith and repentance. Secondly that when we will receyue this Sacrament we beginne not with others, and fall in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, but that we trye our ſelues, &amp; ſet our eyes that way. For truely if all things bee conſidered well, they that haue ſo much leaſure to examine others, in them ſelues they are moſt negligent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull. For vppon mine owne experience, ſayth hee, I know one yet aliue, that caried headlong with this nicenes that hee would not receyue with vs for ſome mens faults that pleaſed him not, he ſeparated himſelfe quite from our company. And yet in the meane tyme had them in his owne houſe of moſt lewde behauiour. When I knewe it, I got one to admoniſh him (for of my ſelfe ſayth Maſter <hi>Caluin</hi> hee woulde take nothing) and to aſke what he meant to be ſo ſtrict in the Church, a houſe not in his gouernement, and ſo faultie in his owne
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:1629:264"/>
houſe where hee had gouernement. Muſt hee needes bee defiled in the Church by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy communicants, and cleere at home from ſo neere euill. And it pleaſed God to worke with him, ſayth he, that he ſawe his folly, and afterwarde reconciled himſelfe both to the Church and mee, confeſſing at laſt, that our chiefe and firſt care muſt bee of our ſelues and our familie, next and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly of others. And howe? Not for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or hatred, becauſe they do not ſo well as they ought, to ſeparate our ſelues from the Church, but to correct them and amend them, and to bring them into the way, or according to our places to procure their remouing if they will not. Or if wee cannot effect that, then to leaue all to the Lord to performe and make better. Thus farre Maſter <hi>Caluin,</hi> not vnworthy our earneſt noting, though it be very long. And truely marke it againe, that in ſaying his <hi>owne damnation,</hi> he tyeth the harme that commeth by his vnworthy receyuing to himſelfe, and ſtretcheth it not to others, which yet needes he muſt haue done, if the company of any at that table did defile the godly. Hee muſt haue ſayd, hee eateth and
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:1629:264"/>
drinketh to his owne damnation, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that receiue with him &amp; knowe him. But God forbid.

For as much therefore as by Gods permiſſion the Church is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by theſe men, what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſoeuer they bee, if they ſee the notes of the Church there, it ſhall bee better not to ſeparate themſelues from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Neither hurteth it, that ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true doctrine is there deliuered. For there is hardly any Church that hath not ſome reliques of ignorance.

The thing it ſelfe yeeldeth very great ſtrength to our fayth, as touching the receiuing of that we aſke, conteining in it three notable reaſons to that effect. The firſt is drawne from the duety of a King, which is, to heare his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, to defende and preſerue them.

The ſecond reaſon is drawne from his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which as it is infinite, ſo is it able to giue vs whatſoeuer we want. There is nothing too hard, nothing to great, which he cannot giue. Thine is the power, euen all power, might, and ſtrength, ioyned with goodneſſe, and therefore I faint not. The third reaſon is taken from the end or final cauſe. <hi>For thine is the glorie</hi>: that is, wee deſire theſe things for thy glory.<note place="margin">
