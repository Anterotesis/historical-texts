            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By the Kingdome of God, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is underſtood <hi>the miniſtery of the Goſpell</hi>; becauſe the Elect are admitted into the Kingdome of God by the miniſtery of the Goſpell, and God raignes in their hearts by the ſame: Thus it is taken, <hi>Math. 11.11. He that is leaſt in the Kingdome of Heaven is greater than <hi>John:</hi>
               </hi> that is, the leaſt Miniſter of the Goſpell of Chriſt can give a greater report of Chriſt than <hi>Iohn:</hi> we (the Miniſters of the Goſpell) are ſaid to be greater than <hi>Iohn,</hi> not <hi>propter

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, by the Kingdome of God is underſtood <hi>the Eſtate of grace in this life,</hi> whereby an entry is made into the Kingdome of God. Thus it is taken in the Goſpell of <hi>Luke, Luk. 11.21. The Kingdome of God is within you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, by the Kingdome of God is meant <hi>the eſtate of glory in the life to come,</hi> where God raigneth more perfectly in his Saints, and more fully, and therefore chiefly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>And ſo it is taken, <hi>Ioh. 3.3. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be borne againe, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

            <p>Meates are not materialls of the worſhip of God, for a man doth not pleaſe God becauſe he eateth fiſh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than fleſh: or drinketh Beere ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Ale: or that ſitteth at the Sacrament rather than knéele.</p>

            <p>And who is ignorant of what jarrs and ſtrifes were betwéene the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne and Weſterne Churches in <hi>Victors</hi> time, and all about kéeping of Eaſter day?</p>
            <p>Afterwards whither the Lords Supper ſhould bée celebrated with Bread leavened, or unleveaned?</p>
            <p>The Churches of <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> are much to blame, which breake off ſociety with the Churches of Calviniſts (as they are termed for diſtinction ſake) becauſe of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the Bread in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, whither it ſhould be eaten whole or broken?</p>
            <p>So what a world of trouble hath béene ſtirred up in <hi>England</hi> about
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19662:10"/>
matters of nothing, about ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church, Croſſe, Surplice, and knéeling at the Communion?</p>
            <p>For theſe indifferent things the knot of brotherhood is not to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, nor Communion forſaken.</p>
            <p>But hee that is diſobedient to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, herein for his diſobediedce, ſhall beare his owne burden, for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authority ought to bee obeyed in things indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, although the thing be indifferent yet to obey or not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey in ſuch things is not indifferent. Diſobedience unto lawfull authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is againſt him. <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> But that theſe things fore mentiond are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferents, it is plaine, for they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded nor prohibited by the word of God, neither are theſe in their owne nature good nor evill: they are neither <hi>Cum verbo,</hi> nor <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra verbum, ſed praeter verbum:</hi> they are neither with the word, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the word, but beſids the word, as ſaith an ancient Father: being things indifferent, they may be done and God pleaſed, and they may not be done and God pleaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:19662:10"/>Yet what bitter cenſures are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us about theſe things? igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſons cenſure others very headily which differ from them, and condemne every thing they cannot reach to: as here the Iewes weake in judgement, account the beléeving Gentiles which uſe their liberty in meates and drinkes, violators to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and rebells to God.</p>
            <p>I would have all ſuch as are ſo forward to cenſure their brethren in theſe things of a middle nature know that in things of indifferency it is the intent of the doer, that makes that good or naught that is done, for the things in their owne nature be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor evill: (which makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe that deny <hi>Adiaphora</hi> things indifferent, holding all things to bee either evill or good) now of the inward intention God alone is the diſcerner, ſo that in theſe things hée alone is to bee the Judge: therefore abſtains from judging, leſt thou béeſt an uſurper of Gods office.</p>
            <p>Amongſt us, hee that ſitteth will cenſure him that knéeleth, as idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19662:11"/>
and hée that knéeleth, cenſures him that ſitteth as ſuperbious: But Chriſtians ſhould have a more charitable opinion one of another in theſe things indifferent, done or not done: as <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth, <hi>qui non man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducat, manducantem nc iudicet, Ro. 14.3. He that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leave him unto him, who knowes the intention of our hearts, but he that out of pride, or filthyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or a ſuperbious mind, ſhal oppoſe himſelfe to authority in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different (eſtabliſhed for the good of Gods Church) ſhall as I have ſaid beare his condemnation whatſoever he be.</p>
            <p>Séeing then theſe ceremonies are neither parts of Law nor Goſpell, what reaſon have Chriſtians to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for them, why doe not private men, rather yéeld to publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among us. Indéed for ſuch things as pleaſe or diſpleaſe God (as precepts of the Law, promiſes of the Goſpell, faith and obedience towards God) wée are ſtrongly to

            </p>
            <p>What will ſtrangers ſay of us thus living in diſcord? Theſe are the Chriſtians, they cannot agrée, one holds one thing, another ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what Religion call you this? As the Papiſts doe hereby take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to blaſpheme our Religion, forgetting their owne domeſticall contentions in more and more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matters.</p>

            <p>The Croſſe is uſed to diſtinguiſh us from Infidels that deride us, for depending on Chriſt crucified for ſalvation.</p>

            <p>The ſurplice is uſed as a garment of decency in the miniſtery of the word: ſeverall robes are appointed for ſeverall callings: The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Lords in their Robes, the Judges in their Robes, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpell in their Robes: what errour can there be in all this? where is there the leaſt glimpſe of ſuperſtition herein?

            <p>Many other things are alledged againſt knéeling at the Sacrament, but I will not ſpend too much time about them, but haſten to weightier matters as righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt: <hi>For the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is not meates, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>This counſell being followed, will bring much credit to our Engliſh
