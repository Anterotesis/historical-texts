         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE

Deputy Lieutenant

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE ſhort Experience I
had of your Friendſhip
and Candor, enclines
me now to believe you will
<pb facs="tcp:65929:3"/>
not reject this Poor Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
although he boldly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to intrude himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Honour's Protection.
Indeed I am no great Friend
to the <hi>Common Vanity</hi> of <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Dedicatory,</hi> and therefore
in making my Court to you,
inſtead of troubling you with
an impertinent <hi>Dinn of Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
I ſhall only tell you
the <hi>naked Cauſe</hi> that urg'd me
to lay theſe Papers before
you.</p>
            <p>Sir, 'tis the general Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
you bear of a true <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Gentleman, One that in
all Reſpects, both by your
<pb facs="tcp:65929:3"/>
Practice and Preſident, are
duly qualified to vindicate
and aſſert the Rights and
Priveleges of a <hi>Country Life;</hi>
and that it is <hi>that</hi> has forc'd
upon you <hi>the Patronage of
theſe few Letters,</hi> which if
you think worth your Peruſal
and Owning (and truly <hi>that</hi> at
preſent is the moſt diſturbing
Conſideration) you'll ſoon
find that the <hi>Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
has not more Need of a
<hi>City Companion,</hi> than the <hi>City
Companion</hi> has of a <hi>Country
Patron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, my Lord, he humbly
flies to you for Safeguard, and
<pb facs="tcp:65929:4"/>
who ſo fit to ſhelter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him as he that not only
enjoys the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of a <hi>well-order'd
Country Life,</hi> but withal
knows, but hates and ſcorns,
the <hi>Follies and Vices of the
Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I am affraid, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what a Lewd World
this Poor Companion is to
make his Progreſs in, if I
ſhould turn him out alone,
ſome Bully, Sharper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
would meet and uſe him
rudely, which they dare
not, ſo long as he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
under the <hi>Shadow of
your Protection;</hi> for once,
<pb facs="tcp:65929:4"/>
then, Sir, be pleaſed to
take him <hi>into your Care,</hi>
at leaſt <hi>foſter him for a
Night or two,</hi> till you have
examin'd his Credentials, and
then diſpoſe of him as you
ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, while I am thus
importuning you for <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
I forget <hi>my ſelf,</hi> who
perhaps may more want an
<hi>Advocate</hi> to excuſe the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Trouble of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
than the Book it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
does a <hi>Patron,</hi> and
<hi>ſome body</hi> to plead for the
Errours and Frailties of it.
There's nothing, that I know,
<pb facs="tcp:65929:5"/>
but an extraordinary Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Generoſity can engage
you, either to <hi>forgive the

            <p>THE giving <hi>Advice</hi> and
<hi>Reproof,</hi> has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
juſtly reputed one of the
moſt Exalted Acts of <hi>Friendſhip</hi>
that can paſs between Man and

<hi>miſ-apply'd,</hi> or, what's as
<pb facs="tcp:65929:6"/>
bad, <hi>miſunderſtood,</hi> that like a

            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>common fate</hi> in
moſt Caſes, but then, when they're
Intermixt too with an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Repreſentation</hi> of
Men and Things, they are ſtill
more difficult: So that in ſuch a
Caſe, 'tis next to an <hi>Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
to recommend 'em with any
<hi>tolerable</hi> Advantage or Succeſs.</p>
            <p>As for this Poor <hi>Vade Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
'tis ſo <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>trivial</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:65929:6"/>
it ſelf, that it can hardly justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
even its Pretenſions to an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle;</hi>
but then conſidering what
kind of Perſons it is to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
'twill be neceſſary, I
think, to <hi>premiſe</hi> a few things
to prevent <hi>miſ-conſtructions</hi> and
<hi>miſtakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> General Deſign, <hi>I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
I need not mention; the</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>has done that before,</hi> i. e. <hi>that
it is intended for,</hi> A Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for Country Gentlemen
and Strangers, firſt to diſcover
and expoſe, and then to Guard
and Fortify 'em againſt the
Cheats, Vices and Follies of
the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65929:7"/>
That's the <hi>Deſign</hi> of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and how far 'twill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that <hi>Deſign,</hi> must be left
intirely to the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the
<hi>Reader</hi> only with this ſhort
<hi>Caution,</hi> that if he pleaſes he
may do the Author this Juſtice,
to conſider that he's Writing <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
and then if his <hi>Characters</hi>
and <hi>Repreſentations</hi> are a little
more abrupt and ſhort than they
might, or perhaps ought to be in
other Caſes; That's a very good
Plea and Excuſe for 'em.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Things</hi>
that are here Expos'd and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
I preſume, that no
<hi>Gentleman</hi> that has liv'd in
<pb facs="tcp:65929:7"/>
               <hi>London</hi> any conſiderable time,
but will allow 'em to be true in
the main; and that furniſh's me
with an Anſwer to an <hi>unkind
Reflection,</hi> which I perceive lies
very ready to be paſt upon me, <hi>i. e.
That a Man muſt conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be a very Vicious Perſon
himſelf that is Qualified, to
give a general Deſcription of
the Cheats and Vices of a Lewd
Town;</hi> But why ſo I wonder,
they may as well repute a Man
to be a <hi>Good Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe
he has gathered up ſome general
Notions and Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
which he makes no other uſe of
then to deceive the <hi>World,</hi> or
prate over at a <hi>Tavern,</hi> or an
<hi>Ale-Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65929:8"/>
The Caſe is the very ſame,
and truly, I can't conceive why a
Perſon that has Eyes and Ears,
and a little underſtanding can't
have a <hi>Curſory Knowledge</hi> of
theſe matters, without being any
other ways concern'd than as an
<hi>Obſervator;</hi> If ſome Peoples
Intellects are not ſo good as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who can help it? In
ſhort, this <hi>Reflection</hi> is ſo Dull
and Ridiculous, that 'tis below
an <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I'm confident,
there's none but the very <hi>Cheats</hi>
and <hi>Jilts,</hi> and ſuch ſort of
Rabble will make any uſe of it,
and let them e'n take it and
make their most on't.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65929:8"/>
Well, but that I may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
<hi>My Lords Herbert Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
make my Porch too big

allow'd, that I have made any
advances towards the deſtruction
or diſcovery of <hi>Vice,</hi> and but
one tho the ſhortest ſtep towards
the Support and Defence of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
which <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe, few will be
ſo hardy or unjuſt to deny, <hi>I</hi> have

               </argument>
               <p>'TIS but few Days (dear Sir)
ſince I received the ſurprizing
News of your Reſolutions to
exchange your Conntry for a
City Life. I confeſs the Report at firſt
ſtartled me, and indeed I would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it till I ſaw it ſolemnly confirm'd
under your own Hand. Well, I find, to
my great Aſtoniſhment 'tis really ſo, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65929:14"/>
the weighty Reaſons you give for it,
are, That you muſt have better Company
Diverſion and Education than your own
Country can afford you. But then Sir,
is there no way but preſently to Horſe
and to <hi>London?</hi> Is there no room left for
a ſecond Thought? What, hath this
<hi>London</hi> Expedition enhauns'd 'em all?
Muſt your good old Hoſpitable Seat, that
for ſo many Cenerations hath been the
Sanctuary of an Honourable Family, be
at laſt cruelly turn'd off and forſaken,
and left empty and void, and ſacrificed to
the Vices and Folly, or at leaſt to the
Nonſence and Impertinence of a debauch'd
City? For ſhame, conſider a little, and
don't let this Wild Thought take too deep
a root; and then I'll engage to point you
out a method whereby you ſhall not
only improve your ſelf with regard
to your Company and Education, but
withal enjoy the dear Opportunity of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Retirement, without being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the Interruptions and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that muſt conſequently await you
in this ſcurvy Town.</p>
               <p>But your Determinations are fix'd it
ſeems, and there's no removing 'em; to
Town you will come, let the Conſequence
be what it will. Well then, ſince I can't
diſſwade you from this giddy and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65929:14"/>
Adventure, I can however act
the other part of a Friend, and lay ſome
honeſt Cautions and Admonitions before
you, by the Aſſiſtance of which you'll
be the better qualified to guard your ſelf
againſt thoſe Cheats and Villanies, which,
as a Gentleman and a Stranger, you are
liable to be encountred with, before you
can come to have any tolerable Knowledge
or Idea of the Town.</p>
               <p>But, Firſt, you ſay, <hi>that the main thing
that brings you to</hi> London, <hi>is for the ſake
of good Converſation:</hi> Let me tell you Sir,
I ſpeak it from long Experience, you'll
ſoon find your ſelf cheated in your Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.
If it be good Company you
want, you muſt e'en ſeek it ſomewhere
elſe, for here 'tis hard, or rather not at all
to be found. You may form what Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Notions you pleaſe to your ſelf
concerning the Men and Things of this
Town; but, take the Word of your Friend
for't<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you'll quickly find your Miſtake
with a Witneſs. Alas! this Town is grown
ſo monſtrouſly corrupt and degenerate,
and ſo ſtrangely over-run with Vice and
Folly, that there's little good to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from the Society you'll find in't.
There are ſome few converſable Perſons,
I confeſs, Perſons of Sence and Honeſty;
but then they are ſo very few, and withal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65929:15"/>
ſo hard to be diſcern'd and come at, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by a Stranger, that how you'll do
to pick 'em out, I can't tell; for my own
part, I ſolemnly declare to you, <hi>That
after twenty years Experience, the Expence
of my Money, and the irreparable Loſs of
my Time, I have but very few Perſons in my
whole Catalogue that I dare recommend to
you, or can depend upon my ſelf for Friends
and Familiars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, no, Sir, if you will come hither,
you muſt take <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> as they are,
and not expect to find 'em juſt as you'd
have 'em. If you'll come here you muſt
ſometimes expect to be encountred with
the Apes and Peacocks of the Town, thoſe
uſeleſs Creatures that we dignifie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
by the modiſh Titles of <hi>Fops</hi>
and <hi>Beaux,</hi> and what's worſe, be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to ſuffer your Ears to be bor'd through
and grated with an empty, tedious Din of
their dull Impertinencies, or elſe the
ſqueamiſh Coxombs look awry and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
upon you, and immediately repute
you to be a <hi>proud, ill natur'd, unmannerly
Country Fellow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes you muſt be forc'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
<hi>the peeviſh Wranglings of contentious
Zealots;</hi> at other times be compell'd to
ruffle with <hi>the Inſolence of Bullies and
Sharpers,</hi> or content your ſelf to ſubmit
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65929:15"/>
to <hi>the Infamous Characters of a Cowar'd</hi>
and to be born down, inſulted and
impos'd upon, as often as thoſe <hi>good
natur'd Sparks</hi> ſhall think fit either to
make you their Property or Buffoon; nay,
what is ſtill worſe, you muſt be often
forc'd to endure <hi>the fulſom Steam of beaſtly
Ribaldry, intermix'd perhaps with the
horrid ſounds of Blaſphemy and Profaneneſs,</hi>
or elſe the <hi>Gentleman Moraliſt</hi> (as he is
pleaſed to call himſelf) preſently hiſſeth
you out of his Company as a <hi>Pragmatick
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper upon the Freedom of Common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi>
Sometimes you muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be cruciated with baſe and falſe
Innuendo's, and ſly and injurious Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Anon be plagu'd with the poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Breath of Backbiters, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
Hiſſings of Hypocrites and Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers.
In ſhort, in this beloved City, for
the dear ſake of which you ſeem ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately
reſolv'd to quit your Retirement,
your honeſt Country Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and what you ought to value
moſt of all, the Habitation of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
you'll meet with ſo many exalted
Villanies and Rogueries, and ſo many
Cheats and Tricks of all ſorts and ſizes,
that I know not where or how to direct
you to begin to form your new Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65929:16"/>
Here you'll ſee ſome pretending Piety,
to promote their own Ambition and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;
others extolling Charity and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
purely to advance Diviſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
and the generality crying out, and
exclaiming for the Good of the Publick,
that under that Veil they may conceal
their treacherous and baſe Ends, and have
a larger Opportunity to propagate their
own Advantage and Deſigns: and theſe
together with innumerable multitudes of
Rogues and Whores, Pimps, Bawds, and
Cheats, make up the Grand part of the
Converſation of this Town.</p>
               <p>Now this is Bleſſed Company (is it not?)
for a Man of Sence to be ſo fond of, that
for the ſake of it, he'll forgo the two beſt
Properties of his Life, <hi>i. e.</hi> his Liberty and
Retirement, and leave his Eſtate at Six's
and Sevens, or at beſt to the Management
of a few heedleſs Mercenary Servants, that
'tis ten to one, either through Avarice or
Negligence, betray or deceive him. Come,
Sir, I beſeech you, conſider again; look
once more into the Nature of your Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:
I proteſt to you, it ſeems to me
to be a kind of haſty Folly exalted into
Madneſs. What? Leave the endearing
Sweets of a Country Life, for a little dull
Noiſe, and rude Juſtlings and Confuſion.
To tell you my ſhort Thoughts of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65929:16"/>
matter, if this wild Motion holds, I'm
afraid I ſhall find your Name in <hi>Poor Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi>'s
Chronology the next New Year.</p>
               <p>Believe me, Sir, the Country is ſo
empty already, that a true <hi>Engliſhman</hi>
cannot look into it, without a great deal
of juſt Pity and Concern. Is it not a
very ungrateful Spectacle, to ſee ſo many
Noble Houſes mouldring into ruin, and
dropping down for want of Inhabitants?
and then to behold the prodigious Growth
and Increaſe of this unweildy City, and to
obſerve what a ſtrange multitude of People
there is jumbled together in it; who can
reflect upon this, but muſt neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Head in a little time longer
will grow ſo much too big for the Body,
that it muſt conſequently tumble down
at laſt, and ruin the whole? This is a
Misfortune, which I'm confident would
well become the Wiſdom of the Nation
to prevent; but 'tis foreign to my Deſign,
and ſo I will not inſiſt upon't: beſides I
have troubled you long enough, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
too long already; and therefore will
trouble you with no more now, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
my Deſign from Poſt to Poſt, till I
have either wean'd you from the vicious
Inclination of coming to <hi>London;</hi> or at
leaſt detected, and expoſed to you the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
and follies that attend upon it.</p>

and Diverſions of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Life, are infinitly preferable to
thoſe in Town upon many accounts.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SIR, in my former I briefly ſhew'd
you what kind of Converſation you
muſt expect when you come to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
and by the way, I would not have
you ſuſpect, that I have been any ways
partial in my Relation, or that I intend
to be ſo for the future. You may depend
upon't, you'll find the Men and Things
as I have reported 'em, and in ſome caſes
worſe. But let them be what they will,
it ſeems you will come to Town; you're
cloy'd with your honeſt Country Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and ſo are reſolv'd to come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in queſt of new and more agreeable
Pleaſures, as well as better Society.</p>
               <p>I muſt tell you that this is a worſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than your former; I muſt own, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
there is ſome ſmall matter to be ſaid
in point of Converſation, for this of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65929:17"/>
there's nothing at all to be urg'd:
'tis a Notion perfectly extravagant, and
in the Judgment of all ſober Men, ſtands
condemn'd as a fooliſh ridiculous Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and ſo will you too for making uſe
of it. We have ſome ſort of Antick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks
uſed here, 'tis true, to deceive Men
out of their Time and Money, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may paſs upon the fooliſh part of the
<hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Mob,</hi> under the Character
of Pleaſure; but alas! when you come to
take off the Vizard, and look into 'em in
earneſt, they are nothing elſe but pure
Cheats and Deluſions. He that will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
the Reaſonableneſs of an <hi>Adventure,</hi>
muſt be ſure to prove the Prize at leaſt to
equal the worth of what he hazards for
it; and when you can do this, I ſhall be
of your Mind, and allow you have done
very wiſely, when you have exchang'd
your Country for a City Life; but then,
in the <hi>Interim,</hi> I conjure you not to ſtir,
till you have clear'd the Point. I'm afraid,
Sir, to tell you my Thoughts, you have a
wrong Notion of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in general, and
falſly eſteem that to be <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and
<hi>Diverſion,</hi> which in truth is nothing elſe
but <hi>Vice</hi> or <hi>Folly.</hi> I hope you don't ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
there's any real Pleaſure in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries</hi>
or <hi>May-games</hi> of the Town, that's
a dangerous Principle indeed; and if you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65929:18"/>
once ſuffer your ſelf to be impoſed upon
by't, you'r in the ready road to utter Ruin
and Deſtruction. Perhaps you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
mighty matters from the <hi>Play-houſe</hi>
too; why, indeed, that is the only Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
we have in Town, that can any
ways pretend to a Singularity or Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
from the Country; but there too
(tho' 'tis the beſt way of paſſing away an
idle Hour, as I know of) you'll be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
whith ſuch a variety of ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Scenes and Actions, that in the main
you'll hardly find it worth your trouble.
There you'll find ſome clapping and ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
others hiſſing and ſcoffing; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
both without any Reaſon: There
you'll ſee ſome a Cock-horſe on the Seats,
damning and confounding the Play and
Players, they know not why or for what;
others throwing about their Wigs, and
almoſt blinding you with their fulſom
Powder, or tormenting you with the nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous
ſcents of their Perfumes and Pulvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios;
others prating with <hi>Orange-wenches,</hi>
or bantering the <hi>Whores,</hi> and what's more
probable, the <hi>Whores</hi> bantering of them.
In ſhort, there's ſuch a ſtrange Confuſion
and <hi>Jargon</hi> amongſt 'em, and ſuch a huddle
of Men and things jumbl'd together, that
unleſs you can abſtract the Good from the
Bad, and withal draw. Obſervations and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65929:18"/>
Diverſions from 'em both, I can't tell
what kind of Pleaſure or Satisfaction you
can propoſe from thence. 'Tis the very
ſame in all the reſt of our pretended Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions,
<hi>i. e.</hi> Bowling-green's, Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
Tennis-court's, Ordinary's, Ball's,
Muſick, Entertainments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
in themſelves may moſt of 'em
be innocent, and harmleſs enough; yet
they are generally ſo vitiated and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and the Pleaſure that they pretend
to, is ſo interwoven with Danger, as well
as Vexation of Spirit, that I defie the
greateſt Maſter of the Town to make it
appear that there is not more Pain and
Diſappointment, than there is real Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or Satisfaction, attending upon the
beſt of 'em. I dare ſay, if you could be
perſwaded to make a fair Eſtimate, and
compare the ſickly, feeble Pleaſures of this
Town, with your own Noble and Manly
Recreations, you'd find the latter turn
the Scale, with a great deal of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight.
Ours are all but wretched Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits
and Impoſtures, and will hardly
endure the Teſt of a Fruition. Indeed they
may be ſomething grateful to us at firſt,
but after we have repeated 'em once, or
twice, they grow flat and dull, and at laſt
loathſom: We are here like ſo many <hi>Bees</hi>
in a Garden, humming and roving about
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65929:19"/>
from one Flower to another, fooliſhly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to keep up our Courſe of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
by a continued ſucceſſion and circle
of Varieties. I'm confident, Sir, if you
had made ſo many Tryals of all this, as
I have done, you would not ſuffer your
ſelf to be impoſed upon by the roving Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of a blind Imagination; or run the
fooliſh riſque of being perpetually toſs'd to
and fro, in the ſearch of new Vanities, or
elſe to be contented to endure the tireſom
Scenes of the old repeated Impoſtures.
'Tis no matter for multiplying Words;
beſides I'm writing of Letters, which ſhould
be drawn into as narrow a Compaſs as
may be; or elſe there's enough to be
ſaid, to ſhew you that your Expectations
from the Pleaſures of the Town, are much
bigger than your Enjoyments can be; and
that thoſe in the Country, are much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to them. Your Diverſions in the
Country, <hi>i. e.</hi> your Hawking, Hunting,
Fiſhing, Fowling, and the like, are Noble,
Manly, and Generous, and do not cloy
or ſatiate their Poſſeſſors; but are ſtill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
upon 'em, and are every Day
growing more grateful, and delightful;
they are not ſpent or waſted by Fruition,
as ours are, but ſtill the more they're en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd,
the more they pleaſe and gratifie
the Enjoyers. Beſides, you would do well

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is demonſtrated that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
has, in the general, the ſame
Opportunity of Education as the
Town; and in many things, a great
deal more.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN my two former, I gave you my
haſty Thoughts concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
and Pleaſures of the Town.
In this I intend to trouble you only with
my Opinion concerning the <hi>Education</hi>
you expect in it. <hi>Education,</hi> I confeſs, is
a moſt precious and eſtimable Treaſure; a
Mine that contains ſo many rich Veins, that
no Perſons can be poor, that are in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it, unleſs they be ſuch, whoſe Sloth
and Idleneſs will not ſuffer them to dig
out the <hi>Ore.</hi> But, Sir, as to your Point,
the great Queſtion is, what kind of <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
it is that you come to <hi>London</hi> to be
improv'd in: You know I am ſenſible
your <hi>Education</hi> has been hitherto very
Liberal and Genteel, and that you're al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65929:20"/>
a tolerable Maſter of moſt of the
uſeful Qualifications, which are required
in a <hi>Gentleman.</hi> But ſuppoſing you were
not, and if that there were ſome other
<hi>Rudiments,</hi> which you either wanted, or
at leaſt had a deſire to be better inſtructed
in; why, I wonder may not there be as
good Opportunities to improve 'em in
the Country, as in this Town. Indeed,
if you have a Mind to learn to Fiddle
and to Dance, and ſhew little <hi>Apiſh-tricks,</hi>
or to be exact in the Rules of playing the
Fool, or the <hi>Pedant,</hi> here you may be
equipt. I confeſs, if you have a Deſign
to make your ſelf a good Proficient in
the Arts of <hi>Whoring,</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> or
to underſtand exactly the Methods of
<hi>Debauchery</hi> and <hi>Profaneneſs,</hi> this is indeed
the Place of the World.</p>
               <p>But then, for the Solid and Subſtantial
parts of <hi>Education,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Architecture, Heraldry, Fortification,
Limning,</hi> and the like, I'm very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
they may be acquir'd with far
greater Freedom and Conveniency in the
Country, than they can be at <hi>London;</hi>
eſpecially by a Gentleman of an Eſtate,
that has it in his power, to chooſe what
kind of Tutors and Directors he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>No, Sir, you muſt ev'n keep at Home,
if you expect to improve your <hi>Education;</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65929:21"/>
there you may enjoy the precious Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of Quiet and Sedateneſs, which
you muſt not expect when you come
hither: Here you muſt expect the quite
contrary, to be encountred with Noiſe
and Non-ſence, and to have your Thoughts
vitiated and diſturbed with Wranglings,
and Impertinence; which are the very
Bane and Canker of <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
But in the Country, all things are
generally ſtill and calm; there you have
few Cares to bend and torment your
Mind, and fewer Dangers to fright or
diſcompoſe you, there's no Hurryings and
Scramblings, nor Juſtlings, nor Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
of one another; but all the buſie
Actors are innocently and induſtriouſly
marching on in their proper Stations, and,
as far almoſt as the <hi>Human Nature</hi> is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of, huſht into perfect Reſt and
Repoſe. And now, Sir, can you think
of theſe things, and at the ſame time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
your giddy Reſolution to quit 'em
all, for the ſake of a noiſie paultry City.</p>
               <p>I would not have you miſtake me, I
am not adviſing you to a ſower Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Life, or ſhutting you up in a Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
I grant indeed, that the Flute and
Violin, that Dancing, Singing Fencing and
the like, may be very proper and innocent
Qualifications for a young Gentleman to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65929:21"/>
paſs away an idle Interval; but then, I
would not have him, like <hi>Nero,</hi> prefer his
Fiddle to his Empire; or, like <hi>Domitian,</hi>
ſpend his whole time in catching Flyes: I
confeſs, if he could uſe them as all
Bables and Trifles ought to be uſed, play
with them at his Leiſure and then throw
them by, there's no harm in them, but
they are rather an Accompliſhment.</p>
               <p>To make as ſhort of the Matter as I can,
there is but one thing within the Compaſs
of my Experience, in which this Town
can any ways improve your Education
beyond the Country, and that's a ſmall
thing in Point of Converſation. If you
were ſo well weighed both in your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Principles, that you might be
turned looſe to take a ſhort view of the
Town without any Danger, I mean, if
you could run through the different Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Humours of it, without being infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
or ſeduced by any of 'em, and
withal could extract from them too ſome
good Morals and uſeful Obſervations;
why then, if you did make a <hi>Winter
Trip</hi> to <hi>London</hi> for a Month or two, and
ſtay no longer, then indeed there would
be no great matter of Harm or Hazard in
it; but to leave your Eſtate to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Servants, and your Houſe
and Gardens to run into Ruin and Diſorder,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65929:22"/>
and to come up hither, and ſpend your
Time and Money, purely under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of better Company, Diverſion and
Education than your own Country can
afford you, is ſuch an unaccountable Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Folly and Madneſs, that 'twill at
once render you the <hi>Pity, Scorn</hi> and <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of all that know you. But here I'll
leave you to retire into your ſelf, and to
reflect in earneſt upon the Nature and
Conſequence of what you are about.</p>

as you can have in</hi> London. I might have
ſtopp'd there and left the Acquital that
theſe have receiv'd, at the Tribunal of
Reaſon and Common Experience, to have
included all the reſt: But Sir, that will
not thorowly anſwer my preſent Deſign.
I intend to expoſe the whole Town to you,
as the <hi>Spartans</hi> of old were wont to do
their drunken Helots to their Children,
to wean them betimes from the vicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Wine and Debauchery. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to lead you from one Seat of Action
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65929:23"/>
to another, and give you a ſhort View of
moſt of the <hi>Dangers, Tricks</hi> and <hi>Villanies</hi>
which, as a Gentleman and a Stranger, you
will conſequently be expoſed to when you
come to it. As to the Town it ſelf, <hi>'Tis
a kind of large Forreſt of Wild Beaſts,
where moſt of us range about at a venture,
and are equally Savage, and mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
one of another.</hi> I wiſh 'twere
poſſible to give you a <hi>Diſtant View</hi> of
the State and Manner of it. I'm confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the Spectacle (if you were not really
bewitch'd) would be ſo horridly odious
and ungrateful, that you'd have ſmall
Luſt to come at it, notwithſtanding the
Fury of your preſent Inclinations. The
firſt thing that you'd be encountred with
would be the diſmal Proſpect of an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Poverty,</hi> and <hi>Crowds of miſerable
People,</hi> either wrack'd with the Agonies
of their own Guilt or Folly, or groaning
under the intolerable Want of Bread,
or mad or infatuated by Oppreſſion, or
deſperate by a too quick Sence of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Infelicity; here you'd ſee us all
generally buſied to trappan, undermine
and deceive one another, which we are
forc'd to do to make good our miſtaken
Pretence to a Life of Senſuality and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
If you caſt your Eye upon the
Court, you'd ſee but few there but Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65929:23"/>
and Hypocrites, except it be ſome
nauſeous uſeleſs Creatures that are only
fix'd there for Show, and indeed are fit
for nothing elſe. If you look into <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter
Hall</hi> among the Lawyers, there
you'll be entertain'd with little elſe but
hideous Complaints for Want of Money
and Buſineſs, and find 'em all ſo ſower
and ill natur'd that you can hardly ſpeak
to any of 'em without endangering your
Noſe. Look among the Religious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and you'll ſee them in the very ſame
Condition, all furiouſly hating, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably
cenſuring one another, ſnapping,
ſnarling, grinning and biting, and almoſt
every Party wiſhing all the reſt damn'd,
but juſt thoſe few that agree with them
in their own Opinion and Judgment.
Obſerve the Shops, and you'll ſee an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Diſcontent and Melancholy hanging
in the Faces of their reſpective Owners.
You would ſee all theſe things, and many
other unpleaſant and tormenting Objects.
And what ſenſible Man then would not
be mightily rejoyc'd and ſatisfy'd that his
better Fortune hath remov'd him from
hence, out of the Noiſe and Participation
of all theſe Evils and Calamities, and be
conſtantly alarm'd, affraid and diſturb'd

the Bleſſings and Sweets of <hi>Retirement</hi>

your View, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Content, Happineſs,
and Quiet of the Country, and the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,

ſuch a Caſe, I hope I need not direct you
to make your Election. Well, the Caſe
is the very ſame, and if <hi>true innocent
Delight and Diverſion</hi> be preferable to
<hi>Debauchery and Exceſs:</hi> If Liberty be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Confinement, if a wholſom open

Air be better than contagious Smoak

why then the Country is
better than the Town, and there is none

Advantages that are wrap'd up in the
<hi>Comprehenſive Felicity of a Country Life;</hi>
but it ſeems the utmoſt I can ſay in the

ſo that I won't give you or my ſelf any

but rather turn the Current of
my Diſcourſe <hi>another Way;</hi> and firſt, tell
you <hi>my ſhort and blunt Opinion of what it

and then purſue the grand Part
of my Deſign, <hi>i. e.</hi> to expoſe to you
ſome of the moſt dangerous Cheats and
Tricks of the Town, that, as a Young
Gentleman and a Stranger, you are moſt
liable to be catch'd and trapan'd by.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65929:25"/>
Firſt then, to tell you my thoughts
in ſhort, I'm affraid your chief Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>for leaving the Country</hi> will appear
to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>you have too much
time upon your hands,</hi> and <hi>to be rid of it
you will venture to hazard your ſelf, your
Eſtate, Health, Liberty, and Retirement,</hi>
and all for Company, nay, what's worſe,
take in the Aſſiſtance of toylſome and
laborious Vice, and call it by the falſe
Name of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> rather, than be idle.
And, what! could the Country afford
you no Inſtruments for Relief in this
Caſe? Had you no Books to divert you,
nor no Opportunities to come at any?
Was there no Gentleman of Parts and
Learning, that you might exchange and
deal your Thoughts with? Had you no
Gardens nor Walks, no Fiſhing nor Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
nor was there no other Diverſion
to be found out to deliver you from this
intolerable State of Idleneſs? That's
hard indeed. I'm confident <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi>
did not uſe to be ſo barren, I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
heard your good old Father ſay, that
you never wanted innocent Diverſions
there, and that a Country Gentleman
might make his paſſage through human
Life <hi>in that County,</hi> with as much Eaſe
and Satisfaction, as in any part of the
World beſide; but the Scene is altered
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65929:26"/>
now, it ſeems; your Father was a dull,
old phlegmatick Fellow, and only hug'd
himſelf in a little old-faſhion'd Country
Happineſs, a little, good, honeſt, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Houſe-keeping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which, in
theſe Latter Days, are grown the Scorn
and Averſion of our new-faſhion'd Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>Indeed Sir, I muſt agree with you, that
<hi>Idleneſs is a very dangerous thing, and
the fertile Seminary of almoſt all other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi>
but then I cannot grant that <hi>London</hi>
is a proper Place to remove you out of
the reach of it. A Gentleman here is
in the main a Creature that's compos'd
of nothing but <hi>Pleaſure and Idleneſs,</hi> that,
like the <hi>Leviathan in the Deep,</hi> thinks he
hath little elſe to do in the Town but
to take his paſtime in't. I'll give you a
ſhort Account how ſome of our true-bred
<hi>City Gentlemen</hi> manage their time, and
then leave you to make your own Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>In this Town we have <hi>three diſtinct
Sorts of Idle Companions,</hi> which may be
properly differenced by the Reſpective

                  <head>The Character of a Sot.</head>
                  <p>A <hi>Sot</hi> is a kind of ſluggiſh filthy Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
that by a continued courſe of
Lewdneſs and Debauchery, has intirely
raz'd out the goodly Impreſſion <hi>Nature</hi>
at firſt made upon Him; and is degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the ſtricteſt Sence, from a Man
to a Beaſt. He's diſtinguiſhable from the

Shape, and Aſpect; you may diſcern him
by his dirty Hands and Face, his foul Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
ſore Eyes, ſtinking Breath, and twenty
other Badges of his Character, which he
conſtantly carrys about him. His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Living, is generally thus: About
Twelve or One, he commonly riſes, and
when he has careleſly hung on his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
he ſteers his Courſe directly for the

Laſt-night's Debauchery, calls firſt for a
Cooler of <hi>White-wine</hi> and <hi>Ale</hi> mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and when he has taken a ſwinge or
two of that, he ſends for the Maſter of
the Houſe: <hi>Faith,</hi> ſays he (with a kind of
Vanity) <hi>I was damnable drunk last Night,
and my Stomack is a little uneaſie this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
I think we had best try what a Quart
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65929:27"/>
of</hi> Hock <hi>for a Whet will do:</hi> By that time
this is drunk, and perhaps another, and a
Pipe or two of <hi>Tobacco</hi> ſmoak't into the
Bargain, in comes the <hi>Dinner;</hi> if he can
eat a bit, ſo, but 'tis ten to one whether
he can or not; however he can drink as
well as the beſt of 'em, and therefore ſits
down with them for Company. Here the
half Flask muſt be call'd for in Courſe,
and the good Miſtreſs of the Houſe's
Health begun in a <hi>Bumper,</hi> with ſo many
other endearing Healths, that 'tis ten to
one but he's more than half ſea's over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Cloth is remov'd. If he can get
any body to bear him Company, here
he fixes till he's ſo thorowly drunk, that
a <hi>Poſſe</hi> of <hi>Drawers</hi> and <hi>Porters</hi> are forc'd
to be call'd in to lug him into a Chair, or
Coach, to carry him out of Harms-way,
to his own Lodgings: But if he can prevail
with no body to do him the Favour to
ſtay here, and be drunk with him, then
in a ſort of hazy condition, he blunders
to the <hi>Play-houſe</hi> (the general Place of

that Voyage, or at leaſt forces him, upon
the ungrateful Inconveniency, to ſteer to
the next <hi>Barber</hi>'s Shop, to new Rig and
Mundifie. Perhaps ſome Antiquated
<hi>Whore,</hi> that for Company ſake can drink
and ſmoke a Pipe, and be drunk as well
as he, for want of a better Adventure,
halls him to her, and lays him aboard;
and if ſhe can but once decoy him to a
<hi>Tavern,</hi> ſhe ply's him ſo very warmly,
that ſhe ſoon makes him quite up, then
dexterouſly picks his Pocket, and ſo leaves
him. And this is the way a great many

paſs away their Lives till an Habitual

                  <head>The Character of a Beau.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ABeau</hi> is a Creature of a Nature ſo
different and diſagreeable to the
former, that you'd hardly take him to be
of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> and his time cut out
to quite contrary uſes; ſome of it is ſpent
in the idle purſuit of Modes and Faſhions,
in contriving his Cloaths, and putting
them on with the moſt Advantage; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
part of his time is conſum'd in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
Himſelf, or projecting to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
by others, and the reſt in hearing of
Flatteries, and reflecting and ruminating
upon them. The firſt three Hours of
every Day, are conſtantly dedicated to
the ſetting his <hi>Wig</hi> and <hi>Cravat,</hi> rolling his
<hi>Stockings,</hi> redning his <hi>Lips,</hi> and painting
his nauſeous <hi>Phiz,</hi> and the like. When he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65929:28"/>
thinks he has manag'd himſelf in the beſt
order as may be, perhaps he ſtalks maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically
to the <hi>Coffee-houſe,</hi> where he teizes
ſome-body with an Hour's Impertinence,
drinks his diſh of <hi>Tea,</hi> and is laught at,
and then, forſooth, he muſt have a Chair
call'd, to carry him to a Lady, that (it
may be) does him only the Honour after
all, to let him diue with her <hi>Dogs</hi> and her
<hi>Abigails;</hi> or perhaps, if ſhe be in a very
good Humour, and wants a little Sport,
will admit him to the favour to play
a Game at <hi>Cards</hi> with her, till ſhe has
won his Mony, and made him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Buffoon to the Company, and then
ſhe diſmiſſeth him with a Jeſt: From
hence, perhaps, he marches to another,
and tells her a thouſand Stories, how kind
my Lady—was to him, what a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Dinner they had, and how earneſtly
ſhe preſt him to ſtay longer with her; in
ſhort, 'tis ten to one but his Company
ſoon grows ungrateful there too. Ladies
don't often love ſuch Fools, that are fit
for nothing but to be ſtuck up in a Garden
to fright the Birds from the Fruit, which
they can cut none of themſelves; and ſo
to he rid of him, one of the Maids has
the Sign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> given her, to take him aſide, and
tell him that her Miſtris expects Viſiters,
and his Company won't be convenient.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65929:29"/>
From hence, it may be, he walks to the
<hi>Play-houſe,</hi> where his chief Buſineſs is to
obſerve the Ladies in the Boxes, and to
expoſe himſelf to 'em: when the Play is
done, he places himſelf at one of the
Doors of the Houſe, and ſtands ready
to offer his Hand to help them ſeverally
into their Coaches; if there be ever a One,
that will take him home with her, well
and good; if not, by the help of a Link,
he picks his way to the <hi>Groom Porter's,</hi>
where he lolls about for another hour or
two, and then the buſineſs of the Day is
done with him. If there be any broken
Intervals, which cannot be ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to theſe Set and Solemn Fopperies,
thoſe are commonly glean'd up by ſome
other little inſignificant Trifles; ſo that
the main of his whole Life, is nothing
elſe but one continued Scene of Folly and
Impertinence.</p>

                  <head>The Character of a Gameſter.</head>
                  <p>A <hi>Gameſter</hi> is a ſort of Compoſition of
both theſe together, half <hi>Sot,</hi> half
<hi>Beau;</hi> and in his Nature and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
worſe than either<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of them. Indeed
I want a Name for him; and if he be a
profeſt <hi>Gameſter,</hi> and has taken up the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65929:29"/>
Trade purely for a Livelihood, he's no
more fit to be admitted into the Society
of Country Gentlemen, than a Mad <hi>Dog</hi>
is to be turn'd looſe into a Kennel of
<hi>Beagles;</hi> where if he ſets his venomous
Teeth into any of 'em, they conſequently
run mad too, and ſo are fit for nothing
but to be worm'd, or hang'd, to prevent
the Infection of the reſt of the Company.
Theſe, forſooth, range the Town in the
Garb, and under the Characters of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and indeed ſome of 'em are ſo Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally,
but then in their Practices they
are not only a Reproach to their Family,
but to their Title too. 'Tis a worthy
Employment for a Gentleman, is it not?
to make it his Buſineſs to find out Young
Heirs of much Wealth, and little Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and to rook 'em at Play, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
'em into Suretiſhip, or perhaps,
betray 'em into ſome mean and unequal
Matches? This is their common Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
and when they have hit of ſuch
a One, they ſeize upon him with as much
eagerneſs, and obſerve him with the ſame
joy, as a Vulture does the fall of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe:
But I ſhall have other Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to ſpeak with them in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Places; and therefore I'll wave them
now. As to the Gentlemen that uſe
<hi>Gaming,</hi> as their ordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Method, to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65929:30"/>
ſquander away their Time, their uſual
Cuſtom is this: To ſpend their Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the <hi>Tennis Court,</hi> their Afternoon
at the <hi>Bowling Green,</hi> their Evening at the
<hi>Play Houſe;</hi> from thence to their Miſtris;
from her, to the <hi>Groom Porter's;</hi> from the
<hi>Groom Porter's,</hi> to the <hi>Tavern;</hi> and from
thence, perhaps (if they don't commit
ſome Outrages, that oblidges the <hi>Watch</hi>
to ſecure 'em from further Miſchief)
about four or five in the Morning they
get drunk to Bed. In ſhort, Sir, a <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſter</hi>
is a Compoſition of almoſt all the
Vices of the Town jumbl'd together; his
ordinary <hi>Dialect</hi> is Swearing and Curſing,
and his Occupation ſolely depends upon
Lying, Falſhood, and Perjury. His Life's
a perfect <hi>Lottery,</hi> and a <hi>Hazard-table;</hi>
to day he's a <hi>Squire,</hi> and ſo proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent,
no body can ſpeak to him; to
Morrow he's a <hi>Beggar,</hi> and as meek as a
<hi>Lamb;</hi> and but lend him a <hi>Guinea</hi> to ſet
him up, you may ſay or do what you
will to him: To have done with him,
his time is ſo equally divided between
Vice, Folly, and Impertinence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſo taken up and foreſtall'd by his
Deſigns and Projects, and which way to
manage his Cheats and Adventures, or at
leaſt he's ſo harraſs'd and fatigu'd with
his Loſſes and Diſappointments, that his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65929:30"/>
whole Thoughts, and that together, are
loſt in the hurry: And thus he lives
an abſolute Slave, and dies a perfect
Wretch.</p>
                  <p>You ſee, Sir, how theſe ſort of <hi>Sparks</hi>
ply their time; and truly, moſt of your
<hi>Country Gentlemen,</hi> that come to <hi>London</hi>
purely to ſpend their Mony, and to ſee
Faſhions, fall under one of theſe Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
Well, what can make Men,
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> eſpecially (that are diſtinguiſh'd
by ſeveral extraordinary Advantages from
the reſt of their kind) ſuffer themſelves to
be impos'd upon by theſe kind of Follies, I
know not: <hi>Idleneſs</hi> is certainly the grand
Cauſe, and according to that common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Nature, they muſt be doing of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
when they can find out no other
Employ. But then, has <hi>Vertue</hi> loſt her
Prerogative? Is ſhe grown in this laſt
Age ſo old and deform'd, that ſhe has
quite loſt all her Charms, and Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
No, no, my Friend; ſhe's ſtill
the ſame, as charming and as beautiful as
ever: the <hi>World</hi>'s grown worſe 'tis true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but <hi>Vertue</hi> never changes. If you would
but actuate your own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inchant
your ſelf from this unlucky Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
you'd ſoon find ſhe'd propoſe a
Method to you, both to delight and direct
you in your Country Life, a thouſand times
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65929:31"/>
beyond any thing in the moſt guſtful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities,
the City can pretend to.</p>
                  <p>To ſum up all, there's a kind of Iuſtice,
that oblidges a Gentleman to ſtay in the
Country, and live upon his Eſtate; this
he ſhould do, not only for the ſake of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Hoſpitality, but likewiſe upon
the Account of his poor Neighbours and
Tenants, to whoſe Sweat and Labour, a
great part of the Profits and Advantages
of his Land is owing. They, I'm ſure,
ſhou'd be encourag'd, ſupported, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted;
but how can that be, when the
the whole Profits muſt be ſent up to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Grandeur, Equipage, and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
of a lewd Town? And 'tis ſome
odds too, whether the Annual Rents will
do the buſineſs, or no; 'tis very often ſeen
that ſuch kind of Luxuries and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Methods of living, not only deſtroy
the Crop, but the Soil likewiſe; prey upon
the very Heart and Vitals of an Eſtate;
and many have ſtay'd ſo long in Town,
till they have had nothing left to retire to
in the Country. There's much to be ſaid
to prove this Town to be the Forge of
<hi>Vanity,</hi> a Nurſery of <hi>Vice,</hi> a Snare to the
Young, a Curſe to the Old, and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Spring of new Temptations. But,
Sir, I ſaid enough already, to let you ſee
my Sentiments of the Matter. My next
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65929:31"/>
buſineſs ſhall be to diſcover and expoſe to

               <p>SIR, having finiſh'd the firſt Part of
my Deſign, and, as I ſaid, expos'd the
Town to you, as the <hi>Spartans</hi> were wont<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to do their Drunken Helots to their
Children. I come now to the ſecond
thing; <hi>i. e.</hi> firſt, to lay before you ſome
of the Humours, Tricks and Cheats of
it, which, as a young Gentleman and a
Stranger, you are in moſt danger of; and
ſecondly, to give you ſome general Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Advice, <hi>how you may beſt guard
your ſelf againſt them.</hi> And firſt, Sir, I
will wait upon you to the Playhouſe (for
thither I'm confident your Inclinations
or Curioſity, or both together, will ſoon
lead you) and bear you Company accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the beſt of my Judgment through
the Different Accidents and Adventures
which, as a Stranger, you muſt expect
to be encounter'd with as ſoon as you
come there. In our Playhouſes at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65929:32"/>
beſides an Upper-Gallery for Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Coachmen, Mendicants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we
have three other different and diſtinct
Claſſes; the firſt is called the <hi>Boxes,</hi> where
there is one peculiar to the King and
Royal Family, and the reſt for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality, and for the Ladies and
Gentlemen of the higheſt Rank, unleſs
ſome Fools that have more Wit than
Money, or perhaps more Impudence than
both, crowd in among 'em. The ſecond
is call'd the <hi>Pit,</hi> where ſit the <hi>Judges,
Wits</hi> and <hi>Cenſurers,</hi> or rather the <hi>Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
without either Wit or Judgment.</hi> Theſe
are the <hi>Bully-Judges</hi> that <hi>damn and ſink
the Play at a venture;</hi> 'tis no matter
whether it be good or bad, but 'tis a
<hi>Play,</hi> and <hi>they are the Judges,</hi> and ſo it
muſt be <hi>damn'd, curs'd, and cenſur'd</hi>
in Courſe; in common with theſe ſit the
<hi>Squires, Sharpers, Beaus, Bullies</hi> and <hi>Whores,</hi>
and here and there an extravagant <hi>Male</hi>
and <hi>Female Cit.</hi> The third is diſtinguiſht
by the Title of the <hi>Middle Gallery,</hi> where
the Citizens Wives and Daughters, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the <hi>Abigails,</hi> Serving-men, Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-men
and Apprentices commonly <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ake
their Places; and now and then ſome
diſponding Miſtreſſes and ſuperannuated
Poets; into one of theſe you muſt go,
and truly, conſidering your Circumſtances,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65929:33"/>
I think the <hi>Pit</hi> is the moſt proper. Well,
when you come there, the Eyes of every
Body are preſently upon you, eſpecially
of the Whores and Sharpers, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
give out the Word, to try if any
body knows you; and if they find you're
a Stranger, then a Lady in a Mask, <hi>alias</hi>
Whore, which (as they expreſs it) is a
good <hi>Tongue-Pad,</hi> is forthwith detatch'd
to go and ſound you, and in the mean
time a Cabal of Bullies and Sharpers
are conſulting which way you muſt be
manag'd, and paſſing their Judgments
upon you. The Lady comes up to you
with a kind of formal Impudence, and
fixes herſelf as near to you as ſhe can, and
then begins ſome looſe, impertinent Prate,
to draw you into Diſcourſe with her. If
ſhe finds you a Man for their Turn, and
a true Squire, with ſome ſort of Subtil
and Inſinuating Civility, ſhe leaves you
a little, to go and make her Report to
her Friends and Allies, that are earneſtly
waiting to know the Succeſs of her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,
in another Part of the Pit;
here ſome proper Meaſures are ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
upon, and ſhe's diſpatch'd to you
again with new Inſtructions, and will be
ſure to ſtick to you till the End of the
<hi>Play;</hi> and in all the Interludes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
chattering to you, to ſcrew herſelf
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65929:33"/>
as far as poſſible into your Acquaintance,
and familiarity. When the <hi>Play</hi>'s over ſhe
certainly marches out with you, and by
the Way, perhaps does you the Favour
to let you have a Glimpſe of her Painted
Face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if ſhe ſees you take no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of her, and ſeem inſenſible of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
ſhe comes to a cloſe Parley with you,
and muſt needs know which way you go;
be it which way it will, her way's the very
ſame; and ſo to avoid the trouble of call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another Coach, if you'll ſet her down,
ſhe'll give you a Caſt another Night; 'tis
ten to one but this is agree'd to: and now
ſhe has got you by her ſelf, ſhe begins to
Cajole and flatter you, to commend ſome
particular Part; your Shape, Meen, Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
Good-nature, and Civility; but above
all, the Kindneſs in taking her into your
Coach; in Conſideration of which, if you'll
do her the Favour to go Home with her
to her Lodging, ſhe'll do her beſt to make
you Amends: When you come there, the
firſt part of the Entertainment is, with her
own Character, and Circumſtances, which
ſhe commonly makes uſe of, for an Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to enquire into yours; when ſhe has
fully equip'd her ſelf with your whole
State and Condition, if ſhe finds that
you're worth her trouble, why, then ſhe's
ſo much captivated with your Genteel
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65929:34"/>
Deportment, free Diſpoſition and your
Even Temper and Converſation, that you
muſt needs Dine with her to morrow,
and thus the Train is laid that will effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
blow you up and ruin you inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,
if you give her a ſecond Opportunity
to touch it with the fatal Coal. You are
hardly gone out of her Room, but in comes
the reſt of the Confederacy, a Set of
Bullies, Sharpers and Whores, and then
the Tables are ſoon turn'd, and you that
were but the laſt Moment one of the moſt
Accompliſh'd Perſons in the Univerſe,
are now made the grand Laughing-ſtock
for the Night; your Dreſs muſt be ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomized,
your Meen and Dialect Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon'd
and Ridicul'd, in ſhort, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
you fit for nothing but a Cully,
and <hi>that</hi> they reſolve by ſome means or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make of you. But to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the <hi>Playhouſe.</hi> If they find their
Whore can do no good with you, then
they try another Expedient, an Ingenious
Gentleman that's born Weſtward of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
makes up to you, and he, forſooth,
muſt know what Country-Man you are,
or what's a Clock by your Watch? or
what Part of the Town you lodge in, or
where you Sup? Theſe ſort of Sparks are
commonly well ſtock'd, I mean, with
Confidence and Impertinence, and ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65929:34"/>
don't ſtand much upon Forms and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
with you; but, <hi>by his Soul, if
you'll go along with him to the Tavern
and drink an honeſt Gentleman's Health of
your Country, which he either knows, or at
leaſt has heard his Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he can carry you
to a Glaſs of the beſt Wine in</hi> London;
his Bus'neſs with you is of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the former; if he can wheedle
you thither, firſt to make you drunk,
then to draw you in to Gaming, and then by
the help of his falſe Dice, and other tricks
and ſlights of Hand, the <hi>only Arts that
he's Maſter of,</hi> he ſoon gets your Ready
Money, takes your Notes for more by
which means he links you ſo faſt to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that without the greateſt Caution, you
are inſenſibly ruin'd before you can diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
your ſelf. But if this don't paſs
upon you neither; why then comes a
third, and his Buſineſs is to draw you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Quarrel, or at leaſt to try whether
you'll fight or not upon Occaſion; and if
you won't do that, they naturally conclude
that a <hi>Coward</hi> and a <hi>Cully</hi> are convertible
Terms, and ſo will be conſtantly teazing
you till they have gained their Point.
His Way of proceeding with you, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to tread on your Toes, cough in
your Face, ruffle, crowd or diſcompoſe
you. But after all, if he finds you reſent
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65929:35"/>
his Behaviour and grow rough with him
upon the Matter, he flies preſently to his
Grand Reſerve, beg's your Pardon, and
ſneaks off. When neither of theſe can
do your Buſineſs, then comes up a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
Hope, <hi>a worthy Old Matron, deeply
skill'd in the famous Science of Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and ſhe accoſts you firſt with a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
Phraſe or two perhaps; or if ſhe
finds that don't ſo well agree with your
Palate (for ſome of your <hi>Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
are not over-fond of Scripture nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
ſhe changes her Dialect into <hi>Bawdy,</hi>
and ſo with a little of one and t'other, and
a Check under the Chin into the Bargain,
ſhe whiſpers you i'th' Ear, and tells you
in plain Terms, <hi>ſhe perceives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you're a
young Country Gentleman, and if you have a
mind to have a Taſte of the Town, ſhe lives
in</hi> Bow-Street <hi>in</hi> Covent-Garden, <hi>and if
you'll come and Sup with her, ſhe can ſhew
you three or four Couple of the choceſt Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
(Ladies ſhe calls 'em) about the Town.</hi>
You ſee, Sir, how naturally all theſe Beaſts
of Prey hunt a <hi>Country Squire,</hi> and if they
can once blow him a little that he becomes
obnoxious to the Herd, they ſeldom loſe
the Scent till they have ſet him up (as you
Phraſe it) <hi>brought him to a Bay,</hi> and then
they ſoon pull him down and mangle him
as they will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but here we'll leave him, and

or Worſe; 'tis already in a ſtate of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion,
and for my part, I am not ſo
much a Friend to the <hi>Mob,</hi> or the <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
either, to give my Vote for its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Extirpation. To go on then, if it be
a New Play, the Houſe is commonly very
full, eſpecially if the Author be a new One
too; upon ſuch occaſions, every body
that has any Inclination for the <hi>Play-houſe,</hi>
is willing to gratify his Itch with a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty.</p>
               <p>Tho' indeed I muſt confeſs, when I
look into the Plays that were writ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and compare them with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
that have been writ here a late, in
my poor Judgment, the <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,</hi>
and (what's more ſtrange) the <hi>Stile</hi>
too, is grown ſo profoundly dull and flat,
that a Man muſt have a very good Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
that can digeſt ſuch intolerable traſh,
without a Surfeit. Well, let it be what
it will, provided it be ſtampt with a New
Name, and a ſtrange Title, it certainly
raiſes the <hi>Mob,</hi> calls together the <hi>Whores</hi>
and <hi>Bawds,</hi> the <hi>Squires, Beaus, Cits, Bullies,
&amp;c.</hi> that come all crowding in ſhoals, to
hear what this wondrous New Man can

good <hi>Acting,</hi> good <hi>Dancing,</hi> and
<hi>Singing,</hi> good <hi>Scenes,</hi> and the like, the
Sickly half-got Brat can be kept alive ſo
long, is commonly the grand Day; then
you may obſerve the general Humours of
the <hi>Houſe.</hi> In one part of it you'll ſee
the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>Wits,</hi> with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Hangers-on, and <hi>Interlopers,</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
and miſtaking the <hi>Scene,</hi> if there
be any, for the <hi>Non-ſence;</hi> 'tis ten to one,
if there be any Part above the reſt, but
ſome of theſe pretending <hi>Goxcombs</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
pitch upon that, for their Subject
to laugh at: the Reaſon of this is very
plain, perhaps they may know a little of
the <hi>Merry Andrew</hi> Parts, the dull <hi>Jokes</hi>
and <hi>Drolls,</hi> which at beſt are but the
Rubbidge and Lumber of the <hi>Play;</hi> but
for the Flights and <hi>Extaſies,</hi> and the
ſhining Parts of it, thoſe are utterly out
of their Element; and ſo conſequently
they are forc'd to damn and cenſure 'em
in courſe, becauſe they don't underſtand
'em; the poor <hi>Poet</hi> muſt be confounded
and maul'd, and, what's worſe, if there
be e're a <hi>Phanatick</hi> that ſets up for a
Judge, if there's but a few accidental Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
that don't exactly ſquare with
his Opinion, and Inclination, the whole
<hi>Play,</hi> upon the ſcore of one ſingle Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65929:37"/>
or Paragraph, muſt be eſteem'd a
<hi>Satyr</hi> againſt the Government, and have
an <hi>Embargo</hi> laid upon it, and the poor Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
be doom'd as an Enemy to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
to be taken into Cuſtody, and whipt,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> This, within the compaſs of my own
Knowledge, has been the Fate of ſome of
'em; and indeed I have known One of
the beſt <hi>Tragedies</hi> that ever was writ,
ſtopt upon ſuch a Peque. In another part
of the Houſe ſit the <hi>Poet</hi>'s Friends, which
are reſolv'd to carry him off, right or
wrong; 'tis no matter to them, whether
the <hi>Play</hi> be well or ill done, they're en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
either for Friendſhip, Intereſt, or
elſe by a Natural Spirit of Contradiction,
to oppoſe the other Faction; and thoſe
you'll obſerve ſtradling upon the Seats,
hollowing, clapping, and flouncing, and
making ſuch an impertinent Clatter and
Noiſe, and uſing ſo many inſolent and
indecent Actions, that I adviſe you as a
Friend, to keep as far from 'em as you
can. But, what's worſe ſtill, perhaps, in
the very nick of all, comes in a drunken
Lord, with a Party of <hi>Low Country</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours;
or, what's more common, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<hi>Squire,</hi> that has lately taken up the
Noble Profeſſion of Scowring and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling;
and to ſhew their Parts and their
Courage, raiſe a Quarrel, and put the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65929:37"/>
whole Houſe into a Hurly-burly; then
you'll ſee fine Work, indeed; the <hi>Whores</hi>
tumbling over the Seats, and the poor
<hi>Squires</hi> and <hi>Beaus</hi> tumbling after 'em in a
horrible fright, and diſorder; the whole
<hi>Pit</hi>'s in Arms in a Minute, and every Man's
Sword drawn, to defend himſelf; ſo that
if the Uproar be not inſtantly ſuppreſt,
'tis great odds but there's ſome body mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.
Theſe Inſurrections, I confeſs, don't
often happen, and 'tis well they do not;
for if they ſhou'd, they might ev'n play
by themſelves: for, who but a mad Man
would run the riſque of being ſtab'd, or
trode to Death, to gratify himſelf with an
empty, inſignificant Curioſity? And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
moſt of our <hi>Novel Farces</hi> have little
elſe, but barely that to recommend 'em.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, if after all you will ſtill go to
the <hi>Play-houſe</hi> (which I hope will be very
ſeldom, never when you have any Buſineſs
of moment to divert you, or call you off
other ways) why then, if you'll take a
few ſhort Inſtructions along with you,
I'm confident, if they do you no good,
they can do you no harm, at worſt you
will eſteem 'em (I preſume) a well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Impertinence, and that's the moſt
pardonable Errour of any thing of that
kind. Well then, upon the former <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi>
that you have two or three looſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65929:38"/>
hours that are intirely upon your Hands,
and you're reſolv'd to make uſe of the <hi>Play,</hi>
to fill up the idle Intervals; your beſt way
is to fix your ſelf in ſome advantageous
part of the Pit, where with the leaſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance,
and Interruption, you may not
only obſerve the Actions and Behaviour
of the Actors, but likewiſe hear every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Part diſtinctly, by which means
you may be able to underſtand the Plot
and Deſign of the <hi>Play,</hi> and to judge of
the ſeveral Characters, and what they
drive at; for unleſs you do this, the beſt
<hi>Play</hi> that ever was writ, can ſeem nothing
elſe but an empty Dim of Words, and a
jumble of things ſtuck together, without
any manner of Order. 'Tis true, the
greateſt part of thoſe that frequent the
<hi>Play-houſe,</hi> come thither upon a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Errand; perhaps to ſee the Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Love, or Hate of ſome great Queen
or Lady, repreſented; the Deſtruction of
ſome Prince, or a <hi>Hero;</hi> or the Rape of a
Virgin; or, what's more uſual, to hear
the Singing, and ſee the Dancing, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſome of the little Drolling Humours
and <hi>Scenes,</hi> and fine Cloaths of the <hi>Players:</hi>
But, Sir, I hope you wou'd not herd your
ſelf among ſuch a <hi>Mob</hi> as theſe? If this
be all you propoſe to your Self from the
<hi>Stage,</hi> you may ev'n ſave your Mony,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65929:38"/>
and march to <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> Fields, where a
<hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ntebank</hi> and his <hi>Andrew,</hi> will divert
you as well. No, no, Sir, the true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of the <hi>Stage,</hi> is utterly forreign to
this; <hi>i. e.</hi> to expoſe and detect Rebellion
and Faction, and Vice in general; and to
exalt and commend Loyalty, Honour and
Vertue; and truly, there's hardly any
Play (if you take it right) that's acted at
either of the Houſes in <hi>London,</hi> but makes
ſome kind of advances towards one of theſe
Ends. 'Tis true, <hi>Players</hi> like the Mony
of a Fool, as well as they do of a Man of
Sence, and in ſome meaſure are as will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to pleaſe him with their Trifles and
Bables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Divert and Inſtruct the other
with their <hi>Encomiums,</hi> and <hi>Satyrs;</hi> tho'
by the way, I muſt tell 'em, they had beſt
take care that by their <hi>Farces</hi> and <hi>Drols,</hi>
and their <hi>Jack Pudding</hi> tricks, they don't
at laſt pull their Houſes upon their Heads;
but it ſeems they're above Advice, and
ſo I won't go out of my Road, to trouble
my Head with 'em; 'tis well there's
more Fools than Men of Sence, that are
their Cuſtomers; if there were not, for all
their Huffing, their Shares might be ſoon
drawn into a narrow compaſs. Well, Sir,
to have done with them, and the Subject
too, if you pleaſe to obſerve what I have
told you; with this One thing more, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:65929:39"/>
never to Imbark your ſelf upon any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,

the Quarrels, Humours, Intrigues, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the <hi>Stage,</hi> you may then paſs
away an hour or two at the <hi>Play-houſe,</hi>
once in a Month, but no oftner, without

               <argument>
                  <p>In which the Humours and Tricks of
the Tennis Courts are expoſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TENNIS is one of the moſt Manly
and Active Diverſions we have in
<hi>England;</hi> and heretofore was hardly uſed
by any but the Young Nobility, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the Chief Rank: King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second, was a great Maſter and Judge
of it, and would very often divert himſelf
with a Set or two in the <hi>Royal Court</hi> at the
<hi>Cock-pit,</hi> with a great deal of Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>This is a Game that depends purely
upon Skill and Activity, and not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
without conſiderable Expence, and
Practice; upon which Account indeed it
has had the Advantage of moſt of the reſt,
and abundance of <hi>Sharpers</hi> and <hi>Cheats</hi>
have been kept out of it, for want of Mony
to pay the Charge of the Court, and other
Expences that are conſequent to it. But
this, however harmleſs and inoffenſive it
was in its Original and Deſign, has of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65929:40"/>
late incurred the ſame fate with moſt of
the Diverſions of that Nature, and is
ſtrangely degenerated from a Noble and
Genteel Exerciſe, into a perfect Trade for
Rooks and Sharpers, who perceiving it
would neceſſarily be a good Foundation
for 'em to get a baſe Livelyhood by, have
cunningly twiſted themſelves into the
Knowledge and Perfection of it. As to
the Game it ſelf, a Perſon that has never
ſeen it before can make but little on't, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be any Curioſity or Diverſion to him
to ſee three or four Perſons furiouſly run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
after a few little Balls, and laboriouſly
bandying and toſſing them about from one
to another; if this were all 'twere well
enough, but then when he hears the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
calling <hi>Forty, Love, and a Chace,</hi> and
ſees them changing their Sides, and hears
the Players wrangling and ſwearing about
the taking of <hi>Bisks</hi> and <hi>Faults,</hi> and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Cuts</hi> and <hi>Twiſts,</hi> and <hi>Forces,</hi> &amp;c. he
preſently concludes there muſt be ſome
wonderful Secret in all this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſatisfie himſelf a little further.
If he gets into the <hi>Dan,</hi> among the Gentry
that come there to bet, and has the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to ask any Queſtions, or declare
his Ignorance, they preſently give out the
Word, That here's a Squire come; and
then two or three of the ſharpeſt of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65929:40"/>
Gang, come up with him preſently, in
order to give him ſome little Inſight, and
Directions into the Game, that they may
prepare him againſt an Opportunity to
take him in; here they tell him, 'tis all even
and odd, a perfect <hi>Lottery,</hi> and that he
may venture his Mony on either ſide, for
'tis all equal; and ſo indeed, in ſome Sets
it is: For the Noblemen and Gentlemen,
that are acquainted with the Game, and
play it upon the ſquare, and more for the
Reputation of good Gameſters, than for
Intereſt, commonly make their Matches
ſo very nicely, that the beſt <hi>Sharper</hi> and
<hi>Judge</hi> among 'em can hardly (before the
Set's begun) tell which way to bet his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
here, perhaps, he wins half a Piece,
or a <hi>Guinea,</hi> which inclines him to believe
that this muſt needs be a very Fair Game,
that a Stranger can get Mony at it at firſt
Sight; and truly, as long as this Match
laſts, he's in no great danger; but then
againſt this is over, there's another Set
ready to ſtep into the Court, that will be
ſure to do his Buſineſs. The Managers tell
him 'tis all equal now too; that Squire
<hi>A.</hi> is a good Striker-out, but Squire <hi>B.</hi> is
a better Back-hand; that Mr. O. judges a Ball
finely, but then Mr. <hi>D.</hi> plays for a <hi>Chace</hi>
much better than he; ſo that upon the
whole, they conclude it a very good Match,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65929:41"/>
and that he'll ſee theſe Gentlemen will
make better Play than the former; here
they offer him his Choice, or to throw
Croſs and Pile, which ſide he'll take; if
he complys, and they have taken him in
as far as the thing will conveniently bear
at once, then the Sign is made to the
Players, that they may manage their parts;
when this Set is over, which is commonly
play'd with as much ſeeming Eagerneſs
and Fury, and withal with the greateſt
Equality that can be; why then, with
ſome little <hi>Sham-quarrels,</hi> and wranglings
about adjuſting the Odds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they agree
upon another: Here they Attack the
Stranger again; <hi>Come,</hi> Sir, <hi>you had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to be on the wrong ſide last time, tho'
'twas a very hard Match, and no body could
tell who had the beſt of it, till the very
Advantage-game; take your choice, we don't
covet to carry off your Money.</hi> And ſo
they draw him on from one ſet to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and from little Bets to great Ones
(till they have ſtuck him, as they call it)
and then, to keep up to their own <hi>Dialect,</hi>
they ſeldom part with him, till they
have ſent him away ſweet and clean. I
was a tolerable Maſter of this Game my
ſelf, I ſtudied it at <hi>Oxford,</hi> together with
my <hi>Logicks,</hi> and <hi>Ethicks;</hi> and at laſt was
arrived to that Perfection, that but few
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65929:41"/>
Scholars in the Town durſt encounter
with me upon equal terms (I wiſh I could
have ſaid the ſame with reſpect to the
other) but for all my mighty parts in the
Univerſity, when I came to <hi>London,</hi> I ſoon
found my Inſufficiency; and that I muſt
be new Documentized before I muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to ſet up for my ſelf: they would
now and then take me in with them,
to keep a Back-hand, which was my
Maſter-piece; but truly, I had ſoon enough
of my Back-hand buſineſs: In ſhort,
I perceived they only made a Property
of me, as they do of all Strangers, and ſo
I knockt off in time; beſides I quickly
grew acquainted with their Humours and
Tricks, and ſaw that there was but few
Matches made, but there was either a
Bribed <hi>Marker,</hi> or ſome Gentl'eman that
had firſt loſt his Eſtate, and then his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and ſo was forc'd to comply with
the Sharpings and Tricks of the Town,
to get his Bread; or ſome Scoundrel that
never had an Eſtate or Honour either, but
had acquired the Game by a diligent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
upon the Courts, crowded in
among them, and that there was hardly
a Set play'd, but there was ſome ſort of
Falſhood and Deceit practic'd; I wiſely
diſpoſed of my <hi>Raquets,</hi> and Inclination
together, and left them to manage their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65929:42"/>
Matters by themſelves. But ſuppoſing <hi>for
once</hi> that the Game was, as they'd have
the World believe, ſquare and equal, yet
one of theſe Sparks <hi>that make it their Trade
to hunt about from Court to Court have ſuch a
vaſt Advantage of a Stranger that knows
nothing of the Buſineſs, that 'tis morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
but they muſt get his Money and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon him at laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſeveral in Town that live
purely upon the <hi>Tennis-Courts</hi> (and live
well too) if ſuch a way of Living may be
call'd <hi>living well,</hi> but then they have
ſuch a perfect Idea and Notion of a Set,
and ſo many Myſterious Methods to
turn and wind their Bets, and to bring
themſelves off when they have the worſt,
that a Perſon muſt have a natural Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Temper and Genius, back'd with
a long Practice and Experience, before he
can be a tolerable Maſter of the Faculty.
But after all, if a Man could eſcape all
their Tricks and Stratagems, which is
almoſt impoſſible for a Stranger if he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
with them; what Buſineſs, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
has a <hi>Country Gentleman</hi> at a <hi>Tennis-Court?</hi>
Why, truly none as I know of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be to expoſe himſelf, if not to the
Cheats, at leaſt to the Laughter and
Ridicule of a Company of lazy, ſharping
Companions. Well Sir, if you ſhould
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65929:42"/>
chance to fall in among 'em, take this
along with you, <hi>that they'll cheat you if
they can; if they can't draw you in to bet
with 'em there, they'll attempt the enticing
you into a Tavern or Gaming-Ordinary, or
rather than fail, into a Bawdy-houſe; they
have twenty little Arts which they make uſe of,
and abundance of Baits to throw before a
Stranger, and if he ſtoops for any of 'em,
they'll be ſure to find out ſome means or other
to make him pay dear for his Enſtalment into
into his new Society. Indeed, for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
and Gentlemen that love the Game,
and only uſe it for a Breathing, that play a
ſet or two, once in a Week, to divert and
and recreate themſelves, they are above any
baſe Action, and if you could fall in with
them, (though I think the thing is ſcarce
worth your Trouble) as there is no good,
ſo there would be no great matter of harm in't.</hi>

Cheats of the Bowling-Greens are
expoſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BOwling is a Game for Diverſion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
and Exerciſe, as well as
Tennis, and was formerly a Game for
few but Gentlemen, as that was; but as
Men and Things are generally grown
worſe and worſe, ſo is this too, and
ſtrangely degenerated from an innocent,
inoffenſive Diverſion to be a <hi>perfect Trade, a
kind of ſet Calling and Occupation for Cheats
and Sharpers.</hi> The Number of Bowling.
Greens that we have in and near this
Town are unaccountable, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Bowlers, Betters and Rooks that
depend upon 'em, and live by 'em, almoſt
miraculous; How they all live I know
not, but that they do live, get Money,
and ſpend high, is <hi>moſt certain.</hi> Well,
but I'll ſhew you <hi>ſome part of their Art,</hi>
and leave you to judge of the reſt your ſelf.
If you pleaſe therefore we'll make a ſhort
Trip to <hi>Marybone</hi> (for that's the <hi>chief place</hi>
of Rendezvouz) the Bowling-Greens there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65929:43"/>
having in theſe latter Years gain'd a kind of
Preheminence and Reputation above the
reſt, and thither moſt of the Noblemen and
Gentlemen about the Town, that affect
that ſort of Recreation, generally reſort;
I have ſeen a hundred at a time at leaſt
following one Block, and the greateſt part
of 'em, five to one, I'm confident, Rooks
and Sharpers. When a Match is made
which they are commonly very nice in,
but not ſo nice neither but a ſubtle, old
Better knows preſently where the Odds
lies; then the Sport begins, here you'll
hear <hi>five, ten, twenty Pieces</hi> offer'd the
Leader againſt the Follower, or the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
againſt the Leader ſometimes upon
the main End; and very often you'll ſee
<hi>five</hi> or <hi>ten Pound</hi> betted upon a Single Bowl;
they bet nothing but Gold here ſo that
a man muſt have a good Stock that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to embark with 'em. But the Secret
and Myſtery of all is, how one of theſe
profeſt Betters manage the Point; let
the Game go for them or againſt them,
'tis ſome odds, but they turn a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or at leaſt bring themſelves off Savers
at the winding up. I have heard one of
them ſay, tho' he loſt five Pieces by the
Bargain, yet by his cunning Contrivances
and hedging, and his taking and laying
the Odds (which is the chiefeſt part in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65929:44"/>
the Betting) he ſhould be three Pound
Gainer in the Main. But, Sir, this is an
Art that is not learnt on a ſudden; and
truly, 'tis much below a Gentleman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he has ſome Notions of loſing his
Eſtate firſt, and being reduced aftewards
to the Extremity of turning <hi>Rook</hi> for a
Livelihood, to perplex himſelf about it.
<hi>Marybone,</hi> as I told you, is the chief Place
about Town, but for all its greatneſs and
preheminence, it lies under ſhrewd ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions
of being guilty of ſharping and
crimping, as well as the reſt. Indeed, I
believe the Noblemen and Gentleman, are
above any thing ſo exaltedly Baſe and
Sordid; but for the Interlopers, I'm a
little jealous when they find ther's a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Green, a great many Citizens,
Fools, and Strangers, that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a Match or two lying by them,
to divert ſuch kind of Adventurers. I
have obſerv'd my ſelf very unequal Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among them; and withal I muſt own
was ſomething ſurprized and diſſatisfy'd,
to ſee ſo many Gentlemen, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
at leaſt winking and conniving
at it. Well, Sir, in ſhort, I'm very
certain, 'twill be your beſt way never to
come there at all, and then you'll be both
out of the Danger, and the Temptation
too; for unleſs you are ſo much a Maſter
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65929:44"/>
of your ſelf, as I know ſome are, only to
divert your ſelf with walking about, and
obſerving the Humours of the Company,
you'll be in great hazard to be ſeduc'd into
ſome ſort of Gaming, which you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have cauſe to repent as long as you
live. There you may be equipt with
Gaming of all ſorts; if you are for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Game with two <hi>Dice,</hi> properly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht
by the memorable title of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard;</hi>
there the <hi>Groom Porter</hi> has a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in ordinary, conſtantly in waiting:
If you're for <hi>Back Gammon, Trick Track,
Picket, Cribidge,</hi> or for an honeſt upright
Game at <hi>Whisk,</hi> there's Chapmen enough
for you: But, by the way, I'd have you
take care of them, for 'tis ten to one, if they
can once bring you down (as they expreſs
it) if they ſuffer you to riſe again, without
making a Penny of you. But, Sir. I would
not keep you too long here neither, if
you'll give your ſelf the trouble to take a
Turn with me to a Bowling-Green or two
on the other Side of the Water, there
you'll meet with both Bowlers and Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that are very well worth your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
A Gang of ſuch unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Creatures mix'd and jumbl'd together,
and ſuch a ſtrange and horrid Din of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
and Swearing (too common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in moſt of theſe kind of Aſſemblies)
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65929:45"/>
that I know not where to begin my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Account of 'em. Well Sir, to have
done with them as faſt as I can, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Way of Proceeding is this, there are
generally five or ſix that ply at one of theſe
Greens, that are look'd upon to be the
Cocks or Chief Bowlers, and theſe always
keep together, unleſs they can draw in a
Younker to make a Property of. Their
Way of making their Matches is by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Dice as in moſt other Greens, and
the Method is well enough where the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are equal, but that's but a blind nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which they have to impoſe upon the
Perſons that are Strangers, and don't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Cheat; for let the Dice fall
which way they will, their Friends and
Allies, the Betters, muſt give the Sign
which Side muſt win, and each of theſe
has always his Familiar or two near him
to direct him whether he ſhould bowl on
or off, and for Six pence Advantage they'll
do either: Sometimes it happens that they
are forc'd to take in a Stranger for want of
a fourth Man to make up their Set, and
then things are not quite ſo well for their
purpoſe; however to make the Matter
as ſecure as they can, they all three bowl
againſt him, and none more earneſtly
than his own Partner; he muſt lead in
Courſe and then if he puts in a good Caſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65929:45"/>
and leaves him beſt at the Block, if the
Game be in any Danger, he'll be ſure to
be two or three turns over, and either
reſt him off, or ſtrike up the Adverſary;
and to blind the Stranger, will impudently
pretend to juſtifie the thing, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Miſcarriage, to be the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Game; and if he could have
ſtruck the other out, which he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
they had been up. In ſhort, they
manage the matter ſo, that unleſs the
Stranger be able to beat them all three,
he muſt neceſſarily loſe his Mony, and yet
they carry on the Game ſo equally, and
with ſo much ſeeming Fairneſs and Policy,
that 'tis almoſt impoſſible (unleſs a Man
has ſome <hi>Idea</hi> and Notion of the Perſons
before-hand) to find them out.</p>
               <p>If they get a Stranger to engage with
them Hand to Hand, let him be never
ſo exact and judicious a Bowler, they'll
find out ſome means or other to cheat him
out of his Game. Sometimes they'll be
croſſing the Ground upon him; others
will be Bawling to him juſt upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of his Bowl, and teizing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
him with impertinent Advice,
to make him forget his Lengths; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
one of the Gang will pretend to be
betted on his ſide, and ſo amuſe him with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65929:46"/>
giving him falſe Ground; or if none of
theſe or ſuch like tricks will do, why then
juſt as he's acquainted with the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Byaſſes of his Bowls, there's a
Gentleman come they pretend that owns
them, and muſt have them, but they'll give
him another Pair, that are of the ſame ſize
and weight, and in all reſpects as good,
but only 'tis the Gentleman's Humour to
Bowl with no other; and theſe, perhaps,
are either Back-byaſt, or pegg'd, or loaded,
or have ſome other trick uſed to them,
that 'tis impoſſible to come dear the Mark
with them Sir, I could diſcover abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of their little Raſcally Cheats to you;
but 'tis neither worth your time to read
them, nor mine to write them; you ſee
in the main, what a villanous Gang theſe
are, and how careful a Gentleman ought
to be how he ventures himſelf among
them; for beſides theſe cheats and tricks
upon the <hi>Green,</hi> they have abundance of
other dangerous Villanies conſequent to
them: they have their <hi>Whores,</hi> and <hi>Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
their <hi>Thieves,</hi> and their <hi>Pick-pockets;</hi>
their falſe Dice and Cards, and almoſt
all other Engines for Miſchief, ready
upon occaſion. Indeed, even in the worſt
of theſe places, there is a great many
Honeſt Gentlemen come daily to Bowl;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65929:46"/>
but what then? I can't ſee the neceſſity for
a Gentleman to run a Riſque where there's
no occaſion; if he will divert himſelf
with a Game at Bowls now and then,
there's places enough about <hi>London,</hi> where
he may meet with Sober and Genteel
Company, may paſs an hour or two, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being grated and tormented with the
hideous noiſe of Curſing and Swearing.
The Game is a very innocent and healthful
Recreation in it ſelf, and I think one of
the beſt Diverſions we have about Town
(provided a Man has nothing to do) to
paſs away a <hi>Summer</hi>'s Evening. I hope
you will not miſtake me in this, nor in
any of the reſt; I am not entirely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing
you againſt the <hi>Play houſe, Tennis
Court,</hi> or <hi>Bowling Green,</hi> or any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and harmleſs Recreation. I know
ſome Divertiſement is ſo neceſſary, both
for the Body and Mind of a Man, that 'tis
hardly poſſible for either of 'em, to be at
Eaſe without it: but that which I would
reprehend, is the Exceſs and the Inordinacy
of them; the making that a ſet and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Buſineſs and Trade, which ſhould be
only uſed as a Diverſion, and to fill up the
idle Intervals; and withal to diſcover to
you the ill uſes that are made of 'em,
and the Dangers and Hazards they expoſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65929:47"/>
a Man to, if he once ſuffers them to
uſurp his time, and get the Maſterſhip

               <argument>
                  <p>In which the Humours of the Groom
Porter's, and the Tricks and Cheats
of Ordinaries, and other Gaming-houſes
are briefly expoſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SIR, having ſhew'd you in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
how ſome of our Town Gentry
ſpend their Day, and given you ſome
Cautionary hints of ſome of their Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
Cheats and Tricks, that are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
in the ſight of the <hi>Sun;</hi> I ſhall now
carry you a little further, and ſhew you a
few of their Works of Darkneſs; and how
their Nights as well as their Days, are
ſadly conſumed and play'd away, in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
repetition of Gaming and Vice;
and accordingly, if you pleaſe, we'll firſt
make a ſhort ſtep to the <hi>Groom Porter's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Groom Porter's</hi> has been always
looked upon as the moſt Reputable and
Convenient Place in Town, for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to venture into, that has a mind to
try whether his good Fortune will ſuffer
him to keep his Eſtate himſelf, or force him
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65929:48"/>
to commit it into the Hands of ſome body
elſe to do it for him. There is whole-ſale
Buſineſs, I can aſſure you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeveral thouſand
Pounds bartered for moſt nights, ſo that if
Fortune ſhould play the Jilt, as ſhe often
does in ſuch Caſes, you may be readily
unſquired in two or three hours; nay, if
you will in two or three Hands. The
ordinary Game they play at there, is
<hi>Hazard,</hi> and <hi>Hazard</hi> indeed it is, and a
very great one too, if you go in among
'em with two or three hundred Pieces
in your Pocket, whether you bring e're a
one out with you again. I have known
an Honeſt Gentleman come thither in a
new Coach, with a pair of very fine
Horſes, that hath found it ſo hazardous,
that in a Night or two afterwards, he
has been forc'd to hazard it Home in a
<hi>Hackney.</hi> But they ſay, All things there
are very ſquare, and honeſt, good Wine,
good Attendance, good Company, and
all other ſuitable Conveniencies to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
a Gentleman, whilſt he's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
playing away his Eſtate. All
this may be, 'tis true, and it may not be
too; for by the way, I have ſeen a <hi>Spark,</hi>
by the help of good Fingers, and a little
Dexterity of Hand, manage their <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi>
ſomething quirely upon occaſion.
Well, but we muſt not dive too far into
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65929:48"/>
their Secrets neither, they'd grow angry
perhaps, if we ſhou'd, and I would not
incur their Diſpleaſure upon any Account:
and yet I hope, Sir, I may give you a
little ſhort Advice, as a Friend, without
being very offenſive to any of 'em; 'tis
only, That you never come within their
Reach upon any Account, or Pretence
what ever; 'tis a dangerous infectious
Place for a young Gentleman but to put
his Head into; and many a One by ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
a little too far, has caught ſuch a
Contagion at once, that has made him
droop a great while, and at laſt carried
him clear off. The old Proverb ſays,
<hi>Forewarn'd Fore-arm'd;</hi> and truly 'tis as
good as any in the whole Catalogue. If
a Man will plunge himſelf into Ruine, and
ſquander away his Eſtate, and reduce
himſelf to the wretched Condition to be
forc'd to ſneak after every little <hi>Coxcomb</hi>
for a Supper, or for a <hi>Crown</hi> to buy him
a pair of Shooes, as I know ſeveral Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of good Families, and who have
had good Eſtates too, till they wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
them in the ſtudy of theſe ſorts of
<hi>Mathematicks,</hi> at this time are; let him ev'n
take it for his pains. But the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in their own Nature, are beyond Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation,
and ſo I'll leave them, and go and
ſee what they're doing at the <hi>Ordinaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65929:49"/>
The <hi>Ordinaries</hi> are a kind of <hi>aming-houſes,</hi>
Inferiour and Subſervien G to the
<hi>Groom Porter's,</hi> and are either managed
by one of his Domeſticks, or elſe tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and allowed, by his particular Licenſe
and Deputation; as moſt of the other
Games are; the <hi>Lotteries</hi> only excepted,
that, I think, are included in the <hi>Royal-Oak</hi>
Patent. Theſe <hi>Ordinaries</hi> are a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
for all ſorts of <hi>Gameſters,</hi> and
are indeed very convenient Nurſeries, to
drag up Youngſters, and to qualifie them
againſt their Eſtates come into their
Hands, to play them decently away at
the <hi>Groom Porter's:</hi> How ſuch kind of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries</hi>
as theſe come to be ſuffered, I
know not; but this I know, 'tis a ſhame,
and a diſgrace to the Kingdom, that there
is not ſome Regulation or Stop put to 'em.
Theſe Gentlemen pretend to be much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> too; and, that all
things are carried extraordinary fairly and
ſquarely among them, as well as at the
<hi>Groom Porter's;</hi> but, by their Leave, I
have ſeen their <hi>Mathematical</hi> Flats, and
Bar's; nay (for a need) <hi>Mathematical</hi>
Fullams too; and abundance that will run
<hi>Mathematically</hi> high or low: theſe are a
ſort of falſe Dice, that are cut and ſtain'd
ſo exactly like the true, and withal mark'd
with the ſame Mark, that 'tis morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65929:49"/>
for a Stranger, that does not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the Cheat, to diſcover it; and theſe
the <hi>Box-Keeper</hi> has commonly in a Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
when he has the Sign given him, to
put in; or if he has them not of his own,
there's thoſe about him that never go
without them. When they have got a
Gentleman, which they deſign to rook in
among 'em; whilſt ſome are ſharping him
out of his Mony within, others are tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his Servants without, to find out
the ſtrength and manner of his Eſtate and
Circumſtances, and where he lodges, and
what Friends and Acquaintance he has in
Town; and if they find that his Effects
will anſwer, and that he's a Perſon that
may be ventur'd upon; as ſoon as they
perceive he has loſt all his Stock, then
one of the Gang, that's conſtantly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there for ſuch Opportunities, takes him
aſide; <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I believe you're a very
honest Gentleman; I am very ſorry to ſee
you have loſt your Mony, and would not have
a Civil Man by any means expoſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if you pleaſe, I have five or ten Pieces
at your Service:</hi> If he'll accept of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
then he tells him, the Cuſtom in
ſuch Caſes, as well here as at the <hi>Groom
Porter's,</hi> is to take nine for ten, and to allow
him a Call upon a good Hand. When
this is loſt too (as it always is in a little
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65929:50"/>
time) then they conclude he's fixt; and
ſo the Gentleman that has done him the
Favour to cheat him of his Mony, will
needs (under pretence of a great deal of
formal Civility) invite him to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
to take a Glaſs, and eat the Wing
of a Fowl with him: When they have
decoy'd him thither, the Perſon that did
him the extraordinary Friendſhip to lend
him the ten Pieces, muſt be inſtantly ſent
for too, who in the <hi>Interim</hi> has made up a
new Purſe, and is very ready to Credit
him with the other ten, till to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Morning, if he has a mind to try
his Luck; but he wo'nt adviſe him. <hi>Here
the</hi> Box <hi>and</hi> Dice <hi>muſt be called for, and
the honeſt</hi> Drawer, <hi>that knows his Duty
in ſuch Caſes, brings in the</hi> Box <hi>with a pair
of their own</hi> Dice, <hi>which they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
into his Hand in the Interim, &amp;c.</hi> And
now there's no room for Suſpicion, but
every thing is carried with the greateſt
Frankneſs and Indifferency; and ſo at it
they go, till the other ten Pieces are gone
after the reſt, and what muſt be done
then? This Worthy Friend has no more
Mony about him; if he had, he might
command it: And truly he thinks ſince
they have won the Gentleman's ready
Mony, that they can do no leſs than give
him a Caſt or two upon Honour; with a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65929:50"/>
great deal of ſeeming Uneaſineſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a thouſand perfidious Oaths and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations,
that they never did the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and upon Condition too, that the
Gentleman will give his Note to pay it
to Morrow Morning, if he ſhould happen
to loſe any thing, this is comply'd with:
And here begins the fatal <hi>Cataſtrophe;</hi> if
they think that he has too much regard
for his Reputation, or too much Modeſty
to make uſe of the Statute for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or perhaps (what's more prevalent
with him than either) will be unwilling
that the Town ſhould know he has been
a <hi>Bubble,</hi> then they ſtick him in earneſt,
ſo deep, it may be, that he muſt be forc'd
to cut off a Limb of his Eſtate to get out
of their Clutches. Sir, we have too many
ſad Inſtances every Day in View, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you of the truth of this, without
enlarging upon it; ſo that, I hope, from
this haſty Caution I have given you,
you'll have enough of theſe kind of <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries;</hi>
however, for your better Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
we'll ſtep thither again, and ſee
what the reſt of 'em are doing in the other
parts of the <hi>Houſe:</hi> Why, there are ſome
playing at <hi>Back Gammon,</hi> ſome at <hi>Trick
Track,</hi> ſome at <hi>Picket,</hi> ſome at <hi>Cribidge,</hi>
and, perhaps, at a By-table in a Corner,
four or five harmleſs Fellows at <hi>Put,</hi> and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65929:51"/>
                  <hi>All-foures;</hi> here's no Reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
here come <hi>Apprentices, Journeymen,
Footmen, Coblers,</hi> or any body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they bring Mony in their Pockets,
and come either to cheat, or to be cheated,
<hi>Pro hac vice,</hi> they have as extenſive a
Qualification to Swear, Blaſpheme, and
Hector, as the moſt Renowned <hi>Sharper</hi>
in the whole Gang. That each of theſe
in his reſpective Station is a Cheat, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
you'll take for granted; you may as
well be cheated at <hi>Cards,</hi> as at <hi>Dice,</hi> and
at <hi>Back Gammon</hi> and <hi>Trick Track,</hi> as at
<hi>Hazard;</hi> the falſe <hi>Dice</hi> and Slights of
Hand will ſerve for One, as well as the
other; there's no difference, as I know of,
but only the former is a little longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Buſineſs. But beſides all this,
if a Man could be ſecure to guard Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
againſt their falſe <hi>Dice,</hi> and Slights
of Hand, and was equal with 'em too in
point of Judgment and Experience, what
buſineſs has a <hi>Country Gentleman,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
any Body elſe, to venture Himſelf
among ſuch a rude Herd of wild Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
Well, I'm aſhamed to think that
any <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſhould ſink himſelf ſo
much below a Rational Creature, to be
guilty of ſuch Unaccountable Folly; I
muſt own I utterly loſe my Pitty, when
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65929:51"/>

               <p>And Firſt, for the <hi>Royal-Oak Lottery,</hi>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65929:52"/>
well it anſwers <hi>that Honourable Title,</hi> I
leave you and all the World to judge.
'Tis pity, methinks, that ſuch a glorious

much queſtion whether the original Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector

               </p>

it; but this is but a perfect Bait, the
next time they come, 'tis odds but they
not only loſe their Intereſt but their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
too. I think there was an honeſt
Gentleman, one that got ſome Money of
'em, and kept it too, but then he was
forc'd to have a Mathematical Ball made
on purpoſe, and truly if he had made no
worſe uſe of his Mathematical Dice than
he did of his Mathematical Ball, I ſhould
not be very much out of Conceit with
his Mathematicks. This Game has got
a wonderful repute lately among the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
eſpecially among the Citizens Ladies,
who, they ſay, that they might not loſe time,
do commonly two Buſineſſes there at once,
<hi>i. e.</hi> firſt, make their Husbands Cuckolds, and
then Beggars; whether they do the firſt
or not, I will not be poſitive, tho, by the
way, conſidering what company they
meet there, there's ſhrewd Grounds for
Suſpicion; but for the latter they do it
effectually. I have ſeen, my ſelf, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Citizen's Wife loſe her Seven or
Eight Pieces in a Morning, and at the
ſame time ſwear ſolemnly ſhe has had the
ſame bad Fortune for a Month together
ſucceſſively. How ſuch Citizens Ladies,
and indeed all other Ladies that frequent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65929:54"/>
ſuch ſort of Diverſions ought to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
I think lies pretty ready, we
have Mad-houſes about Town, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I'd have 'em all ſent and kept under
a ſtrict Diet and Diſcipline, till they had
either abſolutely forgot or ſolemnly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn
the Folly; and after that if they
ſhould relapſe, let 'em be commited to the
Tuition of a Gentleman in a Blew Coat,
and let him try if he can Whip it out of
'em. What it is that bewitches both Men,
Women, and even Children, to follow
this unhappy Game, I cannot gueſs; 'tis
true, 'tis recommended to 'em under the
falſe pretence and Coverture of a great
deal of Equality and Advantage; but
then if they would but turn themſeves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
and look backwards a little, they
muſt needs ſee their Miſtake with a
Witneſs. I can produce hundreds that
have loſt their Eſtates, and been ruin'd by
it; but let them bring but one ſingle Perſon
that has purſu'd this Game for any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time, that will own, or rather prove
that he's a Winner in the main, and I'll give
up the Argument, and grant that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I, or any body elſe can ſay againſt
it, is utterly falſe, and groundleſs. I
know, Sir, this cannot be done, and 'tis
Nonſence, and a Contradiction to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
it; but ſtill I am the more at a loſs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65929:54"/>
to find out what it can be that ſeduces
the World to follow it on, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Strong, and Repeated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the Diſadvantage and Ruine
that attends it. Nay, what's more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſtill, that Men of Sence ſhould be
catcht. I have known ſeveral that in moſt
other things would have paſt Muſter well
enough; by their Fooliſh Projects, and
falſe Aſſurances, which they had form'd
to themſelves, how to win Mony at this
deluſive Game, have rambled from one
Notion to another, and try'd ſo many
Experiments, that they have projected
themſelves out of all that they have, and
are forc'd now to hang upon it, to try if
they can pick up a <hi>Shilling</hi> now and then,
at the beſt of the Ley, or get a Mug of
<hi>Ale,</hi> or the Dregs of a Bottle of <hi>Wine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
'em.</p>
               <p>Well then, Sir, not to trouble you with
too many of theſe kind of Reflections;
there were always Fools, and always will
be; let a Man ſay what he will, there are
ſome People ſo bigotted to their Folly,
and ſo fond of their own way, that they
will not be put out of it, though they
know it leads 'em directly to Ruine and
Deſtruction. I hope you will not fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Character; you ſee the <hi>Rock,</hi> and
if you will voluntarily run upon it, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65929:55"/>
daſh your ſelf to pieces, I have, however,
diſcharg'd the Office of a Friend, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you where it lies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and can do no more,
except it be to lament a Misfortune, I
could not prevent.</p>
               <p>But now I think on't, I won't part with
theſe Gentlemen, without taking my Leave
of 'em neither; there are ſtill ſome memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Qualifications amongſt 'em, that I'm
confident ought not to be paſt by, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome ſort of Ceremony. And firſt:
Theſe Gentlemen keep an open Table;
that's true enough, and a Perſon that has
twenty or thirty pound in his Pocket to
loſe with 'em at Night, may dine with
'em at any time; but withal I have ſeen
a poor Gentleman that has loſt ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
with 'em formerly, baſely and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully
thruſt out of Doors, for but
calling for a Glaſs of their <hi>Brandy:</hi> nay,
and they pretend to be very charitable to
the Poor too; Secret <hi>Charity,</hi> I confeſs, is
the moſt meritorious, and I ſuppoſe, that's
the way they communicate theirs, for I
never heard of any that they did in publick.</p>
               <p>But then, what kind of Poor are they,
as they are thus beneficial to? Why, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
they muſt be the Poor of their own
Making; and, by the by, if they were
forc'd to provide for their own poor, as
all other Honeſt Corporations are, they'd
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65929:55"/>
be ſoon compell'd to quit their Country-Houſes,
and return to their reſpective
Employments to get their Livelihoods,
as well as the reſt of their Neighbours.
Well, but (they ſay) they have one point
of Civility, which every body muſt allow
to be very extraordinary, <hi>i. e.</hi> that when
they have won a Gentleman's or a Lady's
Mony, they'll give 'em Half a Crown,
or a Crown for a Coach; that I muſt
needs own to be a very high point of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
indeed, and who would not after
ſuch a Favour, come within a Night or
two, and loſe thirty or forty Pound more,
to make 'em Amends? And this they
call a <hi>Paratto,</hi> or a <hi>Parato,</hi> you may call
it which you will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it ſeems moſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to me to be a <hi>Parato;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
of which is, <hi>Prepare thou,</hi> that is, <hi>Go, and
provide more Mony, and come hither again,
and play it away;</hi> that's the true Intent of
the Buſineſs, I believe; and this they do
too, to a poor <hi>Gameſter,</hi> with ſo many
Curſes, and ſo much Inſolence, that none
but a Deſpicable, Mean-ſpirited Wretch
will accept of it from 'em. Well, but, Sir,
I muſt not ſpend all my Time and my
Paper about 'em: In ſhort, I don't think
'em worth it. Beſides, I have ſome other
of their Dependants, to make a ſhort Viſit
to; and therefore, I'll leave them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65929:56"/>
and Repent, or, what I rather wiſh,
to be Reform'd, or Aboliſh'd.</p>
               <p>Having done with this <hi>Grand Lottery,</hi>
I ſuppoſe you expect I ſhould ſay ſome
thing in courſe of all the reſt: As for
the <hi>Mony Lotteries,</hi> that are now ſo much
in Vogue in Town, I declare I neither
like, nor underſtand 'em, and therefore
will have nothing to do with 'em. If you
can get a thouſand Pound for a Penny, or
ten thouſand Pound for twenty <hi>Shillings,</hi>
I will own you have good Luck; but I
muſt tell you, that 'tis ten thouſand
Pound to a Penny, whether you do or
not. I believe a Man might find ſome
matters in the Secrets of their Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that might deſerve a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
as well as the reſt; but ſince
they ſay, and ſome People believe they
have only ten <hi>per Cent,</hi> for all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
and Diligence, for my part I won't
trouble my ſelf to diſprove 'em; e'en let
'em take it, and if they and the World are
ſatisfied, I muſt own I never had, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
will have any cauſe to complain.
But now, for theſe little <hi>Sucking Lotteries,
Plate Lotteries,</hi> I think they call 'em,
they're but poor Soundrel Cheats, that will
paſs upon none but the Country Fools,
and Town <hi>Mob.</hi> A few Bables, ſome
falſe Dice, and a little Sham-plate behind
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65929:56"/>
a Glaſs, ſets up one of them; beſides, they
are only <hi>Feuditaries</hi> to the former, and
derive their Priviledge from their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Indeed, a Man may, if he will, go
to one of them, and throw away four or
five Pound, to get a Nutmeg-grater, or a
Tobacco-ſtopple, for a Curioſity; as I
know thoſe that have at a <hi>Bartholomew</hi>
Fair; but then I think <hi>Merry Andrew</hi>
ought to be made acquainted with it,
'twill ſerve him for a good Subject to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Rabble with. Indeed, there is a
late Invented <hi>Lottery,</hi> where there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be won but Mony, nor that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that deſerves a ſhort Obſervation.
This, it ſeems, is to be managed with
ten Dice; and truly the <hi>Projecters</hi> have ſo
carefully ſettled their Prices, that none of
thoſe that are conſiderable, are reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable
with the Numbers upon the Dice;
a Man may in the hazard of thirty or forty
<hi>Shillings</hi> get a Hit of Half a Crown, or ſo;
but unleſs he has got the Art to reconcile
Impoſſibilities, he can never come at
any of their twenty or thirty Pounds,
which they pretend to In ſhort, all theſe
are but Down-right Cheats, and Devices,
to deceive Ignorant People out of their
Mony; and many a child has been tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
to rob his Parents, and Apprentice
his Maſter, upon the Account of 'em: I
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65929:57"/>
muſt confeſs, I think they are ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a Gentleman, that he needs not be
caution'd againſt 'em; they are not only
exaltedly Fooliſh, and Ridiculous, but
Scandalous too, and certainly, under thoſe
two Qualifications, a Man muſt be either
a perfect Madman, or an Idiot, that will
concern himſelf with 'em; a Man may
indeed by ſuch inconſiderate Actions as
theſe, expoſe himſelf to the Laughter and
Scorn of the Town; but let him take this
along with him, when he has once done
it, he'll find it a little difficult to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Loſs of his Reputation. A Good
Name may be loſt in the Queſt of Bables
and Trifles, as well as in the purſuit of
deep and deliberate Follies. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may as well ſquander away his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
and Reputation at a <hi>Nine-pin Yard,</hi>
and a <hi>Shovel-board Table,</hi> among Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<hi>Shoomakers</hi> and <hi>Porters,</hi> as at the
<hi>Groom Porter's,</hi> amongſt <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and
<hi>Sharpers;</hi> there's no difference that I know
of, but only the One does his Buſineſs at
once, and the other's a little longer about
it: They are equally dangerous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful,
and both infinitely beſide the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and Character of a <hi>Gentleman.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>PERHAPS, Sir, having diſcovered ſo
many of the Cheats and Tricks of the
Town to you already, you may now
think it high time to wind up my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
I can aſſure you, I have no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in reporting theſe Matters, they are
as odious and unpleaſant for me to write,
as they can be for you to read: But ſtill,
Sir, I remember my Promiſe, I told you
I'd ſhew you a little of moſt of the Follies
and Villanies of the Town, which as a
Gentleman and a Stranger, you're moſt
in danger to be trapann'd, and impos'd
upon by, when you come at it. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
then to the reſt, for once I'll carry
you to a <hi>Cock Match;</hi> and if you love
that Diverſion, ſhew you a Battle or two,
that you may ſee how much our Sparks
in <hi>London,</hi> manage their matters beyond
yours in the Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:65929:58"/>
                  <hi>Cock-fighting,</hi> is an Ancient, Barbarous
ſort of Diverſion, that for many Years
has been of high repute, even amongſt
the Nobility and chief Gentry of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
'Tis now indeed in ſtate of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion;
the Gentlemen, perceiving the
conſtant Charge, Folly, and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that depended upon it, have in a
great meaſure, wiſely laid it down.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Sharpers, Rooks,</hi> and <hi>Scoundrels,</hi>
together with few ſome <hi>Fools,</hi> have taken
it up; or elſe the Cruel Sport, for that's
the beſt Title I can give it (and I think
the beſt it deſerves) had been happily
worn out, and loſt, and there had been
an end on't. For my part, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
where the great Diverſion in <hi>Cock-fighting</hi>
lies: the <hi>Bear Garden</hi> and <hi>Cock
Fit,</hi> are both alike to me; and truly, in
my Judgment, they are both Inhuman,
and Unnatural, and there's very little Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in either. But this is nothing to
the purpoſe: It paſſes under the Notion of
a Harmleſs Recreation among the reſt;
the <hi>Rooks</hi> and <hi>Sharpers</hi> get Mony by it,
and therefore we'll go and ſee a little how
they manage their point. Their firſt Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
is to bribe themſelves into Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the Feeders, and to learn
every particular Cock's Marks, Breed,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65929:58"/>
Way of Fighting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they are
thorowly equipt with theſe, and every
thing elſe, that can poſſibly give 'em any
Advantage in point of Judgment, they
make their Bets, but ſtill their Eyes
are conſtantly fixt upon the Cock, that
they may obſerve every Wound and Turn
of a Battle; and truly moſt of your Old
<hi>Cockers,</hi> are ſo very ſharp and quick-ſighted
in ſuch Caſes, that they generally diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the niceſt Advantage, and accordingly
either take, or lay the Odds, to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
off; and ſo far 'tis fair enough, and
every Man is to be commended for making
the moſt of his Buſineſs; and indeed, 'tis
impoſſible they ſhould uſe their Talents
any further in a fair Match than this comes
to, unleſs it be to ſwear you out of your
Bets, when you have won 'em, and bring
ſome of their Gang to give Judgment
againſt you, as 'tis very common amongſt
'em. But all this is little to their Buſineſs,
and if there was nothing elſe in it but the
Advantage they have in point of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they muſt be quickly forc'd to find
out ſome new Adventure, or prepare to
fight Battles of another Nature. Their
Buſineſs generally comes on when the
<hi>Grand Match</hi> is over (unleſs the whole be
one of their own making) then, perhaps,
they have a By-match or two, to divert
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65929:59"/>
the Company at Parting, which may
bring in ſomething. Here they ſet down
One of the Sharpeſt narrow-heel'd<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt <hi>Cocks</hi>
they have, to One that they know is a
perfect Slug; and 'tis ten to one too,
to make all things ſure, but they crack
his Beak, or thruſt a Pin into the Roof
of his Mouth, or blunt the Points of his
Gafles, or cramp him with a Hair about
his thigh; for in ſuch caſes they'll be
ſure to make all things ſafe; but then the
force of their Deſigns depends chiefly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the managing point, againſt their
<hi>Cock</hi> comes to be ſet down, in order to
which one of the more Reputable ſort of
Sharpers, offers large Bets upon the <hi>Cock</hi>
that is to loſe, and withal ſeveral <hi>Sham-wagers</hi>
are laid among themſelves. <hi>This,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>is a Brother to the Pile that kill'd Squire</hi>
G—'s <hi>Dun; he came from Mr.</hi> R—'s
<hi>Hen, and my Lord</hi>—C—'s <hi>Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,
that won the Famous Battle at</hi> New
Market: And, perhaps, may be a Sightly
<hi>Cock,</hi> and a good <hi>Cock</hi> in Nature. By theſe,
and ſuch like Stratagems, 'tis odds but there
is ſeveral ſnapt; and to colour the matter,
when the Buſineſs is over, they pretend that
he receiv'd a Wound in the Body in the
Sparring-blows; and if he had not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
diſabled, he would have certainly
won the Battle, and they'll fight one of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65929:59"/>
the ſame Brood, with any <hi>Cock</hi> of his
Match in <hi>England,</hi> for a hundred Pound.
Sir, I would not trouble you too much
with this kind of Stuff; you may judge
from this ſhort Draught, what theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
would be at, their ſole Buſineſs
is flat Sharping, and Rooking; and, if
you'll venture in amongſt 'em, and hazard
your Mony; you may depend upon't; if
they find you a Stranger, they'll have
ſome Device, either by fair means or foul,
to cheat you before they part with you.
But after all, what, I wonder, can it be
that ſhould induce a Gentleman, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
himſelf, and his Reputation among
ſuch a Gang of Varlets, as theſe are. I
can't imagine where the Diverſion, or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
can be, to ſee a Kennel of Deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd
Ruffians (ſtanding round a Pair
of Fooliſh Creatures) Hollowing, Curſing,
and Blaſpheming, whilſt they mangle one
another to death? This is a very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
way of diſpoſing of your ſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
Well, Sir, I will not trouble you more
about it; you ſee how Caſes ſtand, and
if you will plunge your ſelf into ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
Inconveniences, you muſt ev'n take
it for your Pains, and ſit down by the
Loſs.</p>
               <p>And next for <hi>Horſe Raceing:</hi> Why,
that's in the main a Cheat as bad, if not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65929:60"/>
worſe than the former, and many an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Gentleman hath been bubbl'd by it
out of his whole Eſtate. As to the great
Matches between Noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the Plate-matches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that's all
Country Buſineſs, and don't fall within
the compaſs of my Deſign; and I'm glad
it does not, for truly if it had, I'm afraid
I ſhould have been apt to ſay ſomething
that would not ſo well have ſuited with
their reſpective Characters. However, if
you are for a Courſe, and will be betting
with 'em, you may take this among the
reſt, That unleſs you have a true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> and <hi>Riders,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the Deſign of the Owners, you
may as well be taken in by a <hi>Jockey
Knight,</hi> or <hi>Squire,</hi> as by an <hi>Hoaſtler,</hi> or
a <hi>Horſe Courſer;</hi> and what's worſe, you
muſt not complain neither; if you do, you
affront 'em, and then Wars will enſue. In
brief, I think you have no great Buſineſs
among any of 'em. But ſince we are upon
the Ramble, we'll make a ſhort trip to
<hi>Barnſted Downs,</hi> or <hi>Hackney Marſh,</hi> and
ſee what Company they have got there:
There, I'll warrant you, if you are for
ſuch ſort of Sport, you won't want Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.
Well, I wou'd not keep you long
among 'em (for they're a dangerous Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
and therefore you wou'd do well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65929:60"/>
that there's not one Match in
twenty run there, but what's a Cheat;
the <hi>Heart</hi> of the Company is made up of
nothing, but <hi>Jockeys, Horſe Courſers, Hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlers,</hi>
and <hi>Farriers,</hi> with ſome extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Citizens, that are learning to gallop,
and manage their <hi>Racers,</hi> againſt they are
forc'd to mount 'em upon another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
A General <hi>Cit,</hi> that does not Ride
above ten or eleven Stone, after he has
wiſely Raced himſelf out of his Shop,
makes as accompliſht a <hi>Highway-man,</hi> as
the beſt <hi>Butcher, Coachman,</hi> or <hi>Hoaſtler</hi> of
'em all. But, Sir, I'm ſure you won't like this
Company; beſide you have enough of it
in your own Country, and therefore we'll
leave 'em to manage their Cheats by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and make the beſt of our way to
<hi>Hide Park,</hi> to try if we can have any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Diverſion, at a <hi>Foot Match.</hi>

that they Rob a Foot, and the other
a Horſeback; the One's a <hi>Highway-man,</hi>
and the Other's a <hi>Pad.</hi> In ſhort, the
general Buſineſs of both is to make <hi>Sham
Matches,</hi> to draw in Strangers, and to
impoſe upon 'em, by a few raſcally Cheats
and Tricks: But they're grown ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and well known in Town, that
there's few, but the very <hi>Rabble,</hi> take any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65929:61"/>
Notice of 'em. I could have entertain'd
you with ſome of their Villanous Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems
and Devices, but that I think they
are both below a Gentleman's Ear and Pen;
they're only fit for the correction of the

whether a Horſe-pond, or a Houſe of
Office, will work any thing towards their

improv'd to that high Perfection, that 'tis
become a perfect Occupation, and ſeveral
Remarkable Perſons live upon it. The
General Places where the Maſters of this
Art <hi>Rendezvous,</hi> is <hi>Lincolns-Inn Fields,</hi>
and <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> and in moſt other
Publick Places between <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi>
and <hi>Temple Bar;</hi> eſpecially in the two
former; and 'tis ſome odds if a <hi>Country
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65929:62"/>
Gentleman,</hi> or a Stranger paſſes through
either of 'em, but he's attackd by 'em.
The Manner of this <hi>Cheat,</hi> is thus, (as I
had it from One of the Chief Maſters of
the Faculty, that, it ſeems, has quitted the
Buſineſs upon ſome Diſlike.)</p>
               <p>Says he, <hi>To make us a Compleat Set,
there must be three of us; One to Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
a</hi> Merchant, <hi>the other a</hi> Country
Gentleman, <hi>and the third a</hi> Tradeſman.
<hi>When we have hit of our</hi> Cully, <hi>(and they
have commonly a damnable Notion of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for their Turn) One of our Gang marches
directly before him, and another follows cloſe
behind, till they come to a convenient Place,
where the</hi> Mouth <hi>(as they are pleas'd to
term him) muſt needs obſerve; and then the</hi>
Spark <hi>that is in the Front, drops the</hi> Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea:
<hi>Faith,</hi> (ſays he, turning about to the
<hi>Stranger) I have found a Piece of Mony here,
I think 'tis a</hi> Guinea; and then if he that's
in the Rear perceives he's inſenſible of the
Cheat, up he ſteps, and claims Halfs.
After a little Sham-ſquabble between the
two Cheats, ſays the firſt, <hi>If any body has
any right to a Snack, 'tis this Gentleman,
who ſaw me take it up: But to prevent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes,
Come,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>'tis a lucky hit, we'll
ev'n go all to the Tavern, and ſpend the odd
Mony, and then divide the Remainder fairly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65929:62"/>
and equally amongſt us. The third ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
at a diſtance, to obſerve the Succeſs
of their Management, and in what Tavern
they houſe him, which is one where they
commonly have a thorow Acquaintance and
Familiarity: when he's fixt, then in comes
he, in a mighty Hurry, and pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
for the Loſs of a</hi> Bill, <hi>which he ſays
he ſuppoſes he dropt juſt now, in the very
Room where they are drinking:</hi> And to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
the Matter, One of the other two
conveys a <hi>Sham-bill</hi> under the Table, which
he immediately takes up, and as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his Joy for the Recovery of it,
will needs call for his Pint. After they
have drank two or three Pints, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to grow a little warm, up ſtarts
one of 'em, and pretends to have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
a Pack of Cards, which he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
plac'd in ſome convenient part of the
Room, for his purpoſe. <hi>Ha!</hi> ſays he,
<hi>here's a Pack of Cards; Come, Faith, I'll
ſhew you one of the prettieſt Tricks, that I
was taught by a</hi> Dutchman <hi>t'other Day,
that ever I ſaw in my Life:</hi> And ſo to
poſſeſs their <hi>Cully</hi> of their Innocence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
they ſhew ſeveral of the ordinary Tricks
upon the Cards. At laſt, he that is the
moſt Dexterous, ſtarts the Grand Trick;
which they call <hi>Preaching the Parſon;</hi> how
the Dogs came to call it by that Name,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65929:63"/>
know not; unleſs it be, that ſo many
honeſt Clergymen, above the reſt, have been
impos'd upon by it. As to the Manner of
their Trick, 'is no great matter, my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
is not to teach you Tricks, but how
to avoid 'em: 'tis a Palm, and a Slip that
they have, a ſort of <hi>Deceptio Viſus,</hi> which
if you have a Curioſity to ſee, there's
enough in Town will equip you. If this
Cheat takes, then they have no need to
try any other Expedients; but if this don't
paſs upon you, then they'll try you with
falſe Dice, Rug and the Leather, or twenty
other Projects, that they have ready upon
ſuch Occaſions. For, in ſhort, your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
they will have, before they part with
you; or rather than fail, knock you down,
and rifle you, or pick your Pocket.</p>
               <p>Sir, you have this Account of this piece
of Roguery, in the very words, as near as
my Memory will ſerve me, as I had it
from my worthy Informer (one of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Gang;) and truly I have been
ſomething the longer upon it, that it may
ſerve as a General Caution to you againſt
Imbarking your ſelf with Strangers, upon
any pretence whatever. For, give me
leave to tell you, a conſiderable part
of the Miſchiefs of this Town, are deriv'd
to us upon that Account, and will be every
Day more and more ſo, conſidering the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65929:63"/>
preſent poſture of Men and things. This
Town degenerates hourly; Honeſty and
Vertue, are almoſt dwindled to nothing.
Roguery, Folly and Vice, are conſtantly
increaſing, and growing more Publick and
Inſolent; ſo that if you will notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
venture to <hi>London,</hi> believe me,
'twill require your utmoſt Care and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to guard your ſelf againſt 'em.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which the Tricks of Bawds and
Jilts are expoſed, together with
ſome Reflections upon the Art of
Trapping.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SIR, I am now entring upon the laſt, and
indeed the moſt unpleaſant part of my
Relation, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Tricks of <hi>Bawds</hi> and
<hi>Jilts,</hi> two Ranks of degenerated Animals,
ſo exactly Impious, ſo ſolemnly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
Vicious, and Scandalous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
their very Names, the very. Title of a
<hi>Bawd,</hi> and a <hi>Whore,</hi> is ſufficient to fright
a Sober Man, not only from their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
aud Converſation, but even out
of all manner of Luſtful Thoughts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Rank I place the <hi>Bawd,</hi> or
<hi>Procurer,</hi> you may call her what you will;
for though the latter has uſurp'd a Name
a little more Modiſh, and Decent than
the former, and perhaps may have a little
more Buſineſs among the <hi>Quality</hi> and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65929:64"/>
                  <hi>Gentry,</hi> yet they are both Practitioners in
the very ſame Arts and Sciences, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
agree in the Main of their Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.
Ther's no Difference that ever I
heard between <hi>Jeany C</hi>—and <hi>Moll</hi>—
<hi>Q</hi>—or my Lady—either, only in
point of Price: <hi>Jeany</hi> and my Lady won't
equip you under a <hi>Guinea,</hi> perhaps; and
<hi>Moll</hi> will furniſh you as well for Half a
Crown; nay, rather than loſe your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,
for a <hi>Shilling,</hi> and a Quartern of
<hi>Rasberry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, One helps to a <hi>Common Miſs,</hi> and
the other to a <hi>Common Whore;</hi> there's no
Odds but in the Name: And theſe are all
Works of Darkneſs beſide, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the old Proverb, <hi>Jone's as good
as my Lady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, for Method ſake, I'll take 'em
to pieces, and ſhew you a few of their Tricks
and Managements, under the reſpective
Characters of a <hi>Procurer, Bawd,</hi> and <hi>Jilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then for the <hi>Procurer:</hi> Her chief
Place of <hi>Rendezvous,</hi> is at the <hi>Play-houſe,</hi>
that's the Change ſhe never fails to be
upon; and indeed is the moſt proper Place
for her to put off her Dammag'd Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.
She ſeldom wants Chapmen there,
eſpecially for her <hi>Maiden-heads,</hi> which ſhe
pretends is the only part of her Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:65929:65"/>
You may eaſily diſcover where-abouts
in the Pit ſhe keeps her Office, by the
Concourſe of <hi>Whores</hi> and <hi>Gallants,</hi> that are
perpetually crowding about her, either for
Advice, or Aſſiſtance. If you ſhould once
be ſo unhappily Vicious, to make uſe of
her, ſhe will lay ſo many Snares and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
to entangle and betray you, that
'tis almoſt impoſſible for you afterwards
to eſcape her Deluſions.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ſhe'll have the delicateſt
Woman in the World for you; at other
times a fine young Creature, of about
fourteen, a perfect Pattern of Innocence,
and Modeſty, and a pure Virgin; beſide,
ſhe has one that ſings like an Angel; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
than dances to a Miracle; a third
that has an incomparable Shape and Meen;
and a fourth that's an Abſolute Wit, and
the only diverting Companion of her
whole Sex.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, ſhe has 'em, or at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
ſhe has 'em of all Sorts and Prices,
from a <hi>Guinea</hi> to five, and from five to a
hundred; but let me tell you, that if you
deal with her for any of 'em, you have
better Luck than moſt of your Neighbours,
that venture their Stocks upon ſuch brittle
Ware, if it don't prove a dear Bargain at
the making up your Account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:65929:65"/>
A <hi>Race Whore,</hi> or a <hi>Pad Strumpet,</hi> as
they order their Buſineſs, will ſtand you
in five times as much in a Year's Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as a Race Horſe and a Pad together,
nay, than a whole Stable of Racers, Pads,
and Hunters too. They muſt be kept
finely cloath'd, and nicely dreſt, and have
good Meat in their Bellies beſide, or elſe
they'll turn Jades immediately.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you may like the Humour
of Roveing better, than Keeping any of
theſe Cattle for your own Riding; hire
a <hi>Hackney Whore,</hi> as your Citizens do their
Horſes, for a Journey, and no more.</p>
               <p>But then unleſs you can have 'em at the
ſame Price too, fifteen Pence a ſide, if
you ſhould have occaſion to Ride often,
you'll find it very chargeable.</p>
               <p>Which of theſe Methods is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I cannot direct you, I muſt confeſs I
abominato<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2+ letters">
                     <desc>••…</desc>
                  </gap> both; but there's enough
in Town that can; 'tis true, they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
forc'd to walk it now, or if they
do mount (which is very ſeldom) 'tis ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon a caſt Hunter, or ſome poor
Pad that has had the <hi>Farcy,</hi> or a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi>
or ſome Surfeit or other foul Diſtemper,
that has made 'em only fit for the Hounds,
or at beſt for a <hi>Hackney.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:65929:66"/>
However, they can inform you ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
or elſe you may read it in their
Looks; their very Legs will direct that
they have Rid hard in former times, and
withal give you a ſad teſtimony, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
ſuch Journeys are, both in regard
to your Eſtate, Wealth, and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Sir, if one of theſe <hi>Belle
Dame</hi> Sorcereſſes, ſhould once bewitch
you into their Net, deſide the Fulſomneſs
of the Vice it ſelf, and the hateful and,
loathſome Qualifications that are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
with it, ſhe has ſo many Black
Arts, ſo many Infernal Stratagems and
Devices linkt together, to keep you faſt in
her Clutches, that 'tis almoſt impoſſible
for you to diſengage your ſelf, till ſhe has
had her End, and that commonly termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
in your Ruine.</p>
               <p>'Tis unaccountable indeed, when they
hear of a Beautiful Woman, (in the firſt
place) what ſtrange Contrivances and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
what Projects and Deſigns they lay,
that they may get into her Company, and
corrupt her. The Deluding and Ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both Men and Women is their whole
Buſineſs and Occupation; nay, not only
their own, but the Buſineſs of ſeveral
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65929:66"/>
Agents and Factors. A ſort of Mercenary
Hell-hounds, which they turn out to hunt
the Town, to try what Game of either
ſort they can find; and if they chance to
make their Set upon a Country Gentleman,
or a Stranger, be ſure the Dog will never
forſake the Haunt, till his Miſtris (if he
ha'nt been diſturb'd and drawn at before)
finds ſome means or other, to entangle 'em
in her Net.</p>
               <p>And now for the <hi>Bawd:</hi> She's a ſort
of Viperous Creature, that has all the
bad Properties of the former, with ſo many
Additions of her own, that ſhe's a Monſter,
both without Paralel, and beyond Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
She's the very Dregs both of a
<hi>Jilt</hi> and a <hi>Procurer;</hi> a Wretch, that having
loſt all Grace, Modeſty, or Humanity,
has ſu'd out her Indentures in the <hi>Devil</hi>'s
Company, and bound her ſelf to deal in
no other Commodities, but thoſe that tend
directly to propagate his Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſort of Practitioners generally keep
<hi>Seraglio</hi>'s of their own, with the Superſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> or <hi>Coffee</hi> over their Doors,
which are conſtantly guarded with three or
four painted <hi>Harlots,</hi> that are always ready
either by Surpriſe or Aſſault, to make you
their Priſoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:65929:67"/>
If they can any ways get you into their
Caſe (as they call it) and rather than fail
they'll impudently hawl you to: why then
in courſe, you muſt call for your Half-pint
of <hi>Rasberry;</hi> and ſo one of 'em begins a
Beaſtly Health, to let you know what Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation
they follow.</p>
               <p>Before this is drunk, in ſteps the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs,
in a mighty Rage, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
is not ſhew'd into a better Room.
<hi>Come,</hi> Sir, ſays ſhe, and ſnatches up the
Candle (ſo that you muſt either go with her,
or ſtay with thoſe Vermine in the Dark) <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me, and I'll light you up my ſelf:</hi> When
they have got you there, then they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
you're fixt, and ſo three or four
Couple of her Choice <hi>Whores</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
let looſe, to live at Diſcretion upon
you.</p>
               <p>If they can by any Sort of vicious
Lewdneſs entice you into Debauchery,
the next thing is, which of the Ladies
you pitch upon, and the Terms. Mrs.
<hi>Frances,</hi> ſhe's but juſt come out of the
Country, and has not been upon Duty
theſe four Months, there's but little Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between her and a Maidenhead,
and ſhe can't be afforded for leſs than <hi>ten
Shillings, beſide half a Crown for her ſelf.</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:65929:67"/>
Mrs. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s a good clean Woman,
and very modeſt and innocent, a pretty,
harmleſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Creature, <hi>three half Crowns is the
Price,</hi> and ſhe never went under. Mrs.
<hi>Betty,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Nancy,</hi> and ſweet Mrs. <hi>Sukey,</hi>
are all three ſound and active, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Trading's dead, and Money's ſcarce,
and you look like a civil Gentleman, and
becauſe I'd encouage you to come again, you
ſhall have one of 'em for a Crown, and
that's the loweſt; but, for</hi> Moll <hi>and</hi> Kare,
Joan, Margery, Abigail, <hi>&amp;c. you know
the Fare I ſuppoſe, and though I ſay't my
ſelf, there's ne'er a Gentlewoman in the
whole Trade can ſhew a better Warehouſe
of ſuch ſort of Goods than I can, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
a better Pennyworth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this kind of Prate the Old Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of Iniquity entertains her Gueſt,
whilſt a Kennel of hungry Brutes are all
the while yelping their fulſom Ribaldry,
ſwearing, curſing, and blaſpheming, and
ravenouſly ſwallowing and devouring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing they lay their Talons upon.</p>
               <p>This is rare Company, is it not, for a
Country Gentleman to run himſelf into?
Nay, beſides all theſe, there's a ſtrong
Party of Rogues and Bullies below, if
you ſhould not comply with their inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65929:68"/>
Demands, or ſcruple to pay their
extravagant Reckoning, ready upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to hector and inſult you, or rather
than fail, to ſtrip and murder you.</p>
               <p>To have done with 'em, I cannot ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that you ſhould ever give up ſo
much of your Reaſon, to hazard your
ſelf into ſuch a Labirinth of miſchief as
this is. No, no, Sir, I'm confident you
never will. A Bawdyhouſe! why, 'tis
the very Gate of Hell, an In-let to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
Ruine and Contempt, and more
to be avoided by far than a Jaques or a
Peſthouſe, and in all Reſpects as Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
as the one, and as Contagious as the
other.</p>
               <p>I come, in the next Place, to the Jilt,
which is a ſort of Creature, a little more
private and deſigning, but in the main as
lewd and diſſolute, and more dangerous
than e'er a one of the former.</p>
               <p>Theſe forſooth would be counted <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Religious Whores;</hi> Miſſes they'll
own themſelves to be, but <hi>Whore's</hi> a
Term a little too Rough to go down with
ſuch nice Palates, the Name of a <hi>Miſs</hi>
reliſhes better with them; well, let 'em
be <hi>Miſſes</hi> then; but, for all their Miſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65929:68"/>
I paſſionately Caution you, never
to come near any of 'em; for if you do,
you'll find they can Ruin you as ſoon as
the beſt Procurer or Bawd of 'em all.</p>
               <p>Theſe Vermine play at high Games,
nothing will ſerve ſome of them leſs than
a Settlement of <hi>two or three Hundred</hi> per
Annum, <hi>a Coach, fine Lodgings, Plate,
China and other things ſuitable for a
Whore of Rank,</hi> and upon theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
ſhe'll be faithful to you, or at
leaſt ſhe'll promiſe you ſhe will; but this
is only a Promiſe <hi>de facto</hi> neither; ſo
long as your Eſtate laſts, and you can
maintain her in her Extravagance and
Grandeur, but when that fails, ſo does
the Obligation too; ſhe has the grand
political Reaſons ready as well as the beſt
Stateſman of 'em all, and commonly
makes the ſame Uſe of it.</p>
               <p>She can Pray, Cant, ſhed a few Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles
Tears, or, rather than fail, ſham
a Fit, as a token of the Paſſion and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
ſhe has for you; but then your
Back's no ſonner turn'd, but ſhe tells her
Stallion you're a naſty, ſickly, feeble Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and that as ſoon as ſhe has perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you out of the Settlement and the new
Furniture, ſhe'll firſt affront you, and
then leave you.</p>

If ſhe finds you are a Cully indeed, and
will be often impos'd upon by her, then
ſhe has a thouſand little, wheedling tricks
and Artifices to decoy you. Sometimes
ſhe's breeding, forſooth, and then <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Night-Gowns, and Damask for Clouts,

nay, Mr. <hi>F</hi>—that is but an ordinary
Citizen preſented his Miſtreſs with a new
Bed and the Furniture of a Room that
coſt him above <hi>a hundred and fifty Pound;</hi>
and what has ſhe, I wonder, done that
ſhe ſhould not deſerve as much as the beſt
of 'em? Why ſure ſhe's as Handſom and
as Young, and is as well deſcended, and
has been as well bred as any of 'em, and do
you think that ſhe'll be put off with your
naſty, ſhabby forty or fifty Guinea's? No
truly, ſhe rather thinks, that as Caſes ſtand
between you and her, you ought to cut
off the Entail of your Eſtate, and ſettle
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65929:69"/>
a good part of it upon her for her Life,
and then let the Child Heir it afterwards;
and perhaps all this too may be only
Whore-craft, and Pretences, and ſo ſhe
muſt be forc'd (to bring her ſelf off) to
ſham a Miſcarriage; and that your Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
and Hard-heartedneſs in not ſettling
your Eſtate upon her, and anſwering her
Demands, has been the cauſe of it; and
will at laſt force her to make her ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
Well, but if you loved her as well
as ſhe loves you, you could not be ſo Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
to deny her any thing.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſhe has been no chargeable
Miſtreſs to you neither; ſhe has been
your Drudge for at leaſt theſe Seven
Months, and ha'nt coſt you fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pound in the whole. If you had

               <p>Sir, their Tricks and Devices are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs,
and not to be paralell'd by any
thing but their Ingratitude and Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
there indeed they exceed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
nothing in Nature being ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
brutiſh and Cruel, as One of theſe
kind of Creatures; the very Moment
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65929:70"/>
you ſtop your Hand, they grow Rude,
and Inſolent; and when they find they
have entirely done your Buſineſs, and
turned you a grazing, who ſo ready as
that very <hi>Syren</hi> that has ſpent your Eſtate,
to laugh at, revile, and ſcorn you; and
you are not leſs her Buffoon now, than
you were her Property formerly.</p>
               <p>To have done with her: A <hi>Jilt,</hi> is a
<hi>Procurer, Bawd,</hi> and <hi>Whore</hi> Compounded
together. A Vermine ſo Ravenous, and
Malicious, and withal ſo ſubtile and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning,
ſo formally Chaſt, and Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
Vertuous; and yet ſo Scandalouſly
Common, and Impudently Lewd; ſo
Proud, and yet ſo Mercenary, and above
all ſo Inſolently Ill-natur'd, That in the
ſhort Title of a <hi>Jilt</hi> are comprehended
all the Vices, Follies, and Impertinencies
of her whole Sex.</p>
               <p>And laſt for their Art of <hi>Trapping.</hi> This
is Myſtery that they commonly manage
either by the Aſſiſtance of a Pregnant
<hi>Whore.</hi> or by the help of ſome Letters,
or Papers, that they pick out of your
Pocket, that gives them an Inlet into
your Affairs. The firſt is carried on by
<hi>Procurers, Bawds</hi> and <hi>Jilts,</hi> and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by <hi>Sharpers, Setters</hi> and <hi>Bullies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:65929:70"/>
If they are once ſo fortunate to get a
Big-bellied <hi>Whore</hi> into their Confederacy,
then they carry her about in a kind of
Triumph, among all their <hi>Cullys</hi> and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
every one, forſooth, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being the true Father, muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
an Individual Maintenance for the
<hi>Strumpet</hi> and the <hi>Brat;</hi> or a Warrant
muſt be got immediately, or the Maſters
of the Pariſh call'd in to their Aſſiſtance, to
force you to it. 'Tis no boot to conteſt
it; for, if you do, they'll force the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to Swear it upon you, and the<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

the Charge of a <hi>Whore,</hi> and a <hi>Baſtard</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd
upon you <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they get your Papers, and Letters
into their Clutches, thoſe are their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials,
for their <hi>Sharpers, Setters,</hi> and
<hi>Bullys</hi> to commence their Villanies; in
ſuch Caſes they pretend that the <hi>Harlot</hi>
that rifled you, was an honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
and the Wife of a Perſon of
Credit and Reputation; and you muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make Satisfaction, and Compound the

and bring their <hi>Action</hi> againſt you after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:65929:71"/>
And what can a Man can do, when
he has brought himſelf into ſuch a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,</hi>
by his Folly? For my part, the
Caſe is ſo very bad and deſperate, I can't
direct you in't: If you Compound with
'em now, you do but lay your ſelf open
to their Mercy, and render your ſelf a
Bubble, and a Property for the future;
or if you reſiſt 'em, why then you loſe
your Credit; they'll be ſure to be as good
as their Words in that point however,
to miſrepreſent you, and abuſe you in all
Companies, and upon all Occaſions; ſo
that this Buſineſs of <hi>Whoring,</hi> eſpecially,
ſeems to have a Malevolent Influence,
both upon your Eſtate, and Reputation;
nay, upon your Perſon too; and very
rarely terminates without deſtroying 'em
all.</p>
               <p>To conclude this loathſome Relation,
you may learn from this rough Account
what kind of Creatures <hi>Procurers, Bawds,
Jilts, Whores,</hi> and their Appendages, <hi>i. e.
Sharpers, Setters,</hi> and <hi>Bullies</hi> are.</p>
               <p>And now what ſhall I ſay more, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
you again; If you reguard your
Health, your Eſtate, or your Reputation,
nay, what is yet more, if you regard
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65929:71"/>
the Liberty and Quiet of your Life, to
ſhun 'em all; and that will be one great
means to make your <hi>London</hi> Expedition
a little the more Comfortable, and the

               </argument>
               <p>SIR, having in a long Letter, the laſt
Poſt, entertained you with the Vicious
Tricks and Humours of the Female Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes;
I ſhall now change the Sex, and
expoſe to you ſome of the baſe Practices
of the Male, as they fall in Order; under
the diſtinct Characters of <hi>Bullys, Setters,</hi>
and <hi>Hangers-on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt for the <hi>Bully,</hi> which (if I take
him right) is a kind of Lewd Bluſtering
Animal, that having rendered himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
(by a Complication of Vicious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
Actions) for the Converſation
and Society of Sober and Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is forc'd to throw himſelf into the
Company of <hi>Bawds</hi> and <hi>Whores,</hi> and to
live upon their Contribution and Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:65929:72"/>
I ſhall not enlarge much upon his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
or Method of living, they are both
ſo generally known in Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
too, 'twould be at beſt an Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
to ſpend much time about him. As
I told you before, his common <hi>Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi>
is among the <hi>Bawds</hi> and <hi>Whores;</hi> he
eats their Bread, and fights their Battles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Hectors and inſults their <hi>Cullys,</hi> gathers
their Contribution; and for a need, can
Pimp, Betray and Set, as well as the beſt
of 'em.</p>
               <p>You may diſcern him by his long
Sword, his Inſolent and Sawcy Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
but above all, by his <hi>Atheiſtical
Dialect,</hi> Swearing, Curſing, and <hi>Ribaldry.</hi>
If ever you ſhould be ſo unhappy to fall
in with him, he conſequently entertains
you with the diſmal Relation of the Men he
has Murder'd, and the Women he has
Raped; the famous Battle he fought with
ſuch a <hi>Watch,</hi> or the bloody Rencounter he
had with a Detachment of <hi>Bailiffs,</hi> or ſome
ſuch <hi>Romantick</hi> Lies and Forgeries; and if
he can impoſe ſo far upon you, that he
perceives you're inclin'd to believe him,
'tis ten to one but he draws you into a
Quarrel, or ſome other Inconveniency;
and then by a Cowardly Stratagem, brings
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65929:73"/>
himſelf off, and baſely deſerts you to ſhift
for your ſelf.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you, that a <hi>Bully</hi>'s a
Coward; the two Names are too Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible,
to want an Explication; the
whole Streſs of his Valour and Proweſs
depends ſolely upon his Inſolence, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and Oaths; and but ruffle him
once thoroughly, that he may perceive
you know both his Trade and his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
he'll fawn upon you for ever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
like a <hi>Spaniel,</hi> you may kick him,
cuff him, pinch him, or uſe him how you
will; he has had the Misfortune to kill a
Man lately, he'll tell you, and is under an
Obligation at preſent not to fight; but
when his time's expir'd, woe be to you.</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, I hope you won't think this
a Converſable Creature; for, for all his
Cowardice and Ignorance, and for all he's
an Animal ſo perfectly below the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a Man, he can betray you into
Gaming, into Quarrels, into a <hi>Bawdy-houſe,</hi>
and into the Company of Rogues, Thieves,
and <hi>Whores,</hi> as well as the wittyeſt <hi>Sharper,</hi>
or ſtouteſt <hi>Spark</hi> of the Town.</p>
               <p>The next Gentleman that falls in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is the <hi>Setter;</hi> his way of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65929:73"/>
himſelf is quite contrary, by ſlye
Inſinuations and Flatteries, by Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Cringes, and Fawnings, and Smooth
and Knaviſh Pretences, and formal Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations:
But notwithſtanding his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
looks ſo fair and plauſible, take heed
of him; there's a legion within him.</p>
               <p>All the Cheats and Villanies in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is concenter'd in his Mind and
Thoughts; his very Soul is nothing but
thick black, and Soot, and ſtands always
ready bent to proſecute the next Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
Miſchief.</p>
               <p>His ordinary Occupation is to attend
the Motion of Young Heirs, to draw and
trapan 'em into Mean, and Unequal
Matches, and ſo impoſe upon 'em <hi>Jilts</hi>
and <hi>Whores,</hi> under the Character of
Heireſſes and <hi>Virtuoſa</hi>'s; and this he does
with ſo much Dexterity, and ſo many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Arts, and crafty Stratagems, that 'tis
almoſt impoſſible, if you ſhould be once
ſo unfortunate to fall into his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to eſcape out of it again, without
being undone, for the remainder of your
Life.</p>
               <p>Here in courſe the <hi>Entail</hi> of your Eſtate
muſt be cut off, to make room for a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65929:74"/>
for the <hi>Harlot;</hi> and ſhe muſt have
a handſom Preſent made her too, of four or
five hundred Pound value: If you have
no Mony, they'll procure it for you, upon
your Bond and Judgment, and a Friend or
two withal, that ſhall ſtand bound with
you for the Payment, till you receive your
<hi>Lady</hi>'s Fortune; but then you muſt do
them the ſame Favour, only enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Bond and Judgment with one of
'em, for a thouſand Pound or ſo, for a
Month; and that's a return of Civility,
which you cannot deny.</p>
               <p>Here the whole Buſineſs of your Life
is done in the compaſs of a Week, you're
Married to a <hi>Whore,</hi> your Eſtate is all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted,
and torn to pieces, and perhaps
ſeiz'd upon by a Combination of <hi>Villains;</hi>
and what's as great an Aggravation as
any thing elſe, you're become the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word
and Laughing ſtock of your Friends
and Acquaintance; and all this, this New Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate
has done for you, under the ſmooth
Pretence and Hypocritical Coverture of
ſingular Honeſty and Sincerity.</p>
               <p>If this Buſineſs of a Wife don't paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, he'll try in the ſecond place if
he can draw you into <hi>Sham-projects,</hi> and
<hi>Chimaera</hi>'s: He and his Friends have a new
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65929:74"/>
Invented Engine upon the Stocks, by the
help of which you may walk with much
Freedom and Eaſe, in the bottom of the
Sea, as in your own Garden; and withal
they have Intelligence upon Oath of a
Wreck, where there's ſeveral Millions, and
'twill be all their own, in four or five
Months at moſt; if you don't like this,
they have a <hi>Water Engine,</hi> that will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
a thouſand Tun an hour, out of the
deepeſt Mine; or, they have a <hi>Mine</hi> where
there's a Rib of <hi>Ore,</hi> of a prodigious big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and for a Sum of Mony to carry
on their Works, you may be admitted
into their Society, and be a Sharer in the
whole, and can't fail to get a conſiderable
Eſtate in a few Years.</p>
               <p>Here you're entangl'd again, if you Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
your ſelf with 'em; and not only loſe
all the preſent Mony you part with, but
are in great hazard to be drawn into fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Bond and Obligations, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ruin'd at laſt.</p>
               <p>Sir, I ſhould trouble you, and my ſelf,
too long, if I ſhould proceed to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the reſpective <hi>Rogueries</hi> and <hi>Tricks</hi> of
a <hi>Setter;</hi> and therefore I'll leave him
with this ſhort Character.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:65929:75"/>
His whole Life is a compendious Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of deep and deliberate Villany; his
only Buſineſs, nay, even his Diverſion,
conſiſts ſolely in Betraying and Trappan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
his Food and Suſtenance depends
intirely upon Lying, Falſhood and Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
In a Word he has the Devil's Motto
ſtamp'd upon him in large Characters, and
is perpetually ranging to ſeek whom he
may devour.</p>
               <p>I come, in the laſt place, to the <hi>Hanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or <hi>Spunger;</hi> and this is commonly a
ſort of ſottiſh, lazy Creature, tho' natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
not ſo dangerous and miſchievous as
the former, yet, as troubleſome and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
and indeed, a greater Clog to a
Man of Sence than either of 'em.</p>
               <p>He has little to recommend him unleſs
it be a few drunken Jeſts, or Scraps of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or perhaps ſome broken Characters
of Men and things, with a little of the
News and Humours of the Town; and
by virtue of theſe mighty Qualifications
he fancies himſelf a Companion fit for the
beſt Gentlemen in the Kingdom, and will
be ſure, upon the ſmalleſt Invitation to
croud himſelf upon him if he meets
any Encouragement; and 'tis ten to
one but by degrees he grows fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65929:75"/>
and after that impudent, and at laſt
intolerable.</p>
               <p>In one Point, indeed, he's a perfect Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
he carries all he has along with him,
and truly that's little enough too; his Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
in general is ſo wretched and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
that you may as ſoon learn a Spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
by his Garb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a Bully by his
Curſing and Ribaldry, or a Setter by his
Fawning and Diſſimulation. A Bawdy
Song or two, a few drunken Healths, and
about half a Dozen dull Punds ſet him up;
and with theſe he will be perpetually gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and dinning your Ears till he has
worn 'em as thread bare as his Coat, and
after all, muſt be forc'd to be laught or
kick'd out of 'em before he will quit 'em
too.</p>
               <p>As for Money, he never has any, nor
never pretends to any, unleſs it be now
and then the Fragments of a Reckoning
which he pinches from the Drawer, to
heel-piece his Shoes or recruit his Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co
Box.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, theſe <hi>Hangers on</hi> are <hi>Drones</hi>
in the ſtricteſt Sence and Definition, and
if you once ſuffer 'em to crawl into your
Hive (to keep up to the Nature of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect)
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65929:76"/>
they'll be ſure to beſmear and diſturb
your Cell, Devour your Honey, and in
all Reſpects are as burdenſom and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to the Perſons they can faſten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon, as Drones and Waſps are to
Bees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Town ſwarms with this Sort of
Inſects, and a Country Gentleman can
hardly ſet his Foot into it, but there are
ſeveral of 'em come inſtantly humming
and buzzing about him. I have given
you already my Notion of Idleneſs; and
I tell you again, in the Words of a great
Man, <hi>that 'tis ſo ſcandalous and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that neither Heaven, Earth, nor Hell it
ſelf will own or patronize it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How unreaſonable then is it, I think I
may ſay, <hi>how infamous and unaccountable,</hi>
to pick up ſuch looſe and profitleſs Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and take 'em into your Boſom, and
make 'em your Companions. I am aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
when I ſee ſix or ſeven of 'em ſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
before a Country Gentleman, and
crowding themſelves into all Company
and Buſineſs along with him, ſucking and
ſpunging upon him, and, <hi>in the literal
Sence,</hi> eating him up alive. Sir, I hope you
will not miſunderſtand me, I am not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
you againſt Relieving and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65929:76"/>
diſtreſs'd Gentlemen in their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities.</p>
               <p>No, no, I would not have you defie
the Example of that Liberality by whoſe
Effects you live, but then I would not
have you neither abuſe the Divine Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
by foſtering a ſort of vicious, ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh
Creatures, that with great Reaſon
you ought to deteſt and reject, let 'em
e'en ſing their Requiems ſome where elſe,
for you may depend upon't, that a Cry of
theſe Slow, Deep-mouth'd Dogs, altho they
don't run ſo ſwift, will ſtick as cloſe to the
Scent, and as effectually hunt you to
death, as a Kennel of the fleeteſt Hariots
or ſharpeſt Fox-Hounds.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing I propos'd in this, was
to make ſome ſhort and general Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
upon Gaming; they muſt be ſhort
and general indeed, for I find I have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
ſo much of my Paper upon my <hi>three
laſt ſcurvy Subjects,</hi> that I have only Room
left for a very few Lines.</p>
               <p>That the Original Deſign of Play or
Gaming was Diverſion and Recreation, I
ſuppoſe we may take for granted; but
ſince it has loſt its native Property, and
baſely degenerated into a mechanical Trade
and Occupation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:65929:77"/>
I'm affraid, as Caſes ſtand, we have
two other Titles that will ſuit it much
better, <hi>i. e.</hi> Covetouſneſs and Cheating;
for what imaginable Cauſe can there be
aſſign'd, but the flat Deſire of Winning,
that ſhould induce Men to venture what
they have for what they have not; nay,
that which they are affraid and unwilling
to loſe for that which they're uncertain to
gain.</p>
               <p>This can be nothing but Covetouſneſs;
for if Covetouſneſs was not the Grand
Mover, there could not be the leaſt Grounds
or Pretence for <hi>great</hi> and <hi>deep Gaming;</hi> a
Man may divert himſelf as well for a
Shilling as for a Pound, and for a Pound
as for a Thouſand; and if that were all,
provided it were not uſed immoderately,
there would be no Harm in Gaming
at all.</p>
               <p>No, no, 'tis Covetouſneſs, which tho'
ſome of the more thinking Sort of Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are aſham'd to own, take off the
Diſguiſe, and you ſee the Ugly Hag dreſt
up in all her diſmal Pomp of Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:65929:77"/>
And then for Cheating; why, 'tis the
<hi>Inſeparable Qualification of a Gameſter.</hi> A
Man has not only <hi>blind Chance</hi> to deal
with (tho that be but a very leaky, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
Veſſel for him to put to Sea in, upon
ſuch a dangerous Expedition) but <hi>ſuch a
Combination of Deceit,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a Chain of
Tricks and Slights link'd together,</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>good Fortune it ſelf</hi> is not ſufficient to
guard and ſecure him againſt 'em: So that a
Gameſter lies under a kind of Neceſſity to
make himſelf <hi>Maſter of the uſeful Art of
Cheating,</hi> that he may be upon the Level
with the reſt of his Fraternity.</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, can there be any thing
<hi>more ſordidly mean and baſe, and more
exaltedly fooliſh,</hi> than for a Man to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
a Profeſſion that does ſo naturally
entitle him to two of the <hi>worſt Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
in the World,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Miſer and a
Cheat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, if, after all, a Man could
arrive to the <hi>higheſt Perfection</hi> in this
<hi>paltry Science, Gaming and Cheating</hi> have
commonly a Reflex'd Efficacy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
none more than thoſe that uſe 'em.
Beſides all this, what ſhould it be, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that ſhould encline a Gentleman of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65929:78"/>
an Eſtate to take up ſuch a Scoundrel Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation:
He'd be very loath to be ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd
with the exploded Name of a
<hi>Mechanick</hi> in other Caſes; and where the
mighty Reaſon lies, he ſhould ſubmit to it

               <p>Well Sir, let the Shipwrack'd Fortunes

reproachful and hazardous it is to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark

               <p>SIR, I have already led you through
a diſmal Wilderneſs, and briefly
ſhewed you what a Herd of Wild Beaſts
and Monſters you muſt take your Range
among, if your Reſolution for the
Town continues; and now I think 'tis high
Time to wind up my Account. Indeed
there are abundance of other dangerous
Occurrences that may well juſtifie a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Reprehenſion, but I ſhall only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
one or two more, and leave the
Conviction theſe have receiv'd at the
Tribunals of Reaſon and Experience to
conclude the reſt.</p>
               <p>And firſt, for your Garb, you'll find
ſome of our City Gentry ſo ridiculouſly
Gawdy and Extravagant, that compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,

a Ship may be rigg'd for the
<hi>Indies</hi> both as cheap and as eaſily; moſt
of the Trades in the Commonwealth are
ſome way or other concern'd in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage,
ſuch a ſtrange multiplying Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
has this ſort of Vanity, that it has
improv'd Nature's ſimple Neceſſity of a
Covering, the firſt Fig-Leaves (as 'tis
phras'd by that excelent Author of the
<hi>Gentleman's Calling</hi>) to ſuch a Luxuriant
Growth, that thoſe <hi>Hercynean Oaks</hi> which
<hi>Mela</hi> tells ſuch Wonders of, are but a ſort
of Pigmy Plants in compariſon of them.</p>
               <p>But theſe are but a kind of Butterfly-Sparks,
a few inſignificant Inſects that
flutter about Town for a Year or two,
and are afterwards forc'd to crawl into
Holes and Corners in a Dreſs perhaps no
leſs contemptible, wretched, and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
than the former was gay, fulſom,
and pedantick.</p>
               <p>This is a Folly, indeed, that I cannot
ſupect a Gentleman of your Sence can
be guilty of, and yet, vain and fooliſh
as it is, I could quote you a conſiderable
Number that have been undone by it,
that have laid out their whole Eſtate
in a few gawdy Trappings, that they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65929:80"/>
may make a Figure (as they call it)
have at laſt figur'd it ſo long, till they
have figur'd themſelves into Rags or a
Priſon, and render'd them the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and Laughing-Stocks of the whole
Town.</p>
               <p>Next to theſe, we have another Rank
of unthinking Creatures, a ſort of nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palated
Sparks, that nothing will go
down with but Dainties and Curioſities;
tell 'em of good Beef Mutton, Veal, or
any of our own Productions, which
doubtleſs are the beſt in the World,
they'll ſwear they are all <hi>Porters Fare,</hi>
and unleſs they are firſt adulterated with
ſome ſtudied Mixtures; and forc'd from
their native Property by ſome new and
coſtly Sauces, they are far too mean and
common for their Tables.</p>
               <p>Theſe, in the ſtricteſt Sence, may be
ſaid to incurr the Vultures Fate, <hi>i. e.</hi> to
eat up themſelves; and truly ſo it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
falls out. I have known within
the Compaſs of my own Experience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of theſe Luxuriant Prodigals,
that have ſo long tantaliz'd themſelves
with their Delicious Morſels, that at
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65929:81"/>
length they have wanted Food conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for the Support of Nature.</p>
               <p>Others we have, that affect the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of making coſtly Treats and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments;
a hundred pound is but a
<hi>mean Sum</hi> to ſpend upon an <hi>Evenings
Collation for a Miſtreſs or two, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
do him the favour after all but to
laugh at him for his Prodigality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I heard a Fool my ſelf (that's now
ſhirking about Town, and will be glad
of any body that will give him a Pot of
Ale and a Roll and Cheeſe) bragging
not many Months before, <hi>That an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
he made for three or four
Ladies coſt him ſix ſcore pounds.</hi> Such
Wretches, I think, are below all kind
of Pity. I could almoſt <hi>grudge</hi> 'em
<hi>even the Huſks their Extravagance natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
confines 'em to,</hi> and wiſh 'em rather
ſome Fate more remarkable, ſcandalous
and durable, that might not only
nauſeate but fright the reſt of the World
from their Inadvertency.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other things that I
could mention to you that are no leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
than ridiculous; but, Sir, I can
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65929:81"/>
never ſuſpect you ſhonld ſo evidently
tranſplant your diſcerning Faculty from
your Intellect to your Senſe, to ſuffer
your ſelf to be impos'd upon by any of
theſe ſort of Follies.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you not to miſtake me, I
abhor all Sour<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eſe or Singularity, and
heartily allow of a Decent Garb, and
a Gentile, Friendly Entertainment upon
Occaſion, they are equally Neceſſary and
Commendable in a Gentleman. And
indeed, ſo long as they are kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the true Rules of Sobriety and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
are very highly conſiſtent,
not only with his Character but his
Intereſt.</p>
               <p>I could make a great many Juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
(if 'twere neceſſary) upon
thoſe whoſe Vain and Laviſh Humours
have enclined 'em to ſquander away
their Eſtates in ſuch Inſignificant
Trifles; but I'm ſure a haughty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Mind muſt feel Smart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
without any additional Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;
it muſt needs be a moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittering
Conſideration, a Conſideration
that advances the Affliction, beyond
that of a more innocent Poverty, as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65929:82"/>
much as the Pain of an envenom'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
exceeds that of another.</p>
               <p>Beſide all the more remote Dangers
and Inconveniencies I have already
mentioned, there are ſtill two other,
which you are the moſt nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to guard your ſelf againſt;
the firſt is againſt Innovations and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettledneſs
in your Religion; and the
ſecond againſt embarking your ſelf in
Cabals, and Confederacis in Matters
belonging to the State and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>We have Temptations and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
too, of all Sorts at <hi>London,</hi> great
Numbers of Perſons that make it
their Buſineſs to ſnap up Strangers,
and watch all Occaſions to try if they
can impoſe any of their Trumpery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
'em.</p>
               <p>Here the Papiſts, Presbyterians, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
Independants, Anabaptiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
have all their Party Men abroad to
endeavour the Gaining Proſelytes; and
truly 'tis great odds, but ſome of 'em
attempt to ſeduce you: but then I'm
confident you are ſo throughly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65929:82"/>
in the Principles of your own
Church and Religion, that they can
never make any Advances upon you:
however a kind Caution can do you
no harm, if you ſhould never have any
occaſion to make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Then for Caballing and Embarking
your ſelf with Parties and Factions,
'tis a Dangerous bewitching thing, and
ſo many Worthy Gentlemen have
been ruin'd by it, that I think 'tis
utterly needleſs to deſcend into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
I'm ſure it ought to be
Matter of the ſaddeſt Reflection to
all who have been any Way involved
in it. It being a moſt direful Account
that they will at laſt have to make, for
being the Unhappy Authors of ſuch
miſerable Diſorders.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, I will not ſpend more of
your time in theſe (I hope) needleſs
Obſervations and Reflections; you'll doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſoon perceive from the ſtupendious
Fate of vaſt Multitudes; how you are to
order your ſelf in theſe ſeveral Particulars,
and to them I referr you for your full
and ample Satisfaction.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein he firſt directs him in

ſome general Cautions and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
how to manage himſelf in
Town.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SIR, Having drawn you a Rough
Draught of the Men and Things of
the Town, I preſume you'll pardon it
among the reſt of my Impertinencies if
by way of Concluſion I trouble you once
more with a few ſhort and general Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
how to diſpoſe of your Eſtate in
your Abſence, and of your ſelf when
you come to <hi>London:</hi> The former is as
eſſentially neceſſary as the latter, and if
you fail in either, I can ſee nothing in
the Reverſe of your Expedition but flat
Ruin and Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:65929:83"/>
As for the Diſpoſal of your Eſtate 'tis
the Grand Baſis upon which all the reſt
of your Affairs muſt move; ſo that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
you leave that both under a faithful
as well as a prudent Managery, let your
Succeſs in Town be what it will, you'll
have but a bad Return for your Venture
in the Winding up; but then the Grand
Query is, how this may be ſettled with
the moſt Eaſe and Conveniency to your
ſelf, the leaſt Trouble to your Friends and
Servants, and the greateſt Satisfaction and
Advantage to all your Tenants, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and Dependants.</p>
               <p>In Order to which, I think, in the firſt
place, it will be highly neceſſary for you
to be your own Auditor, to take a month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Survey of your Reſpective Accounts,
and to ballance your Expences with your
Receipts, and to ſquare and proportion
'em both according to the true Value and
Nature of your Revenue.</p>
               <p>'Tis true ſome of our high-bred Gentry
look upon this as a Reflection upon their
Character, and that the Overſight of
their Eſtates is not only a Buſineſs too
burthenſom but likewiſe too mean for
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65929:84"/>
'em. What Reaſons they can give for it,
I muſt confeſs, I'm a Stranger to.</p>
               <p>Methinks it ſhould be rather a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſment,
and a proper and advantageous
Method for 'em to diſpoſe of ſome of thoſe
ſpare Hours, whoſe Emptineſs would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their Load, and probably of no
ſmall Pain and Coſt, and perhaps Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
too.</p>
               <p>Next to this, your Buſineſs will be to
procure an honeſt ingenious Man for a
Steward, a Perſon that will neither be
tempted by <hi>Avarice</hi> or <hi>Intereſt,</hi> or ſeduc'd
by <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> to betray your Concerns or
imbezle your Effects; he ſhould be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſoure in his Converſation, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
in his Behaviour, not bitter nor
preſſing upon your Tenants, and yet
watchful and ſedulous to keep 'em within
the moderate Bounds of their Leaſes and
Agreements, and withal, careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
'em from running too far in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears,
which commonly terminates, not
only in the Ruin of themſelves, but in
the manifeſt Loſs and Inconvenience of
the Landlord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:65929:84"/>
                  <hi>A Steward ſhould be a Perſon (if you
can find ſuch a one) that is remarkable
for the</hi> diſcreet Government of himſelf and
his own Affairs, <hi>he ought to be a</hi> tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Maſter of Accompts, <hi>and</hi> well
skill'd in the uſeful Art of Husbandry,
<hi>and</hi> in the manner of Country Dealing and
Comerce, <hi>but above all,</hi> he ſhould be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
from all manner of Selfiſhneſs and
mercenary Deſigns, and be acted purely by
true Principles of Love, Juſtice, and
Gratitude.</p>
               <p>Next to Him, a provident Houſe-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
will be extreamly requiſite, and ſhe,
indeed, ſhould have <hi>moſt of the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Steward;</hi> ſhe ſhould be <hi>diſcreet
and faithful, affable, modeſt, meek and
Compaſſionate;</hi> ſhe ſhould be free from <hi>the
little Vanities of Goſſiping and Talebearing,
too common to her Sex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your</hi> Houſe <hi>ſhould be</hi> her only Empire,
<hi>and</hi> the calm and peaceful Government of
it, <hi>her</hi> higheſt Ambition; <hi>ſhe ſhould have</hi>
no Ends, <hi>nor, indeed,</hi> no Buſineſs of her
own, to diſturb or take her off, <hi>but be</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
vigilant to obſerve and reſtrain the
Irregularities of the Family, and not more
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65929:85"/>
neither by her Advice and Reproof, than
by the Preſident of her own Calmneſs, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and Moderatiou.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, you'll want an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Gardiner and a careful Groom,
the one to take Care of your Fruit and
Flowers, and to preſerve your Walks
and Arbors from running to Ruin and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;
and the other to manage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
your Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if you could thus equip your
ſelf, which, I confeſs, will be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for you to do, you'd be however ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
that when you have tir'd your ſelf
with the Follies and Vanities of the
Town (which I believe, or, at leaſt,
hope will be in a very little time) your
Affairs in the Country are in a good
Poſture, and thither you can return and
reſt your ſelf, out of the Reach of the
Hurry and Impertinence of it.</p>
               <p>And, now Sir, the next thing will be
to manage <hi>your ſelf</hi> with Advantage and
Security <hi>when you come to Town.</hi> I have
ſhew'd you already the Rocks that you
are in moſt danger to Split upon, and the
Vices, Follies and Dangers, which, as a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65929:85"/>
Gentleman and a Stranger, you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
liable to be encountred with; and
becauſe my preſent Deſign hath made
them my peculiar Province, I ſhall wave
all others, and only addreſs my ſelf to
you for a Concluſion, in a paſſionate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
and Requeſt or two, which I
preſume you will either grant or pardon,
if not both.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I prſſionately adviſe and
requeſt you not to plunge your ſelf into
the Society of Strangers. I have told
you that before, and I muſt tell it you
again, and indeed I can never tell it you
too often, that the Generality of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
of this Town are deriv'd to us upon
that Account.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let me again admoniſh you
not to take Men and Things upon Truſt,
but firſt to weigh 'em ſoberly and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
to bring 'em home to the Tribunal
of your own Reaſon, Conſcience and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
before you paſs your Judgment
or make your Option.</p>
               <p>This Town is ſway'd purely by a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Falſhood and Contradiction, or
what's as bad, by Spite, Faction or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65929:86"/>
ſo that if you take things naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without comparing them with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Rules of Truth and Probability,
you lie open to be impos'd upon by an
endleſs Repetition of Falſhoods and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cowler</hi>'s Wiſh lies always before
you; <hi>a few Friends, and a few Books, and
both true and well choſe,</hi> are all you want,
and indeed, your only proper and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Companions for this Town.</p>
               <p>To ſum up all, I hope you will not
eſteem it an uncivil Addreſs, to put you
in mind of your Character, by your Birth,
Education and by your Eſtate too; you
are a Gentleman, and then I think I need
not tell you what it is that is your moſt
adorning Accompliſhment: 'tis Vertue,
Sir, and 'tis that and nothing elſe can add
a Luſtre to your Title. 'Tis <hi>that alone</hi>
can refine and ſublimate your Pleaſures,
and give a long and glorious Splendour
to your Quality.</p>
