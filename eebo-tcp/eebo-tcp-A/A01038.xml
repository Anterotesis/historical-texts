            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Eccleſiaſticke Authoritie, by two <hi>Nationall Synodes,</hi> was given to this <hi>Confeſsion;</hi> and that twofolde: the one <hi>immediate,</hi> the other <hi>mediate.</hi>

               <p>That Royall Mandate, was no perpetuall Law, but a temporarie Mandate, given out in his Majeſties minor age; hee beeing in the fyfteenth yeare of his age then current. There-after hee diſallowed the ſame, in his rype age, as is evident by his Majeſties owne Speach, in the Conference which his Majeſtie had with the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and others of the Clergie of ENGLAND, AT HAMPTON COVRT, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603, in the ſecond dayes Conference: Where it beeing moved by a certayne Doctor, That this PROPOSITION, <hi>[The intenſion of the Miniſter, is not of the eſſence of the Sacrament]</hi> might bee added vnto the Booke of Articles, the rather becauſe that ſome in <hi>ENGLAND</hi> had preached it, to bee eſſentiall; his Majeſtie vtterlie diſlyked that motion; thinking it vnfit to thruſt into the Booke everie <hi>Poſition Negatiue;</hi> which would both make the Booke ſwell into a volume as big as the BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE, and alſo confound the Reader: Bringing for example, the courſe of one Maſter CRAIG, (I am
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2610:9"/>
vſing the wordes publiſhed in the Printed Summe of that Conference) in the lyke caſe in <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> who with his, I renounce and abhorre, his deteſtations, and abrenounciations, hee did ſo amaze the ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they, not able to conceaue all thoſe thinges, vtterlie gaue over all, falling backe to <hi>Poperie,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning ſtill in their former ignorance: <hi>Yea, if I,</hi> ſayd his Majeſtie, <hi>ſhould haue beene bound to his forme, the Confeſsion of my Fayth, must haue beene in my Table-booke, not in myne head.</hi> Out of theſe his Majeſties wordes, concerning this <hi>Negatiue Confeſsion,</hi> yee may eaſilie ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his mynde, concerning that Mandate drawne ſome-tyme from his Royall hand, for exacting <hi>Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the ſayde <hi>Confeſsion:</hi> to wit, that hee did vtterlie diſallow, and annull it: <hi>Ad intentionem Mandantis recurrendum eſt. Extra, de reſcriptis, cap.</hi> 8. <hi>ad aures, in gloſſa.</hi> More-over; Although his Majeſtie had not in his lyfe-tyme made voyde that Mandate, as hee did; yet now it were expyred, with His Royall Breath: <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Mandatoris expirat Mandatum.
