            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For the iniurye offered to so infinite a maiestye of one so farr inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, &amp; so highlye beholding vnto him, in so opprobrious and despytefull wyse, that as much as in the sinner lyeth, he quite defeateth God of his godhead, and yeldeth it to that wherin he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: This iniurye (I saye) is so greate, that though God shoulde double and treble all punishmentes of sinne, and lay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on one sinners backe, for one on lye mortal offence, yett might he iustly double them of new, and as often as he thought good, without doing anye iniurye to the offendor; yea and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him farr lesse, then his desert were.

Lett vs now therfore consider, what ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous punishmentes God hath vsed, in reuenging him selfe vppon sinners. First if we marke what temporall mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all men, God hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the worlde, for one onlye sinne of <hi>Adam</hi>; They will seeme so manye, as might suffise yea and exceede the iust measure of the desert of that sinne. For if man had perseuered in the state of innocencye, nether should our bodyes haue ben subiect to anye diseases, nor the minde to anye sorowe or disordred passions. The earth should haue ben a place of pleasure, the ayre temperate, all creatures to man obedient, finallye all thinges to our contentment, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our annoyance. If therfore we consider now the miseryes of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, as hunger, thirst, nakednesse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitye, sickenesse, and mortallitye; the troubles of our mynde, as phansies, feares, perplexityes, anguishes, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers imperfections: likewyse the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall scourges of plagues, warre, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand hazardes and calamityes,: Finally all other incombrances, that in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect ar incident into this lyfe, they are
<pb facs="tcp:11461:61"/>
so manye in number, so greeuous in qualitye, and so ordinary in experience to all, that who so well wayeth them, might thinke them sufficient scourges, not onlye of one, but of all the sinnes of mankynde. Doe but cast your eyes into one hospitall of lazars. See what cankers, fistuloes, vlcers, and rottings, what wolfes, sores, and festered carbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Wey the miseries of the phrensye, palsey, letargy, falling sicknesse, and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasye. Consider the diseased of the eyes, eares, mouth, throate, and euerye par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of mans bodye. On the other syde consider the infirmityes of the mynde, the furious rages, enuyes, rancours, and corrasiues, the vnplacable sorowes, and desperate passions, the continuall hell, tormentes, and remorse of conscience, and infinite other spritishe fittes, and agonyes. Consider the displeasure of superiours, the malice and enmitye of our equalles, the contempt, ignominy, and reproch, we receyue of our inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, the fraude and trecherye of all sortes and degrees. Goe forwarde to the other ordinarye molestations, by losse of goodes, lymmes, libertye, frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,

wyfe, or children. By daungers of fyer, water, sword, beastes, and infinite of lyke qualitye. And remembring that all these thinges, and the defeating of the commodityes &amp; pleasures contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to the same, befell vnto man by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son of one, and that in shew but a light sinne; Lett vs not thincke much if we, whose offences are most greeuous, and verye many, suffer a few of these scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and those such, as compared with diuers other afore recyted, haue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte of them, scarce anye colour or shadow of miserye. What sinne haue we committed, that maye not be deemed as exorbitant as the eating of an aple: and how manye haue we done, that seeme farr more detestable? why then shoulde we not, eyther looke for the whole heape of afflictions to light vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, or at the lest, the most noysome and greuous that are emongest them: which God of his mercye, not hauing permitted, but layed a softe and easye hande vppon vs, more cause we haue of thankes giuinge, then of anye iuste complaynte.

First the famine was so greate, that not onlye they of the same

familye, were at weapons for a bitt of meate, but the soldiers, that lyke hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye wolues ranged about the cittye, if in anye place they felt but the sent of vittayle, they rushed in with drawne swordes, and were readye to ripp open the bellyes and bowels of their owne citizens, to fetch out the meate which they had eaten, and fedd vppon that lothsome stuffe so brutishlye gotten, &amp; imbrued in the bloode of the first ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as vppon a deyntye &amp; delicate dish. The childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were at defiance with their owne parentes, the brothers &amp; sisters mortall enemyes, the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at deadlye foode, with their owne ofspring, all readye to murder one an other, for euery bitt that anye of them putt into their mouth; So farr did the extremitye of hunger, abolishe all fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge of naturall affection: yea &amp; that which is more, man was enforced to chew beastes dunge, &amp; after they had eaten vpp the fleshe to take their repast vppon their most filthye excrementes. Others fishing &amp; raking in the sinckes &amp; chanels, from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce gatherd though for to thincke most detestable &amp; best<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
<pb facs="tcp:11461:64"/>
yet to them in those termes not vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pleasant foode. Some fedd vppon the lether of their bucklers, and shoes: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on trampled and broken haye, finallye men vsed to all varietye of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande, and delicious fare, were now dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to so base and abhominable dyett, as the brute beastes them selues by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would abhorr. I leaue it to your consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what mortallity &amp; strange diseases this famine was likely to breed. But yet besid this, were ther at the same time such ciuil mutinies, such domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vprores amongest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>Titus</hi> theire mortall enemye, who laye in siege about their citye, hearing of their mutuall slaughters, for all his vnplacable enmitye, was deepely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with compassion, saying that they needed no foreyne enemyes to worke theire confusion, so bloodye were the tragedyes they reysed among them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. Neyther was this the greatest of their miseryes. For afterward besyde the vnmercifull hauocke, that the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines made of the Iewes, when the citye was taken, there was found an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that bred occasion of a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11461:64"/>
and most cruell massaker. For the Iewes vnwillinge to enrich their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes with their treasure, and thincking to saue somewhat from the generall spoyle, swallowed into their bodyes so much golde, perle, and prcious stone, as nature woulde beare. which thinge the Romanes afterwarde fyndinge out by their excrementes, they left rifeling their houses, &amp; in most barbarous sort began to ransacke their bodyes &amp; bow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ells: So that wheras they thought their bodyes, their surest coffers, they found by a rufull experience their owne fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, who when they might with theire treasure haue tedeemed theire lyues, they so horded it vp, that neyther they coulde vse it to their owne profite, nor the enemye spoyle them of it without spillinge their lyues. Finallye besydes battering downe the walles, the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinge of the citye, the burninge of the temple; there were as <hi>Iosephus</hi> reporteth partly by famine, partly by the sword, put to death, an eleuen hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Iewes, besydes fourscore and ten thousand other the relques and onlye remnant of that nation, that were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

For when throughe out all <hi>Africa,</hi> there swarmed innumerable multitudes of <hi>Locustes,</hi> which deuoured, not onlye the corne, fruites, herbes, leaues, and twigges; but euen the barke of trees, and drye wood being lifted al fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, with a sodeyne tempest, and gathered into globes, they were caried in the ayre, a long tyme, and in the end drowned in the <hi>African</hi> sea.

of this one citye, there were caried out fiftene hundred of the younger sorte. And thus the multitude of vermyne, that could not alyue haue bene endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was much lesse tolerable, when it was dead, and the perishing therof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all thinges, which they could haue consumed, if they had liued lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

For though there be greate dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the flower of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode &amp; the ripenesse of olde age, yet is it the same man that was then younge, and is now olde, &amp; though the partes

And in our dayes since <hi>Luther</hi> vprist, by the reuerend father <hi>Francis Xauier</hi> of the societye of Iesus, in the <hi>Indies</hi> whose wonderfull miracles are not onlye certeyne by most diligent en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quirye, and scrutinie made for the true knowledge of them by the Kinge of <hi>Portugall,</hi> but the miraculous conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of so manye thousandes, yea and so manye Kingdomes, as by the same
<pb facs="tcp:11461:90"/>
were turned from infidelitye to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maine faith, yeldeth an vndoubted assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therof. Seynge therfore that these men by our aduersaries owne confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and by their lyues and writinges, are manifestlye knowne for men of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; Seynge also their miracles were suche, as surmounted all power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuringe, sorcery, or enchantment, as the fathers graunt the giuinge light to the blynde limmes to those that wante them, and reuiuinge the dead to be. Seynge finallye these miracles haue ben wrought, eyther for testimony of their vertue, which can not be true vertue without true faythe, or for proofe of their religion, which all authors assure vs was the same that oures, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certificat can we haue of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and integrity of our quarell, since we are sure that God the onlye author of these supernaturall effectes, can not witnesse anye kynde of vntruthe. And to doubte whether these miracles be true, or truelye reported, being written by so graue and authenticall auctors is nothinge els, but to condemne all his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toryes, bookes, and registers of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitye,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:11461:90"/>
and onlye to allow that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our owne sight and sense doth acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine vs, which is extreme follye. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer if we consider both the sinceritye and sanctitye of our fayth, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fessours therof, and the absurditye and corruption of our aduersaryes beliefe, and behauiour; by the fruites we shall soone know in whose gardeyne the best tree groweth. For as concerninge our fayth, the principles, rules, &amp; groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des therof are suche, that though they be aboue, yett are they not agaynst rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, neither yelde they scope to suche as lyue accordinge to their prescript, of licentiousnesse or riott, but keepe them in awe and compasse of their duety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God and man. Whereas the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye articles of our aduersaries religion, are of suche tenour, that in reason and pietye, they can not be held for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truthes, nor beinge belieued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayne mens consciences to the limites of vertue, but rather open them a wyde gate to desperat &amp; dissolute lyfe. For he that affirmeth all the actions of man, euen the verye beste to be damnable sinnes, as <hi>Caluin</hi> and his followers auou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che,
<pb facs="tcp:11461:91"/>
and therewith that all sinnes are of equall deformitye and heynousnes, touchinge death and damnation, what harte or encouragement can he haue, to followe vertue, or what bridle can holde him from plunginge him selfe in the puddle of all vyce: seinge the one is as greate an offence, and as punisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before God as the other, and the same fayth which maketh, that the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of a good action is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the doer, is also of the same force and hath the same effecte, in anye other wicked worke whatsoeuer. Agayne he that beleeueth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of God to be impossible for man to keepe, and withall that howsoeuer he breake them, it nether can nor ought to make him doubt of his election, which depen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth only vpon gods predestinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why should he not thincke it follye to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure to obserue Gods lawe beinge an impossibillitye: yea and vppon certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of his saluation, become carelesse to breake anye commandemement, &amp; to take what course most pleaseth his sensuall appetyte. Further he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth God the author of sinne, &amp; as well the inforcer of man to wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11461:91"/>
actes, as the directour to anye vertue. and withall knoweth that if he be damned it shalbe for no other sinne then suche as by God him selfe he was constrayned to committ, must needes thinke his case most miserable in being so dishabled, from auoydinge suche an offence, and God a most rigorous and vniust iudge, that condemneth a man for that fault, which he forced him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The effecte of which and such lyke principles, well appeareth in the vnchri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stian and irreligious behauiour of son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye estates, and speaciallye of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant ministers, teachers, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the same, who are knowen in most places to be so loose, and lewde, &amp; so far disordred, that their own shepe do greatly mislike their vngodly behauior. But now on the other syde for proofe of the sincerity of our religion, I only ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peale to the common experience of Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholickes lyues, both in our and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages. Let all historyes witnesse their sincere dealing, playne wordes, simple attire, frugal tables, vnfained promises, assured loue, &amp; amity, and most intier &amp; friendlye conuersation one with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Yea and the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest thinges layde to our charge, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and heretickes, are that we kepe men to much in awe, that we restrayne them to muche from carnall libertye, that we haue to muche of the crosse of Christ. <hi>Iudeis quidem scandalum, Gentibus autem stultitiam.</hi>

Christianitie is a warfare, and Chris<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tians spiritual Soldiers, their conflictes continuall, though their enemies be diuers.

And it cannot come to the ful grouthe, vnlesse it be fos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tered with the continuall showres of Martirs woundes. You are the choise captaines, whom God hath alotted to be chiefe actours in the conquest. Your veynes are conduittes, out of which he meaneth to driue the streames, that shal water his Church: he hath placed you as the fayrest and surest stones, in the forefront of his building, to delighte his friendes, and confound his enemies, with the beautie and grace of your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous lyfe and patient constancie.

For why, they vnderstand not, that in the Cage they are both surer from the kyte hauke, and fouler, then abroade, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marke they the benefitt of theire assured repayre, from harde weather and worse foode. But for a reasonable creature, and withall a Christian Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olicke so much to affecte a daungerous libertye, as not to accounte of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitt of his prison in so good a cause, it can not but be thought an imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, especiallye consideringe how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye perils of our soule are cutt of, and how highlye our spirituall welfare is ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaunced. Lett vs not in this be lyke the senselesse byrdes, but rather imitate them in an other propertye, which is, that in the cage they not onlye singe their naturall note, both sweetlyer and oftener, then abroade, but learne also diuerse other, farre more pleasant, and delightsome, So we both keepe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener practise our wonted deuotions, and besydes learne new exercises of ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue, both for our owne comfort, and

And when might you so freelye range emongest the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of Angels, as when you are seques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred from the distractions of vaine com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panye? when could you take a fuller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past of the sweete fruites of prayer and contemplation, then when the onions, garlicke, and fleshe pottes of <hi>Egipt</hi> are farthest out of sent and sight? Your eyes are not to much troubled with impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wicked sightes, your eares not annoyed with bloodye outcryes and heynous blasphemies. You are quitt from many scandals, and seuered from occasion of diuers tentations. Finallye thincke not of the name of a prison, and you shall finde it a retyringe place fittest to serue God. If it restrayne you of temporall comfortes, your bootye is gainfull, that by losse of transitorye deserue eternall. If your bodye be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised your soule is cherished, and the pyninge of the one is the pamperinge of the other. You forsake a paradyse of of poysening delightes, for a place that yeldeth cause of grounded and true so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces. Yea and as <hi>Tertullian</hi> noteth if you way from whence you came, and

Finallye more prisoners &amp; guiltye persons hath the worlde, the whole generation of mankynde, not to be iudged by the vmpiershippe of anye earthlye magistrate, but by the censure and verdicte of almighty God.

If we vse our horse to the race before we runne for the wager; If we accquaint our selues with the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons before we fighte for the victorye; Much more sholde we take heede, that we come not dispourueyed to this laste combat. The good Pylot, when he gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his shipp, he sitteth at the sterne in the hinder parte therof, and so the prouident Christian to directe his lyfe, must alwayes sit at the end of the same, that the mindfulnes of death being his sterne, he may feare it the lesse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for it the better. This is the dore wherby we must go out of bondage, &amp; therfore, as the prisoner that standeth vppon his deliuerye, taketh greatest comfort in sitting vpon the threshold, that when the dore is opened, he maye the sooner gett out: So ought we alway<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es to haue our minde fixed vppon the laste steppe of our lyfe, ouer which we are sure, that passe we muste, though how, or when we know not. For this
<pb facs="tcp:11461:121"/>
cause that holy man <hi>Ioannes Eleemosina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> Patriarke of <hi>Allexandrya</hi> hauing his Tombe in building, commaunded that it shold be lefte imperfect, and that his seruauntes euerye daye, shoulde putt him in minde to finishe the same, that hauinge hys eye alwayes fixed vppon this dore of death, he might the better prepare for the passage through it. The memorye of death is the ashes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the fire of vertue being raked vpp, it continueth the better, and wilbe fitter to enkindle the courage of our mind, that when death commeth in deede, &amp; these ashes shalbe vnraked, we maye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reioyce, that our flame hath found a vente to mount to hir natural Sphere, where it will shine to our glorye, then sorowe, that it parteth out of the chim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye of our fleshe, where it was in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be quenched with our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. It was not without cause that God likened death to a theefe. For as the theefe when hee findeth the man of the house watchinge, and vppon his garde he saluteh him in curteous sorte, and taketh vppon him the person of a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ende; but yf he finde him a sleepe, he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11461:121"/>
cruellye murdereth him, and robbeth his treasurye: So death, to those, that are prepared for it, is verye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable, and to those onlye terrible that sleepe in sinne, and are carelesse of their ende. And to these belongeth that sayinge, <hi>The deathe of the sinners is worste.</hi> Euill because it seuereth from the worlde, worse because it seuereth from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, and worste of all because it seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from God. For why; they make the worlde their Parradise, their bodye their god, and God their enemye. To suche death is hatefull, for that therin they are tormented with the panges of of the dyeing fleshe, amazed with the fittes and corrasiues of the mynd, frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the terrour of that which is to come, greeued with remorse of that which is paste. They are stunge with the gnawing of a guiltye conscience, discomforted with the rigoure of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere Iudge, annoyed with the thought of their lothsome sepulchre. And thus though death of it selfe be not bitter, yet is it bitter, to the wicked. And yet (as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> noteth) euen to them is lyfe more bitter then death.
<q>For more
<pb facs="tcp:11461:122"/>
greeuous is the liuinge to sinne, then the dyinge in sinne. For the wicked while he liueth increaseth his offence, and when he dyeth offendeth no more, and therfore by his lyfe he agumenteth his tormentes, and by his death he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeth the same. It is the feare of death, that maketh it terrible, &amp; is not in deed so greeuous to dye, as to liue in perpetuall feare, and expectation of death.<note place="margin">

They (as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayeth) bycause their desire is to be loosed, and to be with Christe, endure to liue with patience, &amp; are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye to dye with ioye. They feare not death because they feared God in lyfe. They feare not death, because they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feared lyfe; And an euil deathe,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11461:122"/>
is but the effecte of an euil lyfe. Their lyfe was a studye how to dye well, and they knew, that since death passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the veines of lyfe, it loste the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of death, and tooke the taste &amp; sweetnesse of lyfe. Neyther are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed with the fore-goinge gripes, &amp; extremityes, because they take them as the throwes of childebirth, by whiche our soule is borne out of this lothsome bodye, and brought forth to an eternal felicitye.

For to this effecte sound al

the penall lawes and statutes, this doe the examinations, araygneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, make manyfeste, wherein still the thinges punished, and condemned are, not goinge to the diuine seruice as they call it, the hearing masse, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing Priestes, vsinge the benefitt of theyr function, or acknowledginge of the authorytye of the Sea Apostolicke. In all whiche, what can we thincke is meante, but that theyre lawes, and all theyre indeuoures tende to make vs de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye oure, and receyue theyre beliefe. And therefore when we obey them in these poyntes, what doe we but that which they pretende att our handes? For if a subiect should make a lawe, that al the estates of the Realme shold leaue the obedience of theyre true Queene, and only submit them selues vnto him: And shold prescribe that in token ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they all sholde come to his Pallace, and attende there, whyle his seruantes did Pryncelye and regall homage vnto him; were not the obeying of this lawe a consente to his rebellion?

Or doe we thinke, that by forsakinge oure Queene, thoughe it were for feare of her aduersarye, we dyd not enough of our partes, to sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the mynde of his lawe, whiche was to drawe all fom her, to attende vppon himselfe: that therby shee being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of adherentes, he might dispose of her, and of her kingdome at his owne plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The lawe commaunding from the Queenes, and forcinge to her rebels obedience, are the penall lawes terrifyinge vs from the Catholycke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion, and enforcinge vs to the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycal seruice. The comminge to his Pal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lace whyle he is honoured as Kynge, is lyke the comminge to Church while heresye is sett forthe, as true religion. Now therfore is not the obeyinge the lawe of comming to theyr seruice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for feare, or loue, a sufficient sygne of our reuolte from our Queene that is the Catholyke Churche? And doe we not as muche on oure sydes, as is sufficient to fulfil her enemies desire,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:11461:171"/>
and intente? which is the forsakynge the open profession of dutye and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice due vnto her, and the attendance vppon her enemyes pleasure, that none being lefte that dare openlye withstand them, &amp; defend her, they maye worke her ouerthrow the better. Surely if in a temporall cause, this point shold come to the scanning of any seculer tribunal, the leaste faulte that the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders could be condemned of, were highe treason. And how much greater treason thinke we it is against Christe, to cooperate so directly to the ouerthrow of his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, which is not onlye his kingdome, but his mistycal bodye, and he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the Soueraygne, but the heade ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of; Whose iniuryes he accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to himselfe, as he well shewed say<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge to <hi>S.

wher-withal they are here coped. Nowe what a happye man woulde we thinke him, that with a worde mighte haue all the wealth and treasure, solace and comfort that this worlde is able to afforde: If he might be loued of whom and as much as he wolde: honoured of all: and partner of euerye mans ioye, as much as them selues: and haue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye thing in what tyme place and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it pleased him to appoynte? We see how muche anye one pleasure is prysed.

And yet what are all the content-mentes of these senses, but shadowes and dreames of delight, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sufficient to quenche sorowe, nor able to cotinue longe, nor wonne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazarde, nor ended without feare, nor lost without greefe?

But because we beinge ruled by sense, more then by vnderstandinge, conceaue not spirituall matters, but by the similitude of earthlye thinges: Lett this for the glorye of the place suffyse, that all the ornaments, delightes, and inuentions, that eyther nature hathe bredd, or arte deuised, or man imagined, shall there meet to the furniture of these roomes.
