            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> to your Liberality both the leisure and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence which I enjoy at <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lywell,</hi> I am under the greatest obligation of presenting, to your Honour, the First-fruits of my Studies, since my retirement to that Place. These Studies promoted by the encouragement of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, were often suggested to me, by the unwelcome conversation of two sorts of People, of which some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd deficient in Faith, and others, in Charity. It is not long, since, by accident, I convers'd with many who were forward enough in venting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Principles, in the way, but
<pb facs="tcp:62288:3"/>
without the accomplishments, of Mr. <hi>Hobbes:</hi> neither have I escaped the trouble of meeting with some, who, having heard of the Error, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, of an unhappy young man, committed, sometime, to my care; began to reproach my self as a favourer of such opinions. As for this rash attempt against my own good name (the prejudice, which, from thence, might be sustained in my Calling, being set apart); I could have been content to have sate down in silence under it; being ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise, rather then, deeply, to resent the loudest noise of such impertinent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers. For I had learn'd of old, and by this instance was reminded of it, how unequal Judges the vulgar are wont to be; and how very few either can, or do, examine the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Things. It sufficeth me, that I continue in the good opinion of your Lordship, and of some other very excellent persons, whose Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments seem not to be corrupted by ignorance, credulity, or, unjust suspition: and doubtless, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is to be preferr'd which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tall then broad. In the mean
<pb facs="tcp:62288:3"/>
time, it grieved me to see the Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h lye bleeding at the feet of those who had not spurned at it out of strength of Reason, but out of meer wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of humour; and I esteem'd it a piece of Religion to bear such a part as I was able in the vindication of her. In this Cause some have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready engaged, whose Learning is greater then that I should either e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual it, or give it such praise as it hath merited: and, certainly, the Pens of many others ought also to be sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and employed, against our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; that so Religion may the more, triumph over Atheism, and glory both in the streng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h and in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her Advocates; and that there may be le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>t, as little soundness in the Reputations, as there is in the Discourses, of such unreasonable men.</p>
            <p>How sound those are, of which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> hath been the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, I leave to the judgement of all persons, who have not, by any sensual course of life, receiv'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastful impressions against Religion. He hath affirmed of God that he is a bodily substance, though most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined;
<pb facs="tcp:62288:4"/>
and that he forceth evil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very wills of men. He hath fram'd a model of Government, pernicious, in its consequence, to all Nations; and injurious to the Right of his present Majesty: for he taught the people, soon after the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Royal Father, that his Title was extinguish'd when his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents were subdu'd; and that the Parliament had the Right for that very Reason, because it had posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He hath subjected the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Scripture to the Civil Powers, and taught them the way of turning the Alcoran into Gospel. He hath said it is lawful, not onely to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, but, plainly to renounce our Faith in Christ, in order to the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of persecution. His imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been infected with so strange an itch after uncertain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties in Doctrine, that he hath affronted Geometry it self, which, so well, deserveth the name of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>You see, my Lord, that the same Person, who endeavoureth to shake the Foundations of Religion, doth manage a quarrel against the very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
<pb facs="tcp:62288:4"/>
of <hi>Euclid.</hi> He hath, long ago, publish'd his Errours in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, in the English Tongue, insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating himself, by the handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his style, into the mindes of such whose Fancie leadeth their Judgements: and, to say truth of an Enemy, he may, with some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, pretend to <hi>Mastery,</hi> in that Language. Yet for this very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness in dressing his Opinions, as the matter stands, he is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; because, by that means, the poyson which he hath intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them is, with more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and danger, swallowed. Of late he hath set forth his <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> in the Latine Tongue; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his desire (as is the manner of infected persons) of spreading his Malady throughout the World.</p>
            <p>All this being considered, your Lordship will not think it strange, that I use, towards him, in some places, a little warmth in my refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which just Zeal, if he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth, Passion and Rayling, he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into a like mistake with the poor <hi>Norvegian</hi> in <hi>Balzac,</hi> who fled away from a Rose, conceiving it to be
<pb facs="tcp:62288:5"/>
Fire. Wherefore for any bitterness of style, I will not be so injurious to my own innocence as to confess it: but for the Elocution it self, I cannot but acknowledge, before so great a Master of speaking as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is known to be, that, in many places it is beneath mediocrity: yet even that imperfection serveth the Character of such a person as speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in an extempora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Dialogue; he being, now and then, at a loss for aptness or fulness of expression. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Introduction to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue, if it seemeth a little from the purpose of the ensuing Arguments, it is the more natural beginning of an occasional Conference, in which men, otherwise then in the Schools, come not immediately to the matter. And I well remember that <hi>Minutius Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> in that Dialogue, wherein he defendeth the Christian Faith against the Cavils of the Pagans, beginneth with a story of his walking towards the Sea; of his bathing, with good event, in the salt Waters; and of the little sports which Children used in making the stones dance upon the surface of the waves. That which,
<pb facs="tcp:62288:5"/>
possibly, may offend more, is the frugality of notion, wherewith I may seem to have managed some of these great Arguments; though in relation to the chief business concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter as incapable of Thinking, I have not been sparing in my words or conceptions. But your Lordship (I assure my self) knoweth well, that a man can scarce keep at distance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from the crime of <hi>Albutius</hi> the Rhetorician, who desired to speak, in every Cause, not all that was fitting, but all that he could say: That a Defender of Religion is not always bound to produce the Arguments which prove the Truth, of which the Church is always supposed in possession; but it sufficeth that he keep off Aggressors: And this (for instance) was the manner of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> Lastly, that the Book being composed in form of a Dialogue; by the largeness of my Replyes, I should have seemed guilty of the incivility of common Disputants, who endeavour to ingross the talk, and are unwilling to allow, to others, their turns of speaking. For the rest, I might alledge, with truth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb facs="tcp:62288:6"/>
by way of excuse, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Labour in the short space of the last Winter-Quarter: but the Apology it self, the great haste in those twelve Arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>les, might perhaps seem a crime and a matter of greater guilt then the errour of <hi>Ovid,</hi> who made the Sun to post through all the twelve Signes of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> in a single day. The whole, such as it is, is most humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Candor and Charity of your Lordship, of which, that it is great, I have good assurance, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Honour hath pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into the number of your depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,</p>

That if any parts of matter be perfectly at rest, then such parts of the Deity, (suppose of Gold, Lead, or Marble) are without understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thus in opposition to the Sovereign God, whose being and knowledge are no where exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, you have set up a <hi>Baal</hi> of your own, of which one part is asleep, in the depth of Rest; and the other is in a journey hurried by motion.

                  <p>In this first Endeavour (for a Reason I cannot style it) there are many things which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me absurd. You tell us that the Attribute of Incorporeal was borrowed from the Heathens, <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi>; and yet almost in the same breath, you say, that neither of them did ever write of, or mention an incorporeal spirit. You reproach us, as learning Christianity (in stead of which you ought to have used the more proper term of Natural Theology) from such Heathens; and thereby you seem to herd with that ignorant multitude, who of late decry'd all humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon pretence that it was heathenish and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, as if the Pearl of Wisdome and Reason were so besmear'd by the usage of the Heathens, as to be rendred unfit for the touch and service of a Christian Philosopher.

There are many other places in him to the same purpose; for that doctrine served his turn to confute the heresie of them that held, that Christ had no body, but was a Ghost: also of the soul he speaks as of an invisible body.

                  <p>Some perhaps might here reply, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> was a single witness, and that his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony might appear invalid, because he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of old, as an Heretick for this very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; because he was a man of a various Creed; because he was better skilled in the Laws of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, than in those of nature; at least
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62288:24"/>
that he attended not to the phylosophick conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his opinion; lastly, because to avoid his adversaries, he ran too nigh the other extreme, and would have used different weapons in another controversie. But it will be more agreeable to the reverence which we owe to that very antient and learned Writer, to explain one place in him by another, than rudely to accuse him. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be noted, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> sometimes called the passive matter by the name of body, and sometimes by body understood the meer substance, being, or essence of things. In the first sence, are those words to be expounded, which we find in his Book <hi>de AnimÃ¢.</hi>

When we consider that all perfections that are, or can be thought of, by man a second cause, are

more eminently to be ascribed to the first; and when we further conceive, that it is much better to have wisdom, power, truth, justice, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than to want them, and that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Be it so. From hence it may be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that you conceive of space, as of something without your mind, into which you suppose no notion can come but from some outward object.

You then by consequence (though in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect terms you will not grant it) conceive this space as a phantasm of something; yet not of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, seeing you have said, one body may relinquish and another possess the same immoveable space; whereby it follows, that you apprehend it as a phantasm o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Extend then your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this space indefinitely; and remember that you conceive the world without any involuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body in body, placed in it; and that it may remain in your imagination after you have by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction destroy'd the visible world; and that the imagined space is such, as you cannot disimagine; and observe at last, whether you have not attained in your own way, to some competency of fancying an infinite immaterial Being. For my self I have been apt to think of space, as a phantasm of body, really existing; and because I conceive this bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less extention, by you suppos'd an iniquity, as dull and unactive, and understand not how to deduce

from it, or apply to it, the moral perfections which appertain to the Idea of God; I therefore suspend my sentence. But the Argument presseth yourself, who distinguish the conceptions of space and body, beyond the probability of a Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

Wherefore the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> has presumed to call himself, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falsly than improperly, the servant of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, and Vicar of Christ.

For besides that the Apostolical times are but the continuation of the state begun by Christ, and that the Reign of Christ at his second coming, will be a state perfectly new, we must remember, that there were two states before the dayes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>; the one to be computed from <hi>Adam,</hi> who in

                  <p>That Angels are Spirits, is often repeated in Scripture; but by the name of Spirit, is signified both in Scripture, and vulgarly, both amongst <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> sometimes thin bodies, as the Air, the Wind, the Spirits vital, and animal, of living Creatures; and sometimes the Images that rise in the fancy in Dreams and Visions, which are not real substances, nor last any longer, than the dream or vision they appear in; which Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though no real substances, but accidents of the brain; yet when God raiseth them supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to signifie his will, they are not unproperly termed Gods Messengers, that is to say, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>

                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62288:41"/>And as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did vulgarly conceive the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magery of the brain, for things really subsistent without them, and not dependent on the fancy, and out of them framed their opinions of <hi>Daemons,</hi> good and evil; which because they seemed to subsist really, they called substances; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not feel them with their hands, incorporeal. So also the <hi>Iews</hi> upon the same ground, without any thing in the Old Testament that constrain'd them thereunto, had generally an opinion (except the Sect of the <hi>Sadducees</hi>) that those Apparitions (which it pleased God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to produce in the fancy of men, for his own service, and therefore called them his Angels) were substances not dependent on the fancy, but permanent Creatures of God; whereof those which they thought were good to them, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed the Angels of God, and those they thought would hurt them, they called evil Angels, or evil Spirits; such as was the Spirit of <hi>Python,</hi> and the Spirits of mad men, of Lunaticks and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepticks: for they esteemed such as were troubled with such diseases, <hi>Daemoniacks.</hi>

                  <p>But if we consider the places of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where Angels are mentioned, we shall find, that in most of them, there can nothing else be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the word, Angel, but some Image, raised (supernaturally) in the fancy, to signifie the presence of God, in the execution of some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural work; and therefore in the rest, where their nature is not exprest, it may be understood in the same manner. Concerning Spirits, <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Touching the incorporeal nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, I will evince the necessity of it, by proving (when we come to examine the nature of mans Soul) that matter is not capable of Cogitation. At present, I will consider your two Assertion now delivered; that the existence of Angels, as permanent substances, is not to be collected from natural Reason; and that the Writings of the Old Testament speak not in favour of such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the first, it is wont to be said, that strange presages of mind, and warnings in dreams; wonderfull effects in men snatch'd away, and mountains and buildings removed and demolished, by power invisible; real apparitions to many men at once; predictions of Oracles; confessions and exploits of Wizards, and Witches, do by natural argumentation, prove the existence of Angels: as also that these are apt instruments, to beget ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the minds of wicked men, in order to their speedy reformation.</p>

                        <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15 16.</note> that great Doctor of the Gentiles) <hi>is the Image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature; for by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities or Powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him.</hi> These words must be interpreted of Men and Angels, from the importance of the phrase in other places of St. <hi>Paul</hi>

                  <p>To argue from one sense of an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal word to the universal acceptance of it, becomes not a man of ordinary parts. <hi>Nephesh,</hi> Soul (as well as <hi>Ruach,</hi> Spirit) is a word of various signification in the Old Testament; and in many places it denotes <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Maimon. more, Nev. pa.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 41. <hi>pag.</hi> 59.</note> will, lust, or pleasure.

When the word is improperly attributed to God in Scripture, this usually is the sense of it. You would now esteem me absurd enough, if I went about to infer from hence, either that the essence of the Soul consisteth in Will and Pleasure, or that the Deity had a Soul, that is Life, that is Motion: The Soul being the spring of bodily life in man, it might by an easie Metonymie, be used (as in the recited places) in expressing Life. In that place where the Blood is call'd the Soul or Life; it was not the design of <hi>Moses</hi> to set forth Philosophically, the inward essence of a Beast; but to let the people understand, that the blood of a Beast, which was sprinkled upon the Altar, being an embleme of the life of Man forfeited through disobedience, and an instrument in expiation, they should abstain out of rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

                  <p>This exposition of Light by the crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the parts, though it be not wholly to be rejected, yet may it (I think) be rendred suspicious for a time, by that which deserves, at least, the name of a puzzling Objection. Let us then suppose unto our selves, such a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as is surrounded with Eyes: for in every point of enlightned space, and at all times there may be Vision.

Of this, you can have no Sensation, because there is no Object to press into the Brain. You have no proper Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; for, of Nothing there is no Image. But you have an Idea, or Perception, or in your own word, a Phantasm of it: This Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm (by an Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi>) over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the opinion of Imagining, or Fancying Matter, whilst it ariseth from the Negation or Privation of it.

Besides, we may consider, that in the Sentient-Body, each part of it has either the apparence of the whole Image, or of a Part. If, of the whole, then seeing every part of Body is Body, and the smallest atom we can see is resolved further into its parts, and those into their parts without end; it will follow thence, that we shall have an apparence not of one only Sun,

whole <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> or in the Spirits, after the Object of Sight is removed, whose presence occasioned a more stiffe Pressure. We see the like in extended and moved Nets and Ropes, and a thousand other Examples in Art and Nature: but this trembling in them, as also in such Machins where the Motion may be more entirely and longer imprisoned, does soon vanish. Whereas the Re-action must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main extreamly long, in such Men (for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance), who at the seventieth year remember most perfectly, and will repeat with pleasure the passages of their School-play; even those who retain not the things more newly passed. To tell how this can be explained by the meer Mechanism of the Brain, which has received many millions of changes in it self, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions occasion'd from the Objects of every Hour, requires a more skilful <hi>Oedipus</hi> than has yet pretended to unriddle the Secrets of Humane Nature.

                  <p>It is then, impossible to remember, seeing the Motion, in passing to the heart, and in being in the heart, whilst it is dilated in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving blood from the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in forcing what is receiv'd into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body, (for the vulgar Systole is the Diastole of the Heart, and <hi>vice versa</hi>) must needs be either communicated to other parts already in Motion, or encreased by the receit of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from such infinite parts of blood justling with it, or at least, varied once and again in its determinations, rebounding often from divers terms: wherefore it must be suppos'd to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; not properly indeed, seeing no Motion is lost any other way than money is said to be lost when it passeth from one Gamster to another, but to all the intents and purposes of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the Object; which, to awaken a new Sensation, must come into the Brain by a new Impulse. So that Motion in the Blood, from the Impression of an outward Object, is like that of water, by a stone cast in; it is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from one circle to another, 'till at length it passeth undiscerned into a foreign sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>But it is time to hasten our pace in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Controversie. In which, I could not, to say truth, have been very brief, if I had but made a short rehearsal of the very heads of

such Arguments as overthrow the Doctrine of Thinking Matter.</p>
                  <p>Let us then, pass by these lower powers of Sense, and Fancy, and Memory; and consider the more advanced faculty of Reason; and here we shall perceive, by the manner of Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal working, that Reason is a power superiour to Imagination, and much more to all the causality of corporeal pressure.

When we think of a Triangle, we not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand a figure comprehended by three lines, but also we have a Perception, or Image of those three lines in our Brain; and that is Imagination. But when we think of a Figure of a thousand Angles, we as perfectly, by our Reason understand, that it consists of a thousand sides, as we perceive the other to consist of three; but we cannot imagin those thousand Sides and Angles after the same manner that we did the three; that is, behold them as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly pictur'd in our Brain, as present in a Phantasm. And although, by reason of the custom which we have gotten of imagining something as often as there is mention made of a corporeal subject, we may perhaps represent to our selves some confused figure at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foresaid figure named; yet it is plain, that this is not the image of a figure of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand sides and Angles, because it is in nothing differing from that Image of a Figure which should represent to my self, in thinking of a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62288:61"/>
Figure with a myriad of Sides and Angles, or of any other of very many Sides; neither doth it conduce at all to the understanding of those proprieties whereby a figure of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Angles differs from other very Polygo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Figures.</p>
                  <p>Again, to proceed in order, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make it evident, beyond all just excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the power of Reasoning, in the acts of simple Appreh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> In the Acts of simple Apprehension, our Reason, exercised in Notions purely Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or Metaphysical, has Ideas which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged from all Corporeal Matter.

                  <p>I affirm not, that there is such an exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Being as Man in general; yet that, there is such an abstracted notion of Man, or Manhood, all Circumstances of Individuation laid aside, is manifest; seeing it is not a true and proper Predication to say, a Man is <hi>Socrates</hi>: and therefore the notion reacheth beyond a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and therefore is not an impulse from Sense, whose Objects are all singular.

Schools, of non-sense and deceit; into which, if you had enter'd with apprehension, this back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door to Atheism had never bin set open by you.</p>
                  <p>Further, To take you a short lesson out of <hi>Ramus,</hi> a Man who understood the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and yet despis'd not, though he reformed Logick: The Invention of Arguments, shews Reason to be above the Laws of Matter. For, the Arguments in his first part of Logick; (that is, Topicks apt to argue or declare the relation of one thing to another; as (<hi>Virgil</hi> in the fourth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> says, Fear does argue dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Minds) such as are Cause, Effect, Subject, Adjunct, and the like; being used here, not to find out the nature of single Beings (which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to Natural Philosophy, Medics, and other Sciences) nor to interpret Names (which appertains to Grammar) but only as places declaring the mutual <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> or habitudes of one thing to another, which may be related divers ways; they cannot possibly arise from the single and absolute motions of sense. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, now, that I am so busie in the first Elements of Logick, seeing your own miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit about the art of Reasoning, is a manifest relapse into the Ignorance of a second Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and sheweth a necessity of your returning to <hi>Oxford</hi> anew.</p>
                  <p>Again, if we consider Reason in the framing of Propositions, we find that we connect and disjoyn Subjects and Predicates, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and refer them; we say, this appertains to the other, or it does not; it is equal to it, or unequal; like, or unlike; which being acts
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62288:63"/>
of Relation, cannot wholly arise from any thing pressing into the Brain from without, which must be some single and absolute Object; but from the meer efficacy of an Incorporeal mind. It is impossible that the Sentient by meer Motion should connect or compare one Image with another. For, a divers Phantasm is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Motion; and supposing they remain, the Motion is in a divers part: seeing, the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms or divers Motions would be confounded, if in the same part of the Brain, they should conspire. If then there be one Phantasm in one part, and a second in another, by what imaginable power can they confer? For, if any part gives its Motion to the other, or receives from it; the Motion, that is the Phantasm of it, is, by so doing, changed. I may here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, that, without the Anticipation of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions in the mind, it is a difficult matter to understand, how we can be capable of Sense or Fancy, unless we first know what it is to know, and have some antecedent rules whereby to judg of receiv'd Images.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, in deriving Consequences, in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or shorter trains of coherence, reason shews it self to be an immaterial faculty: For if two Images cannot, as hath bin prov'd, be aptly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected by Imagination and Memory, supposed Mechanical; Reason, surely, which ranketh all Beings into their distinct Orders and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies; and connecteth myriads of such Ideas as have no Phantasm appertaining to them, must be divine. Images and Thoughts are produced in us in much disorder, by reason
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62288:63"/>

                  <p>Again, Reason, by the drawing of divers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, correcteth Sense; which, though it doth not properly deceive, (being such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception as naturally ariseth from such a pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and such a disposed Organ) yet would it leave us for ever in Ignorance, if our Reason did not convince us, that the Object is not adequately represented by the Image. In Sense, Imagination, or Memory, one of the fixed Starrs seems not bigger than that in the Badg of the Order of the Garter: the Image is no greater, the Motion of no further force; and therefore Reason, which by consequences in Astronomy, infers that it is bigger than the Earth, is something much superior to Motion derived from the Object.</p>

If men be carryed on in all their Circumstances, by the mighty torrent of irresistible Motion; their iniquities, and the dishonours due unto them, are chargable upon the source and spring of Motion. If Men are necessitated to act or omit, as also to will or to

refuse, then Exhortations unto such Duties as they perform not, are bitter taunts, and like commands to a Criple to rise up and walk; and punishment for such evils as they commit, is a cruel usage; and a declaration against Sin, as hated by the first Cause, (who cannot be thought in earnest to detest his own workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship); and as the default of Man (who is asked in Scripture why he will die? whilst his very Will to die, is by you supposed fatal) is imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mockery, and unworthy deceit.

                  <p>The difference is heavenly-wide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt bare Permission, and that Will which you have fancied in Almighty God; a Will <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Lev. p.</hi> 108.</note> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with such a disposal of all things, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth a necessity in Man's Will of doing Gods. For no Man ever could imagin (your self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) that bare Permission should have the influence of a necessary Cause; whereas such influence is ascrib'd, by you, to the Will of God. It appeareth by the Revelation which God hath made to Man, that he does so will Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that it would be more pleasing to him for Man to obey, than to remain perverse; yet not in such a manner, that he compelleth him to become his subject by active compliance: for that were to unmake Man as such, that is, as a creature endu'd with a free Will. When God saith of his Vineyard, which made not such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of fruitfulness as were proportion'd to his cultivation of it, that he could do no more for it than he had done; he declared plainly that he used such means as were consistent with a liberty in Man of neglecting or misimpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them: And the exercise of this liberty in sinning he permitteth, in regard to Man's free
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62288:70"/>
free nature, and because he can, not only cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise him for his delinquency, but likewise, by his Methods and infinite wisdom, bring good out of it. There being then in God, in many cases, a Conditional Will, that will, without the rescinding of any law of Man's uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd Election, is always done, either by the obedience of Man, or by the vindication of abused mercy in the correction of a stubborn sinner. And thus we have seen how injurious your Doctrine of Necessity, hath been to the just honour of the most Holy Will of God. It is, also, manifest that by the same way, I will not call of reason, but of bold asseveration, you upbraid all Laws, whereby any punishment is inflicted upon Malefactors, of most rigorous and unreasonable procedure; and thereby, after dishonour done to God, you vilisie his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents. For, why is the Scourge or Brand, the Rope, or Fire; the Press, Axe, or Bullet, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for those Men, who do not, by their own free choice and power, lay open the fence which Authority hath set down; but are hurried through it by a foreign violence, against which it is in vain to struggle? Sword and Pistol, or whatsoever is an instrument in the violation of the Law, or safety of Man, is as guilty as Man himself, and with indignation to be broken in pieces; if Man be unavoidably and fatally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged (as in a Puppet-play) by a foreign hand, discern'd only by you who pretend to see with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Curtain. I remember to have read, that <hi>Draco,</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> made a Law, whereby the very Instruments of Homicide were punish'd. And the Sons of him that perished by the fall

                  <p>It is in you absurd to mention Liberty even in relation to God himself; because, by ascribing to him a Material Nature, you assign him no Motions but such as arise from Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal compulsion.â€”But, upon what account is it said by you, that the Omnipotence of God must be obstructed by the grant of an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd liberty in Man? It is not, that I know of, affirm'd by any Disputant, that there is such a lawless Liberty in Man, as is not under sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the absolute Power of God, but that it is a Liberty which God Almighty, in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableness to the free nature of Man, hath been pleas'd to grant; and for the greater part to suffer in the exercise of it. Only it is said concerning sin, that God cannot force the Will of Man to the commission of it: for, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of such a wretched Issue, would argue, not omnipotency, but impotence and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the parent of it. God created Man, and gave a Law to him; and design'd not to use his Almighty Power to effect the fulfilling of that Law; which Power supposeth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Law to be in vain. He therefore that interposeth not his Power whilst he may, hath not his Power disanulled when his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive Will is only withstood, and he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that disobedience.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62288:73"/>
from necessitation, might frustrate and make not to come to pass; and God should either not foreknow it, and not decree it; or he should foreknow such things shall be, as shall never be, and decree that which shall never come to pass.</p>

                  <p>Touching the Decees of God, it cannot be proved that they extend to all things which come to pass. For his Prescience I'm sure, that it extendeth to all things possible to be known, and that it hath no necessary influence upon the Event; it doth neither hinder the Power of God, nor the Liberty of Man.

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>oreseeth it; but the necessity ariseth from the supposition of the infallibility, and not from any causal energy, of divine foreknowledg. It is manifest by the fulfilled Prophesies of divers inspired Men, that there is Prescience; and a man may also be assured, that neither is his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty intringed by it, nor Prescience by his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. It is evident to every Man, in many cases, (as evident as that he perceiveth at all or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth) that he willeth or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>efuseth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any constraint upon his freedom. But there is great difficulty in unridling the manner of the consistence of Foreknowledg and Liberty; because, although there be some notion, yet there is not a knowledg, fully comprehensive of the Divine Wisdom, in a finite Soul. Thus much, notwithstanding, may, with sobriety be offer'd towards the explication of this mysterious truth; that the boundless wisdom of God who made the World, understanding the Laws
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62288:73"/>
and Operations of his Workmanship from the beginning to the end of them, understandeth also the nature of all appearances in all Objects in relation to the mind of Man, in every Estate wherein he is placed, and at all times, together with the dispositions of each Man's Soul, and thereby foreseeth what he will refuse or chuse, whilst he had power (absolutely speaking) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise either to elect or reject. He that should drop a piece of money, by an undiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hand, in the way of a man afflicted with extream poverty; the same person might readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foresee, that the espied money would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly be taken up by that poor man, though he could not but understand that the Beggar had so much power over his own limbs, as not to stoop unless he pleased.</p>
                  <p>But it seemeth not worth the time and pains to reconcile to your apprehension, the Doctrins of Foreknowledg, and undetermin'd Liberty; because this Objection is by you, proposed, in order to the amusing of other Men's Reasons rather than in justification of the Truth, For, according to your Principles, all evidence or knowledg ariseth from Objects already in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Neither understand you this of Essence in the Sense of the Metaphysick-Schools, but of the actual presence of caused Objects.</p>

                  <p>In my Opinion <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib. &amp; Nec. p.</hi> 16.</note>, Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is Knowledg, and Knowledg depends on the existence of things known, &amp; not they on it.</p>
                  <p>However, the Objection serveth for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoding of those who maintain another sort of Foreknowledg; but the argument on which I establish my Doctrine is of another kind.</p>

The same also is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary cause: For, if it be possible that a sufficient cause shall not bring forth the effect, then there wanteth somewhat which was needful to the producing of it, and so the Cause was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; but if it be impossible that a sufficient Cause should not produce the Effect, then is a sufficient Cause a necessary Cause; (for that is said to produce an Effect necessarily, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but produce it.) Hence it is manifest, that whatsoever is produced is produced necessarily, for whatsoever is produced hath had a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cause to produce it, or else it had not been; and therefore also, voluntary actions are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated.</p>

                  <p>In the alterations made in Bodies, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sufficient is an efficient Cause, by reason that matter sufficiently moved cannot stay it self, but is wholly determin'd by foreign impulse; which impulse also had an undefeated deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. But because I have proved the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of an Immaterial Soul, I may affirm that all outward preparations being made, so that there remaineth nothing wanting but the Act of Volition; the Spiritual Mind not being overcome by the sway of Matter, hath a power to abstain from acting, though perhaps it is not pleased to use it. And this we may illustrate by the Example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whose Fire, &amp; Wood, and Son to be a Victim, and Sacrificing-knife, were in a readiness and sufficient strength, with these, to execute the Command which God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, by way of trial, had given to him: yet
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62288:74"/>
who can doubt that <hi>Abraham</hi> had a power, at the same time, to render these preparations useless, and to be disobedient? For, how could those Objects and this Command conveigh a force into his Will, and thence into his Arm, to slay his Son? though they might present him with a reason which the goodness of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position would not refuse: The intention of <hi>Abraham</hi> to slay his Son was wrought by a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and not a Physical, or Natural Power.</p>

For, seeing it was thrown, it had a beginning, and consequently a sufficient cause to produce it, consisting partly in the Dice, partly in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, as the posture of the parts of the hand, the measure of force applied by the Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the posture of the parts of the Table, and the like: In sum, there was nothing wanting which was necessarily requisite to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of that particular Cast, &amp; consequently the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62288:75"/>
Cast was necessarily thrown; for if it had not been thrown, there had wanted somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to the throwing of it, and so the cause had not been sufficient.</p>

                  <p>Here you make instance in an Event resulting from Circumstances of Bodies, and from Physical motion: in relation to which I have already granted, that a sufficient is an efficient Cause; and declar'd the reason of it; and how it toucheth not the present business. But by this last Answer I begin to understand that you obtrude a Sophism upon me, instead of a real Argument. For, whilst you say, that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient is the same which necessary, and that if the Cast had not been thrown, there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting; you include, in your sufficient Cause, when you speak of Man, the very act of Volition, besides all the furniture prepared for that act: And then your meaning amounts to this, that when there is each thing needful, and no impediment, and also a Will to act, the effect followeth. But here you beg the Question, which is this; Whether, all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to action being present, the will and act of Volition excepted, the Soul hath not a power to forbear that Act? and whilst you suppose a removal of impediments, and the presence of all things necessary, and the act of the Will also; and then say, the Cause is sufficient and efficient too, you say no more, than that a Man produceth necessarily, an effect, whilst he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth it; which indeed is a truth, (for he cannot act and not act at the same time) but in the present Controversie it is an egregious Impertinence. For, the Necessity which you
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62288:76"/>
speak of, is not in the Will it self, or in the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but in that consequence which the mind createth, by supposing that the Will compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the means, and that, whilst it chuseth, it cannot but chuse. Wherefore this fallacy is like to theirs, who say, the Will is necessarily determin'd by the last act of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, meaning, because it is the last: they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the last act, and that the Will closeth with the Understanding, and then they say, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth upon necessity: which is no more than to affirm, that there is nothing later than the last. And if I am not impos'd upon by my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, you somewhere argue <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>From this equality of ability, ariseth equality of hope in the attaining of our ends. And therefore if any two Men, desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become Enemies; and in the way to their end (which is principally their own conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and sometimes their Delectation only) endeavour to destroy or subdue one another.

For, we compare Family to Family, and not to a vast Empire, against whose mighty numbers, it is in vain to make resistance: For, if want of strength doth render a Family no Commonwealth, than by the same reason, the Republicks of <hi>Athens, Corinth, Lacedaemon,</hi> and the rest, were properly no Republicks, because they were but so many weak and little Members, compar'd to the vast Body of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Empire.</p>
                  <p>But, further: Were every man supposed loose, even from the yoke of Paternal Government, yet in such a state, there would be place, for the Natural Laws of good and evil.</p>

A man who being bound hand and foot, has a fatal knife put to his throat (in which case the Power is irresistible in respect of his body, as much as if it were omnipotence) such a one cannot help himself; but he may judge without either falshood or partiality, that if in that manner he is butchered, without regard to any crime, the practice is both cowardly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful.

was the second knot dissolved: and almost at the same time, the power was taken also from the Presbyterians: and so we are reduced to the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie of the Primitive Christians, to follow</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>every man as he liketh best: which, if it be without contention, and without measuring the doctrine of Christ, by our affection to the person of his Minister (the fault which the Apostle reprehended in the</hi> Corinthians) <hi>is perhaps the best.</hi> Wherefore speak no more of your reverence for Episcopacy, whilst you have cryed hail to it, and yet betraid it: neither is it for you to pretend to loyalty, who, when one asked what was the price of a Roman pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, amidst a Discourse of our civil Warres, (whilst his thoughts were guided by a train, from, our Warres, to the delivering of the King, from that to the delivering of Christ, from that to the thirty pence received by <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and from that to the value of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man penny) call'd this, in Print, <note n="a" place="margin">

For thus, Society is like a State of Nature, and all is managed still by force, notwithstanding the formalities of transferring Right by Pacts, and every man is to stand no longer to his bargain, when he can break it to his advantage: And thus, the Prince is always in a state of danger, because he cannot be, a day secure, of remaining upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most; seeing the people are taught by you, to believe that the right of Authority is a deceit, and that every one would have as good a title, if he had as long a sword: For the many-headed Beast will throw the Rider when he burthens and galls them, having no check of inward Law. For the Prince has but the strength of a single man, and the people can't confer irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible Power, unless when they lift up their hands on high, they can give up their nerves, and muscles, and spirits, as well as testifie their present approbation. Wo to all the Princes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, if this doctrine be true, and becometh popular: if the multitude believe this, the Prince, not armed with the scales of the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan,</hi> that is, with irresistible power, can never be safe from the Spears and Barbed irons, which their ambition and presumed interest will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62288:93"/>
and their malice will sharpen, and their passionate violence throw against him. If the Beast, we speak of, come but to know its own strength, it will never be managed: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such as own these pernicious doctrines, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to all Societies of men, may be said to have Wolves heads, as the Laws of old were wont to speak concerning excommunicated Persons; and are like those ravenous beasts, so far from deserving our love and care, that they ought to be destroyed at the common charge. What you have written three times over, in your <hi>de cive, de corpore politico,</hi> and <hi>Leviathan,</hi> ought rather to be esteemed seeds of sedition, then Elements of government and societie: the Principles of the Zelots amongst the Papists (who obey a Forrein Power against the King) are not consistent with the government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; yet, like the Elements in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> they are not burthensome in their proper place of <hi>Italy</hi>: but of such large infection is the doctrine, that it will endanger the life of the Common-wealth, wheresoever it is entertained in the consequences of it.</p>

                  <p>In some things you are just to the Praerogative of Kings; but in others, you ought to have remembred the words of our Lord, who adviseth us to give to <hi>Caesar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caesars,</hi> and unto God the things that are Gods.

The absolute Princes of <hi>Syracuse</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Tyrants, though some of them deserved the title of Benefactors: and amongst our selves, the best of Kings was branded with that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious character.

But being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, after the Kings Martyrdom, and his Sons exile, it served the purposes of those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who had then the <hi>Militia</hi> in their hands. For you say <note n="a" place="margin">Lev. p. 102.</note> that the Rights of a Common-wealth by acquisition, are the same with those, by Institution or Succession: That the power of the Representative (whether in one or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) cannot without consent be transferr'd, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, accus'd, punish'd: and that such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is Supreme Judge.

                  <p>But notwithstanding all this, what you seem to build up on the side of the Soveraign, you pull down on the side of the People.

                  <p>Be it also observed, that those Books which are called <hi>Apocrypha</hi> were left out of the Canon, not for inconformity of Doctrine with the rest, but <hi>onely</hi> because they are not found in the Hebrew.</p>

                  <p>Here, again, you erre: for by the same Reason, some part which is contained in the Canon, should have been, of old, excluded. For instance, the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> is partly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Hebrew, and partly written in Caldee; for <hi>Daniel</hi> had learnt that Tongue in <hi>Babylon</hi> by the command of the King. Neither are all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal Books to be thought not written in Hebrew; for that excellent Book of the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> as is manifest by his Preface to it, was a translation out of the Hebrew Copy of his Grand-father <hi>Iesus.</hi> The Reason why such Books were not received by the Jews into the Canon, was not what you suggest, but because they seem'd not written by that kinde of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie which they called <hi>Ruach Hakko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desh</hi>

                  <p>It is plain to those who are versed in the Monuments of the Church, that the Books of the New Testament were declared Canon very early, though the precise time and place be not so easily known. Upon the Enumeration made in the Apostolick Canons, we rely not; not because that Book is to be esteemed wholly spurious; but because this Enumeration is made in the eighty fourth Canon.

For a Law is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of that Man, or Assembly, to whom we have given Soveraign Authority, to make such Rules for the direction of our Actions, as he shall think fit; and to punish us when we do any thing contrary to the same.

That which concerns Polygamy hath (I know) bin doubted; yet (as it seemeth to me) without reason: for when our Saviour said <note n="c" place="margin">S <hi>Luke</hi> 16.18.</note> that he who putteth away his wife and marrieth another, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Adultery; he plainly forbad plurality of wives at the same time; which if it had bin allowed, the man might have taken more then another to him, without sin. Here then the Law of perfection hath bound us, where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

seemeth to have left us at liberty. Now seeing these Institutions are the will of Christ, and that Christ hath made sufficient promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of them to millions of men, and that he is King of kings, and Lord of lords, and that he hath annexed to them the greatest rewards and punishments to secure them from violation; it is evident that these are sufficient Laws, both without and against the Civil Sanction. For to say that the Princes of the Earth are Superior to Christ, is a Blasphemy of such altitude, that the ninetieth degree being cut, we can scarce take the heighth of it. What maketh a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Law, but a Superiour Power, declaring his Will in some particular instances, to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd?

Our subordination to Christ obligeth us to the performance of his revealed will, which is, for that reason, Law. And because he chooseth to rule us, rather with a Scepter of Righteousness, then an iron Rod, we are, by that, the more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged, and not at liberty from obedience. You ought, therefore, to have said, not that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of our Saviour were not Laws, but that the Civil Soveraign may lay a further obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon his Christian subjects, (as those that make a vow of Chastity, do, upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) by making them become his Laws.

Theodosianus</hi>; not having thereby, first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but doubled their obligation. But this string of errour runneth through the whole body of your <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that, without apparent force, there is no Law. And this is the chief ground of your irreverent and false Doctrine, against the Power of the Christian Church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a visible society professing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Cross, and hath not of it self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal co-active Power, but, by virtue of the Commission of Christ as King, layeth spiritual obligation upon men, (and thereby is consistent with the Civil Empire, in which it is,) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you deny unto the Church the right either of making or declaring Laws <note n="c" place="margin">Lev. <hi>p.</hi> 171.</note> as if there were not onely a quibble but a truth, in the meaning of the Frontispiece of your <hi>Leviathan,</hi> which compares the Canons of the Convocation, to those of the temporal Militia; and that they could not properly have that name, unless they had Powder, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and Fire, (external force) attending on them. It is plain enough (and you your self do own it) that after the Ascension <note n="d" place="margin">Lev. <hi>p.</hi> 267.</note> of our Lord, the Power Ecclesiastical, was in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; and after them, in such as were by them ordained to preach the Gospel, and to convert men to Christianity, and to direct them that were converted in the way of Salvation; and after these, the Power was delivered again to others by these ordained. But how this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power, in the Administration of Spiritual Affairs in Christ's Kingdom; in ordaining Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors; in celebrating the Eucharist; in loosing

and binding; in admitting members into this Spiritual but visible society by Baptisme (which is a proof both of the Society and its Power) how all this (I say) was derived on the person of <hi>Constantine,</hi> who was neither Ordained, nor (as some tell us) baptized till his death; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth greater skill to explain, then I dare yet pretend to: he therefore rather gave outward aids and succours, then true Authority and Right to the Doctrines and Commandments of his Soveraign Jesus. Which things being well consider'd, you ought not to have ascrib'd (as somewhere you have done) the very rights of the Priestly Function to the Civil Powers. <hi>Grotius,</hi> who has not had thanks from all for his liberality to the Civil Magistrate in relation to the Affairs of the Church, hath yet made it his whole designe (in the second Chapter of his Book <hi>De Imperio summarum potestatum circa Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra</hi>) to make it manifest, that Authority about Holy things, and the Sacred Function, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct. In the same person they may be (as in <hi>Anius</hi> the King and Priest of <hi>Phoebus</hi>) but not without Ordination. For the Power depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon our Lords Commission, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd but by Succession, through the hands of the Commissioned. Our thirty seventh Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, doth attribute to the King a Power of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rule in Ecclesiastical matters, yet granteth not to him either the ministring of Gods Word, or of the Sacraments. And under the Law, it was said unto <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King <note n="a" place="margin">2 Chron. 26.18, 19, &amp;c.</note> It pertaineth not unto thee <hi>Vzziah</hi> to burn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense unto the Lord, but to the Priests, the sons

                  <p>In this reply, which toucheth not the proposed difficulty, you run out into two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd suppositions. First, that a Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate sheddeth the bloud of an Heathen for not frequenting the Christian Assemblies: next, that there is a parity of reason in the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Christian, and of a Mahometan; and that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> may as much oblige the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as the Testament of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>But I must again ask you, what you <note n="g" place="margin">Lev. <hi>p.</hi> 272.</note> will say of all those Martyrs we read of in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Church? I hope you will not say that they have needlesly cast away their lives. Their bloud hath been more truely the seed of the Christian Church, then the opinion of Ghosts, Ignorance of second causes, Devotion towards what men fear, and taking of things casual for Prognosticks, have ever been (as you affirm) the seeds of natural Religion,

                     <note n="a" place="margin">Lev. <hi>p.</hi> 54.</note> which is generated out of the inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive temper of men, who, by observing any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent effect, are naturally led to search out the cause, and so proceed to the first Original. The Martyrs (I say) did, under Christ, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Christian Faith, which if it had not been professed with the mouth, would have dy'd away, as a spark where no breath doth cherish it. Their memory is precious in the Church of God, and their names will be had in everlasting remembrance. They have been thought <note n="b" place="margin">See Mr. Mede's <hi>works, p.</hi> 944.</note> to have the priviledge of rising first, and, in that sence, to have a part in the first Resurrection.

                  <p>For answer hereunto <note n="d" place="margin">Lev. <hi>p.</hi> 272.</note>, we are to distinguish the persons that have been for that Cause put to death; whereof some have received a Calling to preach, and profess the Kingdom of Christ openly; others have had no such Calling, nor more has been required of them then their own Faith. The former sort, if they have been put to death, for bearing witness to this point, that Jesus Christ is risen from the dead, were true Martyrs; for a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr is, (to give the true definition of the word)
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62288:115"/>
a witness of the Resurrection of Jesus the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which none can be but those that conversed with him on earth, and saw him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was risen: for a witness must have seen what he testifieth, or else his testimony is not good. And this is manifest from <hi>Acts</hi> 1.21, 22. of these men which have companyed with us-must one be a Martyr (that is, a Witness) with us of his Resurrection. Where we may observe that he which is to be a witness of the truth of the Resurrection of Christâ€”must beâ€”one of his Original Disciples: whereas they which were not so, can witness no more, but that their Antecessors said it, and are therefore but witnesses of other mens Testimony; and are but second Martyrs, or Martyrs of Christs wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>

                  <p>By this answer, wherein you approve of the Martyrdom of the Apostles, you grant unto me what I contend for, and contradict your former doctrine. For if the Apostles, drawing temporal deaths upon themselves, by preaching the Gospel, when they were enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to desist, by the Civil Powers, are to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by us, and honour'd, for such resistance unto bloud; then there was given to them a Superiour Law by Christ, by the vertue of which higher obligation they were free from active duty to the Civil Powers: otherwise, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Law, they had opposed the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, they had been pernicious Rebels, and not honourable Defenders of the Faith.

What you add concerning the word Martyr, is a weak nicety of Grammar, upon which the stress of this Cause doth not depend. For the Question is not, whether no man be properly call'd a Witness but an eye-witness, or he who beareth testimony of report received at second or third hand, but whether, at any distance of time, a man may not have sufficient ground to believe the Gospel; and whether, after the hearty belief of it, he may with his mouth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it out of a tender regard to flesh and bloud.</p>
                  <p>To proceed in this Argument; there is yet remaining another objection, to which, I know not what answer can be by you returned. It is the Argument used by St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> to the Rulers of the people and Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> when, by menaces, they urg'd them to desist from the propagation of the holy Gospel: <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be right</hi> (said those Apostles) <hi>in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more then unto God, judge ye</hi>

                  <p>You have by this means, so very much allayed the heat of the everlasting burnings (so far as it can be done by confidence in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that they are rendred almost as tolerable as a death by fire on earth.

                  <p>God hath so given such gifts to all, whom he will severely account with, that they are left without apology. And he will not seem an hard Master, if we have as due a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Majesty and Goodness, both abused by us; and to our own means, and wilful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal of the better part, whilst he hath set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us life and death; as we are wont to have to our own flesh and bloud; seeing nothing burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Hell (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> noted) besides the proper will of man.</p>
                  <p>But why to you of all men should this seem hard? For you believe that the irresistible power of God, as such, doth justifie all things;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62288:119"/>
and <note n="a" place="margin">Lev. <hi>p.</hi> 187.</note> that the right of afflicting men at his pleasure, belongeth naturally to God Almighty; not as Creator and gratious; but as omnipotent.</p>
                  <p>This irresistible Power is urged by you, where it serveth your Hypothesis; and where it yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no advantage to your Cause, there you will have Mercy to succeed in its place. And this may be, more particularly observed, in a Section of your Book <hi>De Cive</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">De Cive <hi>c.</hi> 4 <hi>p.</hi> 69. Sect. 9.</note>. To the sixth Law of Nature (saith that Book) which teacheth that punishments respect the future, belong all those places of Holy Writ, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the shewing of Mercy; such as are (<hi>Matt.</hi> 5.7.) <hi>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</hi> Lev. 19.18. <hi>Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people.</hi> Now there are who think this Law so far from being confirmed, that they imagine it invalidated by the Scriptures: because there remaineth to the wicked eternal punishment after death, where there is no place either for amendment or example. Some resolve this objection, by saying, that God, who is under no obligation, referreth all things to his own Glory; but that it is not lawful for man so to do: as if God would seek his glory, that is to say, please himself in the death of a sinner. It is more rightly answer'd, that the institution of eternal punishment was before sin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected this onely, that men might, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be afraid of sinning.</p>
                  <p>It is, from this place, to be observed, that you once construed the phrases of Scripture, wherein it speaketh of eternal torments, with
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62288:120"/>
relation to the persons, and not the mere state of torture; as also that you here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance not power, but plead for Mercy; and lastly, that you abuse the veracity of God, by supposing him to scare the children of men, with such bug-bear threatnings, as shall never, upon their most enormous delinquencie, be put in execution.</p>
                  <p>But in what horrid place, and of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding quality, are the future torments, if they be not, to single persons eternal? for I cannot but imagine that they are extreamly bitter, if they be but short. What then seemeth to you to be the place and state of the damned?</p>

confounding the sense of those several verses, which are to be interpreted apart from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Wherefore in the begining of his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he setteth down his raw apprehensions: and he relateth, in the first and second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, how he, once, thought folly equal with wisdom, and that there was nothing better then to eat and drink; and what adventures and trials he made, towards the better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what was good for the sons of men: and in this third Chapter, he declareth how full of mystery he found the workes of God (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) and how little was manifest, especially to sensual men, of the future state: but in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh and twelfth Chapters, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth his advanced judgement, and calleth men off from the world, to the thoughts of the day of account, and to the early remembrance of their Creator; to the fear of God, and the observance of his commands; he layeth it down as a positive doctrine (a doctrine apt to promote such observance, fear, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) which at first was delivered, by him, as a probleme, or as the mistake of worldly men, that when the wheel shall be broken at the Cistern, and the circle of our blood utterly

                  <p>But if the Spirit be the breath and life, and not an immaterial substance, why make you it so hard to know what becomes of it; so that only God can understand it? for might we not say, that the machine of the body is dissolved, the breath vanisheth in the soft air, the motion is gone from the carcasse into ambient bodies? we might then, with equal admiration say of a Clock broken all to peices, and in rest; God knoweth what is become of it; for, in both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, there is only a dissolution of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of the parts, and the motion, convey'd to other portions of neighbouring matter.</p>
                  <p>Why, also, do you vary from the translation of the Hebrew copy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in Chap. 3. v. 21. for instead of, <hi>Who knoweth the spirit of man that is ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the Spirit of the beast that goeth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the earth?</hi> You have thus rendred the words; <hi>Who knoweth that the spirit of man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upward?</hi> for there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this saying, Who knoweth that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is a Mathematician? and this, Who knoweth Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> who is a Mathematician?

                  <p>If you attempt, thus, to explain the resurrection of entire man, you will be pressed with such a weighty inconvenience, as cannot, by the utmost strength of your wit, be ever sustained.

                  <p>That <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had remained obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, should have lived eternally upon earth, together with all the race of men to have been produced out of his loyns (to whom this earth would, at last, have denyed Elbow-room) is a conceit of yours which reason doth not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. For the first man was of the earth earthy, he was sustained by corruptible food; he was design'd for propagation before his fall; which things seem to argue a mortal nature, and are, by our Saviour, excepted from the condition of those who shall enjoy eternal blessedness. And though it was said to him, that in eating the forbidden fruit he should dye the death; that argueth thenceforth a necessity of dying and denyeth not a capableness of dying formerly: and though God Almighty could have sustain'd his mortal nature for ever upon earth, yet there is (as I think) no promise of it in Holy Writ: and whilst we consider the future estate of blessed men, described in Scripture; there is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62288:132"/>
some reason for us to believe, that he should have rather been translated to an Heavenly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, then to have dwelt, for ever, in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> below.</p>
                  <p>Neither was it the business of the Apostle, in this Text, to determine any thing of the place, but to set forth the priviledge of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, by the means of Christ, at the last day. The meaning of the Apostle, who speaketh here of those that are Christs, seems no other then this. As all who came from <hi>Adam</hi> were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to death, and could not, naturally, claim the priviledge of a Resurrection to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: So all who believe in the <hi>Messiah</hi> shall not rot for ever in the grave, but be raised up to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting happiness. To this sense agree both <hi>Crellius,</hi> and <hi>Vorstius,</hi> whom I, the rather, name to you, because they were men of singularity in conceit, and such as stepped out of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Road of Divinity, which the Orthodox believe the truest and safest way. In the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase of this comparison, <hi>All</hi> of one kinde, is answered by <hi>All</hi> of the other kinde, and death by life: And therefore there is no impropriety in the comparison, though, in other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the things compared disagree. The main scope of the Apostle, in setting forth the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Believers at that day, by Christ, doth justifie the similitude, though the place of life be not the same to all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> which was possessed by that Root of mankinde. <hi>Parables</hi> (saith <hi>Salmeron,</hi> who wrote of them) <hi>are like to swords; the Hilts and Scabbards of them are variously wrought, but it is the Edge whereby they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
