         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the interpreters of Dreames (as vvitnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

Yet for that ther be so few parsons that

may the sicknesse bee stayed by an other

            <p>Whiche is the chiefe &amp; principal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
And further headde the of the

theym hee well knoweth, then throughe
this be commeth the better and easelyer
vnto the vnderstandinge and knowledge
of the other. Also he ought to know how
to discusse from like to like. For like as
the poetes, which also are named naturall
prophetes, do further passe by a small si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of any matter vnto another lyke
as in speakyng of the nature of <hi>Venus</hi> do
thereby proceade to discusse the caulmnes
of the ayre, &amp; so like in many others. Yet
that personne is apter to interprete drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
whiche otherwyse is not occupyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

do dreame in the one they apply with
the other, so that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one for the other, they

of Hercules, that hee dreamed such drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

drye, and of this sheweth the dominion of

And the lyke whereas they wryte, that
to see drye trees or cleft, doth after signify
perill of lyfe, which if that should be true,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many husbandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and fellers of trees
shoulde die, because they often dreame of
suche businesses which they earnestlye go
about and busy them selues in. And in the
like sort this is not true, that to see in the
sleepe deformed thynges, that the same
foresheweth a sicknesse to come, neyther
is this also true, if that a thinge deformed
of nature doth then appeare farre to the


<pb facs="tcp:21037:15"/>
dreamer, that the farrenes doth forshewe
an euill, for that some do thinke to see ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
garments should signifie a deceit,
in that vnder these is the truethe often co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.
Nor it disagreeth not that to se fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye
thynges in the sleepe, that the same
doth declare corrupt humors, because the
stincke maye proceeade of the outwarde
meanes or bee represented by the kyndes
reserued and then shoulde it rather argue
the goodnes of smelling. And althoughe
the body greeued, maye be sayde to argue
many humors, yet maye it declare that the

in this case doth not onely touch outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,

others say, that to see in the sleepe cleare
and brighte formes doth signifie that the
bodies not to bee altered, this also is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
because this maye happen, when the
melancholie humoure lyke to the sande,
doth purge &amp; cause cleare visible spirites,
and then althoughe the clearenes of the
formes, doth declare the goodnes of these
sences, yet is the cause euill in it selfe, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

Nor it is to be doubted, when si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milytudes
appeare darklye, or shadowed
with cloudes, but that they maye declare
a troublinge of the visible spirites, and
when those tende vnto a witnes, then do
they signifye mattery humors, and when
the shadow appeareth smal, then doth the

harme soone ceasse, and when it sheweth
to the syght as water or earthe, then the
harme shal bee the greuousser, and the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

some affirme, when the sleeaper dreameth
to see starres shadowed with fyer or by a
thynne cloude, that the same doth argue
the dominion of choller, whiche rather
maye declare an indisposition of the eyes
eyther present or to come. And wher
they also afirme, that when the starres ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to the dreamer that they are so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
that they can not bee decerned of him,
that the same is a note of death, especially
if the personne then dreamynge the lyke
should be sicke as though the stars coulde
not then helpe hym. But this trulye
is rather a matter to bee laughed at, that
to prognosticate death of the impedimente
of fight. Yet certaine doo allowe when
the starres seame to the dreamer to moue
swiftlye, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they prognosticate great

               <p>And a stronge motion I mean, in that
this maye heate and resolue the moisture
stoppinge the commone sence. Nor it is
not necessarye, that for that tyme they
shoulde be depryued by a voluntarye mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in that althoughe the senses maye
bee harmed throughe the distemperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and diminution of the spirites, yet
is not in that season the sence of fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye
taken away, whiche is onely cause of
the same.</p>
               <p>Whye is it that persones hoate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or eatynge hoate meates and vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse,

forwarde the kyndes restinge in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,


<pb facs="tcp:21037:21"/>
so that the dreame is caused of the
representing of them. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth,
that throughe the boathe humours,
dreames are caused of matters a longe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
reserued, for althoughe these maye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde
in the Organs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quieter, yet through
a strong motion of heate brought backe,
may so cause dreames, or to dreame after.
Why appeareth it to the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dreaminge
that the dreame is somtymes true, and
somtyme aunsweareth not the lyke at al.
The cause of this is, in that it some tyms
happeneth that in such a dreame the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
or knowledge of the vertu intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiue
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curreth with a sensitiue vertue
but sometimes the same doth not concur:
therefore when it doth concur, the man
iudgeth the dreame to bee false &amp; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is in that the intellectiue vertue doth
correcte the sensityue. But when it doth
not concurre or accorde then doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the man that the dreame is trew.
Why is it that certayne sleapynge doo
exercise the workes of persones waking.
The reason is, for that not simplye they
doo slepe, nor properly bee wakinge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe
the vapour in the tyme of sleape


<pb facs="tcp:21037:21"/>

that vapoure dothe some pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beginninge, yf then from that kynd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f his
fantasie also is moued seeynge it is the
beginninge of the locall motion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sleapynge it is moued by it selfe, and
when the foresayde causes bee base and
weake, that is to saye, not mouing out of
the place, and when they be stronge, then
doo they moue from place to place. And
because the spirites and Organe are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
sences from the Organes, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
therfore of them are for the more-parte
not reasoned of, but seynge they be
not muche distaunt, for that cause is not
speache hyndered in them, so that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes
be not occupyed or indisposed, for
then doo they shewe foolishenes muche
lyke vnto the condition of the sicke. And
because the lower me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers whiche be the
instrumentes of motion are lesse hindred
in respecte of the vpper whiche obeye to

the motion, and not vnto the sence, and
because the qualitye of the eyes is of the
natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of water, therefore are they slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
opened to see abrode then the other
members to moue. But althoughe suche
walke wyth the eyes shutte, and that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a happe, yet sometymes by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
or by Custome they come vnto the
place in the daye tyme immagined, not
by sighte in that the eyes are then shutte
but of the inward fantasie by which they
walke in the darke, like as in the lighte
or daye tyme or rather this by a happe.
And although they bee then without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge,
yet the other senses do obaye in as
muche as they may to the mouinge po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers.
But sometymes they think to kill a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and sometymes that they theym selues
are deade, because the fantasye doothe y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine
that whiche eyther it conueytethe
or feareth.</p>
               <p>Whye is it that suche hauinge bygge
heades be louers of sleepe. The reason is
for that they easelye receiue and retayne
the vaporous fumes of theym, also the


<pb facs="tcp:21037:22"/>
moister braynes are apter to slepe, whose
neare workinge is a vapoure wythoute
doubte. Why is it that wyne doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
cause sleepe, and sometymes to
wake. The reason is for that when it
is druncke moderatly, it doth then cause
sleepe, in that the vapoures of the wyne
doo not trouble but easelye moysten and
stoppe the wayes by whiche the spyrites
and heare passe whereas wakynge, it do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethe
otherwyse. But when the person
drinketh muche, or y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the wyne is strong,
then dooth it dulle and vexe the powers,
and instrumentes of the spyryt, whiche
at that tyme placed in the motion, dooe
force the persone to wake. And although</p>
               <p>Nature troubled sometymes, these
doe cause astonishement, yet do they not
then perfitelye sleepe.</p>
               <p>Whye is sleepe caused moore and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
by lyinge on the righte syde then on
the lefte. The reasone is, for that as
<hi>Aristotle</hi> wrytethe, wee doo more wake
lyinge on the righte syde, yet sleepe is
caused of the contrarye causes. Or for
that the ryghte syde is more wearied in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> daye tyme, whiche of these neede the


<pb facs="tcp:21037:23"/>
the more reste, nor vppon this syde also,
doth the harte labour.</p>
               <p>Why is it that onely man whyles hee
sleapeth, boweth downe in his sleapyng.
The reason is, for that the powers and
spirites gyuing sense and motion drawen
inwarde, doo not then suffer the bodye to
be stayed vpright or for that the vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the fourm in man may cause of the
same that the foresayde powers and heat
by their owne nature may bee caried vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
or determined by the proper kynde
yet by drawinge downe those from the
members, it behoueth that they fal as to
the heades of beastes, of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
goo not vpright. And for that the as<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cending
of those in the beasts is not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely
caused, therfore the members in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
seeyng they remayn not altogether desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of helpes, they staye vp themselues
the surer and better.</p>
               <p>Why doo beastes sleape a lesser time
then they do wake. The reason is, for
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the superfluityes multiplyed by perfect
digestion can not aptlye bee sente of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without the body by one onely expul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion.
And, seeing we may often ryse to put


<pb facs="tcp:21037:23"/>
away those, therfore is sleape oftentymes
broken. Or rather for that the greater
part of the woorkings necessary to life, &amp;
in whiche mans perfection consisteth, is
perfourmed in the daye tyme, and not in
sleape, in whiche man differethe not from
plantes or beastes, and whom nature fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vnto the ende of waking, for that we
sleape quieter, &amp; wake with more delight.</p>
               <p>Why do me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirme, that sleape much
helpeth to digestion. The reason is, for
that the same happenethe not to euerye
thinge, but rather in that whiche is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for the comfort of the whole body, as
of the stomack and liuer, vpon which the
powers and heate more vnited dooe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte
themselues, and be shorter lynes
for they bee in a manner in the midle of
the creature. But to the other particuler
members is the foode digested sence, and
if that lacketh anye thinge then the heate
ingendred suffiseth them, which may as
wel be caused in the day time as in sleepe.</p>
               <p>Why do some wryte that the marishe
or watery places cause sleape. The reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is, for that from these are vapours ingros<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>singe
and coelynge the ayre caused, which


<pb facs="tcp:21037:24"/>
breathed in or drawen in wyth the breath
that spirites refuse, as contrarye to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it selfe whiche is cleare and pure, so
that throughe the drawinge in of these,
sleepe enseweth. Or rather for that the
grosse ayre brethed or entered in by the
pores of the body, dooth by his grossenes
greeue at the firste the brayne, and after
carried vnto the common sence, dooth of
the same compell sometimes to sleepe.</p>
               <p>Whye doo the tellinge or hearinge of
tales sometymes cause, and sometymes
put away sleepe. The reason is as yt
is sayde that in some parsones the grosse
moisture aboundeth, which if it so happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that through laboure in the hearing
it is resolued into a vapour, then are they
taken with slepe or rather moued to slepe
but the humour subtile in leane or cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke
persons, do moore sharpen, and of
this in the prickinge compell the person
rather to wake: Why affyrmeth the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
that sleeping he thinketh some
tymes or through a small noyse to heare
thunder, or through a litle fleume sweet
stillinge to the tongue doothe then thinke
to taste or eat milke, and so lyke in many


<pb facs="tcp:21037:24"/>
others. The reason of these ys, that as
they saye by nighte, the outwarde sences
bounde in the respecte of the motions fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
without do perceyue the inwarde far big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
whereof the common sence or other
vertue dreamynge is deceyued, in that he
iudgeth those to be of other sensible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
then in dede they be. And <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
wryteth that the small motiones in
sleepe do appere bigger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the day ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
because the sences in this occupyed a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bout
many matters, eyther perceyue not
those, or els discern the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> far lesser. And for
that hee thinketh those sometymes to be
rather as honnye then mylke, happeneth
eyther throughe the indisposition of the
spyrites or lyfe of the dreamer or of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause, so that of particuler matters,
no firme rule can bee geuen.</p>
               <p>Or when the same should happen that
Nature expelled from anye principall
member anye moysture lyke as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ewme
in purpose as vnto taste, or wyndye Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
as vnto hearyng, and if now by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son
of the firste that which sheddeth forth
vnto the Organe of taste is smalle in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
yet the sences whiche perceiued and


<pb facs="tcp:21037:25"/>
dooe retayne the cause of the former mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to haue bene bigge in his beginning
or parhappes with a bigge and strong en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forcement
of nature expelled, therfore the
imaginatiue couetynge to expresse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesomnes
which it perceyueth as bigge
doth so moue other customed formes to
represente inwarde tastes, as of Mylke.</p>
               <p>And the selfe same iudgmente is of the
small noyse in respecte of hearyng, which
throughe the foresayd causes thinkethe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
same bygge, and so mouethe the kynde of
thunder otherwyse ment or thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>And why do some wryte, that such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisinge
or vnknowen matters, doo often
falla sleape. The reason is, for that the
dayly beholdinge of matters, doth hinder
the disgestion of nourishment, but vndy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
the humours then do easely, eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
vp to the head &amp; cause the dreame
to appeare otherwyse, Then as they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
and be delighted, Because the
diligente marking, and considerynge of
the matter, doothe then cause the parson
to wake. And of this when any readeth
not vnderstandinge the matter, hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon


<pb facs="tcp:21037:25"/>
dothe often tymes fall a sleepe.</p>
               <p>Because the spirites &amp; power through
the indeuoure and agitation weakened
doo retourne inwarde, that they maye
reste, after whiche ensewethe sleepe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> laboure, whiche also doth
often conuerte the humour into a vapour</p>
               <p>Why do the sicke and dronken parsons
geue somtymes in their sleape angry and
frowarde woordes and sometyms gentle
&amp; honest wordes. The reason of this is for
that the spyrites vexed by an euill or ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>scure
humoure do then cause feare after
whiche then ensuethe hatred, that so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speake frowardlye espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye
beynge a babler by nature. But
when the spirites be cleared, then do they
dispose that person vnto a hope, and so to
talke quietlye and gentlye</p>
               <p>Why is it that certaine beastes sleepe
wythe the eyes oppen, lyke as the Hare
and fyshes. The reason is, for that the
fyshes do lacke eye liddes, whiche verye
nature hath denyed theym, in that they
lightlye waked maye sone succor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them selues. And the hare when she
is pursued or hunted after doothe at no

tyme hyde her selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the wood amonge
bushes, leaste her eyes alwayes open and
vncouered, myghte so bee harmed wythe
bryers and thornes.</p>
               <p>Why is it, that the remembraunce of
the euil past, doth not take awaye sleepe,
lyke as otherwyse of matters to come.
The reason is, for if the same shoulde bee
true and bothe laborious, yet of that to
come by reason of the feare annexed, is
the same wythe carefulnes. soo that thys
letteth him to slepe, whereas of the kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,
it troubleth hym litle or nothing at
all. Why do some sometymes declare to
see or to haue seene in their slepe Deuils,
and somtimes saints or Angels. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, for that althoughe deuils of their
propper nature haue no coloure at all,
yet because by this especialye as bye the
black, they are manifested to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
therefore whan it so happeneth that
the adust humoure or fume doth occupye
the spirites and and passages, then the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitatyue
ruled by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doth cause the dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amers
to belene y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> similitudes or black
kyndes to be very diuils in that they are
then caused corruptlye to decerne. And al


<pb facs="tcp:21037:26"/>
though there can not bee caused one only
dreame of all the kyndes whiche are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
in the remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yet are there
ymagined many diuills, in that they are
comprehended vnder a certayne vnicye
of blackenes imagined. And euen lyke,
when the foresayd similitudes and ways
are affected wythe the redde couloure of
bloudde mixed wythe flewme whiche for
that the same is white and the other redd
therfore through, the worthines of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
they think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those to be ether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
or saints in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both these wer wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to

dispose the sicke to gladnes, appeareth in

               <p>The reason is, for that when the same

the sleepe is the reste of the spyrites, and
the wakinge, the vehemente motione of

caused through the spirites lightlye mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Wherof whyles we soundly sleepe,

lyke for example, when a man in his slepe
thinketh to se a monster with thre heads,
which hee either hearde of by the discrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some or sawe paynted in the lyke
sorte, whiche heades he remembred to be
on this wyse, as the one lyke a Lyon, the

then when a man is vnparfitlye founde.</p>
               <p>And the knowledge of this is, that all
men, yea the moste knowen beeyng seene
far of, are vnknowen. Therfore through
the vnperfite knowledge and tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sposing,
and mixinge of sightes, are all dreames
caused. So that it appeareth that al dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ames
to agre booth in the efficiente cause
and in the matter, for the efficyente cause,
is the moderate motion of the spirites,
but the matter is the memorye of things
seene, eyther whole or vnparfit.
For as it is manifest that there be diuers


<pb facs="tcp:21037:30"/>
kyndes of dreames, euen so it behoueth
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the causes bee diuers for that throughe

               <p>This moderate motion oughte not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to be thoughte so perfit, that this

               <p>But if the mocion be vehementer, and
troublesomer, althoughe it maye bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated
in the kynde, yet are they called
vayne dreames, troubled, vnperfite, and
confused. And in this maner doo twoo
kyndes of them, aryse, the one whiche is
of meate, and is the more confused and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perfyte,
yet more fayntly.
For that from the meate and drinke the
vapours are not soo parfytelye caried as
from the humours, whiche so cause drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

are caused by the humors. Wherfore the
dreames caused of meate are lesse parfyte

appeare more troubled, confused and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
then those whiche are caused of the

those whiche are in an order, and bee

appeareth doothe eyther consiste of


<pb facs="tcp:21037:32"/>
the difference of thinges seene, or of the
maner of seeynge, or difference of the
dreaminges. For that by nature men
see true dreames, whiche dreame but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and false dreames whiche dayelye
dreame. Also suche as be occupyed
in greate actions, and businesses, and
greately abstayne from meate and drinke
nor are troubled wyth feare nor sadnes,
doo see and haue true dreames, but suche
affected in the contrary manner, doo see
false dreames. And for that cause the
dreames of Princes, are commonlie true.</p>
               <p>And suche of honeste manners trewe
faythfull, and godlye, haue for the more
parte trewe dreames. And suche
whiche are not so godlye, but cruell, yet
no deceiuers, see commonlye trewe drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
and the supersticious parsons, do see
very fewe true dreames.
Also he whiche is accustomed to see true
dreames, to his dreames is more credyte
to bee giuen, then to those whiche are of
a contrary manner. And men haue
truer dreames in the Sommer and the
Wynter then in the Springe, and the
Harueste, for that in those tymes they


<pb facs="tcp:21037:32"/>
often alter. Also quiet seasons, dooe
cause true dreames, but the wynde, and
boystrouse weather, dooe worke contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
and the more boysterouse, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
falser. Besydes shorte dreames
and in order, are truer and moore euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente,
and of a cause more constante are
caused. And dreames moued or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the rysinge of the Sonne, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or after vnto the thirde hower, bee
for the more parte trewe. But those
dreames at the noone tyme of the daye
and at the settynge of the Sonne, bee
not so true. For that the sonne is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of the true and constante thinges.
So that when he shalbe nere the angels,
be doth then cause the truer dreames.
And the terrour or feare of thinges mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge

yea and that verye swiftlye those
which presently through y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> proper course
are neare the ende, but those contrarye,

and the reste needfull, lyke as the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye
persons, and men in aucthority. And
whosoeuer also haue a constitute tyme, as
Magistrates for a yeare, lyke as the selfe

presente or shortly after, or a longe tyme
after to come or paste, or els a tyme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

               <p>Whiche dreame of his lyke succeaded by

               <p>A certayne person came to one <hi>Hybu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
Aebaneus</hi> an Interpreter of Drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
and sayde I dreamed this night past
that I had cornes of Barlye in my hande

wel be it vnto you. And after he
was departed, the expounder asked the

knew hym: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one aunswered, that
he knewe hym verye well and where hee
dwelled. Well sayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enterpreter, marke
and haue regard after hym, for that short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the Philosopher thoughte

hymselfe to the studye of Philosophy, yet
the next day followinge when he came to
reasoninge wyth another philosopher ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
hotlye, he was theere stricken on the
head wyth a staffe, and hardlye escaped
death.</p>
               <p>And the wyfe of <hi>Diognosta</hi> dreamed,
to haue halfe a bearde, who after lyued
seperate from her husbande, so that if she
had thought to haue a whole bearde, then
after to be a wydowe.</p>
               <p>A certayne <hi>Lumbarde</hi> so often as he
should wyn, dreamed in the night before,
that he did eate whyte grapes. For the
whyte grapes do protende a plentifull, &amp;
easy encrease of labour. But the blacke
grapes do signify a small gayne, and that
wyth tedions trauayle. Nowe such a
custome of his endured for twelue years,
and after decayed.</p>
               <p>A certayne learned Phisition there was
who so often as he dreamed, that hee saw
his mother beyng deade, very sadde, the

that by good reason, for that sonne is


<pb facs="tcp:21037:66"/>
most deare to the mother, &amp; that her sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
also signifyeth the calamityes to the
child, and not the lyke to the father. For
fathers are not like moued to mourne for
the sicknesses of their sonnes, except those
sicknesses are deadly, in that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are stou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of mynde and stomacke, then women.
And he was also sickly by nature, so that
he dreamed the lyke many yeares.</p>
               <p>A certayne gentleman, as <hi>Mattheus
Ferrarius</hi> wrytethe, that howe often hee
thought that he did eate in his sleape, and
so often in the day following he was pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stone. And if so be he thought
that hee didd eate harde thinges of dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
then the payne continued manye
dayes after. So that by good reason we
saye that wee so well taste of sorrowes,
as meates.</p>
               <p>And to <hi>Valentinianus</hi> Emperour the
day before he dyed, beynge yet not sicke,
for that he dyed sodenlye, appeared hys

And one <hi>Policrates Samius</hi> a tyraunte

him.</p>
               <p>And one thought in his steape, that he

               <p>And this by good reason happening to

corruption of many mens seedes: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

gentle, &amp; to haue one soft and swete appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
aud Jewels of golde aboute her, and
that shee shall also proffer herselfe to him
signifyeth good to hym whiche seeth the

<pb facs="tcp:21037:83"/>
that hee whiche seeth the dreame
shall after leade his lyfe in heauynes and
sorrow. And agayne if the woman afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayde,
shall not offer herselfe to him, then
it signifieth the contraries to the former.</p>
               <p>For a man must suppose that womens
vnknowen Images to be of the actions,
happening to him which seeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dreame.
And if a mayster thinketh in his dreame,
that he hath to do with his seruaunt, it is
not good, for it signifieth despyte, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
by that seruaunt: whiche signifyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
also is of the brother, whether it bee
the yonger whiche hee companieth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
wyth, or the elder. And the lyke
iudgement, it is to be geuen of an enemy.</p>
               <p>And to lye wyth a woman familiarly
knowen and well acquaynted, if he shall
earnestlye loue her, and shall also desyre
her carnallye: doth portende nothinge to
him whiche seeth the dreame, for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentyue

shall not in his dreame earnestlye desire

shalbe rych: for he shall alway after
get or obtayne of her some profit to hym,
or at the leaste by that woman which the

man seeth. And if any thinketh in hys
dreame to lye wyth a maryed wife, is not
good for the lawe sake. And to be moued
of a certayne familiar frende to a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trulye,
it is both ioyoufe and profytable,
whosoeuer be, the earnest desyre shalbe,
But to be moued therto of a richer or el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of a yonger and needye person, is euil for

And a certayne person beyng a seruaunt
dreamed that he thought he handled his

induce daungers through a sicknesse: For
lyke as the wrastler coueteth to handle
his aduersarye, euen so the sicknesse, the
sicke person as to bringe him to the earth.
And further that a man to wrastle wyth


<pb facs="tcp:21037:84"/>
a childe, signifyeth also euill. For if hee
shal ouerthrowe or cast the childe, he shal
then bury some bodye. And to a chylde to
wrastle wyth a man, signifyeth good, for
there shall followe after greate matters,
besydes his expectation. And to wrastle
wyth a dead personne signifyeth sicknes,
or contencion and variance, wyth some of
the children or heires, of that dead parso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And besydes in wrastling, it is alwayes

               <p>And to eate browne breade to a poore

desperation: or that those thynges
whyche be presently hoped after shall not
be perfourmed or accomplished. And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye

               <p>And if any thinketh in his dreame, that
no straunger, but his owne household do

wyfe and children and some of his kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes
to see hym daunsinge, doth por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
good: for it signifyeth gladnes and
ioye, &amp; the greate aboundance of goodes
of ryches: but yet to a person beyng sicke
as wel to a man, as woman, this dreame
signifyeth euill. And for the muche motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
also of daunting, it signifyeth deceyuing
and dotage. Also this dreame signifyeth
euill to hym whiche is vexed or hath any
sicknesse on hym. But yf any shal dreame
that hee dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth in some high place doth
portende that hee shal after fall sodenlye
into a feare or other perils. And if he bee
an offender, hee shal after be greuouslye
punished, for the reason of the highnes, &amp;
stretching out of the handes.</p>
               <p>And he that thinketh in his dreame, to

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

But when those songes any shal remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
then by those songes he muste make
his iugemente: and to singe in the way as
he goeth signifyeth goode, to hym which
followeth a wayne or cart: but to singe
in a bayne or hotte house, signifyeth euill
to hym, which so dreameth. And further
to dreame that hee singeth songes in the
market place or streats, to rych men tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it doth portende dishonestye or rebuke

               <p>And he that thinketh in his dreame to

if it be in the season of the yeare for them,
doth portende good happe: but beyng out
of their florishinge tyme and season, it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeth
euill. And of those truly whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

and those which be made of yeallow

For that the purple coulour hath a certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yne

               <p>And the flowre of Mallowes in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,

               <p>And a Garlande of waxe signifyeth euill

               <p>The starres seene to fall from heauer, do

the head to the bodye. And agayne, what
reason the starres haue to heauen, &amp; the
same haue the heares to the heade. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the starres neyther fallinge on the earth

But rather forshewe daunger and hurte

               <p>The raynbowe seue of the dreamer on

But this right and lefte side, is not heare<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment

And howsoeuer it shall appeare, yet it

To thincke hym selfe to be deade, &amp; that
caryed forth, and buried, to a seruaunte,
to whom the affayres and house of the


<pb facs="tcp:21037:96"/>
Maister is not committed, it sygnifieth
libertie. For that the deade beinge a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce,
hath then no maister, and findeth
at that tyme the rest bothe of laboures &amp;
seruice. But to that seruaunt to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
goodes of the maister are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, death
taketh away that credite. And to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not hauinge a wyfe, it forshewethe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

death, be thoughte both as the endes to

So that to sicke personnes to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

And to that manne dreaminge the

For that the deade doe not after
keepe company with the liuinge, nor the

               <p>

And this hath beene obserued, that to the

this dreame to them, which he in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie

signifyeth a good successe. For that the

losse and sorrow For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in causing

sicke seemeth to be deade, doth after
signifye that he shalbe deliuered from the
sickenesse or griefe, for that the deade do
not then feele griefe: nor be sicke. And if
rny thinketh to be buried aliue, the same
promiseth good to no body, for that it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeth
for the more yarte imprisonment
or to be fettered wyth chaynes. And hee
that thinketh to be strangled and to hang

sorrowes for that to them that are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geld,

tyme luckely: But if not, then contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse.
And if the deade seemeth to take
away such thing, which he enioyed in his
lyfe tyme, promiseth euil to follow. But
most daungerous of all others are these,
whiche seeme to take awaye garmentes,
money, or meate: For they eyther sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifye
death to the dreamer or to some of

               <p>And this for a trueth hath bene obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
