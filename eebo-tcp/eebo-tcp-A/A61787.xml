            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By such small Shifts, together with the Assistanae of the Charity of the <hi>Trinity House</hi> into which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son she was Antient and a Seamans Widdow she had of late years gotten; she with much ado lived a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous and miserable life, being continually in want, and at varience with all that knew her.</p>
            <p>Above twenty years since she nursed a Girl who did always report that she was a Witch, and after she was at a womans Estate was still fearful and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of her, untill the time of her Death. 'Tis believed the Child had been affrighted by some of her Tricks when she was Young, which made her in the greatest Dread and Terror imaginable of her ever after.</p>
            <p>About sixteen Years since, <hi>Walter Fowler</hi> her Son was Transported to <hi>Barbados,</hi> who always used to declare that his Mother was a Witch, that she had bewitched him and several others, and would relate several strange Exploits of her doing, and saying of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to others that she was there in the Room and tempted him to do such and such Mischiefs, and would averr that he saw her present, when no one else in the place could see any thing; this mind he continued in, always accusing her of bewitching him, until about nine Years since that he was hang'd in the <hi>Island</hi> of <hi>Barbados,</hi> for Murdering his Wife and breaking open a House.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:36505:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>About six weeks since, she having lain sick a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time in <hi>King-street</hi> aforesaid, where she had a mean Room Furnished, and having a poor Neighbour to look after and nurse her; she sent her out of an Errand to fetch her something shd had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion <hi>for,</hi> and the woman going out of Doors, lock'd the Door and took the Key with her, leaving no body there save the aforesaid <hi>Alice</hi> sick in her Bed, and coming back again, found the said <hi>Alice</hi> stripped, dead and cold as <hi>Clay</hi> laying on the Floor on her Back, and having her two great Toes ty'd together, and a <hi>Blanket</hi> flung over her; the poor woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much surprized at this, called in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours who were all in <hi>great</hi> astonishment when they saw the Corps lying, and had had an account how it was left, and the rather in that there was so great a stink when they stir'd the Corps that they could hardly endure the Room.</p>
            <p>Several of the Neighbours were so curious to search the Corps, and do all of them affirm that they found in the private parts of the Corps five Teats; to wit, four small ones and one very big, and that they were all of them as black as a <hi>Coal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This considered, together with her ill report that she had <hi>when</hi> alive, made all the neighbours refuse to accompany the Corps to the <hi>Earth,</hi> so that the next day she was put into the <hi>Church Coffin,</hi> and by the Bearers without any more company buried in the <hi>Church-Yard</hi> of St. <hi>Paul Shadwell;</hi> so that as in her Life she <hi>was</hi> little beloved, at her Funeral she <hi>was</hi> as much slighted and scorned by every body, no one offering to accompany her Corps, as is before rehearsed.</p>
