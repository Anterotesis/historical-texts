            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>ARISTOTLE, in his <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> writing of the Nature
of Man, hit the Nail on the Head when he said, That
Man is naturally enclined to, and desirous of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg:
and indeed it is palpable and apparent, that as
Pride is the first visible sin in a child, whereby we may
gather that it was the first sin of <hi>Adam;</hi> so Knowledg
being the first Vertue a Child minds, as is apparent to them that do
but with the eye of Reason heed their actions even whilst they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
yong, even before they are a yeer old, even by natural instinct,
whereby a man may more than guess that Knowledg was the greatest
loss, or at least one of the greatest we lost by the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> is <hi>in Prosperity an Ornament, in Adversity a Refuge;</hi>
and truly there is almost no greater enemy to Knowledg in the world
than Pride and Covetousness: Excellently said, <hi>Juvenal, Sat. 7.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Scire volunt omnes, mercedem solvere nemo.</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>Alhtough all men, in Knowledg take delight,</l>
                     <l>Yet they love money better, that's the spight.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And again, some men are so damnable proud and envious withal,
that they would have no body know any thing but themselves; the
one I hope will shortly learn better manners, and the other be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
too heavy for the Earth long to bear.</p>
                  <p>The Subject which I here fixed my thoughts upon is not only the
Description and Nature of Herbs, which had it been all, I had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
sufficient to bear me out in it, for <hi>Solomon</hi> employed part of that
wisdom he asked, and received of God in searching after them, which
he wrote in Books, even of all Herbs, Plants and Trees; some say
those Writings were carried to <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> being kept
in the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for the publick view of the People, but being
transported to <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Captivity, <hi>Alexander</hi> the GREAT TY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANT
at the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> gave them to his Master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who
committed them to the mercy of the fire.</p>
                  <p>But since the daies of <hi>Solomon,</hi> many have those famous men been
that have written of this Subject, and great Encouragements have


<pb facs="tcp:41525:3"/>
been given them by Princes, of which I shall quote an example or
two, <hi>Mathiolus</hi> his greediness was such to finish his Comment upon <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscorides,</hi>
which Book is yet in use in the famous Universities in <hi>Leyden</hi>
in <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mountpilier</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that he forgot to count what the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of it might amount to, although I rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend him for his dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in Studie and Care of the Worlds good, than harbor the leastill
thought of him for not counting the middle and both ends before he
began the Work, I say when he came to count the charges of Printing
and cutting the Cuts, it far surmounted his Estate; in this he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
furnished by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperor, and diverse other
Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> as himself confessed furnished him with great sums
of money, for perfecting that so great, so good a Work; the Prince
Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi>sent him much money towards his charge, as also
<hi>Joachim,</hi> Marquess of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who as he was neighbor to <hi>Saxony</hi> in
Place, so was he in Affection to so good a Work; <hi>Frederick,</hi> Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi>
of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal Prince</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> the <hi>Arch Bishop</hi> of <hi>Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi>
the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Cleveland,</hi> and the <hi>Free State</hi> of <hi>Norimberg,</hi>
together with many others, so that he had the help of the Emperor,
of Arch Dukes, Dukes, Electors, Cardinals, Princes. Happie is that
Nation whose Magistrates countenance such as mind and study their
Good: I might instance in many more, and thereby give you a glimps
how Magistrates formerly favored this Art, and which is more, how
studious they were in it. <hi>Bellonius</hi> a man that soared high in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Herbs, also professed he had the helping hand of Kings and
Cardinals to maintain him in his Studies, and more than this, Kings
themselves were Studious in it; amongst which (<hi>Solomon</hi> excepted)
<hi>Mithridates</hi> that renowned King of <hi>Pontus</hi> seems to bear away the Bell,
his Writings after his death were found in his Country Mannor by
<hi>Pompey</hi> the great, but never a Roman of them all had the honesty to
print them with his name in the Frontispiece, so that we have nothing
of them but what is quoted by some honest Authors, especially by
<hi>Plutarch.</hi>

                        <l>Nor the Melodious Lute, but to prevent</l>
                        <l>His Fathers death, who now with age was spent,</l>
                        <l>To be an Herbarist, and Medicine</l>
                        <l>To learn, he rather did his thoughts incline.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
                  <p>So precious hath the knowledg of the Vertues of Herbs been in
former times to men of quality, and indeed happy is that Nation,
whose Rulers mind Knowledg, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith on the contrary, <hi>Wo
to that Nation whose King is a Child,</hi> and indeed in Ancient times people
need little other Physick than such Herbs as grew neer them, some
Footsteps of which and but a few only, are now in use with us to this
day, as people usually boyl Fennel with Fish, and know not why they
do it but only for custom, when indeed the Original of it was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon Reason, because Fennel consumes that Flegmatick quality
of Fish, which is obnoxious to the Body of man, Fennel being an Herb
of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and he so great an Enemie to the Sign <hi>Pisces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Art the Worthies of our own Nation, <hi>Gerard, Johnson,</hi> and
<hi>Parkinson</hi> are not to be forgotten, who did much good in the Studie
of this Art, yet they and all others that wrote of the Nature of Herbs,
gave not a bit of a reason why such an Herb was apropriated to such
a part of the Body, nor why it cured such a Disease; truly my own
body being sickly brought me easily into a capacitie to know that
Health was the greatest of all Earthly Blessings, and truly he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sick that doth not beleeve it; then I considered that all Medicines
were compounded of Herbs, Roots, Flowers, Seeds &amp;c. and this first
set me a work in studying the Nature of Simples, most of which I knew
by sight before, and indeed all the Authors I could reade gave me but
little satisfaction in this particular, or none at all; I cannot build my
faith upon Authors words, nor beleeve a thing because they say it, and
could wish ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> bodie were of my mind in this, to labor to be able to
give a reason for every thing they say or do; they say reason makes a
man differ from a Beast, if that be true, pray what are they that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Reason for their judgment, quote old Authors, perhaps their
Authors knew a reason for what they Wrote, perhaps they did not,
what is that to us, do we know it? Truly in writing this Work first,
to satisfie my self I drew out all the Vertues of vulgar Herbs, Plants,
and Trees &amp;c. out of the best and most approved Authors I had or
could get, and having done so, I set my self to studie the Reason of


<pb facs="tcp:41525:4"/>
them; I knew well enough the whol world and every thing in it was
formed of a Composition of contrary Elements, and in such a harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as must needs shew the wisdom and Power of a great God. I knew
as well this Creation though thus composed of contraries was one u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Body, and man an Epitome of it, I knew those various affections
in man in respect of Sickness and Health were caused Naturally
(though God may have other ends best known to himself) by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
operations of the <hi>Macrocosm;</hi> and I could not be ignorant, that
as the Cause is, so must the Cure be, and therefore he that would
know the Reason of the operation of Herbs must look up as high as
the Stars; I alwaies found the Disease vary according to the various
motion of the Stars, and this is enough one would think to teach a
man by the Effect where the Cause lay; Then to find out the Reason
of the Operation of Herbs, Plants, &amp;c. by the Stars went I, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I could find but few Authors, but those as full of nonsense and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
as an Egg is full of meat, this being little pleasing, and less
profitable to me, I consulted with my two Brothers, Dr REASON,
and Dr EXPERIENCE, and took a Voyage to visit my Mother
NATURE, by whose advice together with the help of Dr DILLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENCE,
I at last obtained my desires, and being warned by Mr <hi>Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi>
a stranger in our daies to publish it to the World, I have done it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But you will say,</hi> What need I have written of this Subject, seing so many famous and learned men have written so much of it in the English Tongue, nay much more than I have done?</p>
                  <p>To this I Answer,</p>
                  <p>1. All that have written of Herbs either in the English or not in the
English Tongue, have no waies answered my intents in this Book, for
they have intermixed many, nay very many outlandish Herbs, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many which are hard, nay not at all to be gotten, and what harm
this may do I am very sensible of. Once a Student in Physick in <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi>
sent up to <hi>London</hi> to me, to buy for him such and such Medicines,
and send them down, which when I viewed, they were Medicines
quoted by Authors living in another Nation, and not to be had in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
for Love nor Money, so the poor man had spent much pains and
Brains in studying Medicines for a Disease that were not to be had; so
a man reading <hi>Gerards</hi> or <hi>Parkinsons</hi> Herbal for the Cure of a Diseas, he
may as like as not, light on an Herb that is not here to be had, or not
without great difficulty, if possible; but in mine, all grow neer him.</p>
                  <p>2. My last, though not the least of my Reasons is, Neither <hi>Gerard</hi>
nor <hi>Parkinson</hi> nor any that ever wrote in the like Nature, ever gave
one wise Reason for what they wrote, and so did nothing els but train
up yong Novices in Physick in the School of Tradition, and teach them
just as a Parrot is taught to speak, an Author saith so, therefore 'tis
true, and if all that Authors say be true, why do they contradict one
another? But in mine, if you view it with the Eye of Reason, you
shall see a Reason for every thing that is written, whereby you may
find the very Ground and Foundation of Physick, you may know


<pb facs="tcp:41525:4"/>
what you do, and wherefore you do it, and this shall call me Father,
it being (that I know of) never done in the world before.</p>
                  <p>I have now but two things more to write and then I have done.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 What the profit and benefit of this Work is.</item>
                     <item>2 Instructions in the Vse of it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. The Profit and Benefits arising from it, or that may acrue to a
wise man, from it are many, so many that should I sum up all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
the Epistle would be as big as the Book; I shall only quote
some few general Heads.</p>
                  <p>First, The admirable Harmony of the Creation is herein seen, in
the Influence of Stars upon Herbs and the Body of man, how one part
of the Creation is subservient to another, and all for the use of man
whereby the Infinite Power and Wisdom of God in the Creation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;
and if I do not admire at the simplicity of the Ranters, never
trust me, who but viewing the Creation can hold such a sottish Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
as that it was from eternity, when the Mysteries of it are so cleer
to everie eye; but that Scripture shall be verified to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> I.
20. <hi>The invisible things of Him from the Creation of the world are cleerly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, so that they are without excuse.</hi> And a Poet could teach them a better
Lesson.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Excideret ne tibi divini muner is author</l>
                     <l>Presentem monstrat, quaelibet Herba Deum.</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>Because out of thy thoughts God should not pass,</l>
                     <l>His Image stamped is on every Grass.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This indeed is true, God hath stamped his Image upon every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore the abuse of the Creature is a great sin; but how
much more doth the Wisdom and Excellencie of God appear if we
consider the Harmony of the Creation in the Vertue and Operation of
every Herb; this is the first.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hereby thou maist know what infinite Knowledg <hi>Adam</hi>
had in his Innocencie, that by looking upon a Creature, he was able
to give it a name according to his Nature, and by knowing that, thou
maist know how great thy fall was, and be humbled for it eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in this
respect, because hereby thou art so ignorant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Here is the right way for thee to begin the study of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
if thou art minded to begin at the right end, for here thou hast the
Reason of the whol Art. I wrote before in certain Astrological Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
which I read, and printed, intituled <hi>Semeiotica Vranica</hi> what
Planet caused (as a second Cause) every Disease, and how it might be
found out what Planet caused it; here thou hast what Planet cures it
by <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy;</hi> and this brings me to my last promise, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Instructions for the right use of the Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And herein let me premise a word or two, Many Herbs, Plants, &amp;c


<pb facs="tcp:41525:5"/>
are not in the Pook apropriated to their propper Planets, the Reason
was, want of time, or some other thing else, which many that know
me will easily guess at; at last the Book hanging longer in the Press
than I imagined it would, I took the time and pains (though I could
ill have spared either) to apropriate them all, and have for thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
(Courteous Reader) inserted them in order after the Epistle, now
then for thy Instruction,</p>
                  <p>First, Consider what Planet causeth the Disease; that thou maist
find in my <hi>Semeiotica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consider what part of the Body is afflicted by the Diseas,
and whether it lie in the Flesh, or Blood, or Bones, or Ventricles.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Consider by what Planet the afflicted part of the Bodie is
governed; that my <hi>Semeiotica</hi> will inform you in also.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You have in this Book the Herbs for Cure a propriated to
the several Diseases, and the Diseases for your ease set down in the
Margin, whereby you may strengthen the part of the Bodie by its like,
as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rain by Herbs of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Breast and Liver by Herbs of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
the Heart and Vitals by Herbs of the <hi>Sun, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, You may oppose Diseases by Herbs of the Planet opposite
to the Planet that causeth them, as Diseases of <hi>Jupiter</hi> by Herbs of
<hi>Mercury,</hi> and the contrary; Diseases of the <hi>Lum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>naries</hi> by Herbs of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi>
and the contrary; Diseases of <hi>Mars</hi> by Herbs of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the
contrary.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, There is a way to cure Diseases somtimes by Sympathy,
and so every Planet cures his own Diseases,, as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> by
their Herbs cure the Eyes, <hi>Saturn</hi> the Spleen, <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Liver, <hi>Mars</hi>
the Gall and Diseases of Choller, and <hi>Venus</hi> Diseases in the Instruments
of Generation.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, There was smal Treatise of mine of <hi>Humane Vertues,</hi>
printed at the latter end of my <hi>Ephemeris</hi> for the yeer 1651. I suppose
it would do much good to yong Students to peruse that with this
Book.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly Yong Students would do themselves much good, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es exceedingly in the Study of Physick if they would
tak the pains to view the Vertues of the Herbs &amp;c. in the Book, and
compare them to these Rules, they shall to their exceeding great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
find them all agreeable to them, and shall thereby see the reason
why such an Herb conduceth to the Cure of such a Disease.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, I gave you the Key of al in the Herb <hi>Wormwood,</hi> which if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the volubility of the Language, any think it will not fit the
Lock, I will here give it you again in another Herb of the same Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
which in the Book either through my own forgetfulness, or my
<hi>Amanuensis</hi> was omitted, and here I shal give it you plainly without
any circumstances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Herb is</hi> Carduus Benedictus.</p>
                  <p>It is called <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> or blessed Thistle or holy Thistle, I
suppose the name was put uppon it by some that had little Holinessin


<pb facs="tcp:41525:5"/>
themselves: It is an Herb of <hi>Mars,</hi> and under the Sign <hi>Aries;</hi> now in
handling this Herb, I shall give you a rational Pattern of all the rest,
and if you please to view them throughout the Book, you shall to
your content find it true.</p>
                  <p>It helps Swimmings and giiddiness of the Head, or the Disease called <hi>Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
because <hi>Aries</hi>is the House of<hi>Mars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an excellent Remedy against the yellow Jaundice, and other Infirmities of
the Gall, because <hi>Mars</hi>governs Choller.</p>
                  <p>It strengthens the attractive faculty in man, and clarifies the Blood, because the
one is ruled by <hi>Mars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The continual drinking the Decoction of it helps red Faces, Tetters, and Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms
because <hi>Mars</hi>causeth them.</p>
                  <p>It helps Plague-sores, Boils, and Itch, the Bitings of mad Dogs and venemous
Beasts, all which infirmities are under <hi>Mars.</hi> Thus you see what it doth
by Sympathy.</p>
                  <p>By Antypathy to other Planets.</p>
                  <p>It cures the French Pox by Antypathy to <hi>Venus</hi>who
governs it.</p>
                  <p>It strengthens the Memory and cures Deafness by Antipathy to <hi>Saturn</hi>who
hath his Fall in <hi>Aries</hi> which Rules the Head.</p>
                  <p>It cures Quartan Agues, and other Diseases of Melancholly and adust Choller
by sympathy to <hi>Saturn, Mars</hi>being exalted in <hi>Capricorn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also it provokes Vrine, the stopping of which is usually caused by <hi>Mars</hi>or the <hi>Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you please to make use of these Rules, you shall find them true
throughout the Book, and by heeding them, you may be able to give
a Reason of your Judgment to him that asketh you: I assure you it
gave much content to me, and for your goods did I pen it; but I must
conclude, my Epistle having exceeded its Bounds alreadie; hereby
you see what Reason may be given for Medicines, and what necessity
there is for every <hi>Physitian</hi> to be an <hi>Astrologer,</hi> you have heard it before
I suppose, but now you know it; what remains, but that you labor
to glorifie God in your several places, and do good to your selves
first by encreasing your Knowledg, and to your Neighbors afterwards
by helping their Infirmities; some such I hope this Nation is worthy
of, and to such shall I remain a Friend, during life, readie to my poor
power to help.</p>

somwhat bigger, and dented with smal round
dents of a yellowish green, colour, like the

                  <p>It is temperate, in respect of heat, but dry
in the Second Degree. The Juyce of the
Leaves drunk with the distilled Water of
Horstail is a singular Remedy for all manner
of wounds in the Breast, Bowels,<note place="margin">Wounds in the Breast, Bowels, Vomiting, Bleeding, Terms stops, Whites, Wounds, Ulcers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Wounds.</note> or other parts
of the Body, and is given with good success un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those who are troubled with Casting, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
or bleeding at the Mouth or Nose, or
otherwise downwards. The said Juyce given
in the distilled Water of Oaken Buds is very
good for Women who have their usual Courses,
or the Whites flowing down too abundantly. It
helps sore Eyes. The Leaves infused or boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Oyl Omphacine, or unripe Olives set
in the Sun for certain daies, or the green
Leaves Sufficiently boyled in the said Oyl, is
made an excellent green Balsom, not only for
green and fresh Wounds, but also for old and
invererate Ulcers, especially if a little fine
clear Turpentine be dissolved therin: It also
stayeth and represseth all inflamations that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise

               <p>A Word or two of the most usual kinds of
<hi>Apples,</hi> though the <hi>colledg of Physitians</hi>
make use of none but such as <hi>Vulgò vulgati,</hi>
Pearmains, <hi>vel</hi> Pippins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apples</hi> in general are cold and windy, and
being of sundry tasts, <hi>Galen</hi> sheweth thereby
how to distinguish them: Som have a sharp
tast, and are good for fainting Stomachs and
loos Bellies;<note place="margin">Fainting Stomach, Loos Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Thirst, Flegm.</note> others sowr, good to cool and
quench thirst; som sharp, fit to cut gross flegm;
som sweet, soon destributed in the Body, and
as soon passed away, yet sooner corrupted is
the Stomach if they be staid: The best sorts
before they be throughly ripe are to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
then to be roasted or scalded is the best
way to take them, and a little Spice or Seeds

those that loath, or hardly digest their meat, or
are given to casting, or have a Flux or Lask:
Those that are a little sowr and harsh used in
that manner are fittest: Sweet Apples loosen
the Belly and drive forth Worms; Sowr Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
stop the Belly, and provoke Urin 3 and
Crabs for this purpose are fittest: The sweet
Apples as the Pippin and Pearmain, help to
dissolve Melancholly humors, and to procure
Mirth, and therfore are fittest for <hi>Confectio
Alkerimes,</hi> and <hi>Syrupus de Pomis.</hi> The Leavs
boyled and given to drink in hot Agues, where
the heat of the Liver and Stomach causeth the
Lips to break out, and the Throat to grow dry,
harsh and furred, is very good to wash and
gargle it withal, and to drink down som. This
may to good purpose be used when better
things are not at hand, or cannot be had. The
Juyce of Crabs either Verjuyce or Cider, is
of singular good use in the Heat and faintings
of the Stomach, and against Casting to make
a Posset with, or taken som of it alone by it
self. The Juyce of Crabs, or Cider applied
with wet cloaths therein to scalded<note place="margin">Scalding, Burning, Eyes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation ulcers, Spots, Freckles.</note> or burnt
places, cooleth, healeth, and draweth sorih the
Fire. A rotten Apple applied to Eyes blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shotten,
or enflamed with heat, or that are
black and blue about them by any stroke or
fall, and bound too all day or night, helpeth
them quickly. The distilled Water of rotten
Apples doth cool the heat and inflamations of
Sores, and is good to bath foul creeping Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and to wash the Face to take away Spots,
Freckles or other discolorings. The distilled
Water of good and sound Apples is of special
good use to procure Mirth, and expel Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly.
The Ointment called <hi>Pomatum,</hi> if
sweet and well made, helpeth the Chops in the
Lips or Hands,<note place="margin">Chaps in the Lips &amp; Hands</note> and maketh smooth and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p>Thus my Authors.</p>
               <p>All that I can say of Apples is this:</p>
               <p>1 That they are extream windy.</p>
               <p>2 That they provoke Urin, being roasted
(especially Pomwaters) and mixed with fair
Water, and drunk up at night going to bed;
half a dozen great ones mixed with a quart of
Water, excellently provokes Urin, if there be
no material stone in the Body: This I had of

alwaies with good success. All Apples loosen

put into sundry Triacles for that purpose:

either green or dry; either the Herb,
the Root, or the Flowers in Broth drunk, or
Meat, or made into Conserve, Syrup, Water
Electuary, or Pouder as every one may best
frame themselvs unto, or as the time or season
requireth, taken any of the aforesaid waies. It
helpeth the Jaundice, Falling-sickness, the
Palsie, Convulsions or shrinking of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news,
the Gout, and those that are inclined to
Dropsies, those that have continual Pains in
their Head, although it turn to Phrensie. The
Pouder mixed with pure Honey is no less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable
for al sorts of Coughs or Colds,
Wheesing or shortness of Breath, Distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of thin Rhewm upon the Lungues, which
causeth Consumptions. The Decoction made
with Mead and a little Penyroyal, is good for
those that are troubled with putrid Agues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Quotidian, Tertian, or Quartan, and to
draw down and evacuate the Blood and humors
that by falling into the Eyes do hinder the
Sight: The Decoction therof made in Wine

Obstructions both of the Spleen and
Liver, careth Stitches and Pains in the Back,
or Sides the Torments and griping pains of
the Bowels, and the wind Chollick: and
mixed with Honey purgeth the Belly, helpeth
to bring down Womens Courses, and is of
especial use for those that are troubled with the
falling down of the Mother, and pains therof
and causeth an easie and speedy delivery of
Women in Childbirth: it helpeth also to
break and expel the Stone either in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or Kidneys. The Decoction with Wine
gargled in the Mouth, easeth the Toothach.
It is commended against the sting or biting
or Venemous Serpents or Mad Dogs. Being
used inwardly and applied outwardly to the
place. A dram of the Pouder in Betony taken
with a little Honey in some Vinegar, doth
wonderfully refresh those that are overwearied
by travail; it staieth bleedings at the Mouth
or Nose, and helpeth those that pise or spit
Blood, and those that are Bursten or have a
Rupture, and is good for such as are bruised
by any fall or otherwise. The green Herb
bruised, or the Juyce applied to any inward
hurt or outward green Wound in the Head or
Body wil quickly heal and close it up; as also
any Veins or Sinews that are cut; and will
draw forth any broken Bone, or Splinter,
Thorn or other thing gotten into the Flesh:
It is no less profitable for old Sores, or filthy
Ulcers, yea, though they be Fistulaus and
hollow, but some do advise to put in a little
Salt to this purpose: Being applied with a
little Hogs Lard, it helpeth a Plague-Sore,
and other Boyls and Pushes: The fumes of
the Decoction while it is warm received by a
Funnel into the Bars, caseth the pains of them,
destroyeth the Worms, and cureth the running
Sores in them. The Juyce dropped into them
doth the same. The Root of Betony is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
both to the tast and Stomach, whereas
the Leavs and Flowers by their sweet and spicy

Root, do clens old and filthy Sores, are good
against al fretting and running Cankers, Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes,
and Tetters, and therfore the Berries
are by some Country People called Tetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Berries.
The Root clenseth the Skin wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
from al black and blow Spots, Freckles,
Morphew, Leprosie, soul Scars, or other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
whatsoever: as also al running Scabs,

dried Root, or the Juyce therof, but especially
by the fine white hardned Juyce: The distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Berries, green at the first, and of a yellowish

deeply gashed Leavs lying on the ground,
round about the Head of the Root; the ends
of each Gash or Jag on both sides looking
downwards towards the Root, the middle rib
being white which broken yieldeth abundance
of bitter Milk, but the Root much more: from
among the Leavs which alwaies abide green,
arise many slender, weak, naked Footstalks,
every one of them bearing at the top one large
yellow Flower, consisting of many rows of
yellow Leavs, broad at the points and nicked
in, with a deep spot of yellow in the middle,
which growing ripe, the green Husk wherin
the Flower stood, turneth it self down to the
Stalk, and the Head of down becometh as
round as a Ball, with long reddish Seed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
bearing a part of the Down on the Head
of every one, which together is blown away
with the Wind, or may be at once blown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

chops of the Fundament. It is also profitable
against the Poyson of Venemous Creatures.
The distilled Water of <hi>Mints</hi> is available to
all the purposes aforesaid, yet more weakly.</p>
                  <p>But if a Spirit thereof be rightly and Chimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
drawn, it is much more powerful than the
Herb it self. <hi>Simeon Sethi</hi> saith, It helpeth a
cold Liver, strengthneth the Belly and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,

of the Heart, provoketh Appetite, taketh away
Obstructions of the Liver, and stirreth up Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Lust: But thereof too much must not be
taken, becaus it maketh the Blood thin and
wheyish, and turneth it into Choller, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chollerick persons must obstain from it.</p>
                  <p>It is is a safe Medicine for the biting of a
Mad Dog, being bruised with Salt and laid
thereon. The Pouder of it being dried and
taken after Meat helpeth digestion, and those
that are Splenetick: taken with Wine it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
Women in their Sore Travail in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing;
It is good against the Gravel and
and Stone in the Kidneys, and the Strangury.
Being smelled unto, it is comfortable for the
Head and Memory. The Decoction thereof
gargled in the Mouth cureth the Gums and
Mouth that is sore, and mendeth an ill savou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Breath: as also with Rue and Coriander,
causeth the Pallat of the Mouth that is down
to return to his place, the Decoction being
gargled and held in the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>The Vertues of the wild or Hors <hi>Mints,</hi>
such as grow in Ditches (whose Description
I purposely omitted in regard they are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

in the Stomach, to help the Chollick, and
those that are short winded, and are an especial
Remedy for those that have Venerious Dreams
and pollutions in the Night being outwardly
applied to the Testicles or Cods. The Juyce
dropped into the Ears easeth the pains of them,
and destroyeth the Worms that breed therein.
They are good against the Venemous biting
of Serpents. The Juyce laid on warm helpeth
the Kings Evil, or Kernels in the Throat:
The Decoction or distilled Water helpeth a
stinking Breath proceeding from the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Teeth; and snuffed up into the
Nose purgeth the Head. <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, That
eating of the Leavs hath been found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience

their Courses, being taken inwardly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
either alone or with other convenient
Herbs in a decoction to bath them, or sit over
the hot fumes therof, and by the frequent use
thereof it taketh away barrenness, and the
wind and pains of the Mother.<note place="margin">Terms provokes, Barrenness Womb, Wind, Mother, Cough, Rhewms, Vertigo, Cramp, Cold ach, Difficulty of breath, Bruises, Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids, Scabby Heads.</note> It is also used
in pains of the Head coming of any cold caus,
as Catarrh's, Rhewms, and for swimming
and giddiness thereof, and is of especial use
for the windiness of the Stomach and Belly.
It is effectual for any Cramps or cold aches to
dissolve the cold and wind that afflicteth the
place, and is used for Colds, Coughs, and
shortness of breath. The Juyce thereof drunk
in Wine is profitable for those that are bruised
by any accident. The green Herb bruised and
applied to the Fundament, and lying there
two or three hours, easeth the pains of the
Piles. The Juyce also being made up into an
Oyntment, is effectual for the same purpose:
The head washed with a Decoction thereof, it
taketh away Scabs; and may be effectual for
other parts of the Body also.</p>

to settle the Pallate of the Mouth in its place,
and to heal and temper the Inflamations and

And that it stayeth the sharpness of Humors

performeth the same effect. It is used out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
to cool any heat or Inflamation upon
any Hurt or Wound, and easeth the pains of
them: as also to heal Scaldings or Burnings:
The Juyce thereof beaten with some green
Sallet Oyl, and anointed: The Leaf also brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and laid to any green Wound in the Hands
or Legs, doth heal them quickly; and being
bound to the Throat, much helpeth the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
It helpeth also Ruptures and Burstiness.</p>
                  <p>If you pleas to make the Juyce into a Syrup
with Honey or Sugar, you may safely take a
spoonful or two at a time (let my Author say
what he will) for a Quinsie, and you shall find
the Medicine more pleasant, and the Cure
more speedy, than if you took a Dogs-turd
which is the Learned Colledges vulgar

It is held an especial Remedy for those that are
troubled with the Phtisick, or Consumption
of the Lungs, or Ulcers in the Lungs, or
Coughs that come of heat. The Decoction
or Pouder of the Roots or Seed, is much more
binding for all the purposes aforesaid than the
Leavs. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> saith, That three Roots
boyled in Wine and taken helpeth the Tertian
Ague, and four the Quartan Ague: But (let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
pass the number as Fabulous) I conceive
the Decoction of divers Roots may be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
The Herb (but especially the Seed) is
held to be profitable: against the Dropsie, the
Falling-sickness, the yellow Jaundice, and stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
of the Liver and Reins. The Roots of
Plantane and Pellitory of Spain beaten to
Pouder and put into hollow Teeth, taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the pains of them: The clarified Juyce or
distilled Water dropped into the Eyes cooleth
the Inflamations in them, and taketh away the
Pin and Web; and dropped into the Ears
easeth pains in them, and helpeth and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the Hearing: The same also with
Juyce of Housleek is profitable against all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations
and breakings out in the skin, and
against Burnings or Scaldings by fire or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Juyce or Decoction made either of
it self or other things of like nature is of much
use and good effect for old and hollow Ulcers
that are hard to be cured, and for Cankers and
Sores in the Mouth or privy parts of Man or
Woman; and helpeth also the pains of the
Piles in the Fundament. The Juyce mixed
with Oyl of Roses, and the Temples and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
anointed therewith, easeth the pains of
the Head proceeding from heat, and helpeth
Lunatick, and Phrenetick persons very much;
as also the bitings of Serpents or a Mad Dog:
The same also is profitably applied to all hot
Gouts in the Feet or Hands, especially in the
beginning. It is also good to be applied where
any Bone is out of Joynt to hinder Inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Swellings and Pains that presently rise
thereupon. The Pouder of the dried Leavs
taken in drink, killeth Worms of the Belly,
and boyled in Wine killeth Worms that breed
in old and foul Ulcers. One part of Plantane
Water, and two parts of the brine of pouder'd
Beef boyled together and clarified, is a most
sure Remedy to heal all spreading Scabs and
Itch in the Head or Body, all manner of Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Ringworms, the Shingles, and all other
running and fretting Sores. Briefly the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes
are singular good Wound Herbs to heal
fresh, or old Wounds and Sores either inward
or outward.</p>
                  <p>Its true <hi>Myzaldus</hi> and others yea almost all
Astrologo-Physitians hold this to be an Herb
of <hi>Mars,</hi> and they give a verisimile of a truth
for it too, <hi>Viz.</hi> becaus it cures diseases of the
Head and privities which are under the Houses
of <hi>Mars, Aries,</hi> and <hi>Scorpio:</hi> All Diseases
of the Head comming of heat are caused by
<hi>Mars,</hi> for <hi>Venus</hi> is made of no such hot met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or at least deals in inferior parts. The
truth is, it is under the command of <hi>Venus,</hi> and
cures the Head by Antipathy to <hi>Mars,</hi> and the
Privities by Sympathy to <hi>Venus,</hi> neither is
there hardly a Martial Diseas but it cures, If
I were to fortisie my Body against a Martial

                  <p>The white <hi>Poppy</hi> hasth at first four or five
whitish green Leavs lying upon the ground,
which rise with the Stalk, compassing it at the
bottom of them, and are very large, much cut
or torn in on the edges, and dented also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides:
The Stalk which is usually four or five
foot high, hath somtimes no Branches at the
top, &amp; usually but two or three at most bearing
every one but one Head, wrapped in a thin
Skin, which boweth down before it be ready
to blow, and then rising and being broken, the
Flower within it spreadeth it self open, and
consisteth of four very large White round
Leavs, with many whitish round threds in the
middle, set about a small round green Head,
having a Crown, or Star-like cover at the
Head thereof, which growing ripe becometh
as large as a great Apple. wherein are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a great number of smal round Seed, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
partitions or devisions next unto the
shell, the middle thereof remaining hollow
and empty. All the whol Plant, both Leavs,
Stalks and Heads, while they are fresh, yong,
and green, yield a Milk when they are broken,
of an unpleasant bitter tast, almost ready to
provoke casting, and of a strong, heady smel,
which being condensate is called <hi>Opium.</hi> The
Root is white, and woody, perishing as soon
as it hath given ripe Seed.</p>
                  <p>The Black Poppy little differeth from the
former, until it beareth his Flower, which is
somwhat less, and of a black Purplish colour,
but without any purple spots in the bottom of
the Leaf. The Head of Seed is much less than
the former, and openeth it self a little round
about the top under the Crown, so that the
Seed which is very black will fall out if one
turn the Head thereof downwards.</p>
                  <p>The wild <hi>Poppy,</hi> or Corn Rose, hath long
and narrow Leavs very much cut in on the ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
into many devisions, of a light green co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and somtimes hairy withal; The Stalk
is blackish and hairy also, but not so tall as the
Garden kinds, having some such like Leavs
thereon as grow below, parted into three or
four Branches somtimes, whereon grow smal
hairy Heads bowing down before the Skin
break, wherein the Flower is inclosed, which
when it is ful blown open, is of a fair yellowish
red or crimson colour, and in some much paler,
without any spot in the bottom of the Leavs,
having many black soft threds in the middle
compassing a smal green Head, which when it

wherin is contained much black Seed, smaller
by half than that of the Garden.The Root pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth

                  <p>The Garden <hi>Poppy</hi> Heads with Seeds made
into a Syrup, is frequently and to good effect
used to procure rest and sleep in the sick and
weak, and to stay Catarrh's and Defluxions
of hot thin Rhewms from the Head into the
Stomach, and upon the Lungs, causing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Cough, the Fore-runner of a Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It helpeth also Hoarsness of the Throat,
and when one hath lost their voice, which the
Oyl of the Seed doth likewise. The black Seed
boyled in Wine and drunk; is said also to stay
the Flux of the Belly and Womens Courses.
The empty thels of the Poppy Heads are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
boyled in water and given to procure rest
and sleep; so do the Leavs in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;

                  <p>The White and the Red <hi>Roses</hi> are cooling
and drying, yet the White is taken to exceed
the Red in both those properties, but is seldom
used inwardly in any Medicine. The bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Roses when they are fresh, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Juyce purgeth Choller, and watery Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,<note place="margin">Choller, &amp; Waterish Humors, Headach, Pains in the Ears, Eyes, Throat &amp; Gums, Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, &amp; Matrix.

but being dried and that heat which
caused the bitterness being consumed, they
have then a binding and astringent quality;
Those also that are not ful blown do both cool
and bind more than those that are full blown,
and the White Roses more than the Red. The
Decoction of Red Roses made with Wine and
used, is very good for the Headach, and pains
in the Eyes, Ears, Throat, and Gums, as also
for the Fundament, the lower Bowels, and
the Matrix, being bathed, or put into them.
The same Decoction with the Roses remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in it is profitably applyed to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Heart to eas the Inflamation therin;
as also St. Anthonies fire, and other Diseases
of the Stomach. Being dried and beaten to
Pouder, and taken in steeled Wine or Water,
it helpeth to stay Womens Courses. The yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
threds in the middle of the red Roses (W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
are erroniously called the Rose Seeds) being
poudered and drunk in the distilled water of
Quinces, stayeth the overflowing of Womens
Courses, and doth wonderfully stay the Deflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions
of Rhewm upon the Gums and Teeth,
preserving them from corruption, and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them if they be loose, being washed and
gargled therewith, and some Vinegar of Squils
added thereto. The Heads with Seed being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Pouder or in a decoction, stayeth the
Lask, and spitting of Blood. Red Roses do
strengthen the Heart, the Stomack, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and the retentive Faculties, they mitigate
the pains that arise from Heat, asswage Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
procure rest and sleep, stay both
Whites and Reds in Women, the Gonorrhea,
running of the Reins, and the Fluxes of the
Belly; The Juyce of them doth purge and
clens the Body from Choller and Flegm: The
Husks of the Roses with the Beards and Nails
of the Roses are binding and cooling, and the
Distilled Water of either of them is good for
the Heat and redness in the Eyes, and to stay
and dry up the Rhewms and watering of them.
Of the Red Roses are usually made many
Compositions all serving to sundry good uses;
<hi>Viz.</hi> Electuary of Roses; Conserve both
moist and dry, which is more usually called Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
of Roses; Syrup of dryed Roses, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of Roses; The Cordial Pouder called
<hi>Diarhodon Abhatis',</hi> and <hi>Aromatica Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi>
The Distilled Water of Roses, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar

                  <p>To write at large of every one of these would

sufficient for a weak Constitution; but may
be encreased to six drams according to the
strength of the Patient.

without trouble, and is good in hot Feavers,
and pains of the Head arising from hot Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick
Humors, and heat in the Eyes, the
Jaundice also, and Joynt Aches proceeding of
hot Humors. The moist Conserve is of much
use, both binding and Cordial, for until it be
about two years old it is more binding than
Cordial, and after that, more Cordial than
Binding: Some of the yonger Conserve taken
with <hi>Methridatum</hi> mixed together, is good
for those that are troubled with Distillations
of Rhewm from the Brain to the Nose, and
Defluxions of Rhewm into the Eyes, as also
for Fluxes, end Lasks of the Belly; and being
mixed with the Pouder of Mastick is very
good for the Running of the Reins, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loosness of Humors in the Body. The old
Conserve mixed with <hi>Aromaticum Rosarum</hi>
is a very good Cordial against Faintings,
Swounings, Weakness, and Tremblings of the
Heart, strengthning both it, and a weak Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
helpeth digestion, stayeth casting, and
is a very good Preservative in the time of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
The dry Conserve which is called
Sugar of Roses, is a very good Cordial to
strenthen the Heart and Spirits; as also to stay
Defluxions. The Syrup of dried Red Roses
strengthneth a Stomack given to casting, coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
an overheated Liver and the Blood in
Agues, comforreth the Heart and resisteth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresaction
and infection, and helpeth to stay
Lasks and Fluxes. Honey of Roses is much
used in Gargles and Lotions to wash Sores ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Mouth, Throat, or other parts,
both to clens and heal them, and to stay the
Fluxes of Humors falling upon them; it is
also used in Clisters both to cool and clens.
The Cordial Pouders called <hi>Diarhodon Abba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
and <hi>Aromaticum Rosarum</hi> do comfort and
strengthen the Heart and Stomach, procure
an Appetite, help Digestion, stayeth Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
and is very good for those that have slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
Bowels to strengthen them, and to dry up
their moisture. Red Rose Water is of well
known and familiar use in all occasions (and
better than Damask Rose Water) being coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Cordial, refreshing and quickning
the weak and faint Spirits, used either in meats
or broths, to wash the Temples, or to smel to

the Head also against pain and ach. for which

use, and to procure rest and sleep,<note place="margin">Procure Sleep,</note> if some

to anoint the forhead &amp; temples, &amp; being mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Vnguenium Populeon,</hi> to procure rest;
as also it is used for the heat of the Liver, of

of Humors unto Sores, but is also put into
Oyntments and Plaisters that are cooling and
binding, and restraining the Flux of Humors.
The dried Leavs of the Red. Roses are used
both inward and outwardly, both cooling,
binding, and Cordial, for with them are made
both <hi>Aromaticum Rosarum, Diarhodon Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batis,</hi>

a Fomentation to the Region of the Liver and
Heart, doth much cool and temper them, and
also serveth instead of a Rose Cake (as is said
before) to quiet the over hot spirits and cause
rest and sleep. The Syrup of Damask Roses
is both Simple and Compound, and made
with Agrick. The Simple Solutive Syrup, is
a familiar, safe, gentle, and easie Medicine,
purging Choller,<note place="margin">Purge Choller,</note>

Humors, and available against the Lepry, Itch,
Tetters,<note place="margin">Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chollick, Humors, Lepry, Itch Tetters, French Pox,</note> &amp;c. and the French Diseas: Also

Leavs of these Roses are also operative, in
gently opening the Belly. The Simple Water
of the Damask Roses is chiefly used for fumes

to make sweet Pouders, and fill sweet Bags,
and little use they are put to in Physick, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

Saxifrage</hi> groweth up with diverse long
Stalks of winged Leavs, set directly opposite
one to another on both sides, each being som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
broad, a little pointed and dented about
the edges, of a sad green colour. At the tops
of the Stalks stand Umbels of white Flowers,
after which comes small and blackish Seed:
The Root is long and whitish, abiding long.</p>
                  <p>Our lesser <hi>Burnet Saxifrage,</hi> hath much finer
Leaves than the former, and very smal, and
set one against another, deeply jagged about
the edges, and of the same colour as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
The Umbels of Flowers are white, and
the Seed very small, and so is the Root, being
also somwhat hot and quick in tast.</p>

which upon the breaking may be plainly seen:
from among which rise up divérse hairy green

the Decoction of the Herb dry or green, be
made with Wine, and drunk for some time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
four ounces of the clarified Juyce of

The Juyce or Decoction drunk, helpeth also
Scabs and breakings out in Itch and the like:
The Juyce also made up into an Oyntment

The same also helpeth all inward Wounds by
the drying, clensing, and healing quality ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
A Syrup made of the Juyce and Sugar is

so is the distilled water of the Herb and Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers

when the green Herb is not in force to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
The Decoction of the Herb and Roots

Also it consumes the Flegmatick Humors, the
cold and moist coustitution of Winter most
usually infects the Body of Man with, and that
was the first reason of eating Tansies in the
Spring, at last the world being over run with
Popery, a Monster called <hi>Superstition</hi> perks
up his head, and as a just Judgment of God
obscures the bright beams of Knowledge by his
dismal looks (Pysitians seeing the Pope and
his Imps selfish they began to be so too) and
now forsooth Tansies must be eaten only on
Palm and Easter Sundaies, and their neighbor
daies; as last Superstion being too hot to
hold, and the selfishness of Physitians walking
in the clouds, after the Fryars and Monks had
made the people ignorant, the Superstion of
the time was found out, but the Vertue of
the Herb hidden, and now 'tis almost, if not
altogether, left off: Surely our Physitians are
beholding to none so much as they are to
Monks and Fryars, for want of eating this

                  <p>THree <hi>Wormwoods</hi> are familiar with us;
One I shall not descsrabe, another I shall
describe, and the Third be Critical at. And
I care not greatly if I begin with the last
first.</p>
                  <p>Sea <hi>Wormwood</hi> hath gotten as many Names
as Vertues (and perhaps one more) <hi>Scriphion,
Santonicon, Belgicum, Narbonense, Xantomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,
Misnense,</hi> and a matter of twenry more,
which I will not blot Paper withal: A Papist
got the Toy by the end, and he called it <hi>Holy
Wormwood;</hi> and in truth I am of Opinion,
Their giving so much holiness to Herbs is the
Reason there remains so little in themselves.</p>
                  <p>The Seed of this <hi>Wormwood</hi> is that which
usually Women give their Children for the
Worms: Of all <hi>Wormwoods</hi> that grow here,
this is the weakest; I but Doctors commend
it, and Apothecaries sell it, the one must keep
his Credit, and the other get Money, and
that's the key of the work. The Herb is good
for somthing, because God made nothing in
vain; Will you give me leave to weigh things
in the Ballance of Reason; Then thus, The
Seeds of the common Wormwood are far more
prevalent than the Seed of this, to expell
Worms in Children, or People of ripe age:
Of both, some are weak, some are strong.
The <hi>Seriphian</hi> Wormseed is the weakest, &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
may prove to be fittest for weakest Bodies
(for it is weak enough in all conscience) Let
such as are strong take the common Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed,
for the other will do but little good. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
neer the Sea many people live, and
<hi>Seriphium</hi> grows neer them, and therfore is
more fitting for their Bodies because nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by the same Air; and this I had from
Dr. <hi>Reason.</hi> In whose Body Dr. <hi>Reason</hi> dwels
not, dwels Dr.<hi>Madness,</hi> and he brings in his
Brethren, Dr. <hi>Ignorance,</hi> Dr. <hi>Folly,</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Sickness,</hi> and these together make way for Dr.
<hi>Death,</hi> and the latter end of that man is worse
than the beginning. Pride was the cause of
<hi>Adam's</hi> Fall, Pride begate a Daughter, I do
not know the Father of it unless the Divil, but
she christned it, and call'd it <hi>Appetite,</hi> and
sent her Daughter to tast these Wormwoods,
who finding this the least bitter, made the
sqeamish Wench extol it to the Skies, though
the Vertues of it never reached to the middle
Region of the Air. Its due praise is this; It
is weakest, therefore fitter for weak Bodies,
and fitter for those Bodies that dwell neer it
than those that live far from it: my reason is,
The Sea (as those that live far from it, know
when they comt neer it) casteth not such a
smel as the Land doth: The tender Mercies
of God being over all his Works, hath by his
eternal Providence planted <hi>Seriphium</hi> by the
Sea side, as a fit Medicine for the Bodies of
those that live neer it. Lastly, It is known
to all that know any thing in the Course of
Nature, That the Liver delights in sweet
things; if so, it abhors bitter; then if your
Liver be weak, it is none of the wisest courses
to plague it with an Enemy: if the Liver be
weak a Consumption follows; Would you
know the Reason? 'tis this, A mans Flesh is
repaired by Blood, by a third concoction
which transmutes Blood into Flesh ('tis well I
said [Conction] for if I had said [Boyling]
every Cook would have understood me.) The
Liver makes Blood, and if it be weakned that it
makes not enough the Flesh wasteth, and why
must Flesh alwaies be renewed? Because the
eternal God when he made the Creation, made
one part of it in continual dependency upon
another: And why did he so? Because Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is only Permanent, to teach us, That we
should not fix our affections upon what is
transitory, but upon what endures for ever.
The result of all is this, If the Liver be weak
and cannot make Blood enonough (I would
have said [Sanguifie] if I had written only to
Schollers) The <hi>Seriphian</hi> which is the weakest
of Wormwoods is better than the best. I
have been Critical enonough (if not too

I must take leave; Wormnwood is an
Herb of <hi>Mars,</hi> and if <hi>Pontanus</hi> say otherwise
he is beside the Bridg. I prove it thus: What
delights in Martial places is a Martial Herb,
But Wormwood delights in Martial places,
(for about Forges and Iron Works you may
gather a Cart load of it) <hi>Ergo</hi> it is a Martial
Herb. It is hot and dry in the first degree,

It remedies the evils Choller<note place="margin">Choller,</note> can inflict on

brown Papers, sewing the Paper up like a

shines upon them that so they may be dry, for
if you gather either Herbs or Flowers when
they are wet or <hi>dewy,</hi> they will not keep, and

the plants where they delight to grow.</item>

and forget not the Coelestial Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
before mentioned, for I have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that their Vertues are twice as great
at such times than at others: There is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time for every thing under the Sun.</item>

a little, and but a little in the Sun before you
lay them up.</item>

them so neer the fire as the other before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
because they are fuller of Spirit, and
therefore not so subject to corrupt.</item>

they will keep good many yeers, yet this
I say, they are best the first yeer, and this I
make appear by a good argument, They will
grow soonest the first yeer they be set, therefore
then are they in their prime, and 'tis an easie
matter to renew them yeerly.</item>

neither in softness nor hardness.</item>
                     <item>2. Give me leave to be a little critical a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Vulgar received Opinion, which
is, That the Sap falls down into the Root in
Autumn, and rises again in Spring, as men
go to Bed at night and rise in the morning;
and this idle tale of untruth is so grounded in
the Heads not only of the Vulgar but also of
the Learned, that a man cannot drive it out by
Reason: I pray let such Sap-mongers answer
me to this Argument, If the Sap fall into the
Root in the fall of the Leaf, and lie there all
the Winter, then must the Root grow only in
the Winter, as experience witnesseth, but the
Root grows not at all in the Winter, as the
sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>c experience teacheth, but only in the
Summer. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                        <p>If you set an Apple Kernel in the Spring,
you shall find the Root to grow to a pretty
bigness in that Summer, and be not a whit
bigger next Spring: What doth the Sap do in
the Root all that while? pick straws? For
God's sake build not your faith upon Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
'tis as rotten as a rotten Post.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, when the <hi>Sun</hi> declines from the
Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> the Sap begins to congeal
both in Root and Branch, when he toucheth
the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn</hi> and ascends to us
ward, it begins to wax thin again, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
as it congealed: But to proceed:</p>

                     <item>3. The dryer time you gather your Roots in

moisture in then.</item>
                     <item>4. Such Roots as are soft, your best way is
to dry in the Sun, or else hang them up in the
Chimney corner upon a string; as for such as
are hard you may dry them any where.</item>
                     <item>5. Such Roots as are great will keep longer
than such as are small, yet most of them will
keep a yeer.</item>
                     <item>6. Such Roots as are soft it is your best way
to keep them alwaies neer the fire, and take
this general Rule, If in Winter time you find
any of your Roots, Herbs or Flowers begin to
grow moist, as many times you shall, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Winter time (for 'tis your best way
to look to them once a month) dry them by a
very gentle fire, or if you can with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
keep them neer the fire, you may save
your self the labor.</item>
                     <item>7. It is in vain to dry such Roots as may
commonly be had, as Parsly, Fennel, Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane

Exoticks here, I shall pass them without any
more words.</item>

the Spring, if it be of great Trees, as Oaks or
the like, because then they come easiest off, and
so you may dry them if you please, but indeed
your best way is to gather all Barks only for
present use.</item>

thus to be gotten, Take the Roots of such
Herbs as have a pith in them, as Parsly, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
&amp;c. slit them in the middle, and when
you have taken out the pith (which you may
easily and quickly do) that which remains is
called (though somthing improperly) the

out of some Stalks, and tender tops of Herbs
and Plants, and also out of some Flowers.</item>
                     <item>2. Having gathered your Herb you would
preserve the Juyce of, when it is very dry (for
otherwise your Juyce will not be worth a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton)
bruise it very well in a stone Mortar
with a wooden Pestle, then having put it into
a Canvas Bag (the Herb I mean, not the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
for that will yield but little Juyce) press it
hard in a press, then take the Juyce and clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it.</item>
                     <item>3. The manner of clarifying of it is this,
put it into a Pipkin or Skillet, or some such
thing and set it over the fire, and when the
Scum riseth, take it off, let it stand over the
fire till no more Scum rise, then have you your
Juyce clarified, cast away the Scum as a thing
of no use.</item>
                     <item>4. When you have thus clarified it, you have
two waies to preserve it all the yeer.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>First, When it is cold put it into a Glass,
and put so much Oyl on it as will cover it the
thickness of two fingers, the Oyl will swim at
top, and so keep the Air from coming to it to
purrifie it; when you in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>end to use it, do no
more but so, powr out into a Porrenger, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more than you intend to use, and if any
Oyl come out with it (as if the Glass be not
full 'tis a hundred to one it there do) you may
easily scum it off with a Spoon, and put the
Juyce you use not, into the Glass again it will
quickly sink under the Oyl: This is the first
way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The second way is a little more
difficult, and the Juyce of Fruits is usually
preserved this way, when you have clarified
the Juyce as before, boyl it over the fire, till
(being cold) it be of the thickness of Honey,
this is most commonly used for Diseases of the
mouth, and is called <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are in their greatest vigor, and so ought
the Flowers also.</item>

people use, because they know no better, is in a
Peuter Still, and although Distilled Waters
are the weakest of all Artificial Medicines, and
good for little unless for mixtures of other
Medicines, yet this way distilled they are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

impossible to teach you the way of distilling

                        <item>5. When you have distilled your Water put
it into a Glass, and having bound the top of
it over with a Paper pricked full of holes, that
so the excrementitious and fiery vapors may
exhale (which indeed are they that cause that
setling in distilled Waters called the Mother,
which corrupts the Waters and might this way
be prevented) cover it close and keep it for
your use.</item>
                        <item>6. Stopping distilled Waters with a Cork
makes them musty, and so will a Paper also if
it do but touch the Water, your best way then


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41525:83"/>
is to stop them with a Bladder, being first wet
in Water, and bound over the top of the
Glass.</item>

and Juyce; and 1. for the more grateful

                        <p>Of each of these (for your Instruction sake
kind Country men and women) I speak a
word, or two or three apart.</p>
                        <p>First, Syrups made by Infusion are usually
made of Flowers, and of such Flowers,
as soon lose both colour and strength
by boyling, as Roses, Violets, Peach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Flowers.
&amp;c. my Translation of the
<hi>London Dispensatory</hi> will instruct you in
the rest: They are thus made, having
picked your Flowers clean, to every
pound of them ad three pound (of three
pints, which you will for it is all one)
of Spring Water made boyling hot by
the fire, first put your Flowers in a Peu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pot with a cover, then powr the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to them, then shutting the Pot, let it
stand by the fire to keep hot twelve
hours, then strain it out (in such Syrups
as p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ge, as Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ask Roses, Peach-Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
&amp;c. the usual and indeed the best
way is to repeat this Infusion, adding
fresh Flowers to the same Liquor diverse
rimes that so it may be the stronger) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
strained it out, put the Infusion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Peuter Bason, or an Eartlien one
well glassed, and to every pint of it, ad
two pound of fine Sugar, which being
only melted over the fire without boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and scummed, will produce you the
Syrup you desire.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Syrups made by Decoction are
usually used of Compounds, yet may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Simple Herb be thus converted into
Syrup; Take the Herb, Root, or Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
you would make into Syrup and bruise
it a little, then boyl it in a convenient
quantity of Spring Water, the more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you boyl it in the weaker will it be, a
handful of the Herb, Root, &amp;c. is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
quantity for a pint of Water;
boyl it till half the water be consumed,
then let it stand till it be almost cold, and
strain it (being almost cold) through a
woollen cloth, letting it run out at leisure
without pressing, to every pint of this
Decoction ad one pound of Sugar and
boyl it over the fire till it come to a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup,
which you may know if you now
and then cool a little of it in a spoon,
scum it all the while it boyls, and when
it is sufficiently boyled, whilst it is hot
strain it again through a woollen cloth,
but press it not; thus have you the Syrup
perfected.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Syrups made of Juyces are usually
made of such Herbs as are full of Juyce,
and indeed they are better made into a
Syrup this way than any other; the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
is thus, having beaten the
Herb in a stone Mortar with a wooden
Pestle, press out the Juyce and clarifie it
as you were taught before in the Juyces,
then let the Juyce boyl away till a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it (or neer upon) be consumed, to
a pint of this ad a pound of Sugar, and
boyl it to a Syrup, alwaies scumming it,
and when it is boyled enough, strain it
through &amp; woollen cloth as we taught
you before, and keep it for your use.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. If you make Syrups of Roots that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing hard, as Parsley, Fennel, and grass
Roots &amp;c. when you have bruised them, lay
them in steep some time in that Water which
you intend to boyl them in, hot, so will the
Vertue the better come out.</item>
                     <item>4. Keep your Syrups either in Glasses or
stone Pots, and stop them not with Cork,
nor Bladder, unless you would have the Glass
break and the Syrup lost, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and as many Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
as there are in this Nation, I suppose
there are but few or none of this, only bind a
Paper about the Mouth.</item>
                     <item>5. All Syrups if well made will continue a
yeer, with some advantage yet of all, such as
are made by Infusion keep the least while.</item>

for I have nothing to say to Compounds here;
all Compounds have as many several Idea's as
men have crotchets in their Brain) I say
Simple Juleps are thus made: Take a pint of
such distilled Water as conduceth to the cure
of your distemper, which this Treatise will
plentifully furnish you withal, to which add
two ounces of Syrup conducing to the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
(I shall give you Rules for it in the last
Chapter) mix them together and drink a
draught of it at your pleasure; If you love
tart things ad ten drops of Oyl of Vitriol to
your pint and shake it together, and it will
have a fine grateful tast.</item>

Of Decoctions.</head>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. ALL the difference between Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Syrups made by Decoction
is this, Syrups are made to keep, Decoctions
only for present use, for you can hardly keep
a Decoction a week at any time, if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be hot, not half so long.</item>
                     <item>2. Decoctions are made of Leaves, Roots,
Flowers, Seeds, Fruits, or Barks, conducing
to the cure of the Disease you make them for;
in the same manner are they made as we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you in Syrups.</item>
                     <item>3. Decoctions made with Wine last longer
than such as are made with Water, and if you
take your Decoction to clense the passages of
Urine, or open Obstructions, your best way
is to make it with white Wine instead of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
because that is most penetrating.</item>
                     <item>4. Decoctions are of most use in such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
as lie in the Passages of the Body, as the
Stomach, Bowels, Kidneys, Passages of Urine,
and Bladder, because Decoctions pass quicker
to those places than any other form of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</item>
                     <item>5. If you will sweeten your Decoction with
Sugar, or any Syrup fit for the occasion you
take it for which is better, you may and no
harm done.</item>
                     <item>6. If in a Decoction you boyl both Roots,
Herbs, Flowers, and Seeds together, let the
Roots boyl a good while first, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Vertue longest, then the next in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by the same Rule; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Barks,
2. the Herbs, 3. the Seeds, 4. the Flowers,
5. the Spices if you put any in, because their
vertue comes soonest our.</item>
                     <item>7. Such things as by boyling cause sliminess
to a Decoction, as Figs, Quince Seeds, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed
&amp;c. your best way is, after you have brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them, to tie them up in a linnen rag, as you
tie up a Calves Brains, and so boyl them.</item>
                     <item>8. Keep all Decoctions in a Glass close
stopped, and in the cooler place you keep
them, the longer will they last ere they be
sowr.</item>
                  </list>

Patient, the season of the yeer, the strength
of the Medicine, and the quality of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case.</p>

Of Oyles.</head>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. OYL Olive, which is commonly
known by the name of Sallet Oyl, I
suppose because it is usually eaten with Sallets
by them that love it; If it be pressed out of
ripe Olives, according to <hi>Galen</hi> is temperate,
and exceeds in no one quality.</item>
                     <item>2. Of Oyls, some are Simple, and some are
Compound.</item>
                     <item>3. Simple Oyls are such as are made of
Fruits or Seeds, by expression, as Oyl of sweet
and bitter Almonds, Linseed, and Rapeseed
Oyl &amp;c. of which see my <hi>Dispensatory.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. Compound Oyls are made of Oyl of Olives
and other Simples, imagine Herbs, Flowers,
Roots, &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>5. The way of making them is this, Having
bruised the Herbs or Flowers you would make
your Oyl of, put them in an Earthen pot, and
to two or three handfuls of them, powr a pint
of Oyl, cover the pot with a paper, and set it
in the Sun, about a Fortnight or less accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the Sun is in hotness; then having
warmed it very well by the fire, press out the
Herbs &amp;c. very hard in a press, and ad as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more Herbs to the same Oyl, bruised (the
Herbs I mean not the Oyl) in like manner, set
them in the Sun as before, the ostner you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
this the stronger will your Oyl be; at
last when you conceive it strong enough, boyl
both Herbs and Oyl together till the Juyce be
consumed which you may know by its leaving
its bubling, and the Herbs will be crisp, then
strain it, whilst it is hot, and keep it in a stone
or Glass Vessel for your use.</item>
                     <item>6. As for Chymical Oyls, I have nothing
to say in this Treatise.</item>
                     <item>7. The General use of these Oyls is for pain
in the Limbs, roughness of the Skin, the Itch
&amp;c. as also for Oyntments and Plaisters.</item>
                     <item>8. If you have occasion to use it for Wounds
or Ulcers, in two ounces of Oyl, dissolve half
an ounce of Turpentine, the heat of the fire
will quickly do it, for Oyl it self is offensive
to Wounds, and the Turpentine qualifies it.</item>

Of Electuaries.</head>
                  <p>PHysitians make more a quoil than needs
behalf about Electuaries: I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
but one general way of making them up,
as for the Ingredients you may vary them as
you please, and according as you find occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the last Chapter.
<list>
                        <item>1. That you may make Electuaries when
you need them, it is requisite that you keep
alwaies Herbs, Roots, Seeds, Flowers &amp;c.
ready dried in your House, that so you may
be in readiness to beat them into pouder when
you need them.</item>
                        <item>2. Your better way is to keep them whol
than beaten, for being beaten they are the
more subject to lose their strength, because
the Air soon penetrates them.</item>
                        <item>3. If they be not dry enough to beat into
pouder when you need them, dry them by a
gentle fire till they are so.</item>
                        <item>4. Having beaten them, sift them through a
fine Tiffany Searce, that so there may be no
great picces found in your Electuary.</item>
                        <item>5. To on ounce of your Pouder, ad three
ounces of clarified Honey, this quantity I
hold to be sufficient; I confess Authors dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
about it: If you would make more or less
Electuary, vary your proportions accordingly.</item>
                        <item>6. Mix them well together in a Mortar,
and take this for a truth, you cannot mix them
too much.</item>
                        <item>7. The way to clarifie Honey is to set it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the fire in a convenient vessel till the scum
arise, and when the scum is taken off it is cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</item>
                        <item>8. The usual Dose of Cordial Electuaries
is from half a dram to two drams, of purging
Electuaries from half an ounce to an ounce.</item>
                        <item>9. The manner of keeping them is in a
pot.</item>
                        <item>10. The time of taking them, is either in
the morning fasting, and fasting an hour after
them, or at night going to bed three or four
hours after supper.</item>

                     <item>1. THe way of making Conserves is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
one of Herbs and Flowers, and
the other of Fruits.</item>
                     <item>2. Conserves of Herbs and Flowers are
thus made, If you make your Conserves of
Herbs, as of Scurvy-grass, Wormwood, Rue,
or the like, take only the Leaves and tender
tops (for you may beat your heart out before
you can beat the Stalks small) and having bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them, waigh them, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> pound
of them ad three pound of Sugar, beat them
verie well together in a Mortar, you cannot
beat them too much.</item>
                     <item>3. Conserves of Fruits, as of Barberries,
Sloes, and the like is thus made; First scald
the Fruit, then rub the pulp through a thick
hair Sieve made for the purpose, called a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Sieve, you may do it for a need with the
back of a Spoon, then take this Pulp thus
drawn, and ad to it its waight of Sugar and
no more, put it in a Peuter Vessel, and over
a Charcoal fire stir it up and down till the
Sugar be melted, and your Conserve is made.</item>
                     <item>4. Thus have you the way of making Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
the way of keeping of them is in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
pots.</item>
                     <item>5. The Dose is usually the quantity of a
Nutmeg at a time morning and evening, or
(unless they be purging) when you please.</item>
                     <item>6. Of Conserves, some keep many yeers, as
Conserves of Roses, others but a yeer, as
Conserves of Borrage, Bugloss, Cowslips and
the like.</item>
                     <item>7. Have a care of the working of some
Conserves presently after they are made, look
to them once a day and stir them about; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
of Borrage, Bugloss, and Wormwood
have gotten an excellent faculty at that sport.</item>
                     <item>8. You may know when your Conserves are
almost spoiled by this, you shall find a hard
crust at top with little holes in it as though
Worms had been eating there.</item>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. Flowers are but very seldom preserved, I
never saw any that I remember save only
Cowslip Flowers, and that was a great fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Sussex</hi> when I was a boy; It is thus
done, first, take a flat Glass, we call them jarr
Glasses, strew in a lain of fine Sugar, on that
a lain of Flowers, on that another lain of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
on that another lain of Flowers, do so til
your Glass be full, then tie it over with a paper,
and in a little time you shall have very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and pleasant Preserves.

                           </gap> boyl the Water
with its like waight of Sugar into a Syrup, put
the Syrup into a Pot, and put the boyled Fruit
as whol as you left it when you cut it into it,
and let it so remain till you have occasion to
use it.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. Roots are thus preserved, First, scrape
them very clean, and clense them from the

not, as Eringo and the like, boyl them in
Water till they be soft as we s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such as are bitter, say Authors, must be soaked
in warm Water, often times changed till their

my reason is, because I doubt when their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness
is gone, so is their Vertue also; I shall
then prescribe one common way, namely the
same with the former, <hi>viz.</hi> First boyl them

keep the Barks in the Syrup.</p>

which is easiest to be made, and therefore
most beneficial to people that are ignorant in
Physick, for whose sakes I write this; It is
thus done,
<p>Bruise those Herbs, Flowers, or Roots you
would make an Oyntment of, and to two
handfuls of your bruised Herbs ad a pound of
Hogs Grease tryed, or clensed from the skins,
beat them very well together in a stone Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
with a wooden Pestle, then put it in a
stone Pot (the Herbs and Grease I mean, not
the Mortar) cover it with a paper, and set it
either in the Sun or some other warm place
three, four, or fivs daies, that it may melt, then
take it out and boyl it a little, then whilst it is
hot, strain it out, pressing it out very hard in
a Press, to this Grease ad as many more Herbs
bruised as before, let them stand in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:41525:85"/>
as long, then boyl them as you did the
former, if you think your Oyntment be not
strong enough you may do it the third and
fourth time; yet this I tell you, the fuller of
Juyce your Herbs are, the sooner will your
Oyntment be strong, the last time you boyl
it, boyl it so long till your Herbs be crisp and
the Juyce consumed, then strain it, pressing
it hard in a press, and to every pound of
Oyntment, ad two ounces of Turpentine, and
as much Wax, because Grease is offensive to
Wounds as well as Oyl,</p>

I rather think they were done up in this hard
form that so they might be the longer in dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
and my Opinion is grounded upon
Reason too, not upon Fancy nor Hear-say;
The first invention of Pills was to purge the
Head, now as I told you before, such Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
as lay neer the passages, were best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
by Decoctions, because they pass to
the grieved part soonest, so here, if the insir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
lie in the Head or any other remote part,
the best way is to use Pills, because they are
longer in digestion, and therefore the better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to call the offending Humor to them.</item>
                     <item>4. If I should tell you here a long Tale of
Medicines working by Sympathy and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,
you would not understand a word of it,
they that are fit to make Physitians <hi>may</hi> find it
in the Treatise: All Modern Physitians know
not what belonged to a Sympatherical Cure,
no more than a Cookoo knows what belongs
to Flats and Sharps in Musick, but follow the
vulgar road, and call it a hidden quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis hid from the Eyes of Dunces, and
indeed none but Astrologers can give a reason
of it, and Physick without Reason is like a
Pudding without Fat.</item>

with the help of a Pestle and Mortar and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
diligence, you may make any Pouder into
Pills, either with Syrup or the Jelly I told you

                  <p>You must not think (Courteous People)
that I can spend time to give you examples of

If I should set you to look upon the Sun
I should dazle your eyes and make you blind.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To such as study Astrology (who
are the only men I know that are fit to study
Physick, Physick without Astrology, being like
a Lamp without Oyl) you are men I excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly

                  <list>
                     <item>1. Fortifie the Body with Herbs of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                  <p>But that this may appear unto you as cleer
as the Sun when he is upon the Meridian, I
here quote you an Example, which I perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
when I was as far off from my study as I
am now, yet am I not ashamed the world
should see how much or little of my Lesson I
have learned without Book.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>July,</hi> 25. 1651. there came a Letter to
me out of <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> from a Gentleman
(at that time) altogether to me unknown,
though since well known, who was a Student
both in Astrologie and Physick: The words
which are these;
<floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <opener>
                              <salute>Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi>
                              </salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>My Love remembred unto you, although I
know you not by face; yet because I do much
respect that pretty little Lark, you so lately let
fly into the world, which you call <hi>Semeiotica
Uranica,</hi> which I have lately taken into my
cage; I am therefore imboldned to write unto
you in the behalf of a Neighbors wife, who is
taken with a very violent Disease which began
in the lowr parts of her Body, but is now as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
upwards, and tormenteth her in her
Breast, Throat, Tongue, and Lips: This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
took possession of her (as she relateth to me)
about a fortnight before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last, but
the certain day and hour she is not able to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate;
she sent for me, and enquired whether
she were not under an ill Tongue or not, or of
what nature the Disease was: I have sent you
the enclosed Scheam, I could find but one testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Fascination or Witchcraft, which was
one Sign possessing the Cusps of the Twelfth
and First Houses, which to me holds forth no
more than a strong suspition of it by the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
However I am confident there is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Diseas which hurts much, because the
Lord of the Sixt, which usually gives signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Natural Diseases, is now placed in
the Ascendent; but at present I forbear to
make any large discours of mine own Opinions,
being desirous that you would endeavor your
Skill in this Cure, for there is not a Doctor of
them all far or near that have been so skilful
to find out the Diseas, much less to effect the
Cure. Sr. I expect your Answer; mean time
bid you farewel, and remain yours in Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp;c.</p>

                        <p>I received yours, <hi>July</hi> 25. wherein I find
your enclosed Scheam, and (I suppose) the
nature of the Disease, and have sent you such an
Answer as I could, being far from my Study,
which I entreat you to take in good part, being
<hi>Festinaxi calamo Conscripta.</hi> As for the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of your Country Doctors, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the true Judgment of Astrology, is to me
no waies admirable; I perceive you to be a
yong man by the time of your Genesis, which
you also sent me, beware whom you trust with
that, he that knows your Nativity knows
when ill Directions operate, and if he be an
Enemy, knows when to do you a mischief; If
<hi>Cecil</hi> had not had <hi>Essex</hi> his Nativity, he had
never gotten his Head off, but to instruct
you being a yong Student, I shall give you
my Judgment Methodically.</p>

                           <p>You say you can find no Arguments of
Witchcraft, but only one Sign possessing the
Cusps of both Twelth and Ascendent, but if
you had regarded the Propinquity of <hi>Venus</hi> to
<hi>Saturn</hi> you would have made another of that,
yet do not I think she is bewitched, because of
other more prevalent restimonies; the <hi>Moon</hi>
passing from the beams of <hi>Mars</hi> to the beams
of <hi>Venus</hi> may seem to give some suspition of
Honesty, and the Disease to come that way,
which is encreased by <hi>Mars</hi> his being in the
Ascendent in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and the Dragons Tail
upon the Cusp, yet I can hardly beleeve this,
for <hi>Cauda</hi> in a humane Sign usually gives
Slanders and not Tales of Truth, 'tis a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to one if she suffer not in point of good
name by the vulgar [this was too true] Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the neerness of <hi>Venus</hi> to <hi>Saturn</hi> may
well shew trouble of mind, and it being in the
ninth House, pray enquire whether she have
not been troubled about some tenents in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
[the trouble of mind was true, but it was
about a stranger, which the ninth House also
signifies.]</p>

                              <hi>Venus,</hi> Lady of the Twelfth, and Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and Eigth, shews her alwaies to be her
own foe in respect of Health; and truly I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the original of the Disease was a Surfet
either by eating moist Fruits, or else by cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
wet in travelling; <hi>Venus</hi> with <hi>Saturn</hi>
who is in square to the Ascendent troubles her
Breast with tough Flegm and Melancholly:
Besides, there being a most forcible reception
between the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> from fruitful
Signs, I question whether she be not with
Child or not, the <hi>Moon</hi> being in the fifth
House, <hi>Mars</hi> is lord of the Disease, really in
the Scorpion, and accidentally in the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
together with <hi>Aries</hi> on the sixt, shew
the Disease keep his Court in the Womb, and
accidentally afflicts the Head from thence, so
that heat of the Womb must needs be cause of
the present distemper, and <hi>Mars</hi> in a moist
Sign in the first neer the second may well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
heat, and breaking out about her Face
and Throat.</p>

                           <p>Whether she be curable or not, or how or
when the Disease will end is our next Point;
Truly I can see no danger of death the Moon
being strong in her hain, and applying by
Trine with a strong reception to the Lady of
the Ascendent; yet this is certain, <hi>Mars</hi>
strong in a fixed Sign will maintain the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
stoutly, her hopes will be but smal when
<hi>Venus</hi> comes to the Body of <hi>Saturn. viz. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi>
2. for she will be overpressed with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly,
the time I suppose of her Cure may
be (if good courses be taken) when <hi>Mars</hi>
leaves the Sign he is in, and comes to the place
where the Body of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is, or at least then
it may turn to another Disease more propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
the Sun strong in the Tenth shews she
may be cured by Medicine, and he being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted

stinking Arrach, a pattern whereof I have sent
you enclosed, you may find it upon Dunghils,

is cold and moist, an Herb of <hi>Venus</hi> in the

and under the Coelestial Crab, may do very
well, and the better because <hi>Venus</hi> is in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer:</hi>
It grows upon Bogs in untilled places,
and is in flower about this time, it grows
very low, with roundish green Leaves full
of red hairs, and is fullest of dew when
the Sun is hottest, whence it took its
name; to these you may ad Tansie, which I
take to be an Herb of <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Libra,</hi> and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
if you please which is an Herb of the
<hi>Moon, Mars</hi> having his fall in <hi>Cancer</hi> they are
all harmless, you may use them according to
your own descretion: also Orpine, another
Herb of the <hi>Moon</hi> is very good in this case.</p>

                              <pb n="255" facs="tcp:41525:87"/>Sir, I wish you well, and if you esteem of
my Lark above his deserts, I pray trim his
Feathers for him (correct the Errors by the
Errata) else will he make but unpleasing Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.
Thus remain yonrs, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>I the rather chose this Figure to judg of,
because none should have just occasion to say
of us Astrologers that we do as Physitians vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
practice is, when they judg of Piss; first
pump what they can out of the Querent, and
then judg by his words; of which I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse
you one merry story, and so I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Book.</p>
                           <p>A Woman whose Husband had bruised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
took his Water, and away to the Doctor
trots she; the Doctor takes the Piss and shakes
it about, <hi>How long hath this party been ill</hi>
(saith he) Sr. saith the Woman, <hi>He</hi> hath
been ill these two daies, This is a mans water
quoth the Doctor presently, this he learned
by the word <hi>HE;</hi> then looking on the water
he spied blood in it, the man hath had a bruise
saith he, I indeed saith the woman, my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
fell down a pair of stairs backwards, then
the Doctor knew well enough that what came
first to danger must needs be his back and
shoulders, said, the Bruise lay there; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
she admired at the Doctors skil, and told
him, that if he could tell her one thing more
she would account him the ablest Physitian in
<hi>Europe;</hi> well, what was that? How many
Stairs her Husband fell down, this was a hard
Question indeed, able to puzle a stronger
Brain than Mr. Doctor had, to pumping goes
he, and having taken the Urinal and given it
a shake or two, enquires whereabout she lived,
and knowing well the place, and that the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
thereabouts were but low built Houses,
made answer) after another view of the Urine
for fashion sake) that probably he might fall
down some seven or eight stairs; ah, quoth
the woman, now I see you know nothing, my
Husband fell down thirty; thirty! quoth the
Doctor, and snatching up the Urinal, is here
all the water saith he? no saith the woman, I
spilt some in putting of it in, look you there
quoth Mr. Doctor, there were all the other
stairs spilt.</p>
                           <p>Yet mistake me not, I do not deny but
such whose daily experience is to judg Waters,
and usually judg a hundred in a day may know
somthing by them: If any thing may be
known by Urine, I am sure it may be Art,
put them both together, <hi>vis unita fortior.</hi>
Thus I take my leave of you; be diligent and
I am yours.</p>
