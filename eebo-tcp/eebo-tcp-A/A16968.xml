            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I heard, R. H. of a moſt honorable
bent of the K. for clearing in Ebrew &amp; Grek by the Apoc. all the
Bible: &amp; my deſire that way is ſtird by newes from Graecia. One
Edw. Crain a ſhipper of N. Caſtell: was long in Thrace: where
Iewes dayly reioyced of our knowledge in the law, hoping to
learne from vs ſalvation. And one came with him to Venice, for
Leyden, hearing (by the Poſt of Collen belike) that I meant ſtay
there. He wold be fully inſtructed of me: that hee might returne
to ſaue his nation. And I whole fiften yeres craued allowance to
ſhew Chriſt through the Bible. But Satan hindred all hitherto.
Now I hope the ſting in the Dragons tayle ſhalbe pluck vp: that
no libellers crew ſting more. They ioy that I ſhew Ieſus not Ioſeph
ſon to Ely: Luc. 3. Iechonias, Matth. 1. only by Kings phraſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

owne Doctor: forced to overthrow their owne Thalmudiques all:
by clear ending of Moyſes. Alſo this was acceptable, that I ſhewed
Pſ. 16. That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt ſayd, that thou wilt not leaue me to the Graue
till the body ſee corruption. &amp; ſo Act. 2. &amp; Crede: crucified dead &amp;
buryed: &amp; went to God: wher <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hath heauen for the Godly,
&amp; Gehenna for the wicked: both on high. They thought we in
England held a going to Hell. As Chryſologus now 1200. yeres:
<pb facs="tcp:14685:2"/>
&amp; Rome confuted by Iſaac Ben Arama. fol. 205. that ſo our Goſpel
could not be from God: yf it taught that the Fathers could mis
of Paradiſe hence or Meſſias. The very Deuels &amp; Porphyrie their
Angel in Euſeb. Apod. Euang. 3. ſay: our Lordes ſoule was the
Godlieſt of all ſoules: &amp; the ſoule of the godly goeth into the ſoile
of heauen: wher Ieſus &amp; all iuſt bee. This much the very Deuels
confeſſed: But our tranſlation Pſ. 16. thou wilt not leaue my ſoule
in Hell, &amp; the ſame Act. 2. is more ſhameles then any part of the
Alkoran. And a ſixt poinct cheared the text of the holy Grek: wher
Beza 60. yeres checked the text &amp; milliones after him. Hence they
thought God never gaue it. For as in the courſe of nature God
preſerveth all his creatures &amp; all the letters of the Law: ſo he wold
haue kept euery letter of the New Teſtament yf he gaue it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me none defended the general purenes &amp; eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be from
God. So longe they ſtaggered: But now reioiced vncredibly. Fiue
Hebrew litle works the moſt Eloquent Rabbin of all the worlde,
as prage cenſured, Rabbi Ruben ſent into England for me. Beſide
that which I printed to the delite of all Chriſtendom: But the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers
crew that libelled I forged the firſt of ſix: bezelled them
that poor Ruben died in vnperfect hope. A copie of one a merchand
hath in Ingland. And the Turky marchants might find who had
them. I wold requeſt the K. to try who were the Atheiſtes that
durſt ſo deale to hinder the glory of Chriſtendome: &amp; ſalvation of
Abrahams ſonnes. I haue lately complayned to your Lordſhips a
litle: But I reſerue this to myne owne complaint to his ſacred Maieſtie.
To whom I haue to ſhew the original of Abraham Rubens
Epiſtle printed: for a memoriall againſt them that libelled I forged
it. The one died horribly. Men may mark the others end. I haſten
