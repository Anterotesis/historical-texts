         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N this day a Faſt and Feaſt do
both juſtle together;<note place="margin">1.</note> and the
queſtion is, which ſhould take
place in our affections. I pray
let <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of Kings
and Men, be made Doctor of
the Chaire to decide this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>It is better to go to the houſe of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:124001:3"/>
mourning, then to goe to the houſe of feasting: for it
is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his
heart.</hi> Let us therefore diſpenſe with all mirth
for this time, and apply our ſelves to lamentation.</p>
            <p>2. Wee reade <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 12. that when the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the ſecond Temple was laid by <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
the young men ſhouted for joy: <hi>But many of
the Priests and Levites, and chiefe of the fathers, who
were ancient men, that had ſeen the firſt houſe, when
the foundation of this houſe was laid before their eyes,
wept with a loud voice, and many ſhouted aloud for joy.</hi>
Thus what if young men be ſo addicted to their
toyes and Chriſtmas ſports, that they will not be
weaned from them, O let not old men, who are or
ſhould be wiſer, and therefore more ſenſible of the
ſinnes and ſorrowes of the State; let us who are
Prieſts, whoſe very profeſſion doth date us anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
be tranſported with their follies, but mourne
whileſt they are in their mirth. The French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
ſaith, <hi>They that laugh on Friday, ſhall cry on
Sunday.</hi> And it may pleaſe God of his goodneſſe
ſo to bring it to paſſe, that if we keep a ſad Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
we may have a merry Lent.</p>
            <p>3. This day is called <hi>Innocents</hi> or <hi>Childermas</hi>
day; a day which ſuperſtitious Papiſts count un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie
and unfortunate, and therefore thereupon
they will begin no matter of moment, as fearing
ill ſucceſſe ſhould befall them. Indeed I could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have ſent their follies in ſilence to Hell, leſt
by being a Confuter, I become a Remembrancer
of their vanities: but that this fond conceit muſt
be rooted out of the minds of the ignorant people.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124001:3"/>
Why ſhould not that day be moſt happy, which
in the judgement of charity (charity which though
not ſtarke blind with <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> with <hi>Leah</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
tender eyed) ſent ſo many Saints by <hi>Herods</hi>
cruelty to Heaven, before they had committed any
actuall ſinne. Well, out of ſacred oppoſition and
pious croſſing of Popiſh vanities, let us this day
begin, and this day give good handſell of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<hi>To the cloane all things are cleane.</hi> To the
good all dayes are good: We may ſay of this day
as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 9. <hi>There is
none like that, give it me.</hi> No day like this day for
us to begin our ſanctified ſorrow, and to hearken
to Gods word, <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. In this and the two next Chapters Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Mountain for his Pulpit, and the whole Law
for his text, ſeeks to clear it from thoſe falſe gloſſes
(corrupting the Text) which the Prieſts and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
had faſtened upon it; and ſhewes, that Gods
Law was not to be narrowed and confined to the
outward act alone, but according to the will of the
Law-giver (the Surveyour that beſt knew the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
thereof) is to bee extended to the very
thoughts of the heart, and takes hold of mens wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
inclinations, as breaches thereof, and offences
againſt it. We uſe to end our Sermons with a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
Chriſt begins his with the Beatitudes, and of
the eight, my Text is neither the laſt nor the leaſt,
<hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Obſerve in the words the beſt worke and the
beſt wages; the beſt worke, <hi>Peace-makers:</hi> the beſt
wages, <hi>They are bleſſed.</hi> I begin with the worke,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124001:4"/>
which ſhall imploy my paines and your attention
this day. Now the goodneſſe of peace will the
better appeare, if we conſider the miſery of warre.
It is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>And it came to paſſe when A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
was come neere to enter into Egypt, that hee
ſaid unto Sarai his wife, Behold, now I know that thou
art a faire woman to looke upon.</hi> Why Now <hi>I know
thou art a beautifull woman?</hi> Did <hi>Abraham</hi> live thus
long in ignorance of his wives beauty? Did he now
firſt begin to know her handſomneſſe? Learned
<hi>Tremelius</hi> on the place ſtarts and anſwers the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<hi>Now,</hi> that is, when <hi>Abraham</hi> came into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
as if he had ſaid, When I ſee the tawny faces
and ſwarthy complexions of the ſun-burnt Egpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
thy face ſeemeth the fairer, and thy beauty
the brighter in mine eyes. I muſt confeſſe, I ever
prized peace for a pearle; but we never did or could
ſet the true eſtimate and value upon it till this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
and ſuſpenſion of it. <hi>Now</hi> we know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taught by deare experience, that peace is a
beautifull bleſſing: And therefore we will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
warre firſt in the wickedneſſe, then in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
thereof.</p>
            <p>6. Firſt, warre makes a Nation more wicked.
Surely, ſwearing and Sabbath breaking do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the keeping of the firſt Table. And as for
the ſecond Table, how hard is it in theſe diſtracted
times to be practiſed? Yea, it is difficult to ſay the
Lords Prayer, the Creed, or ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
The Lords Prayer for that Petition,
<hi>And forgive us our treſpaſſes, as wee forgive them
that treſpaſſe againſt us.</hi> The Creed for that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124001:4"/>
               <hi>The Communion of Saints,</hi> which doth tye and
obliege us to the performance of all Chriſtian of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
&amp; charitable duties to thoſe who by the ſame
Chriſt ſeekes ſalvation, and profeſſe the ſame true
Chriſtian Catholike faith with us: The ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
for that precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> and
though men in ſpeculation and ſchoole diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may ſay, that all theſe may be eaſily performed
in the time of war; yet our corrupt nature, which
is ſtarke nought in time of peace, is likely to be far
worſe in warre, and if theſe times continue, I am
afraid wee ſhall neither ſay the Lords Prayer, nor
beleeve the Creed, nor practiſe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And as hard it will be preparedly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
to receive the Sacraments, when wee ſhall
drinke Chriſts bloud as on to day, and go about to
ſhed our brothers bloud as on to morrow.</p>
            <p>7. Secondly, let us conſider the wofulneſſe of
war, and that both in its ſelfe, and in its attendance:
See a Map of war drawne by a holy hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.
63. <hi>The fire conſumed their young men, and their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
were not given to marriage, their Prieſts fell by
the ſword, and their widowes made no lamentations.
The fire conſumed the young men.</hi> Wee behold with
contentment ripe fruit to drop downe to the
ground, but who will not pity greene apples when
they are cudgelled downe from the tree. <hi>And the
maidens were not given in marriage.</hi> So that the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
flowers of virginity were faine to wither on the
ſtalke, whereon they did grow, for want of hands to
gather them. <hi>The Prieſts were flaine with the ſword;
Sed quid cum Marte Prophetis?</hi> Well then, there
they were, though they were none of the beſt of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124001:5"/>
Prieſts, being lewd <hi>Hophnee</hi> and <hi>Phyneus,</hi> and there
they were killed, for ought I know, if theſe times
hold, Gods beſt <hi>Samuels</hi> muſt goe the ſame way.
<hi>And their widowes made no lamentation.</hi> You will
ſay, the more unnaturall women they: O no, <hi>they
made no lamentation,</hi> either becauſe their griefe was
above lamenting, ſuch as onely could be managed
with ſilence and amazement, or elſe becauſe they
were ſo taken up with deploring the publike cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
they could ſpare no time for private perſons
to bemoane their particular loſſes.</p>
            <p>8. But warre is not ſo terrible in it ſelf, as in its
attendants; firſt the Plague which brings up the
reare of war: the Plague, I ſay, which formerly
uſed to be an extraordinary embaſſador in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>London,</hi> to denounce Gods anger againſt it,
but is of late grown a conſtant legier, and for theſe
many late yeares hath never been clearly removed
from us: ſurely ſome great unrepented ſin lyes on
this City, that this conſtant puniſhment doth viſit
us, which will be more terrible when it ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
over the whole Realme.</p>
            <p>9. Secondly, Famine, a waiter in Ordinary on
Warre. Truly it may ſeeme a riddle, and yet it is
moſt true, that <hi>Warre makes both leſſe meat, and
fewer mouthes:</hi> Firſt, becauſe in time of war none
dare attend husbandry, wherewith <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,
<hi>The King himſelf is maintained.</hi> Secondly, becauſe
Souldiers ſpoile more out of prodigality, then
they ſpend out of neceſſity: When our Saviour
multiplied loaves and fiſhes, there were thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
who tooke up the twelve baskets of frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but, alas, no ſuch care is taken in ſouldiers
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124001:5"/>
feſtivals. Hitherto indeed wee have had plenty
enough, and as yet in this City are not ſenſible of
any want. But you know next <hi>Pharaohs</hi> full eares
came <hi>Pharaohs</hi> blaſted ears, next <hi>Pharaohs</hi> fat kine
came <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean kine; &amp; I pray God poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſor this years ſtore be not next year ſtarved.</p>
            <p>10. Thirdly, wilde beaſts, ſee Gods foure cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
puniſhments reckoned up, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>For
thus ſaith the Lord God, for much more when I ſend my
foure ſore judgements upon Jeruſalem: the ſword, and
the famine, and the noyſome beaſt, and the peſtilence to
cut from it man and beaſt.</hi> Some perchance wil ſay,
that there is more danger of wilde beaſts in our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
which is invironed with water. Truely there
need no other wilde beaſts then our ſelves, who are
Lions, Beares, Boares, Wolves, and Tygers one
to another. And though as yet wee were never
plagued with wilde beaſts, yet wee know not how
ſoone God may hiſſe for them over, and for our
new and ſtrange ſins, cauſe new and ſtrange puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Now conceive a City as bigge as your
thoughts can imagine, and fancy the Sword mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in at the Eaſt-gate, and the Plague comming
in at the Weſt-gate, and Famine entring in at the
North-gate, and wilde beaſts paſſing in at the
South-gate, and all meeting together in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place,
and then tell me how quickly will your
voluminous Citie be abridged to a poor pittance.</p>
            <p>11. But hitherto wee have only ſpoken of the
miſeries of War in generall, but the worſt is ſtill
behind, for we are afflicted with Civill war, many
warres have done wofully, but this ſurmounteth
them all. In Civill war nothing can bee expected
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:124001:6"/>
but a ruine and deſolaion. What ſaid <hi>Mordecai</hi> to
<hi>Heſther, Heſther</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Think not with thy ſelfe that
thou ſhalt eſcape in the Kings houſe more then all the
Jewes.</hi> So let none in what houſe ſoever, in the
Kings Houſe, or Houfe of Lords, or Houſe of
Commons, or ſtrongeſt Caſtles, or walled Towns,
or fenced Cities, flatter themſelves with a fond
conceit of their ſafety, for if Civill warres conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
long, they muſt expect as well as others to bee
devoured, yea, none can promiſe great Perſons ſo
much happineſſe as to bee laſt undone: For, for
ought any knowes, it may come their turnes to be
the firſt, as being the faireſt markes to invite envy
and malice againſt them. Meane time poore <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which as the man in the viſion cryed to Saint
<hi>Paul, Come over into Macedonia and helpe us,</hi> which
hath ſo long, ſo often, ſo earneſtly intreated, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored,
importuned our aſſiſtants, muſt be loſt <hi>of
courſe.</hi> The Proteſtants there which have long
ſwom againſt the tide till their armes are weary,
muſt at laſt of neceſſity even give themſelves over
to bee drowned: That Harpe, which when it was
well tuned, made ſo good muſicke, muſt now and
hereafter for ever <hi>bee hung upon the willowes,</hi> a ſad
and ſorrowfull tree, and our diſtraction will haſten
their finall deſtruction. We reade, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 56.
<hi>That in a great Famine the eye of the mother ſhall be
evill towards her ſon and towards her daughter,</hi> ſhee
ſhall grudge every morſell of meat which goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
her owne mouth, preferring nature before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
affection. If theſe times doe continue, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
will grudge <hi>London-derry</hi> her daughter, and
<hi>England</hi> Mother generally of <hi>Ireland</hi> (as a Colony
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:124001:6"/>
deduced from it) will grieve to part with the leaſt
meat, money and munition to it.</p>
            <p>12 But all theſe Miſchiefes are nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the laſt, namely the ſcandal and diſhonour
which hereby will redound to the Proteſtant reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
whereof a true Chriſtian ought to be more
tender and ſenſible, then of any worldly loſſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever:
<hi>Tell it not in Gath, nor publiſh it in Aſcalon,
leſt the daughters of the Philistims rejoyce, leſt the
daughters of the uncircumciſed triumph.</hi> O what
muſick doth our diſcord make to the Romiſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.
We reade, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>And there was a
ſtrife between the heard-men of Abrahams cattel, and
the heard-men of Lots cattell, and the Cananite, and
the Perizite dwelled then in the Land. And Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
ſaid unto Lot, Let there be no ſtrife, I pray thee,
betweene my &amp;c.</hi> Wherein obſerve, that the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
and Perizites being there in the Land, is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as a motive with <hi>Abraham</hi> to make him
make the ſpeedier accommodation with <hi>Lot,</hi> leſt
the true religion and ſervice of God ſhould ſuffer
in the cenſure of Pagans by their diſcords, being
Uncle and Nephew, ingaged in a brawle by their
ſervants diſſention. How many Canaanites and
Perezites behold our bloudy differences, and clap
their hands to ſee us wring ours, yea, inſult and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
to ſee us ſheath our ſwords in one anothers
bowels; wee uſed formerly to taske the Papiſts of
cruelty to Proteſtants; but hereafter, as <hi>Abner</hi> ſaid
to <hi>Aſahel,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>How then ſhall I hold up my
face to Joab thy brother:</hi> So how ſhall we looke in
the face, from this day forwards, of our Romiſh
adverſaries. Tell them no more of their cruelty to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:124001:7"/>
the Proteſtants at <hi>Hedlebergh,</hi> of their cruelty to
Proteſtants of <hi>Magdenberge,</hi> of their cruelty to the
Proteſtants at <hi>Rochel;</hi> for if theſe wars continue,
wee are likely not onely to equall, but to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
theſe cruelties one to another; ſo that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
this accuſation of bloudineſſe againſt
them, it will rebound and recoile in our own faces.
Put all theſe together, that warre makes a Land
more wicked, makes a Land more wofull, is bad
in it ſelfe, is worſe in its traine, deſtroyes Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
people, and diſgraces Chriſtian profeſſion, and
then will all have juſt cauſe to ſay as it is in my
Text, <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. If any object that peace alſo hath her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
which attend thereupon; for it brings
plenty, and plenty brings pride, and pride brings
plagues upon it: peace makes men pampered, and
with <hi>Jeſſurun</hi> to kick againſt God. War indeed
brings <hi>cleanneſſe of teeth,</hi> whileſt peace brings <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of bread,</hi> which is as bad and worſe, making
men preſumptuouſly to rebell againſt God. The
anſwer is eaſie, woes may come from peace, but
they muſt come from warre; miſeries ariſe from
the very uſe of warre, which come but from the
abuſe of peace, being eſſentiall to warre, but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
to peace, inherent alwaies in the one, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
too often to the other: in a word, in war
calamities proceed from the thing it ſelfe, in peace
from men, abuſing it.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>Object.</hi> But peace without truth is rather
poyſon then a cordiall: O let us not be like the
thirſty traveller, who ſo long longs for water, that
at laſt he drinkes mud and water together, not only
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:124001:7"/>
without diſtinction or diſtaſte, but even with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:
O let us not with <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſo dote on the
<hi>Dalilah</hi> of peace, as to get her love to betray truth,
wherein our ſtrength lyes. Some perchance would
propound peace unto us, but on ſuch ſervile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
as <hi>Naaſh</hi> the Ammonite offered a truce to
the men of Jabeſh-Gilead, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>On this
condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may
thruſt out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproacb
upon all Iſrael.</hi> And ſo if we will give in truth to
boot, and put out our owne eyes into the bargaine;
forfeit the true faith and knowledge of God, with
the purity of his ſervice, then perchance a peace
may be proffered us; but as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Simon
Magus, Act.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>Thy mony periſh with thee,</hi> ſo let
ſuch a helliſh peace periſh with thoſe that ſeek to
promote it.</p>
            <p>15. In the anſwering of this objection, give me
leave as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 29. <hi>Men and brethren, let
me freely ſpeake unto you of the Patriarch David;</hi> ſo
let me boldly and fully ſpeak in anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
If leave be denied mee: I know whence
my commiſſion is derived, I am an Embaſſadour
for the God of Heaven if I ſpeake what is falſe, I
muſt anſwer for it; if truth, it will anſwer for me.
And what I have to ſay, I will divide into foure
Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>16. Prop. 1. <hi>Curſed be hee that ſeekes to divide
Peace from Truth.</hi> I muſt confeſſe I was never bred
upon Mount Ebal, neither did ever my tongue take
delight in curſing. The rather, becauſe we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 12. that the moſt eminent Tribes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:124001:8"/>
from w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Princely &amp; Prieſtly men deſcended,
<hi>Levi, Iudah, Ephraim,</hi> &amp; <hi>Benjamin,</hi> took their ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Mount Geraſin, to ſhew, that Magiſtrates &amp;
Miniſters are principally to inure their mouths to
bleſſing. And yet for thoſe that feek to ſever peace
from truth, I cannot refrain my ſelf, but muſt ſay,
<hi>Curſed be they in the city, and curſed be they in the
field, curſed be they in their basket and in their ſtore,
curſed be they in the fruit of their body, and in the
fruit of their land, in the increaſe of their kine, and in
the ſtock of their ſheep, curſed ſhall they be when they
come in, and curſed ſhall they be when they go out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. Pro. 2. <hi>Before this warre began, wee had in
England truth in all eſſentiall to ſalvation.</hi> Wee had
all neceſſary and important truths truly compiled
in our 39. Articles. We had the word of God truly
preacht (I could wiſh it had been more frequently
and generally) the Sacraments duly adminiſtred,
which two put together doth conſtitute a true
Church. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 18. being to prove the
reſurrection of the dead, preſſeth the Corinthians
with this among other Arguments, <hi>Then they alſo
which are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi> Putting
them a moſt uncharitable abſurdity, that in caſe
the dead ariſe not againe, they muſt be bound to
confeſs, that all the Saints formerly deceaſed were
periſhed. And ſurely, ſuch as deny that England
before this warre began had all eſſentiall truth to
ſalvation, muſt of neceſsity ſplit themſelves on the
ſame uncharitable rocke, and paſſe a ſentence of
condemnation on all thoſe which dyed in our
Church before theſe two yeares laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:124001:8"/>
18 3. Pro. <hi>Many errors in Doctrine and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in diſcipline, did creepe faſt into our Church.</hi>
Arminian poſitions, Tenents, reaſon to Gods
grace, invaded the truth of the Word in many
places. One Ceremony begat another, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no bounds in will-worſhip, wherewith one
may ſooner be wearied then ſatisfied. The inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of new Ceremonies endeavouring to ſupply
in number what their conceits wanted in ſolidity;
and God knowes before this time where they had
been if they had not been ſtopt.</p>
            <p>19 4. <hi>Pro.</hi> The beſt and onely way to purge
theſe errors out, is in a faire and peaceable way;
for the ſword cannot diſcerne betwixt error and
falſhood, it may have two edges, but hath never
an eye. Let there on Gods bleſſing be a Synode
of truely grave, pious, and learned Divines; and
let them both fairely diſpute, and fully decide,
whats true, whats falſe; what Ceremonies are to
be retained, what to be rejected; and let civill au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thortie
ſtampe their command upon it, to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
received under what penaltie their deſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall think fitting. But as long as Warre
laſts, no hope of any ſuch agreement; this muſt
be a worke for Peace to performe. So then under
the notion of Peace, hitherto we have and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doe intend ſuch a Peace, as when it comes we
hope will reſtore truth unto us, in all the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and ornamentall parts thereof; and adde it to
that truth in eſſentialls to ſalvation, which we
enjoyed before this Warre began, and in this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:124001:9"/>
ſence I will boldly pronounce <hi>bleſſed be the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20 Come we now to conſider what be the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
of Peace: theſe hindrances are either ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
or particular. The generall hindrance is
this: The many nationall ſinnes of our kingdome
being not repented of; I ſay of our kingdome, not
of one Army alone. Thinke not that the Kings
Army is like <hi>Sodome,</hi> not ten righteous men in it,
(no not if righteous <hi>Lot</hi> himſelfe be put into the
number) and the other Army like <hi>Syon</hi> conſiſting
all of Saints. No, there be drunkards on both
ſides, and ſwearers on both ſides, and whoremun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
on both ſides, pious on both ſides, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
on both ſides, like <hi>Jeremies</hi> figges, thoſe that
are good are very good, and thoſe that are bad are
very bad in both parties. I never knew nor heard
of an Army all of Saints, <hi>ſave the holy Army of
Martyrs,</hi> and thoſe you know were dead firſt, for
the laſt breath they ſent forth proclaimed them to
be Martyrs. But it is not the ſinnes of the Armies
alone, but the ſinnes of the whole kingdome which
breake off our hopes of Peace, our Nation is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſinfull. The City complaines of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and prodigality of the Courtiers, the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
complaine of the pride and covetouſneſſe of
Citizens, the Laity complaine of the lazineſſe and
ſtate-medling of the Clergy, the Clergie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of the hard dealing and ſacriledge of the
Laity, the Rich complaine of the murmuring and
ingratitude of the Poor, the Poor complaine of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:124001:9"/>
the oppreſſion and extortion of the Rich: Thus
every one is more ready to throw durt in anothers
face then to waſh his owne cleane. And in all
theſe though malice may ſet the varniſh, ſure
truth doth lay the ground-worke.</p>
            <p>21 Of particular hindrances, in the firſt place
we may ranke the Romiſh Recuſants, <hi>Is not the
hand of Joab with thee in all this,</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 19. but is not the hand may we all
ſay of <hi>Jeſvites</hi> in theſe diſtractions. <hi>Many times
from my youth up have they fought againſt me may</hi>
England <hi>now ſay, yea many times from my youth up
have they vexed me, but have not prevailed againſt
me.</hi> At laſt, the Popiſh party perceived that the
ſtrength of <hi>England</hi> conſiſted in the unity thereof.
(<hi>Sampſon</hi> is halfe conquered when it is knowne
where his ſtrength doth lye) and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to conquer <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, but by
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants. Is this your ſpite and malice
O you <hi>Romiſh</hi> adverſaries, becauſe you could not
overcome us with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armadoes, nor blowe
us up with Gunpowder treaſons, nor undoe us
with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellions, to ſet our ſelves againſt our
ſelves, firſt to divide us, then to deſtroy us. Well,
God knowes what may come to paſſe. It may be
when we have drunke the top of this bitter cup,
the dregs may be for your ſhare, and we may all
be made friends for your utter ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>22 Next, the Papiſts the Schiſmatickes are the
hendrances of our Peace. Theſe know their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:124001:10"/>
cannot be eſtabliſhed but by Warre, as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
that the wiſdome of the State is ſuch, as will
blaſt their deſignes when matters are ſetled. I
have heard (when a childe) of a <hi>Lawleſſe Church,</hi>
ſure theſe if they might have their will, would
have a Lawleſſe Church and a Goſpelleſſe too;
and yet they as falſly as fondly conceive that the
State gives approbation and connivance to them.
We read <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 50. 21. where Gods ſpirit rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
up many ſinnes which the wicked had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that God ſaith; <hi>Theſe things haſt thou
done, and I kept ſilence; thou thougheſt that I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ſuch a one as thy ſelfe: but I will reprove
thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes.</hi> In
which place of Scripture three things are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Firſt, God is ſaid to keep ſilence when he
doth not preſently and viſibly puniſh offenders,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 22. <hi>O Lord keep not ſilence,</hi> and ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi>
83. 1. <hi>Keep not thou ſilence O God.</hi> God, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
beſt known to himſelfe, and for ſome known
to us, namely, to make wicked men ſwel and break
with a Timpany of good ſucceſſe for the time,
does not outwardly expreſſe the diſlike of their
bad courſes, in inflictine a ſuddain and ſenſible
puuiſhment upon them. Secondly, obſerve the
falſe Logick &amp; bad inference of wicked men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
who conceive that God is altogether ſuch an one
as themſelves, yea make acceſſary and confederate
with them becauſe ſilent, therefore conſenting:
<hi>Qui tacet ſatis laudat.</hi> Thirdly, ſee time wil come
when in time beſt known to himſelfe he will pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:124001:10"/>
reprove them, and ſhew not onely his free
diſſent but full diſpleaſure. Thus Schiſmatickes
improve themſelves upon the clemency &amp; long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of our State. Becauſe they are taken up with
matters of higher concernment, and are not at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to ſtoope to their puniſhment, as imployed in
buſineſſe of more preſent and preſſing impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
Separatiſts and Sectaries conceive that
they favour, what they doe not puniſh. But time
will come when to the glory of God and their own
honour, though ſlowly, ſurely they will viſit their
offences, and as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith; <hi>Set their ſinnes
in order before them;</hi> who have beene the partiall
cauſe of the diſorder and confuſion of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>23 Thirdly, thoſe are enemies to Peace, whoſe
beeing meerely conſiſteth by Warre and diſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Indeed the truly noble Engliſh ſpirits, deſire
a forraigne Foe for a marke for their Bullets; but
many there be rather turbulent then valiant, <hi>who
as Demetrius by this craft they get their gaine,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
a perpetuity of Warre for their poſſeſſion.
We read in <hi>Plutarch</hi> of one <hi>Demades</hi> who by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
was a maker of Coffins, and he was baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of rhe City of <hi>Athens</hi> for wiſhing that hee
might have good trading; that wiſe Sare truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
the language of his wiſh, as deſiring
ſome epidemicall diſeaſe; his private profit being
inconſiſtant with the publike flouraſhing of the
Common-wealth. So thoſe people who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
and cannot live but by undoing of others,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:124001:11"/>
certainly wiſh no good to our Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but muſt needs be State Barrettors to
keep the ſore alwayes raw, betwixt Prince and
people.</p>
            <p>24 Let us now come to ſee the meanes, wherby
private perſons may and muſt endeavour the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of peace; <hi>The firſt is prayer, pray for the peace
of Jeruſalem;</hi> let every one in that prayer which he
uſeth in his Family, or private devotions, build a
roome more and inlarge it, to pray for peace in
our Iſraell.</p>
            <p>25 Secondly, let us petition for peace, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the God in Heaven, but to the Gods on earth;
firſt to his Majeſtie, but alas there is a great gulfe
between us &amp; him fixed, ſo that they which would
paſſe from hence to him cannot, neither <hi>can they
paſſe to us that would come from thence.</hi> The ſins of
our Realm are amounted to ſuch a height that we
deſerve this and worſe puniſhment. Next, let us
petition to the High and Honourable Court of
Parliament, next under God and the King the hope
and help of our happineſſe, Let none ſay it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
to petition them, as undertaking to tell
them of what they are ignorant, or to put them in
remembrance of what they may forget, for herein
we apply our ſelfe to them, in immitation of our
acceſſe to God, and ſurely their greatneſſe cannot
and their goodneſſe will not be diſpleaſed in our
compliance and conformity to ſuch an Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type.
True it is that God, <hi>Matthew</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knoweth what things we have need of before we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:124001:11"/>
aske him,</hi> and yet it is his will and pleaſure to be
ſought too by our prayer. And ſo no doubt that
High and Honourable Court, though that they
know fulwell that peace is that we ſtand in need of
yet they take delight in our duty, yea expect our
ſervice herin to petition for peace, that ſo our beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of peace, may in effect be a modeſt &amp; manner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expreſſion of an harty thanks for their long and
conſtant endeavours herein. Wherefore what <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi>
ſaid flatteringly to <hi>Felex,</hi> we may ſay truly
and feelingly to them; ſeeing that very worthy
<hi>deeds are done to this Nation by their providence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 24. 3.</note> 
               <hi>we
accept alwaies, and in all places with all thankfulnes.
Notwithstanding I pray you, that you of your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
would heare us a few words.</hi> And let us in all
Humility, not directing but beſeeching them,
without a tumultuous thought, moſt peacable and
pathetically begge of them and ſue unto them to
continue their care in advancing a ſeaſonable and
happy accomodation, that ſo the bleſſing pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in my text may lie both upon them and theirs
<hi>Bleſſed are the Peacemakers:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26 Thirdly, we muſt be content ſoundly to
pay for peace, we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 38. 8. <hi>And he
made the Lever of Braſſe and the foot of it of Braſſe,
of the Looking-glaſſes of the Women aſſembling, which
aſſembled at the door of the Tabernacle of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi>
It ſeemeth that the backſids of their Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes
were made of braſſe, which commonly
with us are made of wood, and they conſigned
them over for Gods ſervice; and good reaſon too,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:124001:12"/>
for formerly they had given their eraerings for the
making of a Calfe; Juſtly therefore now they did
pennance for their pride, as counting it Honour
enough, that that wherein they looked their owne
faces, ſhould make the foot of Gods Leaver. But
what ſhould not people give to buy a true peace
and a peace with Truth? O how many yeeres pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
is it worth? let us not thinke much, to give all
our ſuperfluities, but to give fome of our neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
for the advancing and obtaining of it.</p>
            <p>27 Fourthly, ler us baniſh out of our mouthes
all words and phraſes of contempt and reproach,
(I could inſtance in the word, but that it is beneath
the Majeſty of a Pulpit) which the malice of men
hath minted and faſtned on oppoſite parties; O
let us have no other Chriſtian name, then the
name of Chriſtians, or other ſurname then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Proteſtants, neither anſwering to, nor calling
others by any term of diſgrace.</p>
            <p>28 Fifthly, let us with a ſpeedy, ſerious and
generall repentance, remove the crying ſinnes of
our Kingdome, which as long as they laſt, wil bane
all peace amongſt us. I ſay ſpeedy, leaſt the phyſick
come too late for the diſeaſe; ſerious, leaſt the tent
be too ſhort for the wound; generall, leaſt the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
be too narrow for the ſore. Suppoſe that the
Sea ſhould breake forth in this Land, as ſuch a
thing may come to paſſe, <hi>The Lord is King, ſaith</hi>
David, <hi>let the earth rejoyce yea let the multitude of
of the Iſle he glad thereatr,</hi> Pſal. 97. 1. And good
reaſon hath the Iles to be glad, as more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:124001:12"/>
concerned, for if the water were not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded
by Gods Prerogative Royall, it would
ſpeedily recover its naturall place above the earth.
But ſuppoſe the Sea ſhould break into the Land, it
is not the endeavours of a private man can ſtop it;
what if he goes downe with a faggot on his backe,
and a matrock on his ſhoulder, and a ſpade in his
hand, his deſire is more commendable then his
diſcretion, it being more likely the Sea would
ſwallow him then he ſtop the mouth thereof. No,
the whole Country muſt come in, children muſt
bring earth in their hats, women in their aprons,
men with handbarrowes, wheelbarrowes, carts,
carres, waines, waggons, all muſt worke leaſt all
be deſtroyed. I rather inſtance in this expreſſion
of the irruption of the Sea, becauſe I finde Gods
anger ſo compared in holy writ, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 11.
<hi>David ſaid, God hath broken in upon mine enemies
like the breaking forth of waters.</hi> So when a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
deluge and inundation of Gods anger ſeaſeth
upon a whole Kingdome, it cannot be ſtopt by the
private endeavours of ſome few, but it muſt be an
univerſall work, by a generall repentance; all muſt
raiſe bankes to bound it. Till this be done, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
we ſhall have no peace, and to ſpeak plainly
I am afraid we are not yet ripe for Gods mercy,
as <hi>Gideon Judg.</hi> 7. 4. <hi>had too many men for God
to give victory to:</hi> ſo we are too proud hitherto for
God to give peace too, many of us are <hi>Humiliati,</hi>
but few of us are <hi>Humiles.</hi> Many by theſe warres
brought loe, but few made loely, ſo that we are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:124001:13"/>
proud in our poverty, and as the unjuſt Steward
ſaid, <hi>to beg I am aſhamed,</hi> ſo we are too ſtout thogh
halfe ſtarved on the bended knees of our ſoules,
with true repentance, to crave pardon of God
for our ſinnes, which till it be done, we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of peace and ſuperficially deſire it but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
truely care for it, or can comfortably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it.</p>
            <p>29 And indeed wee may take forcible motives
from our owne miſeries, to endeavour peace by
all poſſible meanes; for look upon the complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the warre, and doth it not look of a moſt
ſtrange and different hue from other warres. The
wars of <hi>Germany</hi> (which give me leave to ſay if
we had pittied by the proxie of a true Simpathy,
we had never ſo ſoon ſuffered them in our owne
perſon) were far lighter affliction then ours. In
<hi>Germany</hi> people when hunted with warre took co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
in their fenced Citties. But here in <hi>England</hi>
we have no guard againſt wars blow, but lye open
to plundering and deſtruction. <hi>Germany</hi> was a
great Continent bearing ſix hundred miles ſquare,
ſo that whilſt one part thereof was mowed downe
with warre, the other enjoying peace, might grow
up in the meane time. But little <hi>England</hi> (great
onely in her miſeries, ſevered by the Sea from
other Countries, and by deviſions parted from
het ſelfe) is a morſell which civill warre will
quickly devoure. Thirdy, in <hi>Germany</hi> commanly
they lay in Garriſon in winter and fought in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
we read 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>And it came to paſſe at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:124001:13"/>
the time when Kings goe forth to battell.</hi> This all
Comments generally expound of the ſpring time;
But alas if we in our woes were <hi>Antipodes</hi> to all
others, our miſeries begin when others end, in the
winter time. <hi>Pray</hi> (ſaith out Saviour) <hi>that your
flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sabboth-day:</hi>
winter fights woful fights, Sabboth wars ſorrowful
warres, and yet ſuch are theſe in our Kingdome.
Laſtly, in <hi>Germany</hi> Papiſts did fight againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
where as our inteſtine wars, are againſt
thoſe that profeſſe the ſame Religion.</p>
            <p>30 It hath been a great curſe of God upon us,
to make a conſtant miſunderſtanding betwixt our
King and his Parliament; whileſt both profeſſe to
levell at the ſame end. I cannot compare their
caſe better than to the example of <hi>Ruben</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
Gen.</hi> 37. There <hi>Ruben</hi> deſired and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to preſerve the life of his brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
and <hi>Judah</hi> deſired and endeavour to preſerve the
life of his brother <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and yet theſe two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
different meanes, did not onely croſſe and
thwart, but even ruine and deſtroy the deſires of
each other; for <hi>Ruben</hi> moved and obtained that
<hi>Joſeph</hi> might not be killed, <hi>verſ. 22. And Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben
ſaid unto them, ſhed no blood, but caſt him into
this Pit that is in the wilderneſſe, and lay no hand
upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands,
to deliver him to his Father againe. Judah</hi> alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the ſame, but being not privie to <hi>Rubens</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
and to avoid the cruelty of the reſt of his
Brethren, propounded and effected, that <hi>Joſeph</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:124001:14"/>
might be ſold to the <hi>Medianitiſh</hi> Merchants, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo to preſerve his life; and thereby he did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravell
all the web of <hi>Rubins</hi> deſignes, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
his endeavours. Thus when God will have
a people puniſhed for their ſinnes, hee will not
onely ſuffer but cauſe miſtakes without mending,
and miſpriſions without rectifying, to happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
brethren who meane and really intend the
ſame thing; ſo that they ſpeake the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in effect, and yet, be Barbarians one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as either not or not right underſtanding what
they ſay each to other. Thus the maintaining of
the Proteſtant Religion in the purity thereof; the
vindicating of the lawfull Prerogative of the
King; the aſcertaining of the juſt rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Parliament; the defending of the
dues and properties of the Subject are pleaded
and pretended on both ſides, as the ultimate ends
they aime at. Well, as our Saviour ſaid to the
blinde man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 29. <hi>according to your faith
be it unto you:</hi> ſo, according to the ſincerity and
integrity of their hearts whom God knowes means
moſt ſeriouſly, be it unto them; <hi>we wiſh them
good victory in the name of the Lord:</hi> and yet even
herein a friendly peace were as much better then
victory it ſelfe, as the end is better then the means;
for, <hi>bleſſed are the Peace-makers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>31 <hi>Objections.</hi> But may ſome ſay, though we
doe never ſo much deſire peace, we ſhall not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that bleſſing, which is pronounced in my
text, for the Peacemakers are to be bleſſed. And
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:124001:14"/>
it is to be feared, that our breaches are too wide
to be cured, and Gods juſtice muſt have reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon us.</p>
            <p>32 By Peace-makers, Peace-endeavourers are
to be underſtood, not only the effectours of Peace,
but even the Affectours of Peace ſhal be bleſſed.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18. <hi>If it he poſſible, as much as in you lyeth
live peaceably with all men.</hi> God out of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
meaſures mens reward, not by their ſucceſſe
but deſires, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>For if there be firſt a
willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man
hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>33 And yet I am not out of heart, but that there
is hope of Peace, and that as yet our ſinnes are not
ſweld ſo high, but that there is mercy with God
for our nation. Firſt, my hope is founded on the
multitude of good people in this land, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
and batter Heaven with the importunity
of their prayers. We read of <hi>Ptolomeus Philodel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
King of <hi>Egipt</hi> that he cauſed the Bible to be
tranſlated by ſeventy Interpreters, which ſeventy
were ſeverally diſpoſed of in ſeventy ſeverall Cels,
unknown each to other; and yet they did ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in their ſeveral tranſlations, that there was no
conſiderable difference betwixt them, in rendering
the text; an argument that they were acted with
one and the ſame ſpirit. Surely it comforts me
when I call to minde, what ſhall I ſay, ſeventy,
nay ſeven times ſeventy, yea ſeaventy hundred,
yea ſeventy thouſand, which are peaceable in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:124001:15"/>
Iſrael, which on the bended knees of their ſouls, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pray to God for peace. Theſe though they know
not the faces, no not the names one of another,
nay, have neither ſeen nor ſhall ſee one another till
they meet together in happineſſe in Heaven; yet
they unite their votes and centre their ſuffrages
in the ſame thing, that God would reſtore Peace
unto us, who no doubt in his due time will heare
their prayers.</p>
            <p>34 The ſecond thing that comforts mee, is,
when I looke on Gods proceedings hitherto in
our Kingdome, his judgements ſeeme to be judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
rather of expoſtulation then of exterpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 24. that God being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with <hi>Moſes</hi> for not circumciſing his Sonnes;
<hi>It came to paſſe by the way in the Iane that the
Lord met him, and ſought to kill him.</hi> Sought
to kill him? ſtrange: did God ſeeke to kill
him, and not kill him? Speake Lord, ſpeake
to the Fire, and it ſhall with flaſhes conſume
him; to the Ayre, and with peſtilent vapours
it ſhall choake him; to the Water, and with
deluges it ſhall over-whelme him; to the Earth,
and with yawning chops it ſhall devoure him.
Well, the meaning is this, God ſought to kill
him, that is, in ſome outward viſible manner
whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> was apprehenſive God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
his diſpleaſure againſt him, that ſo <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
might both have notice and leiſure to divert
his anger, with removing the cauſe thereof.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:124001:15"/>
He that ſaith to us, <hi>Seeke and yee ſhall finde,</hi>
doth himſelfe ſeeke and not finde; and good
reaſon too, for he ſought with an intent not to
finde. Thus I may ſay, that for theſe laſt foure
yeeres God hath ſtill <hi>ſought</hi> to deſtroy the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>England,</hi> manifeſting an unwillingneſſe
to doe it, if in any reaſonable time we would
compound with him by ſerious repentance. Thus
the loving Father ſhakes the rod over his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
childe, not with an intent to beat him, but
to make him begge pardon; and ſuch hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hath beene Gods dealing with our Nation,
that he even courts and woes us to repentance,
as loath to puniſh us, if wee would underſtand
the ſignes of his anger, before it breake out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us.</p>
            <p>35 But if all faile, yet thoſe that are Peace-makers
in their deſires, doe enter a caveat in the
Court of heaven; That if warres doe enſue,
yet for their part they have laboured againſt it.
If a man ſlaine were found in the field, and it
not knowne who ſlew him, God provided <hi>Deut.</hi>
21. 7. That the Elders of the next City ſhould
waſh their hands in the blood of an Heifer, and
ſay, <hi>Our hands have not ſhed this blood, neither have
our eyes ſeen it, be mercifull, O Lord, unto thy people
Iſrael whom thou haſt redeemed, and lay not innocent
blood unto thy people of Iſraels charge, and the blood
ſhalbe forgiven them.</hi> So this one day will be a
comfort to the conſciences of godly minded men,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:124001:16"/>
that they may appeale to the God of heaven, how
they have prayed heartily for peace, have petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
humbly for Peace, have been contented to
pay deerly for peace, and to their powers have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured
to refraine themſelves from ſinnes, the
breakers of peace; and therefore they truſt that
Chriſtian <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant blood, which ſhall
be ſhed, which hath beene and hereafter may be
ſhed in theſe wofull warres, ſhall never be viſited
on their ſcore or laid to their charge.</p>
            <p>36 But if all faile, and if we muſt be involved
in a finall deſolation, then let us goe to the <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
Office</hi> of our ſoules, and have peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
with God in our Saviour. It was wont to
be ſaid <hi>A mans houſe is his Castle,</hi> but if this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of late hath proved unable to ſecure any, let
them make their conſcience their caſtle, if beaten
from all our parapets and outworkes, let us retire
to this ſtrength for our defence; It may ſeem, be
it ſpoken with all reverence, a blunt expreſſion
of the holy ſpirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Be not afraid of
them that kill the body, and that have no more that
they can doe.</hi> Yea, but one may ſay they may kil me
with torment and with torture, make me drop
out my life by degrees; why the totall ſome of
their malice, is but to kill the body, <hi>and then they
have no more that they can do.</hi> But they may forbid
my body Chriſtian buriall; herein they do not do
but ſuffer, for the living wil be more troubled then
the dead, if thy corps be not committed to earth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:124001:16"/>
ſo that this in effect is juſt nothing. Then let
Drums beat, and Trumpets ſound, and Banners be
diſplaid; let ſwords claſh, and pikes puſh, and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
flye, and Cannons roare; warre doe thy worſt,
Death doe tby worſt, Devill doe thy worſt, their
ſouls ſhalbe happy that ſleep in the Lord, for they
reſt from their labours. However, if it be poſſible,
and if ſo great mercy be ſtored up in God for us,
we would rather have peace in this world; and on
the promoters therof let the bleſſing in the light
and reſt, <hi>Bleſſed are the Peacemakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>37 And now as I began with the mention of
the Faſt, ſo to conclude with the ſame, let us keep
this day of humiliation holy to the Lord. Some
perchance may make this but a mock-faſt, and faſt
for ſome private and ſineſter ends, but every one
that will may make it a true faſt to himſelf, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to be grieved for the miſery of Gods Saints.
God complaines, <hi>Amos</hi> the ſixt, of the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie
of the Iſraelites, wherein wee finde
the compleat Character of an Epicure, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wantons of his five Sences, entertaining
their eyes with <hi>bedſteads of Ivory,</hi> verſe 4. curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to behold for the milk-whiteneſſe thereof;
pleaſing their feeling, <hi>they ſtretch themſelves on
Couches;</hi> courting their eares, <hi>they chant to the
Violl,</hi> ver. 5. contenting their taſte, and making that
ſence a Pander both to gluttony and drunkenneſſe,
<hi>they eate the fat of Lambes, and drinke Wine in
boules,</hi> verſe 6. delighting their ſmell, <hi>and annoynt
themſelves with the chiefe oyntments;</hi> and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:124001:17"/>
all with this ſharpe cloſe, <hi>but they are not
grieved for the affliction of Joſeph.</hi> Wherein the
Prophet alludes to the ſtory of <hi>Joſeph, Gene.</hi> 37.
24. who was put into a pit without water (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ſuch as flowed from his eyes) where he muſt
either dye for want of meat, or dye for being meat
to wilde Beaſts; and yet in the meane time his
Brethren, though they ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul,
<hi>Gene.</hi> 42. 21. (made viſible and tranſparent
through the windowes of his weeping eyes, bended
knees, begging tongue, folded hands) did moſt
barbarouſly <hi>ſit down to eate;</hi> I dare boldly ſay they
ſaid no grace with a good heart, either before
meate or after.</p>
            <p>38 Juſt ſuch is the cruelty of many of us, (who
profeſſe Chriſtianity) to our Brethren in the
Countrey, becauſe as yet the City of <hi>London</hi> is
as the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> being light when all the
reſt is darkned with miſeries, they lay not to heart
the afflictons of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which our Countrey-men
do ſuffer. Where is the man that ſounds a retreat
to his ſoul when he feeles it marching to faſt in
myrth, who abates a diſh of his Table out of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Conſcience, though perchance many doe
out of reaſons of thrift; and I am affraid all ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
muſt doe out of neceſſitie. Well, if we be not
the more penitent, it may come to paſſe, that that
ſad dance which hath beene led all over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
will come to us to this City at laſt, and God
grant we pay not the Muſique for all the reſt.</p>
            <p>39 Remember <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> who kept a Campe in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:124001:17"/>
the Court, and would not enjoy thoſe pleaſures
the marriage bed reached unto him. Thinke of
<hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> lame but loyall, who went not out
with <hi>David</hi> in his perſon, but attended him with
his affections, and during the Kings abſence, <hi>dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
not his feet,</hi> (enough to gangrene them) as not
caring for his owne feet, whileſt his Soveraignes
head was in danger. Seriouſly conſider <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
who ſympathized with the calamities of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
which ſadded his countenance even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the King. Two things onely can make a
Courtier ſad, ſickneſſe (which cannot be diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled)
and his Princes diſpleaſure. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had
neither of theſe, he was in perfect health, and he
ſtood <hi>rectus in curia,</hi> right in his Soveraignes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme,
as appeares, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 2. 2. by the Kings
favourable and familiar queſtioning him, <hi>why is thy
countenance ſad, ſeeing thou art not ſicke?</hi> So then,
it was nothing elſe but the impreſſion of the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Gods Saints, which clouded the brightneſſe
of his countenance with ſadneſſe. And God grant
we having the ſame cauſe, we may have the ſame
compaſſion with him. Amen.</p>
