            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

into the Skuttle, (I think that's the name on't) at

               <p>Gentlemen,
says he, I am no longer Master of my Ship, the
Wind has got the better of me, and all we have now
to do is to call upon God, and fit our selves for Death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>Marry, a cold Comfort!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>But first, says he,
we must lighten the Ship, for there's no strugling
with Necessity; we had better try if we can save our
selves with the loss of our Goods, than loose both
together. The Proposition was found Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and a great deal of Rich Merchandize was
cast over-board.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>This was <hi>casting away</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Letter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>There was in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54880:5"/>
a certain <hi>Italian,</hi> that had been upon am Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie
to the King of <hi>Gotland,</hi> and had abundance
of Plate, Rings, Diapers, and rich wearing Cloaths
aboard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>And he, I warrant you, was loth to
come to a Composition with the Sea.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>No, not
altogether so neither; but he declar'd that he would
never part with his beloved Goods, and that they
would either Sink or Swim together.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>And what
said the Pilate to this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>If you and your Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
were to Drown by your selves, says he, here's
no body would hinder you; but never imagine that
we'll endanger our lives for your Boxes; If you are
resolv'd not to part, ye shall e'n over-bord toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>Spoken like a true <hi>Terpawlin.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>So
the <hi>Italian</hi> submitted at length, but with many a
bitter Curse, upward and downward, for commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his life to so boysterous an Element.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>I am

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>The Winds
were not one jot the better for the Presents we had
made them, but soon after they tore our Cordage,
threw down our Sails.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Lamentable!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>And then the Man comes to us again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>With

               <p>He gives us a
Salute, and bids us fall to our Prayers, and prepare
our selves for another World, for our time, says he,
is at hand. One of the Passengers askt him how
many hours he thought the Vessel might be kept
above Water. His Answer was, that he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
nothing at all, but that three hours was the
utmost.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>This was yet a harder Chapter than

               <p>
                  <hi>Upon these words he Baules out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,</hi>
Cut the Shrowds; down with the Mast by

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>But why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>Because now they were only
a Cumber to the Ship, and of no use at all; for we
had nothing to trust to but the Helm.</p>

               <p>What

               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so wretched a face of things! The Seamen they
were at their <hi>Salve Regina;</hi> Imploring the <hi>Virgin-Mother;</hi>
calling her <hi>the Star of the Sea; the Lady of
the World; the Haven of Health;</hi> with abundance of
other fine Titles that we hear no News of in the

            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>What has she to do with the Sea,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>In times past, the <hi>Pagans</hi>
gave <hi>Venus,</hi> that was born of the Sea, the Charge of
Seafaring-men: and since she look'd no better after
them, the <hi>Christians</hi> will have a <hi>Virgin-President,</hi> to

               <p>O most Merciful, Generous,

               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>Some were Spewing, Some were
Praying; I remember there was an <hi>English</hi> man there,
What Golden Mountains did he promise to our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Walsingham,</hi> if ever he got safe ashore again!
One made a Vow to a Relique of the <hi>Cross</hi> in one
place; a second, to a Relique of it in another; and so
they did to all the <hi>Virgin Maries</hi> up and down; and
they think it goes for nothing if they do not name

            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>

               <p>And some promise to
turn <hi>Carthusians.</hi> There was one among the rest
that Vow'd a <hi>Pilgrimage, bare-foot</hi> and <hi>bare-head</hi> to
<hi>St. Iames</hi> of <hi>Compostella</hi> in a <hi>Coat of Male,</hi> and <hi>begging

            <sp>

               <p>I could not but laugh at one Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
there, that Vow'd to <hi>St. Christopher</hi> in the great
Church at <hi>Paris,</hi> as loud as ever he could bellow, (that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54880:6"/>
he might be sure to be heard) a <hi>Wax Candle</hi> as big
as himself. (Now you must know that the <hi>Paris-St. Christopher</hi>
is rather a Mountain than a <hi>Statue)</hi> He
was so loud, and went over and over with it so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that a Friend of his gave him a touch upon the
Elbow. <hi>Have a care what you Promise,</hi> says he, <hi>for if
you should sell your self to your Shirt, you are not able to
purchase such a Candle. Hold your tongue you fool,</hi> (says
to'ther, softly, for fear <hi>St. Christopher</hi> should hear
him;) <hi>These are but words of course; Let me set foot
a Land once, and he has good luck if he get so much
as a</hi> Tallow-Candle <hi>of me.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>I fancy this Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head

            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>I wonder no body thought of <hi>St.</hi> Paul;
for he has been at Sea you know, and suffer'd Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck,
and then leapt ashore; and he understood
better then other people what it was to be in that
Condition.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>As if it had

               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>How Religious does Affliction make a

               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>None of 'em all, I assure you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I don't like your way of
Conditioning, and Contracting with the Saints.</hi> Do
this, and I'll do that: Here's one for t'other; Save me,

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>But
did you call upon none of the Saints for Help?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>No, not so much as that neither.</p>

               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>Because Heaven is large ye know:
As put the Case, I should recommend my self to St.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>I
e'en went the next way to God himself, and said my
<hi>Pater Noster;</hi> the Saints neither Hear so readily, nor
Give so willingly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>But did not your Conscience
check you? Were you not afraid to call him <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
whom you had so often offended?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>To deal
freely with you, I was a little fearful at first; but upon
recollection, I thought thus with my self. Let a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
be never so angry with a <hi>Son,</hi> yet if he sees him
falling into a River, he will take him up, though't be
by the hair of the Head, and lay him upon the Bank.
The quietest Creature in the whole Company, was
a Woman there, with a Child at her Breast.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>Why,
what of her?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>She neither Clamour'd nor Cry'd,
nor Promis'd, but hugging of the poor Infant, prayed
softly to her self. By this time the Ship struck, and
they were fain to bind her <hi>fore and aft</hi> with Cables,
for fear she should fall to pieces.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>That was

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>Upon this, up starts an old
Priest, of about <hi>threescore</hi> (his name was <hi>Adam</hi>)
strips himself to his Shirt, throws away his Boots,
and Shooes, and bids us provide to Swim; and so
standing in the middle of the Ship, he Preached to
us out of <hi>Gerson,</hi> upon the Five Truths of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of <hi>Confession,</hi> and so exhorts every man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himself, either for Life, or Death. There was
a <hi>Dominican</hi> there too; and they Confest, that had a

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>I saw eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

to God, Condemning my own Iniquity, and
Imploring his Mercy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>I e'en left that to God; for he is to judge me, and
not I my self: and yet I was not without comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54880:7"/>
comes to us again, all in Tears; prepare your
selves good people, says he, for ye have not one
quarter of an hour to live; the Ship leaks from one
end to t'other. Presently after this, he tells us that
he has Made a high Tower, and urges us by all means
to call for help, to what Saint soever it was, that
had the Protection of that Temple, and so they all
fell down and worshipped that unknown Power.</p>

               <p>But that
we did not know. The Pilate however Steers his
torn and leaky Vessel toward that place, as well as
he could, and if the Ship had not been well Girt,
she had without more ado, fallen directly one piece
from another.</p>

               <p>We
were now come so near the Shore, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
took notice of our distress, and came down in
throngs to the Sea-side, making Signs, by spreading
their Cloaks, and holding up their Hats upon Poles,
that they would have us put in there; giving us
likewise to understand by casting their Arms into
the Air, how much they pitted our Misfortune.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>I would fain know what follow'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>The Vessel
was now come to that pass, that we had almost as
good have been in the Sea, as in the Ship.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>You were hard put to't, I perceive.</p>

               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
They empty the Ship-Boat, and into the Sea
with it: every body presses to get in, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
cry out they'll sink the Vessel, and that they
had better every one shift for himself, and Swim for't.
There was no time now for Consultation; one takes
an Oar, another a Pole, a Plank, a Tub, or what was
next hand, and so they committed themselves to the
Billows.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>But what became now of the patient
Woman?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>She was the first that got ashore.</p>

               <speaker>An.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>We set her upon a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54880:8"/>
Rib of the Ship, and then ty'd her to't, so that she
could hardly be wash'd off, with a Bord in her
hand that served her for an Oar; we cleared her of
the Vessel, which was the greatest danger, and so
setting her aflote, we gave her our Blessing. She
had her Child in her left hand, and Row'd with her
Right.</p>

               <p>When
there was nothing else left, one of the Company tore
away a <hi>Wooden-Image</hi> of the <hi>Mother-Virgin</hi> (an old

to Swim upon't.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>

               <p>No, that was lost at first with thirty

               <p>The

               <p>I had
rather have had it, then a better thing. But look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about me, I bethought my self in good time of
the Stump of the Mast; and because I could not get
it off alone, I took a Partner to assist me; we
both plac'd our selves upon it, and put to Sea, I
held the right corner, and my Companion the left.
While we lay tumbling and tossing, the <hi>Sea-Priest</hi>
I told you off, squabs himself down directly upon
our Shoulders; it was a fat heavy Fellow, and we
both of us cry'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nay he was to have
been in the Boat with the <hi>Dominican;</hi> for they
all had a great respect for him: but though they had
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54880:8"/>
confest themselves in the Ship, yet leaving out I

again, and one lays his hand upon the other; in
which <hi>interim,</hi> the Boat is overturn'd; and this I

               <p>While we
were yet rowling, and beating near the Ship, and at
the Mercy of the Waves, by great misfortune the
Thigh of my <hi>Left-hand-man</hi> was broken with a
Nail, that made him lose his Hold; the <hi>Priest</hi> gave
him his <hi>Benediction,</hi> and came into his place, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
me to maintain my Post resolutely, and to
keep my legs still going. In the mean while we had
our Bellies full of Salt-water, for <hi>Neptune</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
us a <hi>Potion,</hi> as well as a <hi>Bath,</hi> though the Priest
shew'd him a Trick for't.</p>

               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>What was that I
prithee?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ad.</speaker>
               <p>Why he turn'd his head upon every
Billow, and stopt his Mouth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>

               <p>When we had been a while
<hi>adrift,</hi> and made some advance, Chear up, says the
<hi>Priest,</hi> (who was a very tall man) for I feel ground.
No, no, said I, we are too far off yet from the
Shoar, (and I durst not so much as hope for such a
Blessing) I tell you again, says he, my feet are at
the Ground, and I would needs perswade him that it
was rather some part of the Wreck that was driven
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54880:9"/>
on by the Current. I tell you once again, says he,
that I am just now scratching the bottom with my
Toes. When we had floated a little longer, and
that he felt ground again, Do you what you please,
says he, but for my part, I'll leave you the whole
Mast, and wade for't; and so he took his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
still to follow the Wave, and as another Billow
came on, he would catch hold of his knees, and set
himself firm against it, one while up and another
while down, like a <hi>Didapper.</hi> Finding that this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
so well with him, I follow'd his example.
There stood upon the Shoar several men with long
Pikes, which were handed from one to another,
and kept them firm against the force of the Waves;
they were strong body'd men, and us'd to the Sea;
and he that was last, held out his Pike to the next
comer; he lays hold of it, and so they retire and
draw him ashoar; There were some preserv'd this
way.</p>

               <p>A

for one that does nothing <hi>himself,</hi> to make a

that you should tie up your self by a Vow to your

I should Fast twice a week for so many Months.
Would I pinch my Guts do ye think, to make good
your Vow?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>No. I do not believe you would:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54880:10"/>
No, not if you had made the Vow in your own
Name; for you would have found some Trick or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have droll'd it off. But you must consider
that there was a Mother-in-Law, and somewhat of
Duty in the Case; and Women are Passionate you
know; and I had an Interest at stake.</p>

            <sp>

Risque had you run?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>There would have lyen no
Action of the Case; but yet the Saint I must confess
might have stopt his ears some other time, or brought
some sly mischief into my Family; (as people in
power, you know, are Revengeful.)</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee tell

What does he do?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly, matters are come

               <p>Leave your Fooling: as if
you did not know that Saints never grow old. No,
no, 'tis long of this new Opinion that is come to be
so rife now in the World, that he is so little Visited;
and those that do come, give him only a bare Salute,
and little or nothing else; they can bestow their
Money to better purpose (they say) upon those that
want it.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>And this is
the reason that this great Apostle, that was wont
to be cover'd with Gold, and Jewels, is now brought
to the very block he was made of; and hardly so
much as a Tallow Candle to do him Honour.</p>

Greeting. These are to give you
to understand, that we take in good part your strenuous
Endeavours (as a True Disciple of <hi>Luther</hi>) to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the World of the Vanity and Needlesness of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating
Saints:</hi> For I was e'en wearied out of my
Life with Importunities, Petitions, and Complaints:
Every body comes to me; as if my Son were to be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a Child, because he is Painted so; And because
they see him at my Breast still, they take for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he dares deny me nothing that I ask him, for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54880:11"/>
fear that, when he has a mind to't, I should deny him the
Bubby. Nay, and their requests are sometimes so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
that I am asham'd to mention them; and that
which a young Fellow (not wholly abandon'd to his
Lusts) would hardly ask of a Bawd, they have the
face to desire from a Virgin. The <hi>Merchant</hi> when he is
to make a long Voyage, desires me to take Care of his
<hi>Concubine.</hi> The Professed <hi>Nun,</hi> when she is to make
her Escape, recommends to me the Care of her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when at the same time she's resolv'd to turn <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute.</hi>
The <hi>Soldier</hi> marches to a <hi>Butchery,</hi> and
<hi>Slaughter,</hi> with these Words in his mouth, <hi>Blessed
Virgin, put into my hands a Fat Prisoner, or a Rich
Plunder.</hi> The <hi>Gamester</hi> Prays to me for a good Hand
at <hi>Dice,</hi> and Promises me a Snip with him in the Profit
of the Cheat: and if he has but an Ill Run, how am I
Curs'd, and Raill'd at? because I would not be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
in his Wickedness. The <hi>Usurer</hi> Prays for <hi>Ten
in the Hundred;</hi> and I am no longer the Mother of
Mercy, if I deny it him. And there is another sort of
People, whose Prayers are not so properly Wicked, as
Foolish. The <hi>Maids,</hi> they Pray for <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Handsom
Husbands;</hi> the <hi>Wives</hi> for <hi>Fair Children;</hi> the <hi>Big
Belly'd,</hi> for <hi>Easie Labour;</hi> the <hi>Old Trot,</hi> for <hi>Good
Lungs,</hi> and that I would keep her from <hi>Coughs</hi> and
<hi>Catarrhes.</hi> He that is Mop'd and Decrepite, would be
<hi>Young</hi> again. The <hi>Philosopher</hi> Prays for the Faculty of
starting <hi>Difficulties never to be Resolv'd:</hi> The <hi>Priest</hi>
for a <hi>Plump Benefice;</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> for <hi>the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own Diocess;</hi> the <hi>Mariner</hi> for a <hi>Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Voyage;</hi> the <hi>Magistrate, that I would shew
him my Son before he dies;</hi> the <hi>Courtier,</hi> that he
may make an <hi>Effectual Confession</hi> upon the Point of
<hi>Death</hi> (as the last thing that he intends to do;) the
<hi>Husbandman</hi> for <hi>Seasonable Weather;</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi>
for her <hi>Pigs</hi> and <hi>Poultry.</hi> If I deny them any thing, I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54880:12"/>
am presently hard-hearted. If I send 'em to my Son,
their Answer is, <hi>if you'll but say the word, I'm sure
he'll do't.</hi> How is it possible now for me, that am a
lone Body, and a Virgin, to attend Sailors, Soldiers,
Merchants, Gamesters, Princes, Plowmen, Marriages,
Great Bellies? and all this is nothing yet, to what I
suffer. And this trouble is almost over too, (make me
thankful for't) if the Riddance were not accompany'd
with a greater Inconvenience; for the Money and the
Reputation that I have lost by't, is worth a great deal
more then the leisure that I have gotten; for instead of
the <hi>Queen of the Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>Lady of the World,</hi>
not one of a thousand treats me now so much as with a
single <hi>Ave Mary.</hi> Oh! the Presents of God, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones, that were made me formerly; the rich
Embroideries, and the Choice I had of Gowns and Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats!
whereas, I am now fain to content my self
with one half of a Vest, and that mouse-eaten too; and
a years. Revenue will hardly keep Life and Soul toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the poor Wretch that lights me Candles. And
all this might be born yet, if you would stop here, which
they say you will not, till you have stript the <hi>Altars,</hi> as
well as the <hi>Saints.</hi> Let me advise you, over and over,
to have a care what you do; for you will find the Saints
better provided for a Revenge, then you are aware of.
What will you get by throwing <hi>Peter</hi> out of the <hi>Church,</hi>
when he comes to keep you out of Heaven? <hi>Paul</hi> has a
<hi>Sword; Bartlemew</hi> has a <hi>Knife;</hi> the <hi>Monk William</hi>
has a <hi>Privy Coat</hi> under his Habit, and a <hi>Lance</hi> to boot.
What will you do when you come to encounter <hi>George</hi> on
Horse-back in his <hi>Curiasse Arms,</hi> with his <hi>Spear</hi> and
his <hi>Whinyard?</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> himself has his <hi>Holy
Fire.</hi> Nor is there any of them all, that one way or other,
cannot do mischief enough if he pleases. Nay, weak as
I am, you'll have much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54880:12"/>
resolv'd you shall have both or none. If you'l set up a

and you shall do well to consider of an Answer,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Why then you shall
have a Mathematical Illustration. If there should
come a Thunderbolt from <hi>Rome,</hi> against all <hi>Monks,</hi>
then they'll be all Canons. Or if his Holiness should
allow all <hi>Monks</hi> to take Wives, then they'll be all
<hi>Monks.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>These are wonderful Favours; I would
they would take mine for one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>But to the Point:
This Colledge has little else to maintain it than the
Liberality of the Virgin; for all Presents of Value
are laid up; but for small Mony, and things of little
Moment, it goes to the feeding of the Flock, and
the Head of it, whom they call the <hi>Prior.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>What
are they? Men of good Lives?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Not much amiss,
for their Piety is more worth than their Revenue.
The Church is Neat, and Artificial; but the <hi>Virgin</hi>
does not live in it her self; for upon the Point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
she has given it to her Son; but she has her
Place however upon his Right Hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Upon
his Right Hand? which way looks her Son then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>That's well thought of. When he looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>West,</hi> he has his Mother on his <hi>Right hand;</hi>
and when to the <hi>East</hi> on his <hi>Left;</hi> and she does not
dwell here neither; for the Building is not finisht;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54880:13"/>
the Doors and Windows lie all open, and the Wind
blows through it; and that's a bleak Wind you'll
say, that comes from the Sea.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>This is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
hard methinks; but where does she dwell then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>In that unfinisht Church I told you of, there's a
small boarded Chappel, with a little Door on each
side to receive Visitors. There's scarce any light at
all to't, more than what comes from the Tapers,
but a most delicious Perfume.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>These things
cannot but conduce strangely to Religion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>You
would say something, <hi>Menedemus,</hi> if you saw it
within, how it glitters with Gold, Silver, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
Rubies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>You have set me agog to

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Take my word for't, if you do,
you shall never repent your Journey.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Is there
no <hi>Holy Oyl</hi> there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Well said, <hi>Simpleton.</hi> That
<hi>Oyl</hi> is only the Sweat of Saints in their Sepulchres;
as of <hi>Andrew, Katherine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mary,</hi> you know,
was never bury'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>That was my Mistake; but
I pray go on with your Story.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
propagation of Religion, they shew some things
at one place, and some at another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it turns to their Profit too, as we say, <hi>Many a
little, makes a Mickle.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>And you never fail of
some body at hand to shew you what you have a
mind to see.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>One of the Canons it may be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>No, by no means; they are not made use of;
for fear that under colour of Religion, they should
prove Irreligious, and lose their own Virginity in
the very service of the <hi>Virgin.</hi> In the Inward Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
there stands a <hi>Regular</hi> at the Altar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And
what's his business?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Only to receive and keep that
which is given.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But may not a man chuse whether
he will give any thing or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he may; but
there is a certain Religious Modesty in some People;
they will give bountifully if any body looks on; but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54880:14"/>
not one farthing perhaps without a Witness; or at
least not so much as otherwise.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>This is right
flesh and bloud, and I find it my self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Nay,
there are some so strangely devote to the <hi>Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi>
that while they pretend to lay one Gift upon
the Altar, by a marvellous flight of hand they'll
steal away another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But what if no body were
by? Would not the <hi>Virgin</hi> call them to account?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Why should she take any more notice of them,
than God himself does, when People break into his
Temple, Rob his Altars, and Commit Sacrilege?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>The impious Confidence of these Wretches,
and the Patience of Almighty God, are both of them
admirable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Upon the <hi>North side,</hi> there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Gate (I do not mean of the Church) but of the
Wall that encloses the Church-yard; it has a very
little Door, like the Wicket that you see in some
great Gates of Noblemens Houses. A man must
venture the breaking of his Shins, and stoop too, or
there's no getting in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>An Enemy would be
hard put to't to enter a Town at such a Passage.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>So a man would think; and yet the <hi>Verger</hi> told me
for certain, that a Knight a Horseback, with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
at his heels, made his Escape through this
Door, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>v'd himself. When he was at the last
pinch, he bethought himself of a suddain, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
himself to the Blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> there at hand,
resolving to take Sanctuary at her Altar, if he could
come at it: when all in an instant (a thing almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible)
he and his Horse were convey'd safe into
the Church-yard, and his Adversary stark mad on
the other side for his disappointment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And did
you really believe what he told you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Beyond all
dispute.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>One would hardly have expected it
from a man of your Philosophy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, which
is more, he shew'd me the very image of this Knight
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54880:14"/>
in a Copper Plate that was nail'd to the Door, in
the very Cloaths that were then in fashion, and are
to be seen yet in sever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> old English Pictures: which
if they be right drawn, the Barbers and Clothiers in
those days had but an Ill time on't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>How so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>He had perfectly the Beard of a Goat, and not
one Wrinkle in his Doublet and Hose; but they were
made so strait, as if he had been rather stitcht up in
them, then they cut out for him. In another Plate
there was an exact Description of the Chappel, the
Figure and the Size of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>So that now there was
no further doubt to be made upon the matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Under this little Gate, there's an iron Grate, that was
made only for one to pass a foot; for it would not
have been decent that any Horse should afterward
trample upon the Ground that the former Horsman
had consecrated to the <hi>Virgin.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Eastward</hi> from thence, there's another Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
full of Wonders, to the degree of Prodigies.
Thither I went, and another Officer receiv'd me.
When we had Pray'd a little, he shews the middle
Joint of a Mans Finger. First I kist it, and then I
askt to whom that Relique formerly belong'd? He
told me to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> What, said I, the <hi>Apostle?</hi> he told
me yes. Now the Joint was large enough to have
answered the Bulk of a Giant; upon which Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> said I, was a very proper Fellow then.
Which set some of the Company a laughing, truly to
my trouble; for if they had kept their Countenance,
we should have had the whole History of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.
But however we dropt the man some small
mony, and piec'd up the matter as well as we could.
Just before this Chappel, stood a little House, which
the Officer told us, was convey'd thither thorough
the Air, after a wonderful manner, in a terrible Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when there was nothing to be seen but Ice and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54880:15"/>
Snow. Within this House there were two Pits brim
full, that sprang (as he told us) from a Fountain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
to the <hi>Holy Virgin.</hi> The Water is strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cold, and the best remedy in the World for Pains
in the Head or the Stomach.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Just as proper as
Oyl would be to quench a Fire.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>You must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
my Friend, this is a Miracle. Now it would be
no Miracle for Water to quench Thirst.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>That

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>It was posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
affirm'd that this Spring burst out in an instant,
at the command of the <hi>Holy Virgin.</hi> Upon a strict
Observation of every thing I saw, I askt the Officer
how many years it might be since that little House
was brought thither. He told me that it had been
there for some ages; and yet (said I) methinks the
Walls do not seem to be of that Antiquity; and
he did not much deny it. Nor these Pillars (said I.)
No Sir, says he, they are but of late standing, (and
the thing discover'd it self.) And then, said I, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
that Straw, those Reeds, and the whole
Thatch of it look as if they had not been so long
laid. 'Tis very right, Sir, says he; and what do you
think, said I, of those Cross Beams and Rafters? they
cannot be near so old. He confest they were not. At
last, when I had questioned him to every part of
this poor Cottage; How do you know, said I, that
this is the House that was brought so far in the Air
so many Ages ago?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Prithee how did he come

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Without any more to do, he shew'd
us an old <hi>Bear-skin</hi> that was tackt there to a piece of
Timber, and almost laught at us to our very teeth,
as people under an invincible Ignorance. Upon seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <sp>

               <p>It

               <p>And so they tell us of
the <hi>Cross,</hi> which is shew'd up and down both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and in private, in so many Reliques, that if all
the Fragments were laid together, they would load
an <hi>East-India-ship:</hi> and yet our Saviour carry'd the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And is not
this a wonderful thing too?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>It is extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
I must confess; but nothing is wonderful to an

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis well done
however to make the best on't: but I'm afraid that
we have many a Trick put upon us, under the Masque
of Piety, and Religion.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And yet what's more common than
for the Sacrilegious themselves (such is the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of God) to scape in this World without so

               <p>This

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And is it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
too?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>What do you talk to me of Liquid;
when 'twas drawn above Fifteen hundred year ago.
It is now come to a Concretion, and looks just like
pounded Chalk with the White of an Egg.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But
will they not let a man see it open?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Not upon
any terms. Men would be kissing of it, and profane
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>You say very well; for all Lips are not fit
to approach it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>So soon as the Officer sees us, he
runs presently, and puts on his Surplice, and a Stole
about his Neck, falls down, and Worships; and by
and by gives us the <hi>Holy Milk</hi> to kiss; and we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
our selves too, in the first place, bowing to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54880:16"/>
Christ, and then, applying to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
prayer, which I had in readiness for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VIrgin Mother!</hi> That hast deservedly given suck to
the Lord of Heaven and Earth, thy Son <hi>Jesus</hi> at
thy <hi>Virgins Breasts;</hi> We pray thee, that we, being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by his Bloud, may our selves arrive at the Happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
State of the Simplicity and Innocence of Doves;
and that being Void of Malice, Fraud, and Deceit, we
may daily thirst after the Milk of Evangelical Doctrine,
until it grows up to be perfect Man, and to the Measure
of the Fulness of Christ, whose blessed Society thou shalt
enjoy for ever and ever, with the Father and the Holy
Ghost, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Truly a very devout Prayer: but what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>If my eyes did not deceive me, they were
both pleased, for the <hi>Holy Milk</hi> seem'd to leap and
sparkle; and the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> of a sudden lookt brighter
than usual. In the mean while, the <hi>Verger</hi> came to
us, and without a word speaking, held out such a
kind of Table as they use in <hi>Germany</hi> upon their
Bridges, when they take Toll.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>I remember
those Tables very well, and have curst them many
a time in my Travels that way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>We laid down
some pieces of Mony, which he presented to the
<hi>Virgin.</hi> After this, by our Interpreter, one <hi>Robert
Aldridge,</hi> (as I remember) a well spoken young
man, and a great Master of the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, I
askt as civilly as I could, what assurance they had
that this was the <hi>Milk</hi> of the <hi>Virgin:</hi> which I did,
with a pious intention that I might stop the Mouths
of all Scoffers and Gainsayers. The Officer, at first,
contracted his Brow, without a word speaking; and
thereupon I prest the Interpreter to put the same
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54880:16"/>
question to him again, but in the fairest manner ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
which he did in so obliging a fashion, that if
the Address had been to the Mother her self, when she
had been newly laid, it could not have been taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss.
But the Officer, as if he had been inspir'd with
some <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> expressing in his Countenance the
horrour and detestation he had for so blasphemous a
question; <hi>What need is there,</hi> says he, <hi>of these Enquiries,
when you have so Authentick a Record for the truth of
the matter?</hi> And we had undoubtedly been turn'd out
for Heretiques, if we had not sweetn'd the angry Man
with a few Pence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But how did you behave your
selves in the interim?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Just as if we had been stun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with a Cudgel, or struck with Thunder. We
did most humbly beg his Pardon (as in holy matters
a man ought to do) and so went our way from thence
to the little Chappel, which is the peculiar Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
of the <hi>Holy Virgin.</hi> In our way thither, comes
one of the under Officers to us, staring us in the face
as if he knew us; and after him a second, and a third,
all gaping upon us after the same manner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Who
knows but they might have a mind to draw your
Picture?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>But my thoughts lookt quite another
way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Why, what did you imagine then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>That some body had robbed the Virgins Chappel,
and that I had been suspected for the Sacrilege; and
therefore I enter'd the Holy place with this Prayer
to the <hi>Virgin-Mother</hi> in my Mouth.</p>
               <p>OH! Thou alone, who among Women art a Mother,
and a Virgin; the Happiest of Mothers, and the
Purest of Virgins: We that are impure, do now present
our selves before thee that art Pure; humbly saluting
and paying reverence unto thee, with our small Offerings,
such as they are. O that thy Son would enable us to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54880:17"/>
imitate thy most holy Life, and that we might deserve,
by the Grace of the Holy Spirit, spiritually to conceive
the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in our Souls, and having once received
him, never to lose him. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so I kist the Altar, laid down my Offring,
and departed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>What did the <hi>Virgin</hi> here? Did
she give you no token that your Prayer was heard?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>It was (as I told you) but an uncertain Light,
and she stood in the dark upon the Right hand of the
Altar: but in fine, my courage was so taken down
by the Cheque the former Officer gave me, that I
durst not so much as lift up my eyes again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>So that this Adventure, I perceive did not succeed
so well.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Oh best of all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>You have put me
in courage again, for, as your Author has it, my
heart was e'en sunk into my Breeches.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>After
dinner we go to Church again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>How durst
you do that, under a suspicion of Sacrilege?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>It may be I was, but so long as I did not suspect my
self, all was well: a good Conscience fears nothing:
I had a great Mind to see the Record that the <hi>Verger</hi>
referr'd us too; and after a long search, at last we
found it: but the Table was hung so high, that
a man must have good eyes to read it. Now
mine are none of the best, nor yet the worst: but as
<hi>Aldridge</hi> read, I went along with him: for I had not
faith enough wholly to relie upon him in so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
an Affair.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But were you satisfy'd in the point
at last?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>So fully, that I was asham'd that ever I
had doubted of it: every thing was made so clear;
the Name, the Place, the very Order of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding;
and in one word, there was nothing more
to be desired.</p>
               <p>There was one <hi>William</hi> (born at <hi>Paris)</hi> a man of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54880:17"/>
general Piety, but most particularly industrious in
gathering together all the Reliques of Saints that
were to be gotten over the whole World. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
after he had travell'd several Countries, and
taken a View of all Monasteries, and Temples, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he pass'd, came at last to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where
a Brother of his was at that time a Bishop; who gave
him notice, when he was preparing for his Return,
that there was a certain Nun that had a quantity of
the <hi>Mother Virgins Milk;</hi> and that if any of it were
to be gotten, either by Art, or for Love, or Mony, it
would make him the happiest Man in Nature; and
that all the Reliques which he had hitherto collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were nothing to't. This same <hi>William</hi> never
rested till he had obtain'd the one half of this <hi>Holy
Milk;</hi> which he valu'd above the Treasure of an
Empire.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>No question of it; and a thing so
unexpected too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>He goes strait homeward, and
falls sick upon the way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>As there's no trust to
human Felicity, either that it shall be perfect or long
liv'd!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Finding himself in danger, he calls a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
to him; (his friend and fellow Traveller) makes
him swear Secresie, and then delivers him this <hi>Milk,</hi>
upon Condition that if he gets home safe, he should
deposite that Treasure, upon the Altar of the <hi>Holy
Virgin</hi> in the famous Church of <hi>Paris;</hi> that Church
that has the <hi>Seine</hi> on each side of it; as if the River
it self gave place, in reverence to the Divinity of
the Saint. To be short, <hi>William</hi> is dead and bury'd,
the other takes Post, and he dies too; but finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in extremity, he delivers the Milk to an <hi>English</hi>
Nobleman, but under the strictest obligation imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
that the Count should so dispose of it as he
himself would have done; the one dies, the other
receives it, and puts it upon the Altar in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Canons of the place, who in those days
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54880:18"/>
were still called <hi>Regulars</hi> (as they are yet at <hi>St. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noveve.</hi>)
Upon his Request, these <hi>Regulars</hi> were
prevail'd upon to divide the Milk with him, one
Moyety whereof was carry'd into <hi>England;</hi> and by
him afterward deposited upon the Altar I told you
of, as moved thereunto by a divine Impulse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Why this is a Story now that hangs handsomly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>And to put all out of doubt, the very
Bishops names are set down, that were authorized to
grant Releases, and Indulgencies to those that should
come to see it, according to the power to them gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
but not without some obligation or other in
token of their Veneration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Very good; and
how far did that power extend?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>To <hi>forty</hi> days.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But are there days in <hi>Purgatory?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>There is
Time there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But when the stock of <hi>forty days</hi>
is gone, have they no more to bestow?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Oh
you mistake the business! for 'tis not here, as in
the Tub of the <hi>Danaides,</hi> which is always filling, and
always empty; but here, take out as long as you
will, there's never the less in the Vessel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But
what if they should now give a Remission for <hi>forty
days,</hi> to 100000 <hi>men?</hi> has every one of them his
proportion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>All alike.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And suppose a
man should have <hi>forty days</hi> granted him in the <hi>morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
have they wherewithal to give him <hi>forty days</hi>
more at night?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes, if it were ten times
over every hour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>If I had but such a device at
home, I should not ask much to set up withal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>You might e'n as well wish to be turn'd into a Golden
Statue, and as soon have your asking. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to my History. There was one Argument ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which methought was of great Pity and Candor,
which was, that tho' the <hi>Virgins Milk</hi> in many other
places, might challenge due Veneration, yet this was
to be the most esteem'd, because it was sav'd as it fell
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54880:18"/>
from the Virgins Breasts, without touching the
ground; whereas the other was scrap'd off from
Rocks and Stones.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But how does that appear?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>From the very mouth of the Nun at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
that gave it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And it may be she had it from
<hi>St. Bernard.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>I believe she had.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>For he had
the Happiness to taste the Milk of the same Breast
that suck'd out Saviour: so that I wonder he was
not rather called <hi>Lactifluous</hi> than <hi>Mellifluous.</hi> But how
is that the <hi>Virgins Milk</hi> that did not flow from her
<hi>Breasts?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>It did flow from her Breasts; but
dropping upon the Rock she sat upon, it was there
concreted; and afterward, by Providence, multiply'd
and encreas'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>You say well, go forward now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>We were now upon the point of marching off;
but still walking and looking about us to see if there
were any thing else worth taking notice of; and there
were the <hi>Chappel Officers</hi> again, learing at us, pointing,
nodding, running up and down back and forward,
as if they would fain have spoken to us, but had
not the face to do't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And did not your heart
go pit apat upon't?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>No, not at all; but on
the contrary I lookt them chearfully in the very
eyes; as who should say, <hi>speak and welcome.</hi> At length
one of them comes to me, and asks me my name. I
tell it him. <hi>Are not you the man,</hi> says he, <hi>that a matter of
two years since, set up a</hi> Votive-Table <hi>here in</hi> Hebrew
Letters? I told him I was that person.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Do you
write <hi>Hebrew</hi> then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>No, but let me tell you,
they take every thing to be <hi>Hebrew</hi> they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.

so?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Because they don't understand <hi>Hebrew.</hi>

               <p>Neither.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>

               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Virgin</hi> is so poor, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54880:19"/>
she is not able to be at the charge of a <hi>Staff</hi> and <hi>Mitre;</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>But methinks at least they should have a <hi>President.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Because a <hi>President</hi> is a name of <hi>Dignity;</hi> not of

will have no Abbots.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>You are

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>I have

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Observe me
now. He that is next to the <hi>Prior,</hi> is the <hi>Posterior Prior.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Yes the <hi>Sub-Prior.</hi>

               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>That man saluted me
with great Courtesie, and then fell to tell me what
pains had been taken to read those Verses; what
wiping of Spectacles there had been to no purpose;
how often such a Doctor of Law, and another Doctor
of Divinity, had been brought thither to expound
the Table. One would have the Character to be
<hi>Arabick,</hi> another lookt upon't as a <hi>Sham,</hi> and to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
nothing at all; but in conclusion, there was one
found out that made a shift to read the Title, which
was written in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Roman Capitals.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi>
Verses, in <hi>Greek Capitals;</hi> which at first sight lookt
like <hi>Roman.</hi> Upon their request, I turn'd them word
for word into <hi>Latin,</hi> and they would have paid me
for my pains; but I excus'd my self with a Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that for the Holy Virgins sake, I would do any
thing in the World; and that if she had any Letters
to send, even to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> I would not stick to go
upon the Errant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>As if she could want Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that has so many Angels perpetually waiting
about her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>He took out of his Purse a little
piece of Wood, that was cut off from the <hi>Beam</hi> the
<hi>Virgin Mother</hi> stood upon, and made me a Present of
it. I found by the wonderful fragrancy of it, that the
thing was sacred, and could not do less than kiss it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54880:19"/>
twenty times over; and in the lowest posture of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
(bare-headed, and with the highest degree
of Reverence) I put it up in my Pocket.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Mayn't
a man see it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>I'm not against it; but if you
have either eat or drunk to day, or had to do with
your Wife last night, I would not advise you to look
upon't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Shew me't however, and I'll stand the
venture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Why there 'tis then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
a man art thou now to have such a Present?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Such a one as it is, I would have you know, that I
would not change it for the Wealth of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
I'll set it in Gold, and put it in a Crystal Case. <hi>Hyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roprotos,</hi>
when he saw me so over-joy'd at the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
I had already receiv'd, began to think me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of greater; and askt me if I had seen the <hi>Virgins
secrets?</hi> The expression startled me, and yet I durst
not so much as desire him to expound himself, for a
bodies Tongue may slip in Holy matters as well as in
Profane. However, I told him that I had not as
yet seen 'em, and that I much desir'd to see them.
I am carry'd in now, as one in an Extasie; two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
presently lighted, and an Image produc'd; of
no great value for the bigness, matter or Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
but of wonderful Virtue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>It is not the
bulk that does the Miracle; yonder's <hi>Christopher</hi> at
<hi>Paris;</hi> there's a Wagon load of him, a very <hi>Colossus,</hi>
nay, I might have said a <hi>Mountain,</hi> and yet I never
heard of any Miracles that he wrought.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>There's
a Gemm at the feet of the Virgin, which the <hi>Latins</hi>
and <hi>Greeks</hi> have not yet found a name for; the <hi>French</hi>
call it a <hi>Toadstoane,</hi> from the resemblance of a Toad
in it: beyond any thing that ever was done to the
Life: and to make it the greater Miracle, it is but a
little Stone neither; and the Image does not stand
on't, but 'tis form'd in the very body of the Stone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps people may phansie the likeness of a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54880:20"/>
Toad in the Stone, as they do that of an Eagle, in
the stalk of a <hi>Brake</hi> or <hi>Fern;</hi> or as Boys do burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mountains, Battles, and terrible Dragons in the
Clouds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, for your satisfaction, one living
Toad is not liker another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Come, come, I have
had enough of your Stories, you had best go with
your Toad to some body else.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>This humour of
yours <hi>Menedemus</hi> does not at all surprize me; for if
I my self had not seen it with these eyes, (mark me,
with these very eyes) if the whole Tribe of School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had sworn it to me, I should never have believ'd
'em. But you are not curious enough, methinks, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these Rarities of Nature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And why not
curious enough? because I cannot be perswaded that
Asses fly?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>But do you not see how Nature enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
her self in the colours and shapes of all things;
and especially of precious Stones? what admirable
Virtues she has emplanted in them; and incredible
too, if experience had not forc'd us to an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of them? Tell me, would you ever have
believ'd that Steel could have either been drawn by
the Load-stone, or driven away, without touching it,
if you had not seen it with your own eyes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I think I should not, though ten <hi>Aristotles</hi> had
sworn the truth of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Do not pronounce all
things to be fabulous then, that you have not found
so by experiment. Do we not find the figure of the
<hi>Bolt</hi> in the <hi>Thunder-Stone: Fire</hi> in the <hi>Carbuncle;</hi> the
Figure of <hi>Hail,</hi> and the invincible coldness of it, (even
as if it were cast into the Fire) in the <hi>Hail-Stone:</hi> The
waves of the <hi>Sea</hi> in the <hi>Emerald;</hi> the Figure of a
<hi>Sea-Crab</hi> in the <hi>Carcinias;</hi> of a <hi>Viper</hi> in the <hi>Echites;</hi>
of a <hi>Gilt-head</hi> in the <hi>Scarites;</hi> of a <hi>Hawk</hi> in the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclites;</hi>
of a <hi>Cranes Neck</hi> in the <hi>Geranites?</hi> In one
Stone, you have the eye of a <hi>Goat;</hi> in another, of a
<hi>Hog;</hi> in another, <hi>three human eyes</hi> together: in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54880:20"/>
                  <hi>Licophthalmus</hi> you will find the Eye of a <hi>Wolf,</hi> with
four colours in't; fiery, bloudy; and black in the middle,
encompassed with white. One Stone has the figure
of a <hi>Beane</hi> in the middle; another the Trunck of a
<hi>Tree;</hi> and it burns like wood too; the Resemblance of
Ivy in another. One shews you the Beams of <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
another looks as if there were a <hi>Flame</hi> in't; and
in some Stones you shall find <hi>Sparkles;</hi> the colour of
<hi>Saffron,</hi> of a <hi>Rose, Brass,</hi> the figure of an <hi>Eagle,</hi> a
<hi>Peacock,</hi> an <hi>Asp,</hi> a <hi>Pismire,</hi> a <hi>Bittle</hi> or <hi>Scorpion.</hi> It
would be endless to pursue this subject; for there is
not any Element, living Creature or Plant, which
Nature (as it were to sport her self) has not given
us some resemblance of in Stones. Why should you
wonder then at this Story I have told you, of the
Toad?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>I did not think Nature had had so
much spare time, as to divert her self in drawing Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis rather to exercise our Curiosity,
and keep us from Idleness, or worse Diversions, as
running mad after Buffoons, Dice, Fortune-tellers, and
Hocus's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>All this is too true.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard
that if you put this Toad-stone into Vinegar, it shall
move the Legs and Swim.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But why is it dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>Virgin?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>'Tis laid at her feet, to shew
that she has overcome, trampled upon, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
all Uncleanness, Malice, Pride, Avarice, and
Earthly Desires.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Wo be to us then that have
so much of the Toad still in our hearts.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>But
if we worship the <hi>Virgin,</hi> as we ought, we shall be

               <p>The man
shew'd us next, certain Gold, and Silver Statues.
This (says he) is solid Gold, this only silver gilt,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54880:21"/>
and he tells us the Weight, the Price, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter
of every piece. The Man then taking notice of
the satisfaction I found to see the <hi>Virgin</hi> endow'd
with so rich a Treasure, you are so good a man,
says he, that I cannot honestly conceal any thing
from you, and will shew you now the greatest Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacies
the <hi>Virgin</hi> has; and at that word, he takes
out of a Drawer from under the Altar, a World of
things of great value; it would be a days work to
tell you the particulars; so that thus far my Journey
succeeded to my wish; I satisfied my Curiosity abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
and brought away this Inestimable Present
with me, as a Token of the Virgins love.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Did

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I have; I was three or four days
ago in a Treating-house, and there was a Fellow so
stark staring mad, that they were just about to lay
him in Chains; I only laid this piece of wood under
his Pillow (without his Privity) he fell into a sound
sleep; and in the morning, rose as sober as ever he
was in his life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>But art sure he was not drunk?

THat part of <hi>England</hi> that looks toward <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Flanders,</hi> is called <hi>Kent;</hi> there are two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries
in't, that are almost contiguous, and they
are both <hi>Benedictins.</hi> That which bears the name
of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> seems to me to be the Ancienter,
and that of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> I judge to have been the Seat
of the Archbishop, where he past his time with a
few Monks that he made choice of for his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
As the Prelates at this day have their Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
near the Church, tho' apart from the Houses of
other Canons: for in times past, both Bishops, and
Canons were commonly Monks, as appears upon the
Record. But St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Church is so eminent, that
it puts Religion into a mans thoughts as far as he
can see it: and indeed it over-shadows the Neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and keeps the light from other Religious Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
It has two famous Turrets, that seem in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to bid Visitants welcome from afar off; and a
Ring of Bells that are admir'd far and near. In
the <hi>South Porch</hi> stand the Statues of three Armed
Men that murther'd the Holy man, with their Names
and Families.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Why had the Wretches so much
honour done them?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>It is the same honour that
is done to <hi>Iudas, Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and the band
of wicked Soldiers, whose Images and Pictures, are
commonly seen upon the most magnificent Altars.
Their names, I suppose, are there express'd, for fear
some body else hereafter should have the glory of the
Fact that had no title to't; and besides they stand there
for a warning to Courtiers that they meddle no more
with Bishops or Possessions of the Church; for those
three Ruffians ran mad upon the horrour of the Act,
and had never come to themselves again, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Only the Bulk of the Structure,

that are hung up to the Pillars; and here and there
a Monument.</p>

               <p>The Quire
is shut up with iron Gates, so that there's no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance;
but the View is still open from one end of
the Church to the other. There's an Ascent to the
Quire, of many steps, under which, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Vault, that opens a Passage, to the <hi>North-side;</hi>
where we saw a wooden Altar that's dedicated to
the <hi>Holy Virgin;</hi> a very little one, and only remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as a Monument of Antiquity, that still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
the Luxury of following Ages. There it
was that the good man upon the point of death is
said to have taken his last leave of the <hi>Virgin.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Altar, there's a piece of the Blade with
which that Reverend Prelate was kill'd; and part
of his Brains, which the Assassins dash'd together,
and confounded, to make sure work on't. We did
with a most Religious solemnity kiss the sacred
Rust of this Weapon, for the Martyrs sake. From
hence, we past down into a Vault under ground,
which had its Officers too. They shew'd us first the
Martyrs Skull, as it was bor'd through; the Top of
it we could come at with our Lips, but the rest
was cover'd with Silver. They shew'd us also a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Plate inscribed, <hi>Thomas Acrensis,</hi> and there are
hung up in the dark, Shirts, Girdles, and Breeches
of Haircloth, which he us'd for Mortification; it
would make a man shrug to look upon 'em: nor
would the Effeminacy of this age endure them.</p>

               <p>From hence
we return'd to the Quire; upon the <hi>Northside</hi> they
unlock a private place; it is incredible what a world
of Bones they brought us out of it, Skulls, Shins,
Teeth, Hands, Fingers, whole Arms, which with
great Adoration we beheld and kiss'd; and there
would have been no end, if it had not been for one
of our Fellow-travellers, who indiscreetly enough,
interrupted the Officer in his business.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>What
was he?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>An <hi>English</hi> man, one <hi>Gratian Pull:</hi> (as
I remember) a Learned and a Religious man, but not
so well affected this way as I could have wisht him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Some <hi>Wicklifist,</hi> perhaps.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>No, I think not,
but I found by him that he had read his Books; how
he came by 'em I know not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>And did not your
Officer take Offence at him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>He brought us
out an Arm with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> flesh upon't, that was still
bloudy; and he was so squeamish forsooth, that he
made a mouth at it when he should have kiss'd it.
Whereupon the Officer shut up all again. From
hence we went to see the Table, and the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Altar; and after that, the Treasure
that was hidden under it. If you had seen the Gold,
and Silver that we saw, you would have lookt upon
<hi>Midas</hi> and <hi>Croesus</hi> as little better than Baggars.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>No; but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought

               <p>I was e'n upon wishing

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>A most Sacrilegious wish!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>I do confess it; and I do assure you I askt the
Saint forgiveness for't before I went out of the
Church. Our next Remove was into the <hi>Vestry.</hi>
Good God! What a Pomp of rich Vestments?
What a Provission of golden Candlesticks did we see
there? and there was St. <hi>Thomas Crook;</hi> it lookt just
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54880:23"/>
like a Reed cover'd over with a Silver Plate; it had
neither Weight nor Art, and about some three foot

               <p>Not that I saw. There was a silk Gown, but it was
course and plain, without either Pearl, or Embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery;
and there was a Handkerchief of the Saints,
which was still sweaty and bloudy. These Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of antient Thrift we kiss'd most willingly.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>I had some acquaintance, let me tell ye, with

               <p>You would take him for Humanity it self, if
you knew him. A Person of that exquisite Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that Candour of Manners, and Piety of Life,
that there is nothing wanting in him to make him a
most accomplisht Prelate. From hence, we are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
yet farther; for beyond the High Altar, there
is still another Ascent, as if it were into a new
Church. We were shewn in a certain Chappel there,
the whole face of the Good man, all gilt, and set out
with Jewels; where, by an unexpected mischance, we
had like to have spoil'd the whole business.</p>

               <p>My
friend <hi>Gratian</hi> lost himself here extreamly. After a
short Prayer, Good Father, (says he to the Assistant
of him that shew'd us the Reliques) I have heard
that <hi>Thomas,</hi> while he liv'd, was very Charitable to
the Poor; is it true or not? For certain, says he,
so he was; and began to instance in several Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Works that he had done. And he has undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same good Inclination still (says <hi>Gratian</hi>) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Perhaps they may be alter'd for the better. The
other agreed to't. Now (says he again) if this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54880:23"/>
Holy man was so charitable when he was Poor, and
wanted for his own Necessities himself; I cannot but
think now he is Rich, and wants nothing, that he
would take it well if some poor Women, with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ready to Starve, or in danger to prostitue
themselves for Bread; or with a Husband, Agonizing,
and void of all Comfort; if such a miserable Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
I say, should ask him leave to make bold with
some small proportion of his vast Treasure, for the
Relief of her wretched Family. The Assistant of the
Golden head making no Reply; I am fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
says <hi>Gratian</hi> (as he is sodain) that the Good
man would be glad at's heart (tho' in the other
World) that the Poor in this should be still the
better for him. The Officer, upon this, fell to frowning,
powting, and looking at us as if he would have eaten
us: and I am confident, if it had not been for the
Archbishops Recommendation, we had been raill'd
at, spit upon, and thrown out of the Church: but I did
however what I could, to pacifie the man; we told him
<hi>Gratian</hi> was a Droll, and all this was but his way of
fooling. So that with good words, and a little Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
I made up the quarrel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
approve of your Piety, and yet when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the infinite Expence upon Building, Beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Enriching of Churches, I cannot in cold
thoughts but condemn the unmeasurable excess. Not
but that I would have magnificent Temples; and
such Vestments, and Vessels, as may support the
Dignity of a solemn Worship; but to have so many
Golden Fonts, Candlesticks, and Statues; such a
Profusion upon Organs, and Church Musique, while
our Brethren, and the Living Temples of Christ, are
ready to perish for want of Meat and Lodging; this
is a thing I cannot allow of by any means.</p>

            <sp>

                  </gap>, or Piety, but is pleas'd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54880:24"/>
with a Moderation in these Cases; but an excess of
Piety is an Errour on the Right hand, and deserves
favour: especially considering the Cross humour
of those people that Rob Churches instead of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them: and beside the large Donatives come
from Princes, and great Persons, and the Mony would
be worse employed either upon Gaming or War.
And moreover, to take any thing away from the
Church, is accounted Sacrilege. It is a discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Charity of those that are inclin'd to
give; and after all, it is a Temptation to Rapine.
Now the Church-men are rather Guardians of these
Treasures, than Masters; and it is much a better
sight, a Church that is gloriously Endow'd and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd,
than a Church that is sordid, beggarly, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and liker to a Stable, than a Temple.</p>

               <p>You're in the right; and yet Practice
goes a great way, and this is a Lesson that he says
often over. From hence, we were carry'd back
into a Vault. It is somewhat dark, and there it is
that the <hi>Virgin-Mother</hi> has her Residence. It is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
raill'd in, and encompassed with iron Bars.</p>

               <p>Very much in appearance, but for what's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceall'd,
she her self knows best. And take this along
with ye, that these precious things are only shew'd
to persons of eminent quality, and to particular
friends. In the end, we were conducted back to the
Vestry, where was a Box with a black Leather Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
upon it. This Box was set upon a Table, and
upon the opening of it they all fell down upon their
knees, and worshipt.</p>

               <p>What was in't?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Rags
of old Handkerchers in abundance, that carry'd still
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54880:25"/>
about them the marques of the use they had
been put to. These, as they told us, were some
Reliques of the Linnen the good Man had made use
of about his nose, his Body, and other homely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
Upon this, my friend <hi>Gratian</hi> forfeited his
credit once more; for the gentle <hi>Prior</hi> offering him
one of these Rags for a Present, as the highest obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
he could lay upon him, he only took it squeam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly
betwixt his Finger and his Thumb, and with a
wry Mouth laid it down again, (a trick that he had
got, when he would express his contempt of any
thing.) This rudeness made me both asham'd and
afraid; but yet the Prior was so good, (tho sensible
enough of the Affront) as to put it off very dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously;
and after the Civility of a glass of Wine, we
were fairly dismiss'd, and returned to <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>What needed that when you were nearer your own

               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, but it is a Coast so
infamous for Cheats, and Piracies, that I had rather
run the hazard of the worst of Rocks, or Flats, than
of that people. I'll tell you what I saw in my last
passage that way; There was a great many people
at <hi>Calis</hi> that took a <hi>Chaloup</hi> to put them aboard a
great Ship, and among the rest, a poor, beggerly
<hi>French man,</hi> and they would have two Sols for his
passage; (for that they'll have if they carry one but
a Boats length) the fellow pleads poverty; and
they in a frolick would needs search him. Upon
the examining of his Shooes, they find ten or twelve
pieces of Silver that were there concealed; they
made no more ado, but kept the Mony, and laught
and raill'd at the <hi>Frenchman</hi> for his pains.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>What did the young man?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>What should he
do, but lament his misfortune?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>Had they any
Authority for what they did?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>The same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
that an Innkeeper has to rob his Guest, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54880:25"/>
a Highwayman to take a Purse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a strange
Confidence to do such a Villany before so many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>They are so us'd to't, that they think
they do well in't; There were divers in the great
Ship that lookt on, and several <hi>English</hi> Merchants in
the Boat that grumbled at it, but to no purpose;
they take a pride in't, as if it were the outwitting of
a Man, and made their boasts that they had catch'd
the <hi>French man</hi> in his Roguery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>I would, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more to do, hang up these Coast-thieves, and
make sport with them at the very Gallows.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Nay they are both Shores alike; and hence we may
gather, if the little Thieves be thus bold, what will
not the great ones do? and it holds betwixt Masters
and Servants. So that I am resolv'd for the future
rather to go five hundred Leagues about than to take
the advantage of this accursed <hi>Compendium.</hi> Nay, in
some respects this passage is worse than that to Hell
it self; for there the descent is easie, tho' there is
no getting out again; but here 'tis bad at one end,
and yet worse at to'ther. There were at that time
some <hi>Antwerp</hi> Merchants at <hi>London,</hi> and so I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to take my passage with them.</p>

               <p>Are
the Skippers of that Country then any better than
their fellows?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Ape will be always an Ape,</hi>
and a Skipper a Skipper; but yet compar'd to those
that live upon the Catch, these men are Angels.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>I shall remember this if ever it comes in my
head to go for <hi>England;</hi> but I have led you out of
your way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Very good. In our Journy to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
not far from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> there's a narrow hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
steep way, and a great bank on each side, so that
there's no scaping or avoiding; upon the left hand of
that way, there stands a little Cottage or Receptacle
for <hi>Mendicants.</hi> Upon the noise of any Horsemen,
comes an old man out into the way. He first sprinkles
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54880:26"/>
you with Holy Water, and then offers you the upper
Leather of a Shooe with a Brass Ring to't; and in
it, a Glass, as if it were some Gem: this you are
to kiss, and give the poor fellow some small piece
of Mony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>I had rather meet a company of old
Beggars in such a way, than a Troop of lusty Rogues
upon the Pad.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gratian</hi> rode upon my left hand,
next to this Cottage, where he had his share of Holy
Water, and bore it well enough; but upon present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him the Shooe, he askt the manner of it. This,
says the poor man, is the Shooe of St. <hi>Thomas. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
was in choler upon't, and turning to me, <hi>What
a Devil,</hi> said he, <hi>would these Brutes have? If we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to kiss their Shooes, by the same reason we may be
brought in time to kiss their Arses too.</hi> I pitied the poor
Wretch, and gave him a small Charity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>In my opinion <hi>Gratian</hi> was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
without a cause; I should not dislike the
preserving old Shooes, and Garments, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Moderation of our Fore-fathers, but I
am absolutely against the forcing of people to kiss
'em. He that is so zealous as to do it upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
may be left to his liberty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Not to dissemble
the matter I think it were better let alone, than done;
but in case of what cannot be mended on a sodain,
it is my custom to make the best on't. How much have
I been pleas'd with this Contemplation, that a good
man is like a sheep, and a wicked like a harmful
<hi>Creature!</hi> The Viper, tho' it cannot bite when 'tis
dead, yet the very corruption, and the smell of it
is mischievous; whereas a Sheep, while it lives, feeds
us with its Milk; cloaths us with its Wooll; and
fattens our ground with its very Ordure, and when
'tis dead, it serves us still with Mutton and with Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In like manner, men that are furious, and given
to their Lusts, while they live, they are troublesome
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54880:26"/>
to all, and when they are dead, what with the noise
of Bells, and the pomp of their Funerals, they are
still a Vexation to the Living, and sometimes to
their Successors, by causing new Exactions; but
the good man makes himself Profitable in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to the whole World. As this Saint by his
President, his Learning, and his good Counsel, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all men to Piety; he comforted the friendless;
assisted the needy, and if it were possible, he does
more good now he is dead, than he did living:
He built this magnificient Church, and advanc'd the
Authority of the Priesthood all over <hi>England;</hi> nay,
and with this very fragment of his Shooe he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a Conventicle of poor men.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Me.</speaker>
               <p>This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a pious Contemplation; but seeing you are
of this mind, I wonder you should never go to see
St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s <hi>Den,</hi> of which the World tells so many
wonders, which I must confess are no Articles of
my Faith.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Take my word for't, friend, all the
Prodigious things that ever you heard of it, fall short
of the Truth.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and I had as good have past the <hi>Stygian
Lake,</hi> or descended into the Jaws of <hi>Avernus.</hi> I was
where I could see all that's done in Hell.</p>

               <p>We have made
this Dialogue long enough already; let that rather
serve for the beginning of another. 'Tis time for
me to go home and bespeak Supper, for I have not
din'd to day.</p>

               <p>No, but out of spite.</p>

               <p>No, no; but to the unconscionable
Victuallers; that set high Rates upon ill Meat; and
this is my way of revenge. When I am in hope of
a good Supper, my Stomach wambles at dinner; and
when I find a dinner to my mind, my Stomach is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54880:27"/>
out of order toward Supper.</p>

               <p>And are not you

            <sp>
               <speaker>Og.</speaker>
               <p>Believe me, <hi>Menedemus,</hi> in such a case as
this, shame is very ill employ'd, and I have learn'd
to keep mine for better uses.</p>

to night: for I have time little enough for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of my Family: and yet, now I think on't,
I'll tell you what will be better for us both; you
shall invite me and my Wife to dinner to morrow;
and then if you please we'll talk it out till Supper;
or rather then fail, we will not part then neither,
till you confess you have your Belly full. Never
fcratch your head for the matter; do but you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

               <p>Why truly little or nothing. They shew'd us cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Monuments of Antiquity, which I look upon

               <speaker>Cor.</speaker>
               <p>As if that
repentance would not be to as little purpose as
the Journey. Nay, I cannot so much as be asham'd
on't, there are so many other Fools to keep me in

               <p>It furnishes a man with Table-talk,

hear other Travellers amplifie upon matters that
they never saw nor heard; and they do it with so
much Confidence too, that in things, even the most

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ar.</speaker>

               <p>This is a more

               <p>If

               <p>Yes. I have been at <hi>Rome</hi> my self, and at <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stella.</hi>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cor.</speaker>
               <p>It must be

               <speaker>Ar.</speaker>
               <p>There was a knot of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly
good-fellows of us drinking together; and
when we were high Flown, one was for making a
Visit to St. <hi>Iames;</hi> another, to St. <hi>Peter: If you'll go,
I'll go,</hi> says one; and <hi>I'll go, if you'll go,</hi> says another;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54880:29"/>
till at last, we concluded upon it to go altogether.
I was willing, I confess, to keep up the Reputation
of a fair Drinker; and rather than break Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I e'en past my Promise: The next question
was, whether we should march for <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stella;</hi>
and upon the debate, it was determined that
(God willing) we should begin our Journey the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
next morning, and visit <hi>Both.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ar.</speaker>
               <p>After this, a swinging Glass was
put about, to the <hi>Bon Voyage;</hi> and when every man
in his Course had <hi>done reason</hi> to't, the Vow was seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and became inviolable.</p>

               <speaker>Ar.</speaker>
               <p>All but
<hi>Three. One</hi> dy'd upon the way; but gave us in
charge to remember his humble service to <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Iames; another,</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> who bad us commend him
(when we return'd) to his Wife and Children:
the <hi>third</hi> we left desperately sick at <hi>Florence;</hi> and I
believe he is in Heaven, long e're this.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ar.</speaker>
               <p>Because he had a whole Satchel full of large <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</hi>

            <sp>

            <sp>

               <p>Sin is a terrible weight indeed. The

               <p>In my whole life I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>It is undoubtedly, of all Courses, the most wicked,
and the most miserable.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Han.</speaker>
               <p>And yet some people
ye see, whether for Mony, or for Curiosity, make as
much haste to a Battle, as to a <hi>Banquet:</hi> What do they

            <sp>

               <p>I look upon 'em to be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

would never anticipate their Fate.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Han.</speaker>
               <p>So one
would think; for put them upon honest Business
they'll scarce stir a foot in't for any mony. But
how went the Battle? who got the better on't?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>What with the noise and clamour of Drums and
Trumpets, Horses, and Arms, I was so far from
knowing what became of others, that I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <sp>
               <speaker>Han.</speaker>
               <p>But I have seen
those, that after a fought Field, would paint ye every
Circumstance so to the life, as if they had only look'd
on. Such an Officer Said this, and t'other Did that;
and every Word, and Action to a tittle.</p>

               <p>I am
of opinion that these men ly'd most confoundedly.
In short; if you would know what was done in my

I can say nothing to't.</p>

               <p>In

               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>Truly not much; but I had a lively Faith;

            <sp>

               <p>Now do I rather wonder that people can be

               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>Because
'tis the very place where the <hi>Sirens</hi> charm'd <hi>Ulysses</hi>
and his <hi>Mates;</hi> or 'tis at least the <hi>Moral</hi> of <hi>that Fable.</hi>
When a man is there at his Inn, he's as well as if he
were at his own house.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>Why what's the way on't
then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>The women are very handsom there, and
the Table never without one of 'em to season the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment;
and with ingenious, and innocent Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54880:33"/>
to keep the Guests in good humor. First came
the Mistress of the House, and bad us welcome; and
then her Daughter, a very fine woman, and of so pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a Kind of Wit and Fashion, that it was impossible
to be sad while she was in the Company: And you
are not received there like strangers neither; but as
if you were familiar Friends and old acquaintances
the first minute you see one another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>Oh I know
the <hi>French</hi> way of Civility very well.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>Now
because they could not be always with us, (what
with business, and what out of respect to their other
Lodgers) when the Daughter left us, we had to
supply her place till she could return, a Lass that was
so well instructed in the Knack of <hi>Repartees,</hi> she had
a word for every body, and no Conceit came amiss
to her, (the Mother you must know was somewhat
in years.)</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>Well but how were you Treated all
this while; for Stories fill no Bellies?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>Truly
so splendidly, and so cheap that I was amaz'd at it.
And then after Dinner, we chatted away the time so
merrily, that I was still at home methought.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>And
how went matters in your Chambers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>Why
there we had the Girls about us again, gigling and
toying, with a thousand Ape-tricks; and their main
business was to know what Linnen we had to wash:
In one word, they were all Females that we saw there,
save only in the Stable; and we had 'em there too
some times. Upon our coming away, they could not
have shew'd more Affection and Tenderness at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if we had been their own Brothers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>This
Mode may do well enough in <hi>France;</hi> but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way of the <hi>Germans</hi> methinks pleases me better.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>I never was in <hi>Germany,</hi> wherefore pray let's
know how 'tis there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>I can tell you for as much
on't as I saw; but how 'tis in other parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
I can say little. Mine Host never salutes his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54880:34"/>
Guest, for fear he should be thought to have some
Design upon him, which is lookt upon as below the
Dignity and Gravity of a <hi>German.</hi> When ye have
call'd a good while at the gate, the Master of the
Inn puts his head out of the Stove-window, like a
Tortoise from under his shell (for till the Summer
Solstice they live commonly in Stoves.) Then does
he expect that you should ask him if there be any
lodging there: If he makes you no answer, you may
take it for granted there is; and if you enquire for
the Stable, without a word speaking, he points you
to't, and there you may go and Curry your own
Horse as you please your self, for there are no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
there to do that office, unless it be in an Inn of
extraordinary note; and then you have one to shew
you the Stable, and a standing for your Horse, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious
enough, for they keep the best places
for Noblemen, as they pretend, that are yet to come.
If you fault any thing, they tell you at next word,
<hi>

                     </gap>'ad best look out another Inn.</hi> In their great Towns
there's hardly any Hay to be got, and 'tis almost as
dear too as Oats. When you have drest your Horse,
you come <hi>whole</hi> into the Stove, Boots, Luggage, Dirt
and all; for that's a common Room for all comers,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>Now in <hi>France</hi> you have your Chamber pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently

               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>There's nothing of that here; for in this Stove
you put off your Boots, D'on your Shoes, change
your Shirt, if you will; hang up your Cloaths, or
set your self a drying. If you have a mind to wash,
the water's ready; but then you must have more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to fetch off the Dirt of that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>Right:
So that you shall have betwixt fourscore and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
persons sometimes in the same Stove: Horse and
Foot, Merchants, Mariners, Wagoners, Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Women and Children, Sick and Sound.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>Why here is the true <hi>Convent</hi> (or <hi>Coenobium</hi>)
then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>One's combing of his Head, another wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off his Sweat, a third cleansing of his Boots,
or Hob-nail-Shoes; others belching of Garlick:
Without more adoe, the Confusion of <hi>Babel,</hi> for Men
and Languages, was nothing to this. If they see any
Stranger, that by his Train and Habit looks like a
man of Quality, they stand gaping at him as if he
were an <hi>Affrican Monster:</hi> nay when they are set at
the Table, and he behind 'em, they'l be still looking
back at him, and staring him in the face till they
forget their Suppers.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>There's none of this

            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>Take
notice now, that 'tis a mortal sin to call for any
thing. When 'tis so late that there's no hope of any
more Guests, Out comes ye an old gray-bearded Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
close cropt, with a soure crab'd look, and in a
sordid Habit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>He would make a good Cupbearer
to a Cardinal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>He over-looks the place; and
counts to himself the number of the Guests; and the
more Company, the more fire he puts in the Stove,
though they were half smother'd before: For 'tis a
token of respect to stew the people into a sweat.
If any man that's ready to choak with the Fume,
does but open the Window never so little, mine
Host bids him shut it again. If he says he's not able
to bear it, <hi>get ye another Inn then,</hi> cries the Master.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a dangerous thing, methinks, when mens
Bodies are open'd with the heat, to draw in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54880:35"/>
Vapour of so many Folks together, to eat in the
same place, and stay there so many hours: To say
nothing of their Belching, Farting, and corrupt
breaths, some of 'em teinted with secret Diseases,
and every man contributing to the Contagion: Nay,
they have most of 'em the <hi>French Itch</hi> too; (and yet
why the <hi>French?</hi> when 'tis common to all Nations)
so that a man might be as safe among so many <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi>
Tell me now, what is this short of a Pestilence?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>Why what's to be done?
'Tis a thing they are us'd to, and 'tis a point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
not to depart from a Custom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>And
yet till within these five and twenty years, nothing
was more common in <hi>Brabant</hi> than hot Baths. But
we have no more of 'em now, since they are found

            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>Now let me go on;
By and by, comes your bearded <hi>Ganimede</hi> in again,
and layes ye his just number of Napkins upon the
Table; no Damask (with a pox to 'em) but the
remnants rather of an old Sail. There are Eight
Guests at least allotted to every Table; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man that knows the fashion of the Country pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
himself where he likes. Rich and Poor, Master
and Servant, 'tis all one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>This was the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Equality which is now driven out of the world
by Tyranny: They very life (as I suppose) of the
holy Disciples with their Master.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>When they
are all seated, out comes the Dog looking Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beard
again; counts his company once more over, and
by and by brings every man his wooden Dish, with a
Spoon of the same mettle, and then a Glass; a while
after, comes the Bread, which the Guests may Chip
at leasure while the Porridge are a boyling; for there
they sit waiting perhaps some half an hour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:54880:35"/>
Do none of 'em call for Meat in the mean time?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>Not if they know the Country. At last, in comes
the Wine, and Wine that for the sharpness and subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it, is fitter for a Schoolman than for a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller;
none of your heady fuming Drink, I warrant
ye. But if a body should privately offer a piece of
mony to get a Can of better Wine, somewhere else,
they'll give ye a look, without speaking a word, as
if they would murther ye. If you press it further,
they'll tell you presently, here have been such and
such <hi>Counts</hi> and <hi>Marquises,</hi> that found no fault with
this Wine: If you don't like it, y'ad best mend your
self elsewhere. You must observe now, that they
only reckon upon their own Noblemen, in effect, to
be <hi>Men;</hi> and wherever ye come, they are shewing
you their <hi>Arms.</hi> By this time, comes in a Morsel to
pacifie a barking Stomach; and after that, in great
Pomp, follow the Dishes. The first, with Sippets of
Bread in Flesh Porridge; or if it be a Fish-day; in
a Soupe of Pulse. After that, comes in another Soupe;
and then a Service of Butchers Meat, that has been
twice boyl'd, or of Salt meats twice heat; and then
Pulse again, or perhaps some more substantial Dish:
When ye have taken off the edge of your Appetite,
they bring ye either Roast Meat, or Stew'd Fish,
(which is not amiss) but they are sparing on't, and
'tis quickly taken away again. This is the method
of their Eating, which they order as Commedians do
their Scenes, into so many Courses, of Chops, and
Soupes; still taking care that the last Act may be
best.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>The Poets method too.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>Now 'tis
death for any man to say, <hi>Take away this Dish; here's
no body Eats:</hi> For you are bound to sit out your time;
which (as I take it) they measure by an Hour-glass.
And at length, out comes your old Servant again, or
mine Host himself (who is no better Clad) and asks
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54880:36"/>
ye, <hi>What cheer Gentlemen?</hi> By and by comes a
Can of more Generous Wine. They are men of
Conscience ye must know; and love those most that
Drink most; for (say they) you are all upon the
Club; and he that Drinks most, pays no more than
he that drinks least.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>
               <p>Why these people are
Wits.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>There are many of 'em that spend twice
as much for their Wine, as they pay for their <hi>Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi>
But before I leave this Entertainment, what
a horrible noise and confusion of Tongues is there,
when they come once to be warm in their Drink!
without more wore words, it deafens a man; and then
you shall many times have a mixture of Mimiques
and Buffoons in among them: a most detestable sort
of men, and yet you would not think how these people
delight in 'em. There's such a Singing, Bawling,
Gaggling, Leaping, and Thundring up and down,
that there's no hearing one another, and you'd
think the Stove would fall upon your heads; and
yet this is it they take to be a pleasant life; and
there you are condemn'd to sit in spite of your heart,
till toward midnight.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gu.</speaker>

               <speaker>Be.</speaker>
               <p>Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
At length, when the Cheese is taken away (which
must be rotten and full of Maggots, or they'll
have none on't.) In comes your <hi>Ganimede</hi> once again;
with a wooden Trencher, and so many Circles, and
Semicircles drawn in Chalk upon't. This he lays
upon the Table, with a grim countenance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speaking, by his Look, and by his Dish you
would take him for a <hi>Charon.</hi> They that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the meaning of all this, lay down their mony,
one after another, till the Trencher's cover'd. The
Servant takes notice who lays down, and then reckons
it to himself. If all be paid, he gives you a Nod.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Table-Discourse for Christians. All the Works
of Nature yield Matter for Contemplation.
A Description of a pleasant Garden, with
all the Beauties of it. The Reading of
Scripture recommended even at Meals. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Texts expounded. The Force of the
Light of Nature, in Pagan Philosophers
and Poets: With Reflections upon the
Excellencies of Socrates and Cicero. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is better bestowed upon Necessities then
Superfluities; with Directions how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

               <p>I Wonder how any body can endure to
live in a smoaky Town, when every
thing's so fresh and pleasant in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
such delicious Flowers, Meadows,
Rivers, Fountains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Several
Men, several Humors; and besides, a Man
may like the Country well, and yet like some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else better. For 'tis with Pleasures as

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>You
speak of Usurers perhaps, or of covetous Traders,
which in truth are all one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>not of them alone,
I assure you, but of a thousand other sorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
to the very Priests and Monks, that make
choice still of the most populous Cities for their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.
It is not <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in this Practice, but the <hi>Blind Beggar</hi> rather,
who loves to be where he's crouded: For, says he,
<hi>the more People, the more Profit.</hi>

               <p>Pre'thee let's
leave the <hi>Blind Beggar</hi> then, and behave our selves
like <hi>Philosophers.</hi>

               <p>Was not <hi>Socrates</hi> a <hi>Philosopher?</hi>
And yet he was for a <hi>Town-life;</hi> where a man might
learn what he had a mind to <hi>know.</hi> In the <hi>Country,</hi> 'tis
true, ye have Woods, Gardens, Springs and Brooks,
that may entertain the Eye; but these are all mute;
and there's no Edification without Discourse.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> puts the Case, I know, of a Man's walking
<hi>alone</hi> in the Fields; not as if any of the Works of
the Creation wanted a Tong, for every part of it
speaks to the Instruction of any Man, that has but a
good Will, and a Capacity to learn. Do but consider
the native Glories of the Spring; how they set forth
and proclaim the equal Wisdom and Goodness of
the Creator! How many excellent things did <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
in his Retirement, both teach <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> and
learn from him?</p>

               <p>A <hi>Country Life,</hi> I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,

               <p>If you
have a mind to make Trial of it, take a Dinner with
me to morrow, a step here out o'th' Town, I have
a plain little House there; but I'le promise you a
cleanly and a hearty Welcome.</p>

               <p>Never fear that, so long as the
Melons, the Figgs, Pears, Apples, and Nuts last:
And 'tis but gaping neither, to have the Fruit fall
into your Mouths. In one Word; you are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

only a <hi>Garden Treat,</hi> unless perhaps we should
search the Hen-roost for a Pullet; the very Wine
grows on the place too, so that there's not one
penny of mony in the case.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Upon these Terms

               <p>A good Stomach.
A light Supper to night, and a Walk to morrow
morning does it. (for the Walk you may thank me;)
But what hour will you eat at?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>About Ten; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the heat of the Day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>I'le give order for't.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, the Gentlemen are come.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>You're
welcome, my Masters, for coming according to your
words; but you're twice as wellcome, for coming
so Early, and bringing the best Cmpany in the
World along with ye. It is a kind of unmannerly
Civility, methinks, in some people, to make their
Host wait.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>We came so much the sooner, that
we might have time enough to look over all your
Curiosities; for they say you live like a Prince here;
and that the very contrivances about your House,
tell who's the Master of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And you will find
it a Palace (I can assure ye) worthy of such a Prince:
This Nest is, to me, more than an Imperial Court;
and if Liberty be a Kingdom, here do I Reign. But
what if we should take the Cool of the morning
now, to see the Gardens, while the Wench in the
Kitchin provides us a Sallad?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>Never was any
thing in better order. The very Design of this
Garden bids a man welcome to't. Have you any
more then this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Here are Flowers, and Greens,
that will serve to put by a worse Scent. Let every
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54880:38"/>
man take freely what he likes; for this place lies
(in a manner) in Common; I never shut it up but
a nights.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>

            <sp>

to our blessed Saviour, that he will vouchsafe (since
we can do nothing of our selves) by his infinite
Goodness, to keep us in the right Way, and bring
us by the Truth of the Gospel to everlasting Life,

Vanities and Delusions apart.</p>

               <p>Strangers are generally pleased with
this Garden; and hardly a Man that passes by this

the Protection of my <hi>Saviour.</hi> This bubling Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

whoever Thirsts for may have his fill <hi>gratis.</hi> Some
that come hither, make it a matter of Religion to

               <p>And so it ought
to be, for this Garden was design'd for Pleasure, but
for Honest Pleasure; the Entertainment of the Sight,
the Smell, and the Refreshment of the very Mind.
You have nothing here but sweet herbs, and those
only choice ones too; and every Kind has its bed
by it self.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I am now convinc'd that the Plants

Y'are in the Right: My house was never made for
Magnificence, but for Discourse. So that I can
never be alone in't, as you your self shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
when you have seen it through. As I have
rang'd my several Plants into several Troops, so
every Troop has its <hi>Standard</hi> to it self, with a
peculiar <hi>Motto.</hi> The <hi>Marjorams</hi> word is <hi>Abstine Sus,
non tibi spiro: My Perfume was never made for the Snout
of a Sow;</hi> being a Fragrancy to which the Sow
has a natural Aversion. And so every other herb
has somthing in the Title, to denote the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Virtue of the Plant.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>I have seen nothing
yet that pleases me better than this Fountain.
It is the Ornament, the Relief, and Security of the
whole Garden. But for this <hi>Cistern</hi> here that with
so much satisfaction to the Eye, waters the whole
Ground in Chanels at such equal distances, that it
shows all the Flowers over again, as in a Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass;
this <hi>Cistern,</hi> I say, is it of <hi>Marble?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Not
a word of that, I prithee. How should <hi>Marble</hi> come
hither? 'Tis only a <hi>Paste</hi> that's cover'd over with
an Artificial Counterfeit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>And where does this
deliciate Rivulet discharge it self at last?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Just
at the rate of human Obligations, when we have
serv'd our own Turns; so is it with this delicate
Brook: when we have had the Pleasure, and
the Benefit of it in the Garden, it washes the
Kitchin, and then passes through the Sink into
the Common shore.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>A most inhuman Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And I should
think it so too, if the Bounty of Providence had
not appointed it in Common for all these Uses. If
you call this a Cruelty, what shall we say of those
that with their Lusts, and Appetites, Pollute the
Fountain of Divine Truth, which was given us for
the Composing, and purging of our minds; and abuse

the unspeakable Goodness of the Almighty?</p>

               <p>You

are green too?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Because I would have
every thing green here. Some are for a mixture of
Red to set off the other. But I am still for Green;
as every man has his Phancy, though it be but in a
Garden.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>The Garden is very fine of it self,
but these three Walks, methinks, take off very
much from the Lightsomness and Pleasure of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>First, one piece of Ground will
not hold all Sorts of Plants. Secondly; 'Tis a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pleasure to compare painted Flowers with the
Life. In the one we Contemplate the admirable
work of Nature: In the other, the Skill of the
Artist; and in both, the Goodness of God, who
gives us all things for our use, and shews himself
to be Wonderful and Amiable together. And lastly
the painting holds fresh and green all the Winter
when the Flowers are dead, and wither'd.</p>

               <p>They do so, but yet they'l outlive us; beside,

               <p>These walks serve me to many
purposes. In one of them I take the benefit of the
<hi>Morning-Sun.</hi> In another, I take Sanctuary against
the Heats of the <hi>Meridian,</hi> and refresh my self in the
cool of the shade. And in the Third I sit airing my
self sometimes. But if you please, we'l take a view of
'em nearer hand. See how green 'tis under foot; and
ye have the beauty of painted Flowers in the very
Chequerings of the Pavement. Here's a Wood now
in <hi>Fresco;</hi> there's a strange variety of matter in't;
so many Trees, and but one of a sort; and all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
to the Life: And so for the Birds too, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if any way remarkable: As for Geese, Hens
and Ducks, they are not worth the drawing. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath,
are Four-footed Creatures, or such Birds

               <p>This <hi>Chamaeleon</hi> is always hungry

               <p>It would ask at least three days to run thorough
the particulars one by one. So that we had better
take some other time for that, and content our selves
with what we have had for the present. You have
here all sorts of famous Plants, describ'd according
to Nature, and (to encrease the wonder) the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Poysons in the World, which ye may both look

               <p>Here's a

               <p>This

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>That's no wonder, for we have
none of it in these Parts. They call it <hi>Woolfs bane,</hi>
so dealy a Poyson, that upon the very touch of it,
a <hi>Scorpion</hi> presently turns pale, is stupified and
overcome. But then when he is wounded with one
Poyson he finds his remedy in another; and if he
can but get to the <hi>White Helebore,</hi> he recovers.
Those Plants there, are the two sorts of <hi>Helebore.</hi>

it were not we should have needed other Eyes. Look
ye; there's another <hi>Polypus,</hi> see how he cuts it away
above water like a wherry; and there lyes a <hi>Torpedo</hi>
upon the sand (both of a colour) you may touch
'em here without any sort of danger. But let's to
something else; for this feeds the Eye, but not the
Belly.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Is there any more to be seen then?</p>

               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Wee'l look into the Backside by and by. Here's
an indifferent fair Garden cut into two. The one's
for the Kitchin, and that's my Wives, the other is a
<hi>Phisique Garden.</hi> Upon the left hand, you have an
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54880:42"/>
open Grean Meadow enclosed with a Quickset Hedg.
There do I take the Air sometimes, and divert my
self with good Company. Upon the Right-hand
there's a Nursery of Forreign Plants, which I have
brought by degrees to endure this Climate. But
these things you shall see at better leisure.</p>

               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>At the end
of the upper Walk, there's an <hi>Aviary,</hi> which I'le
shew you after Dinner. And among the Birds you'le
see as great a Diversity of Humors as of Plumes
and Notes: For they have their Kindnesses and their
Feuds as well as we. And then they're so tame
and familiar, that when I'm at Supper, they'll come
flying in at the Window to me at the very Table, and
eat for Company. When they see me there upon
the Draw-bridge (talking perhaps with a Friend, or
so) they'll sit some of them observing and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
others fluttering about me, and lighting upon
my Head or my Shoulders, without any sort of
Fear, for they find that no body hurts 'em. At
the further end of the Orchard, I have my <hi>Bees,</hi>
which is a Sight worth your Curiosity. But I'll
keep that in reserve for ye till by and by.</p>

               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>A little Patience, tell
her, and we come. Let's wash first, my Masters,
that we may bring clean hands to the Table, as
well as clean Hearts: the very Pagans us'd a kind
of Reverence in this Case; how much more then
should Christians do it; if it were but in Imitation
of that sacred Solemnity of our Saviour with his
Disciples at his last Supper? The washing of the
Hands is but an Emblem of purging the Mind. And
so long as there is any Uncleanness in the one, or any
Envy or Ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

usurp upon the Blessings of the Table: The very

               <p>It is

it was the Practice of our Saviour to bless the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

you please, I'le say you a Grace that St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>

               <p>I would have him in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Drop, and Morsel that we Eat, or Drink; but
principally in our minds. And the better to fit
us for the reception of so Divine a Guest, if you

               <p>This Entertainment pleases me so much the better,
because it puts off Vain and frivolous discourse, and
brings profit beside. I am none of those that
think no Society diverting, unless it be season'd
with the foppery of wanton Stories, and Bawdy
Songs. There's no true joy but in a clear and open
Conscience; and those are the happy Conversations,
where only such things are spoken and heard, as we
can reflect upon afterward with Satisfaction, and
without any Mixture either of Shame, or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>It were well if we were as Careful in

               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And 'tis not all neither, that the Benefit is valuable

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>And therefore 'tis the

                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. The Kings heart is in the
hand of the Lord as the Rivers of Water: he turneth it
whithersoever he will. Every way of man is right in his own
Eyes, but the Lord pondereth the hearts. To do Iustice
and Iudgment, is more acceptable to the Lord, then
Sacrifice, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Hold there; 'tis enough;
for 'tis better to take down a little with an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis better I must confess in many cases. <hi>Pliny</hi>
would have <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Offices</hi> never out of your hand:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54880:43"/>
and I'm so far of his Mind, that I could wish the
whole World, especially States-men, had him by
heart: and for this little Book of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> I
have always lookt upon as the best of Manuals.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a good Sauce however to a flat Dinner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>That Compliment might have been spar'd, where
every thing is excellent. But if you had given us
this Lecture to a Dish of Beets only, without either
Pepper, Wine, or Vinegar, it had been a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Treat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>I could commend it however
with a better Grace, if I did but perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that which I have heard: And I would we
had but some able Divine among us, that might ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expound it: But I do not know how far a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may be allowed to descant upon such a Subject.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>I see no hurt in't, even for the meanest Skipper
to do it, bating the Rashness of passing Sentence in
the Case. And who knows but that Christ himself
(who has promised his Grace and Favour even to
two or three that are gathered together in his Name)
may vouchsafe his Assistance also unto us who are
somewhat a large Congregation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>What if we
should take these three Verses then, and divide them
among us Nine Guests.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>We are all content,
provided that our Patron lead the Way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I
should not scruple it, but that I am loth to use ye
worse in my Exposition, than I have done in my
Dinner. But Ceremony apart, and waving all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Interpretations, I take this to be the Moral of
the first Verse. That</hi> Private Men may be wrought
upon by Admonition, Reproof, Laws and Menaces; but
Kings that are above Fear, the more they are oppos'd,
the fiercer their Displeasure. And therefore Princes in
their Passions should be left to themselves; not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of any Confidence in the goodness of their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but they are many times the Instruments of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54880:44"/>
for the Punishment of the Wicked, tho' by their
own Cruelties, and Errors: was not <hi>Nebuccadnezzar</hi> a
Scourge to his People? And yet God commanded that
Obedience should be paid him. And that of <hi>Job, Cap.
34. of the Hyppocrites Reigning,</hi> paradventure looks
this way. And so that of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> lamenting
his Sins, <hi>Psal. 51. 4. Against Thee only have I sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and done this Evil in thy sight.</hi> Not as if the
Iniquity of Princes were not also fatal to the People:
but they are only accountable still to Almighty God;
from whose Iudgment there lies no Appeal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>It goes
well thus far. But what's meant by <hi>the Rivers of
Waters?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>The very Comparison explains it.</hi>
The Wrath of a Prince is Impetuous, and Impotent;
not to be led This way or That; or to be manag'd: but
it presses forward with a Restless Fury. There's no
stopping, or diverting of a Sea-breach; but the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Banks and Walls only makes it the more Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious.
Let it but alone, and it will at last sink of it
self; as it falls out in many great Rivers. There is, <hi>in
one word,</hi> less hazard in yielding, then in striving.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>Is there no remedy then against the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of unruly Governors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>The first Expedient
is, not to receive a Lyon into the City. The second, so
to hamper him with Laws, and Restrictions, as to keep
him within bounds, but the best of all would be to train
him up from his Childhood, in the Love and Exercise of
Piety, and Virtue; and to form his Will before he comes
to understand his Power. Good Counsel, and Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
goes a great way; provided it be seasonable and
Gentle: but the last resort must be to Almighty God,
for the moving of his heart toward things becoming his
Dignity and Profession.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>And do you excuse your
self because you are a <hi>Layman?</hi> Where's the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duate
in Divinity, that will take upon him to mend
this Comment?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Whether it be Right or wrong
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54880:44"/>
I cannot tell; but if it be not Heretical, or Impious,
I'm satisfi'd. But whatever it be, I have done as ye
bad me; and now, according to the Rules of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
do you take your turns too.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>The Complement you pass'd upon my gray
Hairs, gives me some kind of Title to speak my
sense next: which is, that the Text will bear yet a
more mysterious meaning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>I believe it may: and
I should be glad to hear it.</p>

               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>By the word <hi>King,</hi>
may be signified a man so perfected, that he has whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
subdu'd his Lusts; and is only led by the guidance
of a Divine Impulse. Now it may not be proper, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to tie up such a Person to the Conditions of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws; but rather to remit him to his Master, by
whose Spirit he is govern'd. Neither is he to be judg'd
according to the Measures by which frail and imperfect
Men advance themselves toward true Holiness: but if
he steer another Course, we must say with <hi>St. Paul,</hi> Rom.
14. <hi>God hath received him, and to his own Master
he standeth, or falleth.</hi> And so 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 15. He
that is Spiritual, judgeth of all things, yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is judged of no man.</hi> To such therefore, let none
prescribe; for the Lord, who hath appointed bounds to the
Seas, and the Rivers, hath the Heart of the King in his
Hand, and inclines it which way soever pleases him.
Now to what End should we prescribe to him, that does
better things of himself than Humane Laws oblige him
to? And how great a rashness were it, to restrain that
Person to Political Constitution, who is manifestly dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Inspirations of the Holy Ghost?</p>

               <p>You
have not only the pretences of Wisdom <hi>(Tymothy)</hi>
in your Grey hairs, but the substance of it in your

such Kings as this of yours among Christians, for in
truth, they ought all of them to be such. But we

our success has been so good upon the first Verse;

betwixt this Meat and that; and betwixt
one day and another; and some again pass a judgment
upon every day. In these things, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have
every Man enjoy his own Freedom, without reproaching
another. Neither should we Censure any Man in these
Cases; but leave him to be judg'd by him that weight
the Heart. It falls out many times that he that <hi>Eats</hi>

                  <hi>It seems to me, that the

Prophet</hi> Hosea 6. 6. <hi>expounds that Verse very well.</hi> I
desire Mercy and not Sacrifice, and the Knowledge
of God more then Burnt Offerings. <hi>This is fully
explain'd, and to the life, by our Saviour in</hi> St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew;
Chap. 9. <hi>When being at the Table of a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,
with several others of the same Stamp and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
the Pharasees that valu'd themselves upon their
external Observance of the Law, without any regard
to the Prcepts of it, whereupon depend the Law and
the Prophets: the Pharasees,</hi> I say, <hi>askt the Disciples
(to alienate their Affections from him</hi>) what their
Master meant, to Eat with Publicans and Sinners.
<hi>This is a Point, of which the</hi> Jews <hi>made a Conscience
to so high a Degree, that if the stricter sort had but
met any of 'em by chance, they would presently go home,
and wash themselves.</hi> This Question put the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to a Loss, till their Master made Answer,
both for himself and them. They <hi>(says he)</hi> that
are whole need not a Physician, but they that are
sick: But go you and learn what that meaneth; I
will have Mercy and not Sacrifice; for I came not
to call the Righteous, but Sinners.</p>

               <p>This way
of comparing Texts is the surest Rule of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the Scriptures. But I would fain know
what is't he calls <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and what, <hi>Mercy;</hi> For
how should we reconcile it, that God who has <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi>
and <hi>required</hi> so many <hi>Sacrifices</hi> should be
against them?</p>

               <p>How far God is against <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi>
he himself teaches us in the <hi>Prophet Isaiah, Chap.
1.</hi> There were certain Legal Obligations among the
<hi>Jews,</hi> that were rather Significations of Holiness, then
of the Essence of it: and there were certain other Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of Perpetual Force, being Good in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
without any Respect to the Command. Now
God was not displeased with the <hi>Jews</hi> for Observing the
Rites and Ceremonies of the Law; but for placing all
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54880:46"/>
their Holiness upon that outward performance; to the
neglect of Necessary and more Important Duties: As if
they had Merited Heaven by keeping their Holy Days;
offering up of Sacrifices, abstaining from Meats forbidden,
and by their frequent Fastings: whereas all this while
they lay wallowing in their Sins; as Avarice, Pride,
Rapine, Hatred, Envy, and other Iniquities; embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
only the Shadow of Religion, without minding the
Substance. But where he says, <hi>I will have and Mercy
and not Sacrifice,</hi> I take it to be an <hi>Hebraism;</hi> that is
to say, <hi>Mercy rather</hi> then <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> after the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Solomon</hi> in this Text. And again the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
expresses all Charitable Offices to our Neighbour
under the term of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emosinary Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
which derives its very <hi>Name</hi> from <hi>Pitty.</hi> By
<hi>Sacrifices,</hi> I suppose, is intended whatsoever respects
corporal Ceremonies, under any Affinity with <hi>Judaism.</hi>
As the choice of <hi>Meats, appointed Garments, Fasts,
Sacrifices, Resting upon Holy Days; and the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over Prayers as a boy says his Lesson.</hi> These things
as they are not to be neglected in their due season, so
if a man relies too much upon these Observances, and
sees his Brother in Distress, without Relieving him; these
bare Formalities are very unpleasing to God. It has some
appearance of Holiness, to have nothing to do with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men. But this Caution ceases, wheresoever there is
place for the exercise of our Charity. It is a point of
just Obedience to rest on Holy Days; but it were most
Impious to make such a Conscience of the Day, as not to
make a greater of saving his Brother upon that Day, if
he were in Danger. Wherefore to keep the <hi>Lords day</hi>
is a kind of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but to be Reconcil'd to my <hi>Brother</hi>
is a Poynt of <hi>Mercy.</hi> And then for the Iudgment of
things, though the Weak are commonly opprest by the
more Powerful, who are to pass the Sentence; yet it
seems to me reasonable enough, that the Poor Man should
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54880:47"/>
mind him of that in <hi>Hosea, and the Knowledge of
God more than Burnt-Offerings.</hi> No Man can be
said to keep the <hi>Law</hi> but he that observes the <hi>Will</hi> in it
of the <hi>Law Maker.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld take up an <hi>Ass</hi>
upon their <hi>Sabbath</hi> that was fallen into a Pit; and
yet they calumniated our Saviour for preserving a Man
upon that day. This was a preposterous Iudgment,
and not according to the Knowledg of God, for they
never consider'd that these provisions were made for <hi>Man,</hi>
and not <hi>Man</hi> for them. <hi>But I should think my self

               <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi>
would not allow their Priests to Drink any Wine
at all: and yet in those Days, there was no <hi>Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Confession.</hi> 'Tis become lawful now for all
people to drink Wine; how convenient, I know
not. What Book is that, <hi>Eulalius,</hi> you take out of
your Pocket? It must needs be a good one sure,
there's so much cost bestow'd upon it.</p>

               <speaker>Eula.</speaker>
               <p>It
has a Glorious outside, I must confess, and yet 'tis
infinitely more precious within. Here are the <hi>Epistles</hi>
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which I still carry about me, as my
beloved Entertainment, and I take 'em out now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
something you said, that minds me of a place
which I have beat my head about a long time, and
I am not yet resolved in. It is in the <hi>6th Chapter</hi>
of the <hi>first Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians. All things are
Lawful unto me, but all things are not Expedient: all
things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought
under the Power of any.</hi> First, (if we may trust the
<hi>Stoiques</hi>) Nothing can be profitable to us which is
not Honest. Therefore how comes St. <hi>Paul</hi> to
distinguish betwixt <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Expedient?</hi> It is not
<hi>Lawful</hi> sure to Whore or to drink drunk. How is
it said then that <hi>All things are Lawful?</hi> But if St.
<hi>Paul</hi> speaks of some particular things only, which
he would have to be <hi>Lawful;</hi> how shall I divine
from the Tenour of the place, which those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
things are? From that which follows, it may
be gathered that he there speaks of the Choice of
Meats. For some abstain from things offer'd to
<hi>Idols,</hi> others, from Meats that were forbidden by
<hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Law.</hi> In the <hi>Eighth Chapter,</hi> he Treats of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54880:48"/>
the former, and then in the Tenth, unfolds the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of this place; saying, <hi>All things are Lawful
for me; but all things are not expedient: All things are
Lawful for me, but all things Edify not. Let no man
seek his own but every Man anothers Wealth. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is sold in the Shambles, Eat,</hi> And that which
<hi>St. Paul</hi> subjoyns, agrees with what he said before.
<hi>Meat for the Belly, and the Belly for Meats: God shall
destroy both It and Them,</hi> Now that this was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the <hi>Iudaical choice of Meats,</hi> appears by the
close of the <hi>Tenth Chapter, Give none Offence nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the</hi> Jews <hi>nor to the</hi> Gentiles; <hi>nor to the Church
of God, even as I please all Men in all Things; not seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my own Profit, but the Profit of many that they
may be saved:</hi> Where he speaks of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he
seems to reflect upon things offer'd to <hi>Idols,</hi> and in
naming the <hi>Iews,</hi> he refers to the <hi>Choice of Meats:</hi>
Under the <hi>Church of God</hi> comprehending the weak
that are collected out of both sorts. It was <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
it seems, to eat of all Meats whatsoever, and
all things are clean to the clean: But the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
question is, whether or no it be <hi>Expedient.</hi>
The Liberty of the Gospel makes all things Lawful;
But for the avoiding of scandal, Charity has a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Conscience of my Neighbour. Upon
that score, I would forbear, even things the most
<hi>Lawful:</hi> rather choosing to gratifie the scruples of
Another, than to insist upon the Exercise of my
own freedom. But now here arises a double diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
First, That there's nothing in the Context
to warrant this Construction either before, or after.
For his charge against the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was, that they
were <hi>Seditious, Fornicators, Adulterous, Incestuous</hi> and
given to <hi>Contention,</hi> before <hi>Wicked Iudges.</hi> Now
what coherence is there after all this, to say, <hi>all things
are Lawful for me, but all things are not expedient?</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:54880:48"/>
After this Passage, he returns to the point of <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,</hi>
which he had also repeated before, only lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
out the Charge of Contention: <hi>But the Body,</hi>
says he, <hi>is not for Fornication, but for the Lord, and
the Lord is for the Body.</hi> But this may be Salv'd
too, because a little before in the Catalogue of Sins,
there was mention made of Idolatry. <hi>Be not deceived;
neither Fornicators, Idolaters, nor Adulterers;</hi> and then
the Eating of things offer'd to <hi>Idols,</hi> is a spice of
<hi>Idolatry.</hi> Wherefore he follows it with this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Meat is for the Belly, and the Belly for Meat.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
Intimating, that in Case of Necessity, and for a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
a man may Eat any thing, as far as Charity will
permit; but that uncleanness, is in all persons, and
at all times, to be detested. It is matter of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
that we Eat: But that Necessity shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away at the last day. If we be lustful, it is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and malicious. There is yet another scruple
which I cannot either dissolve, or reconcile to that
passage: <hi>but I will not be brought under the Power of
any:</hi> For he says, that he has the Power of all things,
and yet he will not be brought under any ones Power.
If he may be said to be in another mans Power, that
abstains for fear of offending; it is no more then
what in the ninth Chapter he speaks of himself:
<hi>For tho' I be free from all men yet have I made my self
Servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</hi> St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
stumbling, as I suppose, at this scruple, takes
this to be the Genuine sense of the Apostle, for the
better understanding of him in another Place, where
he claims to himself the Power of doing as the rest
of the Apostles, (either true or false) the Liberty
of receiving Maintenance from those to whom he
Preached the Gospel. But yet he forbore this, tho'
he might have done it, as a thing expedient among
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whom he charg'd with so many, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54880:49"/>
so Enormous Iniquities. And moreover, he that
receives is in some degree in the Power of him that
gives; and suffers some kind of Abatement in his
Authority: For he that takes, cannot so freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his Benefactor: and he that gives, will not
easily take a reprehension from him that he has
oblig'd. Therefore did St. <hi>Paul</hi> abstain from many
things that were <hi>Lawful,</hi> for the Crdit of his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Liberty,</hi> which he chose rather to support at
the height, that he might maintain the Dignity of
his Commission, for the Reprehension of their Sins.
This Explication of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> I am well enough
pleas'd with: and yet if any body had rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this passage to Meats. St. <hi>Pauls</hi> saying, <hi>but I
will not be brought under the Power of any,</hi> may in my
opinion, bear this Explanation. Although I may
some time abstain from Meats offer'd to Idols, or
forbidden by the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> out of a Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the scruples of a weak Brother; my mind
is never the less Free: Well knowing that Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
makes all Meats Lawful: But there were some
false Apostles, that would persuade the World that
some Meats were in themselves impure; and that
not only upon Occasion, but in all Extremities, they
were to be forborn, as <hi>Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Murther.</hi> Now
those that were thus misled, fell from their <hi>Gospel-Liberty</hi>
under a <hi>foreign Power.</hi> Only <hi>Theophilact,</hi> as I
remember, has an Opinion by himself. It is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
says he, to Eat of all Meats, but it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient

               <p>Whatsoever is pious, and conducing to good
Manners, should not be called profane. The first
place must be granted to the Authority of the Holy
Scriptures; and yet, after That, I find among the
Ancients, nay the <hi>Ethniques,</hi> and, which is yet more,
among the Poets, certain Precepts, and Sentences,
so clean, so sincere, so divine, that I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my self but they wrote them by Holy Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And perhaps the Spirit of Christ diffuses
it self further then we imagine. There are more
Saints then we find in our Catalogue. To confess
my self now among my Friends, I cannot read <hi>Tully,

I am wholly against them neither; but from the

<hi>carries upon it the stamp of something that

my life again from my very Cradle, and once more
to run the course over of the years I have liv'd, I should
not upon any Terms agree to't. For what's the Benefit
of Life; or rather how great is the Pain? Or if there
were none of this, there would be yet undoubtedly in it
Society, and Trouble. There are many (I know) and
Learned men, that have taken up the humour of deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their past Lives. This is a thing which I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Consent to; or to be troubled that my Life is spent,
because<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have so liv'd as to persuade my self that I
was not born in vain. And when I leave this Body,
'tis but as an Inn, not as a place of Abode. For Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has given us our Bodies only to Lodge in, not to
dwell in. Oh! How glorious will That day be, when I
shall leave the Rabble, and the Trash of this World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

               <p>'Tis all one to me, whether the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
be <hi>Cato</hi>'s, for the sense and expression of this

and the Excellency of representing his
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54880:50"/>
thoughts in words answerable to the Matter. Tho'
I'm apt to think, that although these very Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
were not <hi>Cato</hi>'s, yet that his familiar Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
were not far from this purpose. Neither
had <hi>Tully</hi> the Confidence to draw a <hi>Cato</hi> fairer then
he was; especially in a time, when his Character
was yet fresh in the Memories of all men. Beside
that such an Unlikeness in a <hi>Dialogue,</hi> would have
been a great <hi>indecorum,</hi> and enough to have blasted
the Credit of the Discourse.</p>

               <p>That which you
say, is very likely; but let me tell you what came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my head upon your Recital. I have often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
with my self, considering that long Life is the
Wish, and Death the Terrour of all Mortals, that
there is scarce any man so happy (I do not speak
of <hi>Old,</hi> but of <hi>middle-ag'd-men</hi>) but if it should
be offer'd him to be young again, if he would; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Condition of running the same Fortune over
again of Good and Ill, he would make the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that <hi>Cato</hi> did: especially passing a true refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon the mixture of his past Life. For the
remembrance, even of the pleasantest part of it, is
commonly attended with shame and sting of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
insomuch, that the Memory of past de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
is more painful to us, then that of past mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
Wherefore it was wisely done of the
Antient Poets, in the Fable of <hi>Lethe,</hi> to make the
<hi>Dead</hi> drink the Water of <hi>Forgetfulness,</hi> before their
Souls were affected with any desire of the Bodies
they had left behind 'em.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Vr.</speaker>
               <p>It is a thing that I
my self have observ'd in some Cases, and well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of our Admiration. But That in <hi>Cato,</hi> which takes
me the most, is his Declaration, that <hi>he did not repent
himself of his past Life.</hi> Where's the Christian that
lives to his Age, and can say as much? 'Tis a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thing for men that have scrap'd Estates toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54880:51"/>
by hook or by crcok, to value themselves at
their death, upon the Industry and Success of their
Lives. But <hi>Cato</hi>'s saying that he had not liv'd <hi>in
vain,</hi> was grounded upon the Conscience of having
discharg'd all the Parts of an honest, and a resolute
Citizen, and Patriot, and untainted Magistrate;
and that he should transmit to Posterity the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Integrity, and Virtue. <hi>I depart</hi> (says
he) <hi>as out of a Lodging, not a dwelling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Place.</hi> What
could be more Divine? I am here upon sufferance,

will not easily be forc'd from his own Home; but
the fall of a Chimney, the spark of a Coal, and
a thousand petty Accidents drive us out of this
World, or at the best, the Structure of our Bodies
falls to pieces with Old Age, and moulders to Dust;
every moment admonishing us that we are to change
our Quarters. <hi>Nephalius.</hi> That expression of <hi>Socrates</hi>
in <hi>Plato,</hi> is rather methinks the more significant of
the Two. <hi>The Soul of a man</hi> (says he) <hi>is in the
Body as in a Garison.</hi> There's no quitting of it;
without the leave of the <hi>Captain;</hi> nor any longer
staying in't, then during the pleasure of him that
plac'd it there. The Allusion of a <hi>Garison</hi> is much
more Emphatical, than that of a <hi>House.</hi> For in
the <hi>One,</hi> is only imply'd an <hi>Abode,</hi> (and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
an Idle one too) whereas in the Other, we are
put upon Duty by our <hi>Governor;</hi> And much to
this purpose it is, that the <hi>Life of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And what says <hi>Christ</hi> himself <hi>Mat. 24. Mar.
13.</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 21. That we should so live, and
Watch, as if we were presently to Die; and so
apply our selves to honest things, as if we were to
live for ever. Now who can hear these words of
<hi>Cato, Oh that glorious Day!</hi> without thinking of
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ?</hi>

               <p>How happy are they that wait for Death in

that I have most affectionately en leavour'd to please him.
And I am in good hope that he will accept the Will for

Inclinations, and an absolute Resignation of himself
to the Divine Will, that he deliver'd up himself,
in a dependence upon Gods Mercy and Goodness,

With how much Pomp are the Antient Rites
of the Church set forth in <hi>Baptism?</hi> The Infant
waits without the Church-door; the <hi>Exorcism,</hi> the
<hi>Catechism,</hi> is dispatch'd; the <hi>Vow</hi> is past; the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
with all his Pomps and Pleasures is <hi>abjur'd;</hi>
and then the Child is <hi>Anointed, Signed,</hi> Season'd
with <hi>Salt, Dipt,</hi> a Charge given to his <hi>Sureties</hi> to
see him well brought up, and then follows their
<hi>Oblation;</hi> and by this time the Child passes for a
Christian, as in some sense it is. After this, it comes
to be Anointed again; and in time learns to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,</hi>
take the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> Rest on <hi>Holy-Days,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Fasts,</hi> and <hi>Publique Prayers,</hi> and to abstain
from <hi>Flesh,</hi> and observing all these things, it goes
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54880:52"/>
for an absolute <hi>Christian.</hi> The Boy grows up then,
and marries, which draws on <hi>another Sacrament;</hi> he
enters into <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> is <hi>Annointed again,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated,</hi>
his <hi>habit chang'd,</hi> and so to <hi>Prayers.</hi> Now
the doing of all this, I like well enough; but the
doing of it more out of <hi>Custom</hi> than <hi>Conscience,</hi> I do
not like; as if this were all that is needful to the
making up of a <hi>Christian.</hi> There are but too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the World, that so long as they acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in these outward Forms, think 'tis no matter
what they do else: but Rob, Pillage, Cheat, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
Whore, Slander, Oppress and Usurp upon their
Neighbours, without Controll. And when they are
brought through this Course of Life, to their last
Prayers, then there follow <hi>more Ceremonies; Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
upon <hi>Confession,</hi> more <hi>Vnction</hi> still, the <hi>Eucharist,
Tapers,</hi> the <hi>Cross, Holy Water, Indulgences</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons;</hi>
if they be to be had for Love or Money: Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is then given for a <hi>Magnificent Funeral;</hi> and then
comes <hi>another solemn Contract.</hi> When the man is
come to agonizing, there's one bawls in his Ear,
and dispatches him now and then before his time,
if he chance to be a little in drink, or to have better
Lungs than ordinary. Now though these things may
be well enough, so far as they are done in Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to <hi>Ecclesiastical Customs;</hi> there are yet some
Inward, and Spiritual Impressions that do more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
us against the Assaults of Death, even to the
degree of filling our hearts with Joy, and Confidence
at our least Breath.</p>

not, God be prais'd, that we have still a Subject for

be thankful for that munificence, and Liberality, by
which we are both invited, and oblig'd to Love
him. And let us still use his Blessings and Bounties
with Moderation, and Temperance; and remember
the Poor. For God has given to some, too little
for their Convenience, and to others, more than
they need; that neither side might want an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for their Virtue. He bestows upon us sufficient
for the Relief of our Brethren; that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Mercy, and the Poor, on the other side,
when they are refresh'd by our Liberality, give God
thanks for putting it into our hears, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
us to him in their Prayers. And now I think
on't. Come hither, Boy. Bid my Wife send <hi>Gudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
some of the Meat that's left? 'Tis a very good
poor Woman in the Neighbourhood; her Husband's
lately dead (a Profuse Lazie fellow) and has left
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54880:53"/>
his Wife nothing but a number of Children.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis Christ's Command that we should give to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that asks. But yet if I should follow that rule;
with-in one month, I should go a begging my self.</p>

               <p>This is said, I suppose, of those that Ask only Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries.
For 'tis Charity to deny to many what
they ask. There are, that not only beg, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune,
or rather extort great Sums from people
to furnish voluptuous Entertainments, or which is
worse, to nourish Luxury, and Lust. It is a kind
of Rapine, to bestow that which we owe to the
present Necessities of our Neighbours, upon those
that will abuse it. Upon this Consideration it is, that
I can hardly excuse those from a Mortal Sin, who,
at prodigious Expence, either build, or beautifie
Monasteries, or Churches; when so many living
Temples of Christ are ready to starve for want of
Food, Cloathing, and other Necessaries. When I
was i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>England,</hi> I saw St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Tomb; so prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
Rich, in Plate, and Jewels, that the Value
was almost inestimable. Now had it not bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
if these superfluities had been rather apply'd to
Charitable Uses, for the Relief of the Poor, than
reserv'd for those Ambitious Princes, who shall have
the Fortune one day to make a Booty of it. The Holy
Man, I am Confident, would have been very well
content with Leaves, and Flowers, instead of them.
In <hi>Lombardy</hi> I saw a Cloyster of <hi>Carthusians;</hi> (not
far from <hi>Pavia</hi>) the Chappel, within, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
is white Marble, from the top to the bottom,
the Altars, Pillars, Tombs in it (and almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing else) are all Marble. To what end was
this vast expence upon a Marble Temple for a few
solitary Monks to Sing in? And 'tis of more
Burthen then Use too. For they are perpetually
troubled with Strangers that come only out of mere
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54880:54"/>
Curiosity to see it. And which is yet more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
I was told there, that they are indow'd with
Three thousand Duckets a year, for Building and
Maintenance of the Monastery. It passes for little
better than Sacriledge, to bestow one penny of that
Mony upon Pious Uses; beside the Intention of the
Testator. And they had rather pull down that they
may rebuild, then not to go on with Building. We
have a World of Instances up and down in our
Churches of this kind; but I shall content my self
with these, as being somewhat more remakable than
Ordinary. This is rather Ambition, then Charity.
Great men now adays will have their own Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Churches, whereas in times past they could
hardly get room for the Saints. They must have
their Pictures there, and their Images, forsooth;
with their Names at length, their Titles, and their
Benefits: And this takes up a considerable part of
the Temple. Who knows (if they may have their
Wills) but their own Carcases may come hereafter
to be laid upon the Altars? But this Munificence
of Great men, you'll say, must not upon any Terms
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e discourag'd. And I say so too; If that which
they offer to the Temple of God, be worthy of it.
But if I were a Priest, or a Bishop, I would ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
it into the heads of those thick skull'd Courtiers,
and Merchants; that if they would attone them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Almighty God, they should privately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
their Liberality upon the Relief of the Poor.
But they reckon all as good as lost, that goes out
so by Parcels, and is so secretly distributed toward
the succour of the Needy, that the next Age shall
have no Memorial of the Bounty. But can any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be better bestow'd then that which makes Christ
himself a Debtor?</p>

               <p>Yes, and I would be a Benefactor
my self, if I had a fortune for't; but it should be
such a Provision for their Necessities, as should not
reach to Luxury. And I would give something too,
wheresoever I found a Religious man that wanted it.</p>

               <p>I would do something that
way too, but with Caution and Choice. It were
well if every City were to maintain its own Poor,
without suffering Vagabonds, and sturdy Beggars,
which want Work rather than Mony.</p>

               <p>'Tis hard to answer all
these Points exactly. There should be First, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to oblige all; and then the Proportion
must be according to a mans Ability, as often as

I would be satisfi'd that they are Poor, and Honest;

               <p>Truely I take this house of mine to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

from any pretence of Luxury, or I am mistaken.
I have seen many a more chargeable Building that
has been erected by a Beggar; and yet out of these

of Tribute to the Poor, and daily lessen my own

please. So that chuse which you will, it must be
oppos'd to that which is signifi'd by the other.
As if you should say, <hi>either you shall exclude</hi> A, <hi>and
admit</hi> B, <hi>or you shall admit</hi> A, <hi>and exclude</hi> B. Here's
the <hi>thing chang'd,</hi> and the <hi>Person</hi> the <hi>same.</hi> And it

               <p>The
greatest difficulty to me is this; That we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to take thought for to morrow, when yet
<hi>Paul</hi> wrought with his hands for his Bread; and falls
bitterly upon Lazie people, and those that live
upon other mens Labour; exhorting them to take
pains, and get their livings with their fingers, that
they may have wherewithal to relieve others in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.
Are not these, holy, and warrantable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
by which a Husband provides for his Wife
and Children?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is a question, which in
my opinion, may be resolv'd several ways. First,</hi>
This Text had a particular regard to those times; when
the Apostles, being dispersed far and wide for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54880:56"/>
of the Gospel, they were to cast themselves
upon Providence for their support, without being sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
for it themselves; having neither leisure to get their
living by their labour, nor any thing to trust to for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
Fishing. But the World is now at another pass:
and we are all for Ease. <hi>Another way of expounding
it, may be this.</hi> Christ has not forbid Industry, but
Anxiety of thought; such as commonly possesses those
men that are hard put to't for a Livelihood; and set all
other things apart only to attend this. This is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by our Saviour himself, when he says that <hi>one man
cannot serve two Masters.</hi> For he that wholly delivers
himself up to any thing, is a Servant to't. Now tho'
the Propagation of the Gospel ought to be our Chief, yet
it is not our only Care. For he says, <hi>First,</hi> (not <hi>Only)
seek the Kingdom of Heaven, and these things shall
be added unto you.</hi> The word, <hi>To morrow,</hi> I take
to be <hi>Hyperbolical,</hi> and to signifie a time to come <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain;</hi>
it being the Custom of the World to be scraping
and sollicitous for Posterity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Your Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we allow of. But what is his meaning when he
says, <hi>Nè solliciti sitis Animae vestrae, quid Edalis.</hi> The
Body is Cloath'd, but the Soul does not Eat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>By <hi>Anima,</hi> is meant <hi>Life,</hi> which cannot subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Meat: This does not hold in our Garments
which are more for Modesty than Necessity. For a
Body may live without Cloaths, but without Meat
it is certain Death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>I do not well understand how
to reconcile this Passage, with that which follows.
<hi>Is not the Life more then Meat, and the Body more
then Raiment?</hi> For if Life be so precious, we
should take the more Care of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ti.</speaker>
               <p>This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
does rather encrease our trouble then lessen
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> this is none of our Saviours meaning. Who
by this Argument creates in us a stronger Confidence in
the Father; for if a bountiful Father hath given us.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54880:56"/>
                  <hi>gratis,</hi> that which is more valuable, he will, by a stronger
reason, confer upon us, that which is Cheaper. He that
has give us Life, will certainly give us Food. He that
has given us Bodies, will not deny us Cloaths. So that
upon the experience of his Divine Bounty, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why we should afflict our selves with any Anxiety,
of Thought, for things below. <hi>What remains then
but that using this World as if we used it not, we
transfer our whole study and application to the love
of Heavenly things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rejecting the World, and
the Devil, with all their Vanities, and Impostures,
we chearfully serve God alone, who will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
his Children. But here's no body takes any
Fruit! 'Tis a Scripture Dinner you have had; for

               <p>Because all honour
is due to our Master, and principally in these three
respects. We call him <hi>Lord,</hi> as the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of us
from the Tyranny of the Devil, with his Holy Blood,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54880:57"/>
and taking us to himself. We stile him <hi>Holy</hi> as the
<hi>Sanctifier</hi> of all men, and not only forgiving us all
our sins <hi>gratis,</hi> but by the Holy Spirit cloathing us
with his Righteousness; that we might follow Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
And then <hi>King,</hi> as heirs to a <hi>Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
from him who sits, and reigns himself at the
Right hand of God the Father. And all this we
owe to his gratuitous Bounty, that we have <hi>Iesus
Christ</hi> for our Lord, and not <hi>Satan;</hi> that we have
Innocence, and Sanctity, instead of the Filth and
Uncleanness of our Sins; and for the Torments of
Hell, the Joys of Life everlasting.</p>

Bring 'em out here Boy; These are all of a Price,
that is to say, they are of no value. 'Tis all one
to me now whether you will draw Lots, or chuse.
You will not find it <hi>Heliogabulus</hi>'s <hi>Lottery,</hi> for one
to draw 100 Horses, and another as many Flies. Here
are four little Books, two Clocks, a Lamp and a
Standish; which I suppose you will like better then

This <hi>Sommer-hall,</hi> I suppose, you have
had enough of. It looks three ways you see, and
which way soever you turn your Eye, you have a

Wind or the Sun be troublesome, here are both
<hi>Shutters</hi> and <hi>Chassies</hi> to keep them out. Here do I
eat in my House, as if I were in my Garden; for
the very walls have their Greens, and their Flowers
intermixt, and 'tis no ill Painting. Here's our
<hi>Saviour</hi> at his last Supper; and here you have <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s

of his Luxury; little thinking how soon he's to be

               <p>You have now before you,
my chiefest Treasure. You saw nothing but Glass
and Tin at the Table, and I have in my whole
house but one piece of Plate, and that is a Guilt
Cup, which I preserve, most religiously for his sake
that gave me it. This hanging Sphere gives you
a prospect of the whole World; and this wall shows
you the Situation of the several parts of it, more
at large. In those other walls, you have the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of all Eminent Authors; The rest are number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
In the first place, here's <hi>Christ</hi> upon the <hi>Mount,</hi>

               <p>Let's go to those three Walks now, above the other,
that I told you look'd into the <hi>Kitchin-Garden.</hi> These
upper walks have a prospect into both Gardens,
but only through windows with shutters; especially
in the walls that have no view into the Inner Garden,
for the safety of the house. Upon this wall, on
the left hand; (having fewer Windows in't, and a
better light.) There is painted the whole Life of
<hi>Iesus,</hi> out of the Story of the <hi>four Evangelists,</hi> to
the <hi>Mission</hi> of the <hi>Hely Ghost,</hi> and the first Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54880:59"/>
of the Apostles out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> with such notes
upon the places, that the Spectator may see, near
what Lake, or upon what Mountain, such or such
a thing was done. There are also Titles to every
Story, with an Abstract of the Contents; as that
of our Saviour, <hi>I will, be thou clean.</hi> Over against
it, you have the Tipes and Prophesies of the <hi>Old
Testament,</hi> especially out of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Psalms,</hi>
which are little other than the Story of <hi>Christ</hi> and
his Apostles, told another way. Here do I some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
walk, discoursing and Meditating with my
self upon the unspeakable Counsel of God, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Son for the Redemption of Mankind: My
wife, or some friend at my Elbow perhaps, that takes
delight in Holy things.</p>

as Memorials of the History. At each corner, there's
a lodging Chamber, where I can repose my self,

Do they fear this the less because they do not see
it? Neither does a <hi>Basilisk</hi> see the Venom that he
shoots from his own Eyes. In a good cause, I would
not stick to venture my Life; but to do it without
a cause, is madness; as it is Cruelty to bring others
into danger. There are yet other things worth the

afraid it may run into a Feud; they're both my

               <p>If you will not believe

Supper?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Pray'e let's have no more Questions,

               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>But,
by your favour, I am very much concern'd, when I
cannot be merry my self, unless you be so too. What
a Sigh was there now; enough to break your heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, there is somewhat that presses me, but
'tis not a thing to be told.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Out with it I prithee,
and what ever it be, upon my Soul, thou'rt safe:
My own Sister is not so dear to me as thou art.</p>

               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I dare swear you would not betray me;
but the mischief of it is, you can do me no good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>That's more then you know. As to the Thing
it self, perhaps I cannot, but in the matter of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
or Consolation, 'tis possible I may serve ye.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>It will not come out.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>What should this

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Less then I do
my own dear Brother: And yet my heart will not
serve me to speak it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Shall I guess at it? And
will you tell me if I'm right? Nay, give me your
word, or you shall never be quiet; and we'll have
no shifting neither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Agreed then: I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

               <p>Not above

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>That's true.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>So that the

               <p>And then the very habit of your
Body, and your complexion, speak ye in perfect
health. So that your grief must certainly be some

               <p>And then your Credits fair.</p>

               <p>Your Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Many people

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>In one word, you are the

               <p>There is Love in the Case, but not of that sort

you Divine?</p>

               <p>I have spent all my Divining Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties:
But yet I'll never let go this hand till I

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>You are too Violent.</p>

               <p>Since

               <p>From my very Infancy, I have had a strange kind

            <sp>

               <p>To put my self into a <hi>Cloyster.</hi>

               <p>And turn <hi>Nun?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>That's the very thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis well: I have

            <sp>

               <p>What's
that ye say?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing, nothing, my dear <hi>Mol;</hi>
My Cough troubles me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>This was my Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and my Parents most desperately against it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>I hear ye.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>On the other side I strove as
passionately, by Entreaties, fair Words, and Tears
to overcome that Pious Aversion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>At length, when they saw that I would
take no Denial, they were prevail'd upon, by Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
Submissions, and Lamentations, to promise,
if I continu'd in the same mind till I were <hi>seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of age,</hi> they would leave me to my self.
The time is now come; I continue still in the same
mind, and they go from their words. This is the
Sum of my Misfortune; and now I have told ye my
Disease, be you my Physitian, and help me if ye
can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>My advice must be, (my sweet Creature)
to moderate your Affections; and if ye cannot do
all that ye would, to do however as much as ye
can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>It will certainly be my Death if I be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.</p>

               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>What was it that gave the first Rise
to this fatal Resolution?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>When I was a little
Girl, they carry'd me into one of these Cloysters,
and shew'd me the whole Colledge; the Chappels
were so neat, and the Gardens so clean, so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and so well order'd, that I fell in love with
'em: and then they themselves were so pure, and
glorious, they look'd like Angels: so that (in short)
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54880:62"/>
which way soever I turn'd my eye, there was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and pleasure; and then I had the prettiest
discourses with the <hi>Nuns!</hi> I found <hi>Two</hi> there, that had
been <hi>my Play-fellows,</hi> when I was a Child; but I have
always had a strange passion for that kind of Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>I have no quarrel to the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> of
<hi>Cloysters;</hi> tho' the same thing can never agree
with all Persons. If I were to speak my opinion,
I should think it more suitable to your <hi>Genius</hi> and
<hi>Manners,</hi> to take a Convenient <hi>Husband,</hi> and set
up a <hi>Colledge</hi> in <hi>your own House,</hi> where He should be
the <hi>Father</hi> of it, and <hi>You</hi> the <hi>Mother.</hi>

               <p>I'l ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Nay, 'tis an Admirable thing to be a pure Maid.
But cannot you keep your self so, without running
your self into a Prison, never to come out again?
Cannot you keep your Maidenhead, I say, <hi>at home</hi>
with your Parents, as well as in a <hi>Cloyster?</hi>

               <p>Much

swill-belly'd <hi>Monks.</hi> They are no <hi>Capons,</hi> I'll
assure ye, whatever you may think of 'em; but
may very probably be called <hi>Fathers;</hi> for they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
make good their Calling to the very <hi>Letter.</hi>
In times past, Maids liv'd no where honester then
at home; when the only <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Father they
had, was the Bishop. But I prethee tell me, what
Cloyster has thou made choice of to be a Slave in?</p>

               <p>I'm very well acquainted with the whole

you Father, Mother, Friends, and a worthy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
for that precious Fellowship! The <hi>Patriarch</hi>
there; What with <hi>Age, Wine,</hi> and a certain <hi>natural
drowziness,</hi> has been mop'd this many a day. He
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54880:62"/>
poor man, tastes nothing now but <hi>Florence Wine:</hi> and
he has two Companions there (<hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iodocus</hi>)
that match him to a hair. And yet I cannot say
that <hi>Iohn</hi> is an <hi>Ill man,</hi> for he has <hi>nothing</hi> at all
of a <hi>man</hi> about him but his <hi>Beard:</hi> Not a grain
of Learning in him, and about the same Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of common Prudence. Now for <hi>Iodocus,</hi> he's
so errant a Sot, that if he were not ty'd up to the
Habit of his Order, he would walk the Streets in
a <hi>Fools Cap,</hi> with <hi>Ears</hi> and <hi>Bells</hi> at it.</p>

               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>But you must give me leave <hi>(Kitty)</hi> to know 'em

               <p>You would not
think how I'm troubl'd at my Fathers House, to see
so many entertainments there; and then the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
Women are so given to talk Smutty:</hi> And besides,
I'm so put to't sometimes, when People come to

There's no hurt in using our selves to hear all things,

I suppose you have a Chamber to your self at home.</p>

               <p>You may withdraw then, if
you find the Company grow Troublesome; and while
they are chaunting and triflng, you may entertian
your self with <hi>(Christ)</hi> your Spouse, Praying, Singing,
and giving Thanks; your Fathers House will not
defile ye, and your Goodness on the other hand will
turn it into a Chappel.</p>

               <p>I do not disallow of a modest

you'll tell me another Story. There are more

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And I talk in Cipher (my dear
<hi>Kitty</hi>) because I would not have thee understand

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>My head runs strangely upon this Course
of Life tho'; and my passion for it grows every
day stronger and stronger. Now if it were not
inspir'd into me from above, this Disposition (I
am perswaded) would have gone off long ago.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Nay but the Obstinacy of it makes me the rather
to suspect it, considering that your Parents are so
fiercely bent against it. If it were good, Heaven
would as well have inclin'd your Parents to favour
the Motion, as you to entertain it. But the <hi>Gay
things</hi> you saw when you were a <hi>Child;</hi> the <hi>Tittle-tattles</hi>
of the <hi>Nuns,</hi> and the hanckering you have
after your <hi>Old Acquaintances:</hi> the <hi>External Pomp</hi> of
their <hi>Worship,</hi> the <hi>Importunities</hi> of their <hi>Senseless
Monks,</hi> that only hunt for <hi>Proselites,</hi> that they may
cram their own <hi>Paunches; here's the Ground of your
Affection.</hi> They know your Father to be Frank, and
Bountiful; and that this is the way to make sure of
their <hi>Tipple:</hi> For either they drink with him, or
else they invite him, and he brings as much Wine
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54880:63"/>
with him as ten lusty Sokers can Swallow. Do
nothing therefore without your Parents consent
(whom God has set over you as your Guardians)</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>But what's a <hi>Father</hi> or a <hi>Mother,</hi> in respect of
<hi>Christ?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>This holds, I grant ye, in some Cases;
but suppose a <hi>Christian</hi> Son has a <hi>Pagan Father,</hi> who
has nothing but a Sons Charity to support him; It
were an Impiety in him to leave even That Father,
to starve. If you were at this day <hi>Vnchristen'd,</hi>
and your <hi>Parents</hi> should forbid your <hi>Baptism,</hi> you
were undoubtedly to prefer <hi>Christ,</hi> before a <hi>Wicked
Father:</hi> Or if your <hi>Parents</hi> should offer to force ye
upon some <hi>Impious thing,</hi> their Authority in that
point were to be contemned. But what's this to
the Case of a <hi>Convent.</hi> Have you not <hi>Christ</hi> at
<hi>home?</hi> the <hi>Dictate</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Approbation</hi> of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Exhortation</hi> of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
of <hi>Human Laws,</hi> for your <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents?</hi>
And will ye now withdraw your self from
the Authority of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>natural Parents,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for <hi>figurative ones?</hi> Will ye take an <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Mother</hi> for a <hi>True one?</hi> And deliver up your
self a Slave to severe Masters, and Mistresses, rather
then live happily under the Wing of Tender and
Indulgent Parents? So long as you are at home,
as you are Bound in some things, so in many things
you are wholly Free; as the word <hi>Liberi</hi> (or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren)
denotes; in <hi>contra-distinction,</hi> to the Quality
of <hi>Servants.</hi> You are now, of a <hi>Free Woman,</hi> about
to make your self a <hi>Voluntary Slave.</hi> A Condition
Christianity has long since cast out of the World;
saving only some obscure footsteps of it, and in some
few places. But there is now found out (under
pretence of Religion) a new sort of <hi>Servitute,</hi> which
I find practised in the <hi>Monasteries.</hi> You must do
nothing but by a <hi>Rule;</hi> and then all that <hi>you Lose,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54880:64"/>
they Get.</hi> Set but one step out of the Way, and
ye're lugg'd back again, like a Criminal that
would have Poyson'd his Father: And to make the
Slavery yet more evident, ye change the Habit that
your Parents gave ye; and (after the Old Example
of Slaves, bought and sold in the Market) ye change
the very Name that was given you in Baptism. <hi>Peter</hi>
is called <hi>Francis,</hi> and (<hi>Iohn</hi> for the purpose) is
called <hi>Dominicus,</hi> or <hi>Thomas. Peter</hi> gives his Name
first up to <hi>Christ;</hi> and when he gives up his name
to <hi>Dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nicus,</hi> he's call'd <hi>Thomas.</hi> If a Servant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in <hi>War</hi> do but so much as <hi>cast off</hi> the Garment
that his <hi>Master</hi> gave him, it is look'd as a <hi>Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi>
of his <hi>Master;</hi> and yet we applaud him that
lays down the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> (who is the <hi>Master</hi> of
us all) and takes up <hi>another Habit</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> never
gave him. And if he should after That, presume to
change the Other, his Punishment is a Thousand
times heavier then for throwing away the Livery of
his Heavenly Master, which is the Innocency of his
mind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>But they say 'tis a <hi>Meritorious Work</hi> for a Body
to enter into this <hi>Voluntary Confinement,</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>That's
a <hi>Pharisaical Doctrine:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us otherwise;
<hi>and will not have him that's called Free, to make himself
a Servant, but rather endeavour that he may be more Free.</hi>
And that which makes the Servitude yet More Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
is, that you must <hi>serve many Masters;</hi> and
those most commonly <hi>Fools</hi> too, and <hi>Debauche's:</hi>
Besides that they are both New, and uncertain. But
say (I beseech ye) by what Law are you discharg'd
from the Power of your Parents?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly
by none at all.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>What if you should buy, or
sell your Fathers Estate?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>I do not hold it Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>What Right have ye then to dispose of
your Parents Child, to I know not whom? His
Child; which is the Dearest, and most appropriate
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54880:64"/>
part of his possession.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>The Laws of Nature may
be dispens'd withal, (I suppose) in the Business of
Religion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>The great Point of <hi>Religion</hi> lies in
our <hi>Baptism:</hi> But the matter in question Here, is
only the changing of a <hi>Garment;</hi> or of such a Course
of Life; which, in it self, is neither good nor evil.
And now consider how many valuable Priviledges
ye lose, together with your Liberty: If ye have a
mind to Read, Pray, or Sing; you may go into
your Chamber when you will, and take as much, or
as little on't as you please. When ye have enough
of Privacy, you may go to Church, and hear Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Sermons, Anthems; you may pick your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
among grave Matrons, and sober Virgins; and
such as you may be the better for. And you may
learn from Men too, where ye find any that are
endow'd with Excellent Qualities; and you are at
Liberty to place a more Particular Esteem upon
such as affectionately, and conscienciously Preach
the Gospel. But there's none of this Freedom when
ye come once into a Cloyster.</p>

               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Away with this Nicety
of <hi>Names;</hi> and weigh the <hi>Thing</hi> it self. They make
their boast of <hi>Obedience;</hi> and why should not You
value your self too upon <hi>Obeying</hi> your <hi>Parents,</hi> your
<hi>Bishop,</hi> and your <hi>Pastor,</hi> whom God commands ye
to Obey? do they Profess <hi>Poverty?</hi> And so may
you too; so long as all is in your Parents hands.
'Tis true, the Virgins of former times were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by holy Men for their Liberality toward
the Poor: But they could never have given any thing,
if they had possess'd nothing; Nor is the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your <hi>Chastity</hi> ever the less, for living with
your Parents. And what is there more now Here?
A <hi>Vail,</hi> a <hi>Linnen Stole,</hi> and certain <hi>Coremonies</hi> that
serve but little to the Advancement of Piety; and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54880:65"/>
make us never the more acceptable in the sight of
God; who only regards the Purity of the Mind.</p>

caution all young Women, (especially those of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Natures) not to precipitate themselves into
this Gulph, from whence there is no returning. And
the rather, because their Modesty is more in danger
in a Cloyster, than out of it: beside that they may
discharge their Duties of Devotion, as well at home,

               <p>I was brought

               <p>It was something
very considerable, but I must not tell ye what. When
I had been there <hi>six days,</hi> I got my Mother to me;
I begg'd, and besought her as she lov'd my Life,
to help me out again: but she would not hear on't;
and bad me hold to my Resolution: Upon this, I
sent to my Father, and he chid me too. He told
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54880:67"/>
me, That I had made him master his affection, and
that he would now make me overcome mine. When
I saw that this would do no good, I told them both,
that I would submit to Die, to please 'em, which
would certainly be my Fate, if I staid there any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and hereupon they took me home.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>By his Bounty that has promis'd to provide for

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>

               <p>

Take you no care, but all things shall be added to you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>But that Promise extends only to those that

seek the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Apostles</hi> were
famous for <hi>Miracles:</hi> they cur'd the <hi>Sick;</hi> and 'tis
no wonder then how they liv'd any where; but you
can do no such thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>We could, if we were like
the Apostles, and if the matter requir'd a Miracle.
But the power of Miracles was only temporary to
convince Unbelievers. There's nothing needful now
but a Holy Life: Beside, that it is many times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be sick, then to be well; to die, then to live.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>What do you do then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>The best we can;
every man according to the Tallent that God has
given him. We comfort, exhort, admonish, reprove,
as we see Occasion: Nay, sometimes we preach too,
where we find Pastors that are Dumb; and where
we can do no good, we make it our Care to do no
hurt, either by our Words, or Examples.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>He was a good man; but how came
he to have a <hi>Holy day?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>I'll tell ye; we have
a world of <hi>Swineherds</hi> hereabouts (for there's a
huge Wood hard by here, for Acorns) and the
people have an opinion that <hi>St. Antony</hi> takes charge
of the <hi>Hogs;</hi> and therefore they worship him, for
fear he should hurt 'em.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>I would they would
worship him affectionately as they should do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>In what manner?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>Whosoever follows his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
does his Duty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>We shall have such
Drinking, Dancing, Playing, Scolding, and Boxing
here to morrow!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>Like the <hi>Pagans Bacchanals.</hi>
But these people are more sottish than the <hi>Hogs</hi>
they keep; and I wonder that <hi>Antony</hi> does not
punish 'em for it. What kind of Pastor have ye?
Neither a <hi>Mute</hi> I hope, nor a <hi>Wicked</hi> one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>Let
every one speak as he finds, he's a good <hi>Pastor</hi> to me;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54880:71"/>
for here he topes it the whole live-long day; and no
man brings me either more, or better Customers.
'Twas ten to one he would have been here now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>He's not a man for our turn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>What's
that? Do you know him then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>We would
fain have taken up a Lodging with him, but he bad
us <hi>begone,</hi> and chac'd us away like so many Wolves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>Very, very good. Now I understand the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
'Tis <hi>You</hi> that kept him <hi>away,</hi> because he knew
you would be here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>Is he not Mute?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>Mute do you say? he's free enough of his
Tongue in the Stove; and he has a Voice
that makes the Church ring again, but I never heard
him in a Pulpit. In short, I presume he has made
you sensible that he wants no Tongue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>Is he a
learned Divine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>So he tells the World him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
but he's under an Oath perhaps never to
make any other discovery of it. In one word, the
<hi>People</hi> and the <hi>Pastor</hi> are well agreed; and the <hi>Dish</hi>
(as we say) <hi>wears its own cover.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think he
would give a man leave to preach in his Place?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>I dare undertake he shall, provided that there
be no flurting at him, as 'tis a common practice to
do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis an ill custom. If I dislike any thing,
I tell the <hi>Pastor</hi> of it privately; the rest belongs to

               <p>Truely I see no advantage at all; but in <hi>War,</hi>

               <p>How well it becomes you, I know, not; but <hi>your Habit</hi>

               <p>I cannot say what you are: but this I know,

saw once an Errant <hi>Tony,</hi> with a <hi>Gown</hi> to his <hi>Heels,</hi> a
<hi>Doctors Cap,</hi> and the <hi>Countenance</hi> of a very Grave
<hi>School Divine;</hi> he disputed Publiquely; several Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <p>If your Proposition be

               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>You

               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>What if I should
say on the contrary, that their Habit does rather
provoke people to do 'em mischief; insomuch that
of Fools they come to be mad men; and why shall
not a Bull, or a Dog, or a Boar, that kills a man
or a Child, escape unpunisht; as well as a Fool?

But the thing that I ask you, is, the reason of <hi>your

as well be distinguisht from a <hi>Fisherman,</hi> a <hi>Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker</hi>
from a <hi>Taylor,</hi> an a <hi>Apothecary,</hi> from a <hi>Vintner,</hi>
a <hi>Coachman</hi> from a <hi>Waterman?</hi> You that are <hi>Priests,</hi>

               <p>In antient time, <hi>Monks</hi> were only the <hi>purer Sort</hi>

honour upon <hi>us;</hi> and we gave some Reputation to
the Habit our selves; which is not simply either
<hi>Layik</hi> or <hi>Sacerdotal;</hi> but such as it is, I could name
you some <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and <hi>Popes,</hi> that have not been

               <p>Some time from the very

Murtherer exemplary, would it not be a sufficient
Punishment to cut of the hind Lappet of his Shirt,
clap a Wholfs skin upon his Buttocks, put him on
party-coloured Stockins, cut the fore-part of his
Doublet into the fashion of a Net, leave his breast
and his Shoulders bare, turn up one part of his
Beard, leave another part at length, and shave the
rest; cut off his hair, clap a Cap upon his Crown
with a hundred holes in't, and a huge Plume of
Feathers, and then bring him in this Dress, into
publick? Would not this be a greater reproach, then a
fools Cap to him with long ears, and gingling baubles?
And yet we find those that accompt this an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
tho' nothing can be a greater Madness; nay,
we see Souldiers every day in this Trim, that are
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54880:74"/>
well enough pleas'd with themselves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
               <p>Yes;
and there are some honest Citizens, would strain
hard to get into this Mode.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>But now if a Man
should dress himself up with Birds Feathers, like an
<hi>Indian,</hi> would not the very Children think him
Mad?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Directly Mad.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>And yet that
which we admire, does still savour of a greater
Madness. Now as it is true, that nothing is so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
but Custom may bear it out; so it must
be allow'd, that there is a Certain <hi>decorum</hi> which
all Wise-men will approve of: And somewhat again
in <hi>Garments,</hi> that is Mis-becoming, and agreed by
all the World, to be so. What can be more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
than a <hi>Burthensome Gown</hi> with a <hi>Long Train;</hi>
as if the <hi>Quality</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> were to be measur'd
by the <hi>Length</hi> of her <hi>Tail?</hi> Nay, and some <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals</hi>
are not asham'd to imitate it: And yet so
prevalent a thing is <hi>Custom,</hi> that there's no changing
of a Fashion so received.</p>

               <p>So much for <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.</hi>
But tell me now, whether you think it better

               <p>I
take it to be more agreeable to Christian Simplicity,
not to pronounce upon any Man for's Habit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it be sober, and descent.</p>

               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>Because
an Invincible Custom hindre'd it. For whatsoever
is deep rooted in the Minds of Men, and by long
use confirmed, and turn'd as it were into Nature,
can never be taken away on the sudden, without
the hazard of the Publick Peace: but it must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
by Degrees, as the Horse Tail was pluck'd
off by single Hairs.</p>

               <p>I could bear this, if the

               <p>My dear

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>Troth, I had much ado
to know you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>What? such
an Alteration in two years?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>No. But your New <hi>Dress,</hi> and that
<hi>bald Crown,</hi> make you look like quite another sort of
Creature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>You'd hardly know your <hi>Own Wife,</hi>
perhaps, in a <hi>New Gown.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>In such a one as

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>And yet I
remember you perfectly well still; though you have
chang'd <hi>Habit, Face, Body,</hi> and all. How come you
to be so set out with Colours? Never had any
Bird such a Variety of Feathers. You have nothing
about you that's either <hi>Natural,</hi> or in <hi>Fashion.</hi> Was
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54880:77"/>
ever any Mans <hi>Hair</hi> Cut so Phantastically? Half a
<hi>Beard,</hi> and the Crop of your Upper Lip grown so
straggling, as if one Hair were afraid of another:
A Man would think ye had chang'd Whiskers with

               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, Father, these are
the Marks of Honour: but pray'e tell me, are
there no <hi>Surgeons or Physicians in this Quarter?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you ask?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>Because your brains should
have been taken out, and wash'd, before you plung'd
your self into this Slavery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>You take me for a

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>As any thing in <hi>Bedlam;</hi> you
would never have leapt into your <hi>Grave</hi> before your
time else; when you might have lived handsomly in
a better <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>So that I'm no longer a <hi>Man
of your World.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>By <hi>Iove,</hi> I take it so.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>And
what's your Reason for't?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>Because you are
Coop'd up, and cannot go where you will. Nay,
your very <hi>Habit</hi> is <hi>prodigious:</hi> Your <hi>Shaving,</hi>
as <hi>Extravagant;</hi> and then perpetually to <hi>Eat</hi> nothing
but <hi>Fish,</hi> makes ye all stink like <hi>Otters:</hi> Your very
<hi>Flesh</hi> is <hi>Fish</hi> too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>If men were turn'd into what
they Eat, your <hi>Bacon-Eating Chops</hi> would have been
<hi>Swines-Flesh</hi> many a fair day ago.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>But you have
enough of your Bargain, I suppose, by this; for I
meet very few in your Condition, that are not sick
on't sooner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis one thing for a Man to cast
himself into a <hi>Retreat,</hi> as if it were into a <hi>Well;</hi>
and another thing to do it <hi>considerately,</hi> and by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi>
as I have done; upon a thorough search of
my Own Heart, and a due Contemplation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life: For at the Age of Eight and Twenty
a Man may be supposed wise enough to know his
Own Mind. As to the <hi>Place;</hi> what is the <hi>Place</hi> of any
Mans abode, compar'd with the World? And any
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54880:77"/>
Place is large enough, so long as it wants nothing for
the Commodity of Life. How many are there
that never stirr'd out of the City where they were
born; and yet rest well enough contented within
that Compass? But yet you'll say, If they were
confin'd to't, it would give'em a longing to go out.
This is a common Fancy, which I am clear of.
This Place is the whole World to me; and this
Map here, shews me the Globe of the Earth; which
I can travel over in a Thought, with more Security
and Delight, than he that sails to the <hi>Indies</hi> for
<hi>Spice,</hi> and <hi>Pearl.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>That ye say comes near the
matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Why should not I <hi>shave my Head,</hi> as
well as you <hi>clip yours?</hi> If you do the One for <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
sake,</hi> if there were nothing else in't, I would
do the Other, for my <hi>Health.</hi> How many Noble
<hi>Venetians</hi> shave their Heads all over? And then for
our <hi>Habit,</hi> where's the Prodigy of it? Our <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are for <hi>two Ends;</hi> Either to Defend us from
<hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> or to <hi>cover our Nakedness:</hi> And
does not this Garment now answer both these
Ends? If the <hi>Colour</hi> offend you; why should not that
become all Christians, which is given to us in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism?</hi>
It is said also, <hi>Take a White Garment;</hi> so
that this Colour does but mind me of what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
in that Sacrament, the perpetual study of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency:
And then if by <hi>Solitude</hi> you mean only a
withdrawing from the Croud; you may reproach
with This Solitude the <hi>Ancient Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Philosophers,</hi> and many other Persons that have
applied themselves to the Gaining of a good Mind,
as well as Us. Nay, <hi>Poets, Astrologers,</hi> and other
<hi>Eminent Artists,</hi> whensoever they have any thing in
hand that is extraordinary, do commonly betake
themselves to a <hi>Retreat.</hi> But why should this kind
of Life be call'd a <hi>Solitude,</hi> when one single Friend
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54880:78"/>
is a most delightful Contradiction to it? I have
here almost twenty Companions, to all Sociable,
and Honest Purposes; Visits more than I desire;
and indeed more than are expedient.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>But you
cannot have these always to talk with.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Nor

for being sometime interrupted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
so too; for I never relish <hi>Flesh</hi> so well, as I do
after a <hi>Strict Lent.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Neither am I without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
when you take me most to be alone; and
for <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Entertainment,</hi> worth a Thousand of
your <hi>Drolls,</hi> and <hi>Buffoons.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>Where are they?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Look you; here are the <hi>four Evangelists.</hi> In this
Book, I can confer with him that accompanied the
two Disciples in their way to <hi>Emaus,</hi> and with his
Heavenly Discourse, made them forget the trouble
of their Journey: With Him that made their Hearts
burn within them, and inflam'd them with a Divine
Ardor of receeiving his blessed Words. In this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Study I converse with <hi>Paul, Isaiah,</hi> and the rest
of the Prophets: <hi>Chrysostome, Basil, Austin, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
Cyprian,</hi> with a World of other <hi>Learned,</hi> and
<hi>Eloquent Doctors.</hi> Where have you such Company
<hi>Abroad</hi> as this? Or what do you talk of <hi>Solitude,</hi> to
a Man that has always <hi>This Society?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>But these
People will signifie nothing to me, that do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand 'em.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Now for our <hi>Diet;</hi> As to the
<hi>Quantity,</hi> Nature contents her self with a little;
and for the <hi>Quality</hi> of it, <hi>a Belly full's a Belly full;</hi>
no matter what it is. Your Palate calls for <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,
Pheasant, Capon;</hi> and a piece of <hi>Stock-Fish</hi>
satisfies mine: and yet I am perswaded my Body
is as good Flesh and Blood as yours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>If you
had a Wife, as I have, perhaps 'twould take off
some of your Mettle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>But however, we are at
Ease, let our <hi>Meat</hi> be never so <hi>Plain,</hi> or never so
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54880:78"/>
                  <hi>little.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>In the mean time, ye live like <hi>Iews.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>You are too quick; if we cannot come up to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
we do at least aim at it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>You place
too much <hi>Holiness</hi> in <hi>Meats, Formularies,</hi> and other
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> neglecting <hi>the more weighty Duties of the
Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Let others answer for themselves; but
for my own part, I place no sort of Confidence in
those things; but only in <hi>Christ,</hi> and in the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>Why do ye observe these things
then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>For the preserving of <hi>Peace,</hi> and the
avoiding of <hi>Scandal.</hi> There's little trouble in such
a <hi>Conformity;</hi> and I would not offend my Brother for
so small a matter. Let the <hi>Garment</hi> be what it will,
Men are yet so Nice, that agreement, or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
even in the smallest Matters, has a strange In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the Publick Peace. The <hi>shaving</hi> of
the <hi>Head,</hi> or the <hi>colour</hi> of the <hi>Habit,</hi> gives me no
Title (of it self) to <hi>Gods Favour,</hi> and <hi>Protection:</hi>
And yet if I should let my <hi>Hair grow,</hi> or change my
<hi>Gown</hi> for a <hi>Buff-coat,</hi> would not the People take
me for a <hi>Phantastical Coxcomb?</hi> I have now told
you My sense; and pray'e let me have Yours, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital.
You ask't me e'en now, If there were no
Physicians in this Quarter, when I put my self into a
Cloyster: Where were they, I beseech you, when you
left your young Wife, and pretty Children at Home,
to Enrol your self a Souldier? <hi>A Mercenary Bravo,
to cut the Throats of yeur Fellow Christians</hi> for <hi>Wages?</hi>
And your business did not lye among <hi>Poppyes,</hi> and
<hi>Rushes</hi> neither, but with <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Gun-shot;</hi> where,
over and above the miserable Trade of Cutting their
Throats for Money that never did you Hurt, you
expose your Self, Body, and Soul, to Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
But here's none of this in a Cloyster.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not Lawful then to Kill an Enemy?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Yes,
and Pious too, if it be in the defence of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54880:79"/>
your Wife, and Children, your Parents and
Friends, your Religion, Liberties, and the Publick
Peace. But what is This to a <hi>Souldier of Fortune?</hi>
If you had been knockt on the Head in this service,
I would not have given a Nut-shell to redeem the
very Soul of you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>No?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>As I am honest
I would not. Speak your Conscience: Is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be under the Command of a <hi>Good Man,</hi> whom
we call our <hi>Prior;</hi> one that summons us to <hi>Prayers,
Holy Lectures,</hi> the hearing of saving <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and
the Glorifying of <hi>God,</hi> than to be subject to some
<hi>Barbarous Officer,</hi> that Posts you away upon <hi>Marches</hi>
at <hi>Midnight,</hi> sends you at his Pleasure hither and
thither, backward and forward; exposes you to Shot,
great and small, and assigns you your <hi>Station,</hi> where
upon Necessity you must either <hi>Kill</hi> or be <hi>Kill'd?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>And all this is short yet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>In case of any
<hi>Transgression, here,</hi> upon the Point of <hi>Discipline,</hi> the
Punishment is only <hi>Admonition,</hi> or some such slight
Business. But in <hi>War,</hi> you must either <hi>hang</hi> for't,
(if you cannot <hi>compound</hi> for <hi>Beheading</hi>) or run the
<hi>Gantlope.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>All this is too true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>And what
have ye got now by all your great Adventures? Not
much, if a Man may judg by your <hi>Patch'd Breeches.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, my own Stock is gone long since, and a

               <p>I would you had come hither before you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd

               <p>So <hi>Bare,</hi> do ye

My <hi>Pay,</hi> my <hi>Plunders,</hi> and all the Advantages I made

               <p>Miserable

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54880:79"/>
to forsake Father and Mother for. And still
you call this <hi>Living,</hi> which was but wallowing in

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>So.</speaker>
               <p>The thing that Egg'd me on

               <p>Mind me then, and I'll give ye the
naked Truth of the Story. My Friend <hi>Reuchlin</hi> had
a dangerous Fit of Sickness; but not without some
hope of Recovery neither. What Pity 'tis that so
admirable a Man should ever grow Old, Sicken, or
Dye! One Morning I made my <hi>Franciscan</hi> a Visit,
to put off some trouble of thoughts, by diverting my
self in his Company; for when my Friend was Sick,
(do ye see?) I was Sick; and I lov'd him as my own
Father.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>As if ever any honest Man would have
done otherwise!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Br.</speaker>
               <p>My <hi>Franciscan</hi> bad me chear
up; for <hi>Reuchlin</hi> (says he) is well. What? (said I)
Is he well again so soon? For but two days ago the
Doctors despair'd of him. Then satisfy your self,
says he, for he's so well, that he shall never be Sick
again. The Tears stood in my Eyes, and my <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan</hi>
taking notice of it, Pray'e be patient, (says
he) till I have told you all. I have not seen the
Man this week, but I pray for him every day that
goes over my head. This very Morning, after
<hi>Mattins,</hi> I threw my self upon my Bed, and fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a gentle, pleasant Slumber.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>My mind gives
me already there will come some good on't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Br.</speaker>
               <p>And yours is no <hi>ill Genius.</hi> Methought I was stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a little Bridge that led into a Meadow, so
wonderfully Fine, what with the Emrald Verdure,
and freshness of the Trees and Grass; the Infinite
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54880:82"/>
Beauty, and variety of Flowers, and the Fragrancy
of all together, that all the Fields on this side the
River lookt dead, blasted and withered, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.
In the <hi>Interim,</hi> while I was wholly taken
up with this Prospect, who should come by (in a
lucky hour) but <hi>Reuchlin?</hi> And as he pass'd, he
gave me (in <hi>Hebrew</hi>) his Blessing. He was gotten
above half over the Bridge, before I was aware;
and as I was about to run up to him, he lookt back,
and bade me stand off. <hi>Your time</hi> (says he) <hi>is not
yet come; but five Years hence you are to follow me. In
the mean while, be you a Witness, and a Spectator of
what's done.</hi> I put in a word here, and ask'd him,
if <hi>Reuchlin</hi> was <hi>Cloth'd</hi> or <hi>Naked; Alone,</hi> or in
<hi>Company.</hi> He had nothing upon him (says he) but

followed him a good way off, certain <hi>Birds</hi> that

their <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Cry,</hi> one might have taken them
for <hi>Pyes;</hi> but that they were sixteen times as big;
and about the Size of <hi>Vultures.</hi> They had <hi>Combs</hi>
upon their <hi>Heads,</hi> and a kind of <hi>Gorbelly'd Kites,</hi>

Be gone, says he, <hi>ye cursed Fiends, to a place that's fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

but you have no Commission to meddle with me, that am
now listed in the Roll of Immortality.</hi> The words were
no sooner out of his Mouth, says my <hi>Franciscan,</hi>
but these filthy Birds took their Flight, and left such
a Stink behind them, that a Close-stool would have
been Orange-flower-water to it; and he swore, that
he would rather go to Hell, than even snuff up such

               <p>But hear what the <hi>Franciscan</hi> told me more.
While I was musing upon this, St. <hi>Ierome</hi> (says
he) was gotten close to the Bridge; and saluted
<hi>Reuchlin,</hi> in these very Words, <hi>God save thee my most
Holy Companion. I am commanded to conduct thee to the
blessed Souls above, as a Reward from the Divine Bounty,
of thy most pious Labours.</hi> With that, he took out
a Garment, and put it upon <hi>Reuchlin.</hi> Tell me
then, (said I) in what Habit or Shape St. <hi>Ierome</hi>
appear'd? Was he so old as they Paint him? Did he
wear a <hi>Cowl,</hi> or a <hi>Hat;</hi> and the Dress of a <hi>Cardinal?</hi>
Or had he a Lyon for his Companion? Nothing of
all this (said he) but his Person was Comely, and
his Age was only such, as carried Dignity with
it, without the Offence of any sort of Sluttery: But
what need had he there of a Lyon by his side, as he
is commonly Painted? His Gown came down to his
Heels, as Transparent as Christal, and of the same
Fashion with that he gave to <hi>Reuchlin.</hi> It was paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over with <hi>Tongues</hi> of <hi>three several Colours;</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the <hi>Ruby,</hi> the <hi>Emerald,</hi> and the <hi>Saphyre.</hi>
And beside the clearness of it, the Order made it
exceeding graceful.</p>

               <p>Out of this <hi>Overture,</hi> there was

Two Holy Souls</hi> embraced one another, ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

them, with so charming a Melody,
that the <hi>Franciscan</hi> says, he is not able to think of
the Delight of it, without weeping. And after this,
there followed an incomparable <hi>Perfume.</hi> His Sleep
(or rather the Vision) was no sooner over, but he
started up like a Mad-man, and call'd for his Bridge,
and his Meadow, without either speaking or thinking
of any thing else; and there was no perswading of
him to believe that he was any longer in his Cell.

to see any Man breathe his last.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>But it has been
mine too often, if I might have had my wish.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>Pray'e tell me, is Death so Terrible as they make
it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Way</hi> to't, is worse than the <hi>Thing it
self;</hi> for the <hi>Apprehension</hi> is the greatest part of the
<hi>Evil.</hi> Beside, that our Resignation to the Will of
God makes all the Bitterness, as well of Sickness, as
of Death, casy to us. There can be no great Sense
of any thing in the Instant of the Souls leaving the
Body. For before it comes to that point, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
it self is become Dull and Stupid; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
laid asleep.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>What do we feel when
we're Born?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Mother</hi> feels something how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
if we do not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>Why would not Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
let us go out of the World as smoothly as we
came into't?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Our Birth is made painful to the
Mother, to make the Child dearer to her; and
Death is made formidable to Mankind, to deter us
from laying violent Hands upon our Selves; for if
so many make away themselves as the case stands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
what would they do, if the dread of Death
were taken away? If a Servant, or a Child were
but corrected; a Family-quarrel started, a Sum of
Money lost, or any thing else went Cross, Men
would presently repair to Halters, Swords, Rivers,
Preciplces, Poysons, for their Relief. It is the
<hi>Terror</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> that makes us set the greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
upon <hi>Life;</hi> especially, considering that there's no
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54880:86"/>
Redemption; for the Dead are out of the reach of
the Doctor. Now so it is, that we do not all either
come into the World, or go out of it alike. Some
dye sooner, others later; some one way, some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
A Lethargy takes a Man away without any Sense
of Death; as if he were Stung with an Asp, he goes
off in's Sleep. Or be it as it will, There is no Death
so Tormenting, but that a Man may overcome it with
Resolution.</p>

               <p>I'll begin with my Friend
<hi>George.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So soon as ever it could be certainly known that
his Hour was drawing on; the <hi>Physitians</hi> that had
attended him throughout his Sickness, gave to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Pains they had taken, and that there
was matter of Money in the Case; but not a Word
of the Despair they had of his Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>How many
<hi>Physitians</hi> might there be?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>Ten;</hi>
sometimes <hi>Twelve;</hi> but never under <hi>Six.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now
in all Conscience to have done the Business of
a Man in perfect Health.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Their Money was no
sooner paid, but they privately hinted to some of
his near Relations, that his Death was at hand,
and advis'd them to take the best Care they could
for the good of his Soul, for his Body was past hope.
This was handsomely intimated by some of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Friends to <hi>George</hi> himself, desiring him, that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54880:86"/>
he would remit the Business of his <hi>Life</hi> to <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
and turn his Thoughts now toward the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of another <hi>World.</hi> Upon this News, <hi>George</hi>
cast many a soure Look at the Physitians, taking it
very heinously, that they should now leave him in his
distress. They told him, that <hi>Physitians</hi> were but
<hi>Men,</hi> not <hi>Gods;</hi> and that they had done as much
as <hi>Art</hi> could do to save him; but there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
against <hi>Fate;</hi> and so they went into the next
Chamber.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>What did they stay for after they
were paid?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>They were not yet agreed upon the
<hi>Disease.</hi> One would have it to be a <hi>Dropsy;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
an <hi>Apostheme</hi> in the <hi>Guts; Every Man</hi> of them
would needs have it a several <hi>Disease;</hi> and this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
they were very hot upon, throughout his

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
               <p>The Patient had a blessed

               <p>For the deciding of
this Controversy, <hi>First,</hi> They desir'd by his Wife
that the Body might be open'd; which would be
for his Honour, a thing usual among Persons of
Quality. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they suggested how beneficial
it might be to others, which he would have the
Comfort of, by increasing the Bulk of his <hi>Merits,</hi>
and then they promis'd him <hi>Thirty Masses</hi> at <hi>their
own Charge,</hi> for the good of his <hi>Soul.</hi> There was
much ado to bring him to't; but at last, by <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities</hi>
and <hi>fair Words,</hi> the thing was obtain'd;
and so the whole Consultation was dissolv'd; for
Physitians, whose Business it is to preserve Life, do
not think it convenient to be present, either at their
Patients Death, or Funeral. By and by, <hi>Benardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
was sent for to take his <hi>Confession:</hi> a <hi>Reverend

               <p>They did not

               <p>They told the <hi>Curate,</hi> he was

Where did they ever learn <hi>Aristotle's Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy;</hi>
the <hi>Arguments</hi> of <hi>Thomas,</hi> or the <hi>Speculations</hi>

                  <hi>Batchelors?</hi> Ye crept into a <hi>Believing World,</hi> a
Company of poor, humble Wretches of ye, (tho
some, I must confess, were Devout and Learned.)
Ye nestled at first, in <hi>Fields</hi> and <hi>Villages,</hi> and so
by Degrees, transplanted your selves into <hi>Opulent
Cities,</hi> and none but the best part of them neither,
would content ye. Your business lay then only in
Places that could not maintain a <hi>Pastor;</hi> but now,
forsooth, none but great Mens Houses will serve your
turn. You value your selves much upon the Title of
<hi>Priests,</hi> but all your <hi>Priviledges</hi> are not worth a Rush,
unless in the <hi>Absence</hi> of the <hi>Bishop, Pastor,</hi> or his <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi>
Not a Man of you shall come into my <hi>Pulpit,</hi>
I assure ye, so long as I am <hi>Pastor.</hi> 'Tis true, I am
no <hi>Batchelor;</hi> no more was St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and yet he
discharg'd the Office of a <hi>Bishop.</hi> If I have not so
much Learning as I should, I'll never come a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to you for't. The World is grown Wiser now
adays, than to think that the <hi>Holiness</hi> of <hi>Dominicus</hi>
and <hi>Franciscus,</hi> is entail'd upon the <hi>Habit.</hi> You're
much concern'd what I do in my own House: 'Tis
the common talk of the People what you do in your
Cells; and at what rate you behave your selves,
with your <hi>Holy Virgins;</hi> and how many <hi>Illustrious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces</hi>
ye have turn'd into <hi>direct Bawdy-Houses. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colphus,</hi>
you must excuse me for the rest, for it is
too foul to be told: But in truth, he handled the
Reverend Fathers without <hi>Mittens:</hi> And there would
have been no end on't, if <hi>George</hi> had nor held up
his hand, in token that he had something to say.
With much ado, the Storm was laid at last, and
they gave the Patient the Hearing. <hi>Peace</hi> (says
he) <hi>be among ye: I'll Confess my self over again to my</hi>
Parish-Priest: <hi>and see all the Charge of Ringing, of
my Funeral Rites, Burial and Monument, paid ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye go out of the House; and take such Order, that

in some measure; only something he mutter'd
about <hi>Confession;</hi> but he remitted it at last, and told
them that there was no need of troubling either
the Priest, or the Patient, with the same things
again; but if he had Confess'd to me in time (says
he) he would have made his Will perhaps upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Considerations. But now we must e'en take it
as it is; and if it be not as it should be, it must be
at your door. This Equity of the Sick Man's gall'd
the Monks to the very Heart, to think that any part
of the Booty should go to the Priest of the Parish.
But upon my Intercession Matters were Compos'd;
and the Parish-Priest gave the Sick Man the Unction
and the Eucharist, receiv'd his Money, and so went

heard every word that was spoken; there was no

               <p>The Patient sent them word by his Wife, that
if they would but be quiet a little, and hold their
Tongues, all things should be set right: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desir'd, that for the present, the <hi>Augustines,</hi>
and <hi>Carmelites</hi> would Depart, and they should be no
Losers by it: for they should have the same Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Meat sent them home, which the rest had
that staid. He gave direction, to have all the <hi>Five
Orders</hi> assist at his <hi>Funeral;</hi> and for an <hi>Equal Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend</hi>

should go <hi>First;</hi> and after <hi>Them,</hi> the <hi>Rest,</hi> for fear
of a <hi>Tumult,</hi> or Quarrelling for <hi>Place.</hi> The <hi>Parish-Priest</hi>
and his <hi>Clerks</hi> went <hi>Last:</hi> for the <hi>Monks</hi> would
never indure it otherwise.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>George</hi> had Skill,

               <p>And it was provided, that the <hi>Funeral
Service,</hi> which was to be perform'd by the <hi>Parish-Priest,</hi>
should proceed in <hi>Musick,</hi> for the Greater
<hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Defunct.</hi> While these things were a
doing, the <hi>Patient</hi> was seiz'd with a <hi>Convulsion,</hi> which
was a Certain Token that his Dissolution was at
hand: So that they were now come to the <hi>Last Act.</hi>

               <p>No; For

a Total <hi>Pardon</hi> of All his <hi>Sins,</hi> and an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption</hi>
from the Fear of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> with a <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
over and above, of his <hi>Whole Estate.</hi>

               <p>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> of the <hi>War:</hi> But it
happen'd that a Brother of his Wives, one <hi>Philip,</hi>
a <hi>Civilian,</hi> was by at the reading of the <hi>Bull;</hi> and
took notice of One Passage in it, that was not as it
should be, which made him Jealous of <hi>Foul Play.</hi>

               <p>This came very Unseasonable; Or if there had

the <hi>Sick Man never the worse for't.</hi>

               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>You say ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well; and I assure ye it wrought upon <hi>George</hi> so,
that it had like to have cast him into an <hi>Absolute
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54880:91"/>
Despair.</hi> And <hi>here, Vincentius</hi> shew'd himself <hi>a Man
indeed; Courage,</hi> George, (says he) <hi>for I have an
Authority to Correct, or to supply all Errors, or Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in this Case: so that if this Bull should deceive
thee, my Soul shall stand ingag'd for thine, that thine
shall go to Heaven, or mine be Damn'd.</hi>

               <p>But will
God accept of This way now of <hi>Changing Souls?</hi>
Or if he does, is the <hi>Pawn</hi> of <hi>Vincentius</hi>'s <hi>Soul</hi> a
sufficient <hi>Security?</hi> What if <hi>Vincentius</hi>'s <hi>Soul</hi> should

               <p>I only tell ye Matter of Fact. <hi>Vincentius</hi> Enter'd
formally into <hi>This Obligation,</hi> and <hi>George</hi> seem'd to
be much <hi>Comforted</hi> with it. By and by the <hi>Covenants</hi>
are <hi>read,</hi> by which, the <hi>Whole Society promise</hi> to
<hi>Transfer</hi> to <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>All the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>I speak of their
<hi>Good Works</hi> only; for they <hi>help a Soul</hi> in mounting
to <hi>Heaven,</hi> as <hi>Feathers</hi> help a <hi>Bird.</hi>

And then they read over, how many <hi>Masses</hi> and
<hi>Psalms</hi> were to accompany the Soul of the <hi>Deceased;</hi>
which indeed were <hi>Innumerable.</hi> His <hi>Confession</hi> was
<hi>Repeated,</hi> after This; and they gave him their <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction.</hi>

               <p>Not yet. They

               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>They threw <hi>Ashes</hi> upon it;

<hi>Body;</hi> and then they <hi>Consecrated</hi> a <hi>Franciscans Coat,</hi>
with <hi>Certain Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Holy Water,</hi> and Cast That
over him; they laid his <hi>Coul</hi> under his <hi>Head,</hi> (for
there was no putting of it on) and his <hi>Pardon</hi> with
it.</p>

But they affirm, that the <hi>Devil</hi> has no <hi>Power</hi> over
Those that Die in This manner; for they do

               <p>These were the last Words he spake:

St. <hi>Francis,</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> that of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> while
the rest were up and down in the Bed-Chamber,

               <p>Bernardinus <hi>spake to this Purpose:</hi> George Baleari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
If thou dost now approve of all that is here done, lean
thy Head toward thy Right Shoulder. <hi>And so he did.</hi>
Vincentius, <hi>on the other side,</hi> Have a good Heart,
<hi>George, (says he)</hi> thou hast St. <hi>Francis</hi> and St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick</hi>
for thy Defenders; fear nothing, but think of
the Merits that are bestow'd upon thee; The Validity of
thy Pardon, and that I have engag'd My Soul for Thine,
if there should be any Danger. If thou Vnderstand'st
all This, and approvest of it, lean thy head toward Thy
Left Shoulder; <hi>and so he did. After this, they cry'd
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54880:92"/>
out as loud as before,</hi> If thou art sensible of All This,
squeeze my Hand; <hi>and he did so: So that betwixt
the</hi> turning <hi>of his</hi> Head, <hi>and the</hi> squeezing <hi>of his</hi>
Hand, <hi>there past almost</hi> Three Hours. <hi>When</hi> George
<hi>began to</hi> Yawn, Bernardinus <hi>stood up, and pronounc'd
his</hi> Absolution; <hi>but he could not go through with it,
before</hi> George'<hi>s</hi> Soul <hi>was out of his</hi> Body. <hi>This was
about</hi> Midnight; <hi>and in the</hi> Morning, <hi>they went about

               <p>Well

               <p>With a <hi>Musquet Shot,</hi> as
his Wife told me; and the Physicians conjectur'd that
some part of the <hi>Melted Lead</hi> was yet in his <hi>Body.</hi> By

could, into a <hi>Franciscans Habit;</hi> and after Dinner
they Bury'd him in Pomp, as it was Order'd.</p>

               <p>I

               <p>There's no danger; for if This be

it; and for making the <hi>Impostors Themselves,</hi> perhaps,
asham'd of what they have done; and Cautious how
they do the same thing again. Beside that it may
possibly preserve the Simple from falling any more

               <p>He told
him, that he should be ready to serve him in any
thing as a Friend; but that his business lay rather
with <hi>God,</hi> than with the <hi>Doctors. Cornelius</hi> took This
Sentence as Chearfully, as if he had assur'd him of
his Recovery. Wherefore, tho he had always been
very Charitable, according to his Power, yet he then
enlarg'd himself, and bestow'd upon the Needy all
that he could possibly spare from the Necessities of
his Wife and Children: And not upon Those that
take a <hi>Pride</hi> in a <hi>seeming Poverty;</hi> (those are an
<hi>Ambitious sort</hi> of <hi>Beggers,</hi> that are every where to
be met withal:) But upon those good Men, that
oppose a <hi>Laborious Industry</hi> to an <hi>Innocent Poverty.</hi>
I desir'd him, that he would rest himself, and rather
take a <hi>Priest</hi> to entertain him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than spend his Wasted
Body with more Labour than it would bear. His
Answer was, That it had been His Practice, rather
to Ease his Friends where he could, by <hi>Doing</hi> good
Offices, than make himself Toublesome by <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
them; and that he would now <hi>Die</hi> as he had
<hi>Liv'd.</hi> He would not lie down till the <hi>Last Day,</hi>
and <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Last Night</hi> of his <hi>Life.</hi> In the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,</hi>
he was forced to support his Weak Body with
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54880:93"/>
a Stick; Or else he would sit in a Chair, but very
rarely came into his Naked Bed: Only he kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his Clothes, with his Head <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>upright. In This
time, either he was giving Orders for the Relief of
the Poor, and of the Neighbourhood, (especially
such as were known to him) or else he would be
Reading of those Scriptures that might fortifie him
in his Faith toward God; and shew the Infinite Love
of God to Mankind. When he was not able to
Read himself, he had some Friend to Read to him;
and he would frequently, and with wonderful Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
encourage his Family to Mutual Love, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and to the Exercise of True Piety; comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Friends with great Tenderness, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
them not to be over-sollicitous for his Death.
He gave it often in Charge to his Family, to see all
his Debts paid.</p>

<hi>came, and finding himself extreamly weak, he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54880:94"/>
kept his Bed. The</hi> Parish-Priest <hi>was then call'd,
gave him</hi> Extreme Vnction, <hi>and the</hi> Holy Communion;
<hi>but he made</hi> no Confession, <hi>for he had</hi> no Scruple, <hi>he
said, that stuck upon him. The</hi> Priest <hi>began then
to discourse of the</hi> Pomp, Place, <hi>and</hi> Manner <hi>of his</hi>
Burial. Bury me <hi>(says he)</hi> as you would bury the
meanest Christian: Nor do I concern my self where ye
lay my Body; for the Last Iudgment will find it out
in One place, as well as in Another; and for the Pomp
of my Funeral, I heed it not. <hi>When he came to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the</hi> Ringing of Bells, <hi>the saying of</hi> Masses, <hi>the
Business of</hi> Pardons, <hi>and Purchasing a</hi> Communion of
Merits; My good Pastor <hi>(says he)</hi> I shall find my self
never the worse, if never a Bell be rung; and One Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Office will abundantly content me: but if there be
any thing else, which the publick Custom of the Church
has made necessary, and that cannot well be Omitted,
without giving a scandal to the Weak; In that case, I
remit my self to your Pleasure: Nor am I at all desirous,
either to buy any Man's Prayers, or to rob any Man of
his Merits; Those of Christ I take to be sufficient, and
I wish only, that I my self may be the better for the
Prayers, and Merits of the Whole Church, if I Live,
and Die, but a true Member of it. All my hope is in
these two Assurances. The One is, That my Sins are
abolished, and nail'd to the Cross by my Blessed Savio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,
who is our Chief Shepherd. The Other is, that which
Christ bath signed, and sealed with his Holy Blood; By
which we are made sure of Eternal Salvation, if we place
all our Trust in Him. Far be it from me to insist upon
<hi>Merits,</hi> and <hi>Pardons;</hi> as if I would provoke my God
to enter into Iudgment with his Servant, in whose sight
no Flesh living shall be Iustifi'd. His Mercy is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and unspeakable, and thither it is that I must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
from his Iustice. <hi>The</hi> Parish-Priest, <hi>upon these

Passion, <hi>out of the</hi> Gospels. <hi>With what affection did
he take in all these Scriptures! Sighing at some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages;
Closing his Hands, as in Thankfulness, at
Others: One while rapt, and Overjoy'd at some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
and at Others sending up his Soul in short
Ejaculations. After Dinner, when he had slept a
little, he caused to be read the</hi> Twelfth of <hi>St.</hi> Iohn, <hi>to
the End of the Story. And here the Man seem'd to
be Transfigur'd, and possess'd with a New-Spirit.

               <p>My dearest Wife, the same God that joyn'd us,
doth now part us; but only in our Bodies, and
That too, but for a short time. That Care, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Piety, that thou hast hitherto divided
betwixt my self, and the tender Pledges of our
Mutual Love, thou art now to transfer wholly to
Them: Nor canst thou do any thing more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God, or to me, than to Educate, Cherish,
and Instruct those whom Providence has bestow'd
upon us, as the Fruit of our Conjunction, that
they may be found worthy of Christ. Double thy
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54880:95"/>
Piety towards them, and reckon upon my share
too, as translated unto Thee. If thou dost This,
(as I am confident thou wilt) thy Children are
not to be accounted Orphans.</p>
               <p>If ever thou shouldst Marry again—
<hi>With that his Wife gush'd out into Tears,
and as she was about to forswear the thing,</hi>
Cornelius <hi>thus interposed:</hi> My dearest Sister
in Christ; If our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> shall vouchsafe to
thee such a Resolution, and strength of Spirit,
be not wanting to thy self in the Cherishing of so
Divine a Grace; for it will be more Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as well to thy self, as to thy Children; but
if thy Infirmity shall move thee another way,
know, that My Death has freed thee from the
Bond of Wedlock, but not from That Trust,
which in both our Names, thou owest in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the Care of our Children. As to the
Point of Marriage, make use of the Freedom
which God has given thee. This only let me
intreat, and admonish thee, make such a Choice
of a Husband, and so discharge thy self towards
him, in the Condition of a Wife, that either by
his Own Goodness, or for Thy Convenience, he
may be kind to our Children. Have a Care then
of Tying up thy self by any Vow: Keep thy self
free to God, and to our Issue; and bring them
up in such a frame of Piety and Virtue, and
take such care of them, that they may not fix
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54880:95"/>
upon any Course of Life, till by Age, and the use
of things, they shall come to understand what
is fittest for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turning then to his Children, he exhorted them to
the Study of Virtue; Obedience to their Mother; and
Mutual Friendship and Affection among themselves. He
then kist his Wife, pray'd for his Children; and
making the Sign of the Cross, recommended them to
the Mercy of Christ. After This, looking upon all
that were present;</hi> Yet before to Morrow-morning, <hi>(says
he)</hi> the Lord that sanctified the Morning, by Reviving upon
it, will descend, out of his Infinite Mercy, to call this poor
Soul of mine out of the Sepulchre of my Body, and the
Darkness of This Mortality, into his Heavenly Light. I
will not have ye tire your selves in your Tender Age with
Vnprofitable Watching; only let One wake with me, to
read to me, and let the rest sleep by Turns. <hi>When he
had past the Night; about Four in the</hi> Morning, <hi>the
whole Family being present, he caused that</hi> Psalm
<hi>to be read, which our Saviour, praying, recited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cross. When That was done, he call'd for
a</hi> Taper, <hi>and a</hi> Cross; <hi>and taking the</hi> Taper, The Lord
<hi>(says he)</hi> is my Light, and my Salvation, whom shall
I fear? <hi>And then, kissing the</hi> Cross; The Lord <hi>(says
he)</hi> is the Defender of my Life, of whom then shall I be
afraid? <hi>By and by, with his hands upon his breast,
and the Gesture of One Praying, and with his Eyes
lifted up to Heaven,</hi> Lord Iesus <hi>(says he)</hi> receive
my Spirit. <hi>And immediately he closed his Eyes, as
if he were only about to sleep; and so, with a
Gentle Breath, he deliver'd up his Spirit, as if he
had only slumber'd, and not expir'd.</hi>

I'll tell you a late Whimsy of his, of the same
kind. We were a good many of us, Riding to
<hi>Richmond,</hi> and some in the Company that you would
allow to be no Fools. The Day was so Clear, that
there was not a Cloud to be seen. <hi>Pool,</hi> looking
wishly up into the Air, fell on the sudden to <hi>Crossing</hi>
of himself, and with a strange Amazement in his
Countenance; <hi>Lord</hi> (says he to himself) <hi>what do I
see!</hi> They that rod next him, asking him what it
was that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; he <hi>Cross'd</hi> himself, <hi>more and more.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54880:97"/>
In Mercy</hi> (says he) <hi>deliver us from this Prodigy.</hi> They
still pressing him more earnestly, to say what was
the matter. Then <hi>Pool</hi> fixing his Eyes, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toward such a Quarter of the Heaven, <hi>That Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Dragon</hi> (says he) <hi>with Fiery Horns;</hi> (Don't
you see him?) <hi>and look how his Tail is turn'd up into
a kind of a Circle.</hi> Upon their denial, that they
saw any thing; and his urging them to look steadily
just where he pointed; one of them, at last, for
the Credit of his Eyes, yielded that he saw it too;
and so one after another, they all saw it; for they
were asham'd not to see any thing that was so plain
to be seen. In short, the Rumour of this <hi>Portentous
Apparition</hi> was in three days all over <hi>England;</hi>
and it is wonderful, how they had amplifi'd the
Story; and some were making Expositions upon
the meaning of this horrid Portent. But in the

of seeing the Success of his Project.</p>

the Man, that as he was a Holy, and a
Learned Person, he would do his best toward the
Relieving of a poor Soul out of that terrible Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

               <p>Well, and
what then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>After Supper, out goes <hi>Pool,</hi> a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or about his usual Sports; and when it grew
Duskish, out went <hi>Fawn,</hi> and was at last, a Witness
of those grievous Lamentations. <hi>Pool</hi> had hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thereabouts in a <hi>Bramble-Bush,</hi> and perform'd
his part incomparably well. His Instrument was an
<hi>Earthen Pot,</hi> that through the Hollow of it, gave a
most mournful Sound.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>You'll say
more when you have heard it out. Away goes
<hi>Fawn</hi> home in great Impatience, to tell what he
heard; while <hi>Pool,</hi> by a shorter Cut, gets home be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. There does <hi>Fawn</hi> tell <hi>Pool</hi> all that past,
with something of his own too, to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more wonderful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but could <hi>Pool</hi>
hold his Countenance all this while?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He
hold his Countenance?</hi> Why, he carries his Heart in
his Hand; and you would have sworn that the whole
Action had been in earnest. In the End, <hi>Fawn,</hi>
upon the pressing Importunity of <hi>Pool,</hi> resolv'd to
venture upon an <hi>Exorcism;</hi> and Slept not one wink
that Night, his Thoughts were so taken up with
the Consideration of his own Safety; for he was
most wretchedly afraid. In the first place, he got
together the most powerful <hi>Exorcisms</hi> that he could
find; to which, he added some new ones, as by the
<hi>Bowels</hi> of such a <hi>Saint,</hi> the <hi>Bones</hi> of St. <hi>Winnifrede;</hi>
and after this, he makes choice of a Place in the
Fie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, near the Thicket of Bushes, whence the Noise
came. He draws ye a Circle, a very large one,
with several <hi>Crosses</hi> in it, and a phantastical Variety
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54880:98"/>
of <hi>Characters;</hi> and all this was perform'd in a <hi>set
Form of Words.</hi> He had there also, a great Vessel,
full of <hi>Holy Water,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Stole</hi> (as they call
it) about his Neck; upon which hung the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Gospel of St. <hi>Iohn.</hi> He had in his Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
a little Piece of <hi>Wax,</hi> which the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> us'd to Consecrate once a Year, commonly
call'd an <hi>Agnus Die.</hi> With these Arms in time past,
they defended themselves against <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> till the
<hi>Cowl</hi> of St. <hi>Francis</hi> was found to be more Formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.
All these things were provided, for fear
the <hi>Fiend</hi> should fall foul upon the <hi>Exorcist.</hi> And
all this was not enough neither to make him trust
himself alone in the Circle; but he concluded to
take some other Priest along with him, to keep
him Company. This gave <hi>Pool</hi> an Apprehension;
that by the joyning of some Cunning Fellow with
him, the whole Plot might come to be discovered.
So that he took a <hi>Parish-Priest</hi> thereabouts, whom
he acquainted before-hand with the whole Design;
(and it behoved him so to do) Besides, that he was
as fit as any Man for such an Adventure. The next
day, when every thing was ready, and in order;
about <hi>Ten a Clock, Fawn</hi> and the <hi>Parish-Priest</hi> enter
the Circle. <hi>Pool,</hi> that was gone before, <hi>Yels</hi> and <hi>Howls</hi>
in the <hi>Brambles. Fawn</hi> gives a <hi>God-speed</hi> to the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcism.</hi>
In the mean time, <hi>Pool</hi> steals away in the
Dark to the next Village, and from thence, brings
another Person to Act his Part; for there went a great
many of them to the Play.</p>

               <p>They mount themselves

            <sp>

               <p>The sudden Flashing of
the <hi>Fire,</hi> so startled the <hi>Horses,</hi> that the Riders could
hardly keep the Jades upon their Legs, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Saddle. And here's an end of the first
Act.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Fawns</hi> Return, <hi>Pool</hi> askt him very Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
what he had done, as knowing nothing at all
of the Matter; and then <hi>Fawn</hi> up with his Story,
and tells him of two dreadful <hi>Cacodemons</hi> that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to him upon <hi>Black Horses,</hi> their Eyes Spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with Fire, and Flames coming out of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils;
and what attempts they made to pass the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
but that by the Power and Efficacy of his Words,
they were driven away with a Vengeance. This
Encounter put <hi>Fawn</hi> into Courage; so that the next
day, with great Solemnity, he returned to his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
And when he had a long time, with much Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence,
provok'd the Spirit; <hi>Pool</hi> with his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,</hi>
shew'd himself again upon their <hi>Black Horses,</hi>
and prest on with a most <hi>Outragious Outcry,</hi> as if
they were fully determin'd to Storm the Circle.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>None at all; for that
did not succeed well: But you shall now hear of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Device. They had a long <hi>Rope,</hi> which they
drew gently over the Ground; and then hurrying
from one place to another, as if they had been
frighted away by <hi>Fawn's Exorcisms,</hi> up went the
Heels by and by of both the Priests, and down come
they upon the Ground, with a great Vessel of <hi>Holy
Water;</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> and their <hi>Holy Water,</hi> both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>And this was t'other Priests Reward, for
playing of his Part.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>It was so; and yet he would
have endur'd a great deal more, rather than quit the
Design.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:54880:99"/>
After this Encounter, <hi>Fawn</hi> upon his Return,
makes a mighty Business to <hi>Pool,</hi> of the Danger he
had been in, and how valiantly he had defeated <hi>both
the Devils</hi> with his <hi>Charms:</hi> And he was by this
time, absolutely perswaded, that all the Devils in
Hell had not the Power to force his Circle, or the
Confidence so much as to attempt it.</p>

               <p>This same

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>Oh!
you have heard nothing yet, to speak of. When
the <hi>Comedy</hi> was thus far advanc'd, in very good time
came <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Son in Law.</hi> He's a pleasant Droll, ye
know; the Young-man that married <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Eldest
Daughter.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>I know him very well, and no man
fitter for such an Exploit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>Fitter saist thou?
Why, I will undertake he shall leave his Dinner at
any time, for such a Comedy. His Father in Law
acquaints him with the whole Business, and who
but he to Act a <hi>Ghost.</hi> He undertakes his Part;
has every thing provided, and wraps up himself
in a Sheet, like a Corps, with a live Coal in a Shell
that shew'd through the Linnen, as if something
were a burning. About Night he goes to the Place
where the Scene of the Story lay. There were
heard most doleful <hi>Mones,</hi> and <hi>Fawn</hi> in the mean
time, lets fly all his <hi>Exorcisms.</hi> By and by, a good
way off in the Bushes appears the <hi>Ghost,</hi> shewing
<hi>Fire</hi> by Fits, and Groaning most rufully. While
<hi>Fawn</hi> was beseeching him to say, who he was, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
out leaps <hi>Pool,</hi> in his <hi>Devils Habit,</hi> from
the Thicket; and Roaring and Raging, <hi>This Soul,</hi>
says he, <hi>is mine, and you have no Power over it;</hi> and
with that, he runs up presently to the very Edge
of the Circle, as if he were about to fall violently
upon the <hi>Exorcist.</hi> After which, he loses Ground,
and Retreats, as if he had been either beaten off by
the Words of the Exorcism, or by the Virtue of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54880:100"/>
                  <hi>Holy Water,</hi> which was thrown upon him in great
abundance. At last, when the Spirit's Protector was
driven away, <hi>Fawn</hi> enters into a Dialogue with the
<hi>Ghost;</hi> which, after much Intreaty and Importunity,
confest it self to be the Soul of a Christian; and being
askt the Name; my Name (says the Ghost) is <hi>Fawn.</hi>
Why, then (says <hi>Fawn</hi>) we are both of a Name;
and the very Thought of delivering his <hi>Namesake,</hi>
made him lay the Matter more to heart. <hi>Fawn</hi>
put so many <hi>Questions,</hi> that the <hi>Ghost</hi> began to fear,
that a longer Discourse might make some Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and so withdrew himself, upon Pretence that
his Hour was come, that he was not permitted to
Talk any longer, and that he was now compell'd to
go away, whither it pleased the Devil to carry him;
but yet promis'd to return again the next day, at
some lawful Hour. They meet again at <hi>Pool</hi>'s House,
who was the Master of the Shew; and there the
<hi>Exorcist</hi> talks of his Atchievement; and tho in many
ny things he help'd the Matter, he believ'd himself
yet in all he said; so heartily was he affected to the
Business in hand. It was now manifest that it was
the Soul of a Christian that was faln under the Power
of some unmerciful Devil; and in the most cruel Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
so that their Endeavour is now wholly
bent that way. There happen'd one pleasant kind
of a Ridiculous Passage in this <hi>Exorcism.</hi>

               <p>When <hi>Fawn</hi> had call'd
up the <hi>Ghost; Pool,</hi> that acted the <hi>Devil,</hi> leap'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
at him, as if without any more ado, he would
break into the Circle. <hi>Fawn</hi> fought with him a great
while with <hi>Exorcisms,</hi> and whole <hi>Tubs</hi> of <hi>Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
and at last, the Devil cry'd out, <hi>He did not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
all that, any more than the Dirt under his Feet;
You, Sirrah,</hi> (says he) <hi>have had to do with a Wench,
and you are my own. Many a true Word has been spoken
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54880:100"/>
in jeast:</hi> For so it proved, for the <hi>Exorcist</hi> finding
himself touch'd with that Word, retir'd presently
to the very <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Circle,</hi> and mumbled some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
I know not what, in the other Priests' Ear.
<hi>Pool</hi> finding that, withdrew, that he might not
hear more than did belong to him.</p>

with more Courage and Fierceness, up to the very
Line of the Circle, and provok'd the Devil of his
own accord: But the Devil's heart now fail'd him,
and he fled Back. <hi>You have deceiv'd me,</hi> says he;

to draw toward a Conclusion. This way of <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy</hi>
with the <hi>Ghost,</hi> continu'd for some days; and it
came to this at last, that the <hi>Exorcist</hi> asking if
there were any way to deliver the Soul from Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
The <hi>Ghost</hi> answer'd him, That it might be
done, by restoring the Ill-gotten-Money, which he
had left behind him. What (says <hi>Fawn</hi>) if it were
put into the Hands of your <hi>People,</hi> to dispose of for
<hi>Pious Vses?</hi> His Reply was, That it might do very
well that way; which was a great Consolation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o
the <hi>Exorcist,</hi> and made him very diligently enquire
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54880:101"/>
to what Value it might amount. The <hi>Ghost</hi> told
him, that it was a mighty <hi>Sum,</hi> and a thing that
might prove very Good and Commodious. He told
him the very place too (but a huge way off) where
this Treasure was buried under Ground.</p>

                  <hi>Three Persons</hi> were to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

to Kiss the <hi>Comb</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which is at <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi>
And then a great number of <hi>Services</hi> and
<hi>Masses</hi> were to be perform'd by several <hi>Monasteries;</hi>
and for the rest, he should dispose of them as he
pleas'd. Now <hi>Fawn</hi>'s heart was wholly fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Treasure;</hi> which he had in a manner swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
already.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ans.</speaker>
               <p>There was nothing omitted, that concern'd
the business of Money; and when that was done,
the <hi>Exorcist</hi> (being put upon't by <hi>Pool</hi>) fell to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the <hi>Ghost,</hi> about <hi>Curious Arts, Chymistry</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</hi>
But the <hi>Ghost</hi> put him off for the present,
with some slight Answer; only giving him the hopes
of large Discoveries, so soon as ever he should get clear
of the <hi>Devils Clutches.</hi> And here's the end of the <hi>Third
Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Fourth. Fawn</hi> began every where to talk
high, and promise strange things, and to brag at
the Table, and in all Companies, what a Glorious
Work he had in Hand, for the Good of the <hi>Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and he was elevated now into another manner
of Stile and Behaviour. He went to the place
where the Treasure was hid, and found the Marks,
but durst not venture to dig for't; for the <hi>Ghost</hi> had
put into his Head, that it would be extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to touch the Money, before the <hi>Masses</hi> were
said. By this time, there were a great many Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54880:101"/>
Snaps that had the Plot in the Wind; but yet
he was still making Proclamation every where of his
Folly, tho divers of his Friends, and his <hi>Abbot,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
caution'd him against it: and advis'd him,
That having a long time had the Reputation of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Man, he should not take so much Pains now to

               <p>I had an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
lately, that put me upon a long Journey; and
I was in great Haste; so I went to one of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestest,
as I thought, of the whole Gang; and one
for whom I had formerly done some good Offices.
I told him, that I was call'd away upon urgent Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and that I wanted a strong, able Gelding for
my Journey. And I desired him, as ever he would
do any thing for me, to furnish me with a Horse for
my Turn. <hi>Depend upon me,</hi> says he, <hi>and I will use
you, as if you were my own Brother.</hi>

               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>He leads me
into the Stable, and bids me take my Choice. At
last I pitch'd upon one that I lik'd better than the
rest. <hi>Well, Sir,</hi> (says he) <hi>I see you understand a
Horse; I know not how many People have been at me
for this Nag; but I resolv'd to keep him rather for a
Particular Friend, than to put him off to a Chance-Customer.</hi>
All this he Swore too; and so we
agreed upon the Price; the Money was paid;
and up got I into the Saddle. Upon the first s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out, my Steed falls a Prancing, and shews all
his Tricks; he was Fat and Fair, and there was
no Ground would hold him. But by that ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e I
had been some half an hour upon the way, he tyr'd
with me, so downright, that neither Switch nor
Spur could get him one Step further. I had heard
sufficiently of the Tricks of these Merchants, and
how common a thing it was for them to make a Jade
look Fair to the Eye, and not be worth one Penny
yet, for Service. So soon as I found that I was
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54880:104"/>
caught: <hi>Come</hi> (said I to my self) <hi>if I live to come
back again, I may chance to shew this Fellow yet a Trick

               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
with Necessity, and turn'd into the next Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
where I left my Horse privately with an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
I had there, and hired another in his
Stead. I pursu'd my Journey; return'd, deliver'd
up my hired Horse, and finding my own Jade in
as good Case as I left him, I mounted him again,
and so back to my Horse-Courser; desiring that he
might stand in his Stable till I call'd for him. He
askt me how he perform'd his Journey; and I swore
as solenmly to him, as he had done, to me, that I
never came upon the Back of a better Nag; and
so easy too, that me thought he carry'd me in the
Air; beside, that he was not one bit the Leaner for
his Journey. The Man was so far perswaded of
the Truth of what I said, that he began to think
within himself, that this Horse was better than he
took him for. Before we parted, he askt me if I
would put him off again; which I refus'd at first;
for in case of any occasion for such another Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
I could never expect to get the fellow of him.
Not that I would not Sell my very self, or any thing
else, for <hi>Money,</hi> if I could but have enough for't.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Aul.</speaker>
               <p>This was playing with a Man at his own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Briefly, he would not let me go, till I
had set a Price upon him. I rated him at a great
deal more than he cost me, and so I went my way.
By and by, I gave an Acquaintance of mine some
Instructions how to behave himself, and made him
a Confiden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of my D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sign. Away he goes to the
House, calls for the <hi>Horse-Courser;</hi> and tells him he
wants a Nag, but it must be a hardy one, for he
was upon a long Journey, and earnest Business. The
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54880:104"/>
Ostler shews him the Stables, and still commended
the Worst, but said nothing at all of the Horse
he had sold to me, upon an Opinion that he was
as good as I reported him. I had given my Friend
a Description of that Horse, and told him his very
<hi>Standing;</hi> and so he enquired, if that Horse (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to mine) were to be sold. The <hi>Horse-Courser</hi>
went on commending Other Nags in the Stable;
without any Answer to That Question. But when
he found that the Gentleman would have That
Horse or none, the Horse-Courser fell to reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the matter with himself. <hi>I was clearly mistaken</hi>
(says he) <hi>in this Horse; but this Gentleman under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
him better than I did:</hi> So that upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Pressing, whether he would sell him or no;
Well, says the Man, he may be sold, but 'tis at a
Swingeing Price; and so he made his Demand.
<hi>Why this,</hi> says the Other, <hi>is no great Price, in a Case
of Importance;</hi> and so they came at last to an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Gentleman giving a <hi>Dueate, Earnest,</hi> to
bind the Bargain. (The <hi>Horse-Courser</hi> set his Price
much higher than I had rated him, to make sure
of a Considerable Profit.) The Purchaser gives the
Ostler a Groat, and bids him feed his Horse well,
till he came back by and by to fetch him. So
soon as ever I heard that the Bargain was struck,
away go I immediately, Booted and Spurr'd, to
the <hi>Horse-Courser,</hi> and call my self out of Breath
for my Horse. Out comes the Master, and asks
what I would have? I bade him presently make
ready my Horse, for I must be gone immediately
upon Extraordinary Business. <hi>But</hi> (says he) <hi>you
bade me take Care of your Horse for some few days.</hi>
That's true, said I, but I'm surpriz'd with an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
wherein the King is concern'd, and there
must be no delay. <hi>You may take your Choice,</hi> says
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54880:105"/>
the Other, <hi>out of my Stables; but your Own is not
to be had.</hi> How so, said I? He tells me that he is
sold. Heaven forbid, said I; pretending to be in
a great Passion; for as the Case stands, I would
not part with him to any Man for four times his
Price. And so fell to wrangling about him, as if
he had undone me; and in the Conclusion, he grew
a little Testy too. <hi>There's no need</hi> (says he) <hi>of Ill
Language, you set a price upon your Horse, and I sold
him; and if I pay you your Money, you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to me: We are Govern'd here by Law; and you
cann't compel me to bring your Horse again.</hi> When I
had clamour'd a good while, that he should either
produce the Horse, or the Man that bought him,
the Man at last, in a rage, throws down the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
The Horse cost me <hi>Fifteen Crowns,</hi> and I sold
him for <hi>Twenty,</hi> he himself valu'd him at Two and
Thirty; and so computed with himself that he had
better make That Profit of him, than restore him.
Away go I, like one in sorrow, and not at all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifi'd
with the receipt of the Money; The Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
me not to take it Ill, and he would make me
an amends some other way. This was the <hi>Cheater
Cheated.</hi> His Horse is an Errant Jade; he looks
for the Man to fetch the Horse, that gave him the
Earnest, but that will never be.</p>

do That? I have met him over and over since.
He only complain'd that the Buyer never came to
take him away: but I have often reason'd the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with him, and told him 'twas a Just Judgment
upon him for selling away my Horse. This was a
Fraud so well plac'd, in my Opinion, that I could
not so much as confess it for a Fault.</p>

               <p>Nay, he is <hi>all That;</hi> but it is not
for any Mortal to be wise at <hi>all times,</hi> and to <hi>all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</hi>
And this Excellent Person, after all his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Qualities, has his weak Side, as well as his
Neighbours: His <hi>Beauty</hi> is not without a <hi>Mole;</hi>

               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>Whatever it is,
he has been of late strangely wrought upon by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>There was a Certain <hi>Priest</hi> that
went to him, saluted him with great respect, and
in this fashion accosted him: <hi>You will wonder, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
most learned</hi> Balbinus, <hi>at the Confidence of a
Stranger, to interrupt your thoughts in the middle of
your most Holy Studies. Balbinus,</hi> according to his
Custom, Nods to him, being, you know, a Man of
Few Words.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>An Argument of Prudence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>But the Other, as the wiser of the two, proceeds:
<hi>You will forgive this my Importunity,</hi> says he, <hi>when I
tell you what it was that brought me hither.</hi> Tell me
in short then, says <hi>Balbinus. I will,</hi> says the Other,
<hi>be as brief as possible. You know, most Excellent of
Men, that the Fates of Mortals are various; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say whether I should reckon my self among the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
or the Miserable; for looking upon my self one way,
I account my self most Happy; and if I look Another
way, I am of all Men the most Miserable. Balbinus</hi>
pressing him to contract his Business; <hi>I shall have
done Immediately,</hi> says he, <hi>most Learned</hi> Balbinus;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54880:107"/>
                  <hi>and I may the better shorten my discourse, because no
Man knows more of the Affair I am about to speak of,
than your self.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>You are drawing of an <hi>Orator,</hi>
rather than of a <hi>Chymist.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>We'll come to the
<hi>Alchymist,</hi> by and by. <hi>I have been so happy, you must
know, from a very Child, as always to have had a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for this Divine Study, I mean the</hi> Chymical Study;
<hi>which is indeed, the Marrow of all Philosophy.</hi> At the
Name of <hi>Chymistry, Balbinus</hi> a little rais'd himself,
that is to say, in <hi>Gesture;</hi> but then fetching a hearty
sigh, he bade him go on; and so he did. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
Man that I am!</hi> (says he) <hi>for not falling into
the right way. Balbinus</hi> demanded of him what way
he spake of: <hi>You know</hi> (says he) <hi>Incomparable, as
you are, (for what is there, my Learned Sir, that you
do not know) You know</hi> (I say) <hi>that there are two ways
in this Art; the One is called</hi> Longation, <hi>and the Other,</hi>
Curtation. <hi>Now it has been my hard Lot to fall upon</hi>
Longation. <hi>Balbinus</hi> asking him about the difference
of the ways: <hi>Impudent that I am,</hi> says he, <hi>to speak
all this to a person that knows all these things, no Man
Better. And therefore it is, that I have with all Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
address'd to you, that you would take pity upon me,
and vouchsafe to instruct me in the Blessed Way of</hi> Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<hi>The more knowing you are, the less will be
your trouble of Communicating your Help to me. And
therefore do not conceal so great a Gift of God, from your
poor Brother, that is ready to Die with Grief. Heaven
enrich ye with higher Endowments, as you assist me in this.</hi>
When <hi>Balbinus</hi> saw no End of this Solemnity of Obte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations,
he told him flat and plain, that he understood
nothing at all of the Bus'ness of <hi>Longation,</hi> and <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
from one end to the other; and therefore
desir'd him to explain the meaning of those Two
Words. <hi>Well, Sir,</hi> says he, <hi>tho I know I am now
speaking to my Master; Since it is your Pleasure to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54880:107"/>
me, it shall be done. They that have spent their
whole Life in This Divine Art, turn the</hi> Species <hi>of
things,</hi> two ways, <hi>the</hi> One <hi>is</hi> shorter, <hi>but somewhat
more</hi> Hazardous; <hi>the</hi> Other <hi>is</hi> longer, <hi>but</hi> safer. <hi>I
account my self very Vnhappy, that have hitherto la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
in that which does not so well agree with My Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;
and cannot yet find out any Man to teach me the
Other,</hi> which I am so passionately in Love withal.
<hi>But at length, Providence has put it into my Mind to
apply my self to You, as a Person Conspicuous both for
Piety and Learning. Your Knowledg instructs Ye to
grant what I desire, and Your Piety will dispose You to
aid a Christian Brother, whose Life is in Your Hand.</hi>
To make short with you, when this Juggler, with
this Simplicity of Discourse, had clear'd himself
from all suspicion of a Design; and gain'd Credit
for finding out one way, which was so Certain;
<hi>Balbinus</hi> began to have an Itch to be Medling; and
at last, when he could hold no longer, away with
you Methods (says he) of <hi>Curtation;</hi> for so far am
I from <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> that I never so much as heard
the <hi>Name</hi> of it. But tell me ingenuously, Do you
perfectly understand the way of <hi>Longation? Phy,
phy,</hi> says he, <hi>the Length of it makes it so Irksome; but
for the Knack of it, I have it at my Fingers Ends.
Balbinus</hi> askt him what time it would take? <hi>Too
much,</hi> says he, <hi>little less than a Year: but then 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi>
Never trouble your self for That, says
<hi>Balbinus;</hi> tho it should take up two Years, if you
can depend upon your Art. To shorten the Story.
They came to an Agreement, and presently fell to
work privately, in the House of <hi>Balbinus.</hi> Upon
these Conditions, <hi>That the One should do the Work,
the Other be at the Charge, and the Profit to be equally
divided;</hi> tho the Modest Impostor, of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
gave <hi>Balbinus</hi> the Benefit that came of it.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54880:108"/>
There was enterchang'd an Oath of Privacy, after
the manner of those that are initiated into Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Secrets. And now the Money is immediately
laid down for <hi>Pots, Glasses, Coals,</hi> and other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
for the furnishing of a <hi>Laboratory;</hi> and there
our <hi>Chymist</hi> has his <hi>Wenches,</hi> his <hi>Gamesters,</hi> and his
<hi>Bottles,</hi> where he very fairly consumes his Allowance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>This is one way however of changing the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balbinus</hi> pressing him to fall on
upon the Main Bus'ness: Do not you understand
(says he) that <hi>what's Well begun, is half done?</hi>
'Tis a great Work to get a good Preparation of
Materials. After a time, he set himself upon the
Building of a <hi>Furnace;</hi> and Here there must be <hi>more
Gold</hi> again; which was given, only as a <hi>Bait</hi> for
more to come; As One Fish is taken with Another,
so the <hi>Chymist</hi> must cast <hi>Gold In,</hi> before he gets <hi>Gold
Out.</hi> In the mean while, <hi>Balbinus</hi> keeps Close to
his <hi>Arithmetick. If Four Ounces</hi> (says he) <hi>brings
Fifteen, what will be the Product of Two Thousand?</hi>
When This Money was gone, and two Months spent,
the Philosopher pretended to be wonderfully taken
up about the <hi>Bellows,</hi> and the <hi>Coals.</hi> And when
<hi>Balbinus</hi> askt him how the Work went forward, he
stood directly Mute: But upon Redoubling the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
Why, says he, as all great Works do, the
main difficulty is the Entrance upon them. And
then he picks a Quarrel with the <hi>Coal; Here they have
brought</hi> Oak (says he) <hi>instead of</hi> Beech, <hi>or</hi> Hazle.
And there was a <hi>Hundred Crowns</hi> lost, that supply'd
him with more <hi>Dicing-Money.</hi> Upon giving him
<hi>New Cash,</hi> he provided <hi>New Coals;</hi> and then fell
to't again harder than before. As a Soldier that
has had a Disaster by Mischance, repairs it by his
Virtue. When the <hi>Laboratory</hi> had been kept warm
for some Months, and that they expected the Golden
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54880:108"/>
Fruit; and that there was not so much as one grain
of Gold in the Vessels (for the <hi>Chymist</hi> had wasted
all that too) there was another obstruction found
out. The <hi>Glasses</hi> they made use of were not of the
<hi>Right Temper;</hi> for as every <hi>Block</hi> will not make a
<hi>Mercury,</hi> so every <hi>Glass</hi> will not make <hi>Gold.</hi> The
further he was <hi>In,</hi> the lother he was to give it off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>That's the right humour of Gamesters, as if
they had not better lose some than all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis just
so. The <hi>Chymist,</hi> he swears that he was never cheated
since he was born before, but now he has found out
the mistake, he'l see to the securing of all for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and to the making good of this miscarriage
with Interest. The <hi>Glasses</hi> are <hi>chang'd,</hi> and the Shop
now a third time new furnish'd. The Philosopher
told him, that the Oblation of some Crowns to the
<hi>Virgin Mother</hi> might probably draw a Blessing upon
the Work; for the Art being sacred, it needed the
favour of the Saints, to carry it on with success.
This advice exceedingly pleas'd <hi>Balbinus,</hi> being a
Man of great <hi>Piety,</hi> and one that never past a day
without performing his Devotions. The <hi>Alchymist</hi>
undertook the <hi>Religious Office;</hi> but went no further
than the next Town, where the <hi>Virgin's</hi> Money went
away in <hi>Tipple.</hi> Upon his Return, he seem'd to have
great hope that all would be well, for the <hi>Virgin,</hi> he
said, was wonderfully Delighted with the <hi>Offering.</hi>
After a long time spent upon the Project, and not
one Crumb of Gold appearing, <hi>Balbinus</hi> Reasoning
the Matter with him, he protested that in all his days
he was never thus disappointed. That for his <hi>Method,</hi>
it was impossible That should deceive him; and that he
could not so much as imagin what should be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this Failing. After they had beat their heads a
long time about it, <hi>Balbinus</hi> be thought himself, &amp; askt
him if he had never mist <hi>Chappel</hi> some day or other?
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54880:109"/>
since this undertaking; or mist saying of the <hi>Horary
Prayers</hi> (as they call them) which might be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
perhaps, to defeat the whole Work. <hi>You have
hit the Bird in the Eye</hi> (says the <hi>Quack) Wretch that
I am: for I do now call to mind that I have once or twice
forgotten my self; and that lately, rising from Dinner, I
went may way without saying the salutation of the Virgin.</hi>
Why then, says <hi>Balbinus,</hi> 'tis no wonder that this
great Affair succeeds no better. Whereupon the
<hi>Chymist</hi> engages himself to hear <hi>Twelve Services</hi> for
the <hi>Two</hi> that he had <hi>omitted;</hi> and for that <hi>one Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
to become answerable for <hi>Ten.</hi> This lavish
<hi>Aichymist</hi> came to want money again; and when he
had no pretext left him for the asking of more, he
bethought himself of this Project; he went home,
like a man distracted; and crying out with a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Voice, Oh! <hi>Balbinus, I am undone, utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
My Life's at stake.</hi> This amazed <hi>Balbinus;</hi>
and made him extreamly impatient to know what
was the matter. <hi>Oh!</hi> says the <hi>Chymist, our design has
taken Air, they have gotten an Inkling of it at Court,
and I expect every hour to be carried away to Prison.</hi> This
put <hi>Balbinus</hi> into a fit too. He turn'd as Pale as
ashes (for you know, 'tis Capital with us, for any
man to practice <hi>Chymistry</hi> without the Princes Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense)
Not (says he) that I apprehend my being
put to death; for I should be glad it were no worse;
but there is a greater Cruelty that I fear, which is
(says he, upon <hi>Balbinus</hi>'s asking him the Question)
I shall be carried away into some remote Prison,
and be forced there to spend my Life in working for
those People I have no mind to serve. Is there any
Death now, that a man would not rather chuse,
than such a Life? The matter was then debated;
and <hi>Balbinus,</hi> that was a man well skill'd in <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi>
cast his thoughts every way, to see if it were
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54880:109"/>
possible to avoid this Mischief. <hi>Cann't ye deny the
Crime?</hi> (says he). Not possibly; (says the other)
for the thing is known at Court, and they have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Proof on't; and there's no defending of the
Fact, for the Law is point blank against it. When
they had turn'd it every way, without finding any
shift that would hold water, at last; <hi>We apply our
selves</hi> (says the <hi>Alchymist</hi> that wanted present mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney)
<hi>to slow Counsels,</hi> Balbinus, <hi>when the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
an immediate remedy. It will not be long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am seiz'd, and carried away;</hi> and seeing <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus</hi>
at a stand; <hi>I am as much at a loss</hi> (says he) <hi>as
you, for we have nothing now to Trust to, but to fall like
men of Honour: unless we should make Tryal of this one
Experiment, which in truth is rather Profitable than Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest;
but Necessity is a hard Chapter.</hi> Your <hi>Pursui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
you know, and <hi>Messengers</hi> (says he) <hi>are a
sort of People greedy of money, and so much the easier to
be brib'd to secresie. 'Tis against the statute, I must
confess to give Rascals money to throw away; but yet as
the Case stands I see no other retreat. Balbinus</hi> was
of that Opinion too; and laid down <hi>Thirty Crowns</hi>
to be offer'd them for a <hi>Gratuity.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>

               <p>This let me

            <sp>
               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>In an Honest Cause you should sooner have gotten
so many of his Teeth. This Provision did the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
some service; for the danger he was in was the
want of Money for his <hi>Wench.</hi>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>He's as quick, as any man, in all other Cases,

with <hi>New Money,</hi> and only the promise of a
Prayer to the <hi>Virgin Mother</hi> in favour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
a whole year was now run out, and still some
Rub or other in the way, so that all the Expence and
Labour was lost. In the <hi>Interim</hi> there fell out one
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54880:110"/>
most Ridiculous Chance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>What was That?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Chymist</hi> held a private Conversation with a
<hi>Courtiers Lady.</hi> The Husband grew jealous, and
watch'd him; and in conclusion having intelligence
that the <hi>Priest</hi> was in his <hi>Bedchamber,</hi> he went home
unexpected, and knockt at the door.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Why

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>Do? Why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he would do him the favour to cut his Throat,
or Geld him. The Husband threaten'd his Wife to
force the door, unless she open'd it. They quak'd
within, you may imagin, but considering of some
present Resolution, and the Case bearing no better,
they pitched upon This. The man put off his Coat,
and not without both danger and mischief, Crept
out at a narrow Window, and so went his way. Such
stories as these, you know, are soon spread; and it
quickly came to <hi>Balbinus</hi> himself, the <hi>Chymist</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
as much.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>There was no scaping for him,
now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>Yes he got better off here, than out at
the Window: And observe his Invention now.
<hi>Balbinus</hi> made no words on't, but it might be read
in his very Countenance that he was no stranger to
the talk of the Town. The <hi>Chymist</hi> knew <hi>Balbinus</hi>
to be a Man, at least <hi>Pious,</hi> if not <hi>Superstitious;</hi> and
People of that way are easie enough to pardon any
thing that submits, let the Crime be never so
great. Wherefore when he had done his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
he fell to talk of the success of his business,
Complaining that it did not prosper as usual, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his wish: Adding withal, that he did
infinitely admire what should be the reason of it.
Upon this discourse <hi>Balbinus,</hi> who otherwise seem'd
bent upon silence, was a little mov'd (as he was
easie enough so to be) It is no hard matter (says he)
to guess why we succeed no better. Our sins, our sins
lie in the way, for pure Works should only pass
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54880:110"/>
through pure Hands. At this word, the <hi>Projector</hi>
threw himself upon his Knees; and beating his Breast,
<hi>It is True,</hi> Balbinus, '<hi>tis True</hi> (says he with a deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Countenance and Tone) <hi>our sins hinder us, but
they are my sins, not yours; for I am not asham'd
to confess my Vncleanness before you, as I would before my
Father Confessor. The frailty of my Flesh overcame me,</hi>
Satan <hi>drew me into the Toil, and (Miserable Creature
that I am!) of a</hi> Priest <hi>I am become an</hi> Adulterer;
<hi>and yet the</hi> Offering <hi>that you presented to the</hi> Virgin
Mother <hi>is not wholly lost neither; for I had perished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably,
if she had not protected me; for the Husband
brake open the door upon me, and the Window was too
little to get out at. In the Pinch of this danger, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
my self of the</hi> Blessed Virgin; <hi>I fell upon my
Knees, and besought her, that in token of her acceptance
of the Gift she would now assist me in my distress. So
without any delay, I went to the Window again, my
Necessity lying hard upon me, and I found it by</hi> Miracle,
<hi>so enlarg'd, that I got through it, and made my escape.</hi>

the Impostor not to be Ingrateful to the
<hi>Blessed Virgin;</hi> nay there was more money laid down
upon this Jugglers Promise that he would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane

               <p>'Tis a long History, but I'le dispatch it now
in a word. When he had made sport Enough with
these Inventions, and wheedled <hi>Balbinus</hi> out of a
Considerable sum of Money; there came a person in
the Conclusion, that had known this Knave from a
Child: And he, easily imagining that he was now
upon the same lock with <hi>Balbinus,</hi> as he had been
elsewhere, goes privately to <hi>Balbinus,</hi> shews him
what a Snake he had taken into his Bosom, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54880:111"/>
vises him to get quit of him as soon as he could;
unless he had rather stay the Rifling of all his Boxes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>And did not <hi>Balbinus</hi> presently order the fellow
to be laid by the Heels?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>La.</speaker>
               <p>By the Heels? No, he
gave him money to bear his Charges away, and
Conjur'd him by all that was Sacred to make no
words of what had pass'd betwixt them; and truly
in my Opinion, it was wisely done, rather to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the Story, than to make himself a Common
Laughing-stock, and Table-talk; and to run the
Risque of a Confiscation besides; for the <hi>Chymist</hi>
had no more skill than an <hi>Ass,</hi> so that he was in no
danger, and in such a Case the Law would have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
him. If he had been charg'd with Theft,
his Character would have sav'd him from Hanging,
and no body would have been at the Charge of
maintaining him in Prison.</p>

               <p>Wisdom is a Knowledge that

with me in This, and I'le tell thee what thoul't ask
me. I am not asham'd of <hi>Your Order,</hi> but of the
<hi>Order</hi> that I was first of <hi>my self.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>What <hi>Order</hi> do ye
mean? That of that <hi>Franciscans?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>No, by no means
my good Friend; but the Order of the <hi>Spendthrifts.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>You have a great many Companions sure of that
Order.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>I had a good Fortune, and laid it on to
some tune as long as it lasted; but when that fail'd,
there was no body would know <hi>Apicius.</hi> And then
I ran away for shame, and betook my self to <hi>your
College;</hi> which I look't upon to be much better than
Digging.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>'Twas wisely done. But how comes
your Carcass to be in so good case of late? Your
Change of Clothes, I do not so much wonder at.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>How so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>Because <hi>Laverna,</hi> (the Goddess
of <hi>Thieves</hi>) makes many of her Servants Rich of a
sudden.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>You do not think I got an Estate by
stealing, I hope.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>Nay by <hi>Rapine</hi> perhaps, which
is worse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>No; neither by <hi>Stealing,</hi> nor by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine.</hi>
And this I swear by the Goddess you adore;
(That's <hi>Penia,</hi> or <hi>Poverty</hi>) But I'le first satisfie ye
as to my Constitution of <hi>Body,</hi> that seems to you so
wonderful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>While you were with us you were
perpetually <hi>Scabby.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>But I have had the kindest
Physician since.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>Who was That?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>Even
mine own self; and I hope no body loves me Better.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>The first time that ever I took you for a <hi>Doctor.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>Why all that <hi>Dress</hi> was nothing but a <hi>Cheat;</hi>
daub'd on with <hi>Frankincense, Sulphur, Rosin, Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,</hi>
and <hi>bloud-Clouts;</hi> and when I had a mind to't,
I could take it off again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! Impostor! And
I took thee for the very Picture of <hi>Iob</hi> upon the
<hi>Dunghill.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>This was only a Complyance with
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54880:116"/>
my Necessities, tho' Fortune sometimes may change
the very skin too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>But now you speak on't, tell
me a little of your Fortune: Have you found ever
a Pot of Money?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>No; but I have found out
a Trade that's somewhat better than Yours yet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>What Trade could you set up, that had nothing to
Being upon?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>An Artist will live any where.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>I understand ye. Picking of Pockets, I suppose;
the Cutpurse's Trade.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>A little Patience, I
pray'e; I am turn'd <hi>Chymist.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>A very <hi>apt Scholar,</hi>
to get That in a <hi>Fortnight,</hi> (for 'tis thereabouts
since we parted) that another Man cannot learn in
an Age.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>But I have found out a nearer way
to't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>What may that be?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>When I had
gotten up a stock of about <hi>Four Crowns,</hi> by Begging;
by great luck, I met with an Old Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mine, of about my Estate; we drank toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and (as 'tis usual) he up and told me the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of his Adventures, and of an <hi>Art</hi> he had got.
And we came at last to an Agreement, that <hi>if I pay'd
the Reckoning, he should teach me his Art,</hi> which he
very honestly perform'd, and <hi>That Art</hi> now is my
<hi>Revenue.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>Might not I learn it too?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>I'le
teach thee it <hi>gratis;</hi> if it were but for old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
sake.</p>
               <p>The World, ye know, is full of People that run
a madding after the <hi>Philosopher's Stone.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>I have
heard as much, and I believe it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>I hunt for all
Occasions of Insinuating my self into such Company.
I talk Big; and where-ever I find an Hungry Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
I throw him out a Bait.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>And how's that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>I give him Caution, of my own accord, to have
a Care how he trusts Men of That Profession; for
they are most of them Cheats, and Impostors; and
very little better than Pickpockets to those that
do not understand them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>This Prologue, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54880:116"/>
should never do your business.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>Nay I
tell him plainly that I would not be trusted my self
neither, any further, then a man would Trust his
Own Eyes, and Fingers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a strange Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
you have in your Art.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I will have
him to look on, while the <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> is a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to be attentive to't: and then to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all doubt, I bid him do the whole Work him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
While I'm at a distance; and not so much as a
little finger in't. When the matter is <hi>dissolv'd,</hi> I bid
him <hi>purge</hi> it himself; or set some <hi>Goldsmith</hi> to do
it: I tell him the Quantity it will afford; and then
let him put it to as many Tests as he pleases. He
shall find the <hi>precise weight;</hi> the <hi>Gold,</hi> or the <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Pure;</hi> (for <hi>Gold,</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> 'tis the same thing
to me: Only the Latter Experiment is the less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.)</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>But is there no Cousenage in all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>An Absolute Cheat form one end to the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot find where it lies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>I'll shew ye
then. First we agree upon the <hi>Price,</hi> but I touch
no Money, till I have given proof of the thing it self.
I deliver him a certain <hi>Powder,</hi> as if That did the
whole business. I never part with the Receipt of it,
but at an Excessive Rate: and then I make him swear
most horridly too, that for six Months he shall not
impart the Secret to any thing that lives.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>But
where's the <hi>Cheat</hi> yet?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>The whole mystery lies in
a <hi>Coal</hi> that I have Fitted, and Hollow'd for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
and into That do I put as much <hi>Silver,</hi> as I
say shall come out again. After the Infusion of the
<hi>Powder</hi> I set the Pot in such a manner, that it shall
be, in effect, <hi>cover'd</hi> with <hi>Coals;</hi> as well as <hi>Coals
Vnder,</hi> and <hi>about</hi> it; which I tell them is a Method
of Art. Among the <hi>Coals</hi> that lie <hi>a Top</hi> I put in one
or more that has the <hi>Gold,</hi> or the <hi>Silver,</hi> in't.
When that comes to be dissolv'd, it runs to the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54880:117"/>
rest, whether it be <hi>Tin,</hi> or <hi>Copper,</hi> and upon the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
'tis found, and taken out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>A Ready
way. But how will you deceive him that does the
whole Business himself?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>When all things are
done according to my Prescription, before we begin
the <hi>Operation,</hi> I come and look about to see that
every thing be right, and then I find a Coal or two
wanting upon the Top; and under pretence of
fetching it from the Coal-heap, I privately Convey
one of my own; or else I have it ready laid there
before hand, which I can take, and no body the
Wiser.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>But what will you do, when the Tryal
is made of This without ye?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>I'm out of danger,
when I have the Money in my Pocket: Or I can
pretend that the Pot was crackt, the Coals naught,
they did not know how to Temper the Fire; and
then it is one Mystery in our Profession never to stay
long in a place.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>But will the Profit of This
give a Man a Livelihood?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and a very
brave one: And if you are wise, you'l leave your
wretched Trade of <hi>Begging,</hi> and turn <hi>Quack</hi> too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>Now should I rather hope to bring You back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to Us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>What, to take up a Trade again,
that I was weary of before? And to quit a Good
one, that I have found Profitable?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>But This
profession of ours is made pleasant by Custome.
How many are there that fall off from <hi>St. Francis,</hi>
and <hi>St. Benedict?</hi> But ours is an <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Mendicants,</hi>
that never any man forsook, that was acquainted
with it. Alas! You were but a few Months with
us; and not come yet to Taste the Comforts of
This kind of Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>But I tasted enough on't
tho' to know the misery of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>How comes it
then that our People never leave us?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>Because
they are naturally Wretched.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>And yet for all
this Wretchedness, I had rather be a <hi>Begger,</hi> than
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54880:117"/>
a <hi>Prince:</hi> and there are many Princes I doubt not,
that Envy the Freedom of us Beggers. Whether
it be <hi>War,</hi> or <hi>Peace,</hi> we are still <hi>safe.</hi> We are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Prest</hi> for <hi>Souldiers,</hi> nor <hi>Taxt,</hi> nor put upon
<hi>Parish Duties.</hi> The <hi>Inquisition</hi> never concerns it self
with us. There's no secutiny into our Manners; and
if we do any thing that's Unlawful, <hi>who'l sue a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi>
If we assault any man, 'tis a shame to contend
with a <hi>Begger:</hi> whereas neither in <hi>Peace,</hi> nor in
<hi>War,</hi> are Kings at Ease. And the Greater they
are, the more have they to Fear. Men pay a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>Beggers,</hi> as if they were Consecrated to <hi>God:</hi>
and make a Conscience of it not to abuse us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>But then how nasty are ye in your Raggs, and Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>Those things are without us, and signifie
nothing at all to True Happiness: and for our Rags
'tis to them we Ow our Felicity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>If That be
your Happiness, I'm afraid ye will not enjoy it long.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>Because they say we shall have a
Law for every City to maintain its own Poor; and
for the forcing of those to Work, that are Able to
do it, without wandring up and down as they did
formerly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ir.</speaker>
               <p>How comes that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mi.</speaker>
               <p>Because they
find great <hi>Rogueries</hi> committed under pretence of

their <hi>Hands,</hi> as the <hi>Franciscans</hi> do the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>St.
Francis;</hi> and at That Rate, a <hi>Porter,</hi> an <hi>Ass,</hi> or a
<hi>Gelding</hi> may carry it as well as a <hi>Christian.</hi> There
are Others that carry it in their <hi>Mouths;</hi> and only
<hi>Talk</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel;</hi> and those are <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees.</hi>
And there are Others that carry it in their
<hi>Hearts:</hi> But those are the <hi>True Gospel-Bearers,</hi> that
have it in <hi>all Three;</hi> their <hi>Hands,</hi> their <hi>Mouth,</hi> and
their <hi>Hearts.</hi>

               <p>But where are those?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>What
do you think of those that Minister in the Churches;
that both Carry the Book, Read it to the People,
and Meditate upon it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>As if any Man could
carry the <hi>Gospel</hi> in his <hi>Heart,</hi> and not be a <hi>Holy Man.</hi>

               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Let us have no <hi>Sophistry.</hi> No Man carries the
Gospel in his Heart, that does not love it with all
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54880:120"/>
his Soul; and no Man loves it as he ought to do, that
does not Conform to it in his Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>These are
subtilties out of my Reach.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>I'le be plainer
then: For a Man to carry a Flaggon of Wine upon
his shoulders, it's a Burden.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>What if a Man swills a soup of Wine in his
Mouth, and throws it out again?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>He's never
the better for't: Tho' that's none of my way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>But to come to your way then: what if he Gulps
it down?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>There's nothing more Divine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>It warms his Body, brings his Blood into his Cheeks,
and gives him a merry Countenance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Most
Certain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>And so it is with the Gospel. He
that takes it affectionately into his Soul, finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
presently a New Man after it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>And you
think perhaps, that I do not lead my Life accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my Book.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>That's a Question only to be
Resolv'd by your self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I understand none but

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose any Man should
give ye the Lie to your Face, or call you <hi>Buffle-Head;</hi>
what would you do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>What would I do? Why
I'd give him a Box o'th' Ear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>And what if he
should give You another?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Why then I'd cut his

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>And yet your Book teaches you
another Lesson, and bids you Return Good for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:
and that if any body strikes you on the Right
Cheek, you should offer him the Left also.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I
have read some such thing, but I had forgot it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>I suppose you <hi>Pray</hi> often.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>That's too <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Long <hi>Prayers</hi> are <hi>Pharisaical</hi> indeed,
if they be accompanied with <hi>Ostentation.</hi> Now your
Book tells you that you should <hi>Pray always,</hi> but with
<hi>Intention.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but for all this I do Pray some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>At what times?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Sometimes when I

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>And what's your Prayer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Only once: For the Gospel

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Can you go through the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I never try'd That: Is it not enough that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell that God takes Notice
of any thing in Prayer, but the Voice of the Heart.
Do ye <hi>Fast</hi> often?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>No, never.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>And yet
your <hi>Book</hi> recommends <hi>Fasting,</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>And I should approve on't too, but my <hi>Stomach</hi> will
not bear it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>But St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that he's no
Servant of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that serves his <hi>Belly.</hi> Do
you Eat <hi>Flesh</hi> every day?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, when I have it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>And yet you have a Robust Constitution that would
live upon Hay with a Horse, or the Barks of Trees.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Gospel says that</hi> those things that go into
a man, do not desile him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>Neither do they, if
they be taken Moderately, and without giving <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.</hi>
But St. <hi>Paul</hi> that was a Disciple of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
would rather starve than offend a Weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and he exhorts us to follow his Example of

               <p>I'le tell ye, we had a certain <hi>Franciscan</hi> that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually

ye could see no Eyes he had: and was not this done
now like a man that loves the Gospel? After this,
I gave him Absolution, and knocking him over the
Coxcomb three times with this Book, I made three
Bunches upon his Crown, and so absolv'd him in
Form.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>This was <hi>Evangelically</hi> done, without

               <p>I met with another of his Fellows that

end, or Measure. My <hi>Gospel-Zeal</hi> mov'd me once
again, I brought him on his Knees, to this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
that <hi>what he said, was by the Instigation of the
Devil:</hi> I look'd upon him, like the Picture of <hi>Mars,</hi>
in a <hi>Battle,</hi> with my <hi>Partizan</hi> over him, to cut off
his head if he had not done it in point; and this
was acted in the Presence of a great many Witnesses.</p>

               <p>Ye say well; for I
find in the Prophecies of these times, that the
World's near an end.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ca.</speaker>
               <p>There's so much the

how does it appear that the world is so near an end?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Because People, they say, are now doing just as
they did <hi>in the days before the Flood; they are Eating
and Drinking, Marrying and giving in Marriage; they</hi>
Whore, they Buy, they Sell, they take to use, they
put to use, they Build; Kings make War; Priests
study to encrease their Revenues; Schoolmen make
<hi>Syllogisms;</hi> Munks run up and down the World, the
Rabble Tumult, <hi>Erasmus</hi> writes Colloquies: In fine,
all's naught; Hunger and Thirst, Robberies, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilities,
Plagues, Seditions, and a scarcity of all
things that are Good. And does not all this argue
now that the world is near an End?</p>

               <p>The very Point,

               <p>Now to confirm the World in their

from such and such Illustrious Persons, and there you
must be treated in a Stile of <hi>Honour,</hi> and with bus'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Estates, Castles, Huge Revenues, Commands,
Rich Matches,</hi> &amp;c. These Letters you must either
leave behind ye, or drop them some where by chance,
that they may be found, and taken notice of.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I can do that as Easily as Drink; for I'le Imitate any

               <p>Or you may leave them in

'twill be no secret. But then you must be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>The great Skill is, to have the

            <sp>

               <p>You must

do as well, if they be Servants) that shall stand
Cap in hand to ye, and make Legs to your <hi>Worship</hi> at
every Turn. And never be Discourag'd at the
Charge, for you'll find young Fellows enow that will
bear This part in the Comedy, if it were but for
the Humours sake, and for God a' mercy. And then
you must know that there are a great many Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Blades here, that are strangely infected with
the <hi>Itch,</hi> (I had like to have said the <hi>Scab</hi>) of <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;</hi>
And a Company of Hungry <hi>Printers,</hi> that will
Venture upon Any thing for Money. You must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
these People to make Honourable Mention of
your <hi>Quality,</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> in your <hi>Own Country,</hi> in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54880:124"/>
their <hi>Pamphlets;</hi> and your <hi>Name</hi> to be still set in

and <hi>Squandring,</hi> the Art of <hi>Borrowing</hi> and <hi>Bubbling,</hi>
and the <hi>French Pox</hi> to boot, there's no body will take
ye for a <hi>Person of Condition.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>These are Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
I have been train'd up to: but where's the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
that must carry me through?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>Hold a little,
I was just coming to That Point. Have ye any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>Truly a very small one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>Well but
when ye are once settled in the Reputation of a great
man, you can never fail of finding Fools to Trust
ye. Some will be afraid, and others will be asham'd
to deny you: And there are Tricks for a man to
delude his Creditors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>I know something of that
too. But they are apt to be Troublesome yet, when
they find that there comes nothing but Words.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>Nay on the Contrary, no man has his Creditors
more at Command, than he that ows <hi>Money</hi> to a
<hi>great many.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>How so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>Your <hi>Creditor</hi> pays
ye that Observance, as if he himself were the Person
Obliged; for fear ye should take any thing Ill, and
Cousen him of his Money. No man has his <hi>Servants</hi>
in such awe, as a <hi>Debtor</hi> has his <hi>Creditors:</hi> And if you
pay 'um never so little, 'tis as kindly taken as if you
Gave it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>I have found it so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>But then you
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54880:125"/>
must have a care how you engage your self to <hi>Little
people:</hi> For they care not what Tragedies they raise,
for Peddling Summs; whereas men of Competent
Fortunes are more Tractable: They are either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
by Good nature, led on by Hope, or kept
in order by Fear, for they know the danger of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with men of Power: Or in conclusion, When
ye are no longer able to stand the shock, 'tis but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of your Quarter, and still upon earnest bus'ness
removing from one place to Another: And where's
the shame of all this? for a <hi>Knight</hi> to be in the <hi>same
Estate</hi> with his <hi>Imperial Majesty.</hi> If you find your
self prest by a Fellow of mean Condition, you are to
bless your self at his Confidence: And yet 'tis good
to be paying of something; but neither the whole
Sum, nor to all your Creditors. But whatever ye
do, set a good Face on't, as if ye had Money in your
Pocket still, tho' the Devil a Cross.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>But what
shall a man brag of that has Nothing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>If you
have laid up any thing for a Friend, let it pass for
your own. But it must be taken notice of only as
by Chance. And in this Case, 'tis good to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Money, and shew it, tho' ye pay it again the
next hour. You may put <hi>Counters</hi> in your Pocket;
and 'tis but taking a <hi>Right Crown</hi> or <hi>two</hi> out, and
making the rest Chink: You may imagin—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>I
understand ye. But yet at last I must necessarily sink
under my Debt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>But Knights ye know, will
handle us as they please.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very true; and
there's no Remedy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>I would advise you to have
diligent Servants about ye; or no matter if it were
some of your poor Kindred: such as must be Kept
however. They'l stumble now and then upon some
Merchant upon the way; or find something per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in the Inn, in the House, or in the Boat, that
wants a Keeper. Do ye conceive me? Let 'em Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54880:125"/>
that men have not Fingers for Nothing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>If this could be done with safety.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>You must
be sure to keep them in <hi>handsome Liveries,</hi> and be
still sending of 'em with <hi>Counterfeit Letters</hi> to <hi>This
Prince,</hi> or <hi>That Count.</hi> Who shall dare to suspect
Them, if any thing be missing; or if they should sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
them, who shall dare to own it, for fear of
the Knight their Master? If they chance to take a
Booty by force, 'tis as good as a Prize in War; for
This Exercise is but a Prelude to war it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>A Blessed Counsellor!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>Now this <hi>Statute</hi> of
<hi>Knighthood</hi> must be ever observ'd, that it is Lawful
for a Knight upon the Road to ease a Common
Traveller of his Money. For what can be more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonourable
than for a Pitiful Fellow of <hi>Commerce</hi> to
have <hi>Money at Will,</hi> and a <hi>Knight want it</hi> to supply
him with Necessaries for <hi>Whores,</hi> and <hi>Dice?</hi> Be seen
as much as possible in the Company of Great men,
though you pin your self upon them. You must put
on a <hi>Brazen face;</hi> and especially to your <hi>Host;</hi> and
let nothing put ye out of Countenance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye should do well to pass your time in some Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Place, as at the <hi>Baths,</hi> or <hi>Waters,</hi> and in the
<hi>most frequented Inns.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>I was thinking of That.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>In such places you will meet with many fair Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>As how I beseech ye?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>You'l
find now and then a Purse dropt, or the Key left
in the door, or so; you Comprehend me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>But—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>What are ye afraid of? A Person that lives and
Talks at your rate; <hi>The Knight of the Golden Rock,</hi>
who shall presume to suspect Him, or however to
open his Mouth against him, at the worst? They'l
rather cast it upon some Body that went away the
day before. You'l find the Family in disorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, but do You behave your self as a person
wholly unconcern'd. If This Accident befalls a man
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54880:126"/>
that has either Modesty, or Brains, he'll even pass
it over without making any words on't; and not
cast away his Credit after his Money, for looking
no better to't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very well said; For I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

               <p>Yes, yes; why not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard of a certain
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> a Handsom Gentile Fellow that lodg'd at
his house; he carry'd away a matter of <hi>threescore
Pounds Sterling,</hi> and the <hi>Count</hi> had such a Reverence
for his Person, that he did not so much as open his
Mouth for the matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>So that there's a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.
You may send out a Servant now and then
for a <hi>Souldier,</hi> as ye see Occasion, and he falls in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rifling of a <hi>Church,</hi> or a <hi>Monastery;</hi> and
there's a <hi>Fortune</hi> made by the <hi>Law of Arms.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ha.</speaker>
               <p>This is the safest expedient we have had yet.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ne.</speaker>
               <p>Well, and there's another way now of raising Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>

               <p>When ye find People that have Money in their Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
'tis but picking a quarrel with 'em, especially

Gal. 6. The Brethren took their Brother upon their

               <p>You know,
first, that some People are so possess'd with Pride and
Vanity, that their Ambition accompanies them to the

be <hi>Bury'd</hi> with as much <hi>Pomp</hi> as they <hi>Liv'd.</hi> It is
not that the <hi>Dead feel</hi> any thing; but yet by the force

they are commanded to wear the <hi>Coat</hi> and <hi>Hood;</hi>
(for so say the <hi>Seraphiques</hi>) so that if they recover,
they are at Liberty in two respects. For neither does
That Vow bind, that is made by a man under an

               <p>Whether it be

it one; and God Almighty accepts of the Good

in This place, the Merit of a mans Dedicating
himself wholly to God, when he is no longer in his
own Power. Every Christian, as I take it, delivers
himself up wholly to God in his <hi>Baptism;</hi> when he
Renounces the <hi>Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and
Vanities of the Wicked World, and all the Sinful Lusts
of the Flesh, and lists himself a Souldier to fight under
Christ's Banner, to his Lives End.</hi> And <hi>St. Paul</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those that <hi>Die</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> that they may <hi>live</hi>
no longer to <hi>Themselves,</hi> but to <hi>Him</hi> that is <hi>Dead
for them,</hi> does not mean This of <hi>Monks</hi> only, but of
<hi>all Christians.</hi>

               <p>You have minded me seasonably
of our <hi>Baptism,</hi> but in times past, if they were but
<hi>Sprinkled</hi> at the <hi>last Gasp,</hi> there was hope yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
them of Salvation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis no great matter
what the Bishops promise, but it is a matter of great
uncertainty, what God will vouchsafe to Do: For if
there went no more to <hi>Salvation,</hi> than the <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:54880:130"/>
of a little <hi>Water,</hi> what a Gap were there o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to all sorts of Carnal Appetites, and License?
When men had spent their lives, and their strength
in Wickedness, till they could sin no longer, two or
three drops of Water would set all Right again.
Now if the <hi>same Rule</hi> holds in <hi>your Profession,</hi> and <hi>This
Baptism,</hi> it would make well for the Security of the
Wicked, if they might <hi>Live</hi> to <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Die</hi> to
<hi>Christ.</hi>

               <p>Why then the
<hi>Saints</hi> are <hi>worse natur'd in Heaven,</hi> than they were
upon <hi>Earth.</hi> We are told that <hi>St. Francis</hi> was of so
<hi>meek</hi> a Disposition, that when the Boys in the streets
would be playing the Rogues with his <hi>Cowl,</hi> as it
hung down at his Back, and throwing <hi>Milk, Cheese,
Dirt, Stones</hi> at it, the Saint walkt on <hi>Cheerfull,</hi> and
<hi>Pleasant</hi> without any Concern at all. And shall we
believe him <hi>Now</hi> then to be <hi>Chollerique,</hi> and <hi>Revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?</hi>
One of his Companions once call'd him <hi>Thief,
Sacrilegious, a Murtherer, an Incestuous Sot,</hi> and all the
Villains in the world. His Reply was only, that he
gave him thanks, and confess'd himself Guilty. But
one of the Company wondering at such an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment;
I had done worse than all this, says <hi>St.
Francis,</hi> if God's Grace had not Restrained me.
How comes <hi>St Francis</hi> now then to be <hi>Vindictive?</hi>

or more <hi>Patient</hi> than <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> when they
liv'd upon <hi>Earth?</hi> but now they are in <hi>Heaven,</hi> if
we do not worship them as we ought, what <hi>Diseases</hi>
do they send among us?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>For my own Part, I am
of Opinion, that they rather <hi>Cure our Diseases</hi> than
<hi>Cause</hi> them. But however, assure your self that
what ye say to me is spoken to a man that's neither

               <p>Go to then. I will tell ye
in Confidence, what I have heard as to this Matter:
Be it spoken without offence to <hi>St. Francis,</hi> or the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54880:131"/>
                  <hi>Society.</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ye know, was endu'd with a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found</hi>
and <hi>Hidden Wisdom,</hi> which he never <hi>publish'd;</hi>
but only <hi>whisper'd</hi> it in <hi>Private</hi> to those <hi>Christians</hi>
that were <hi>perfected.</hi> So have these <hi>Seraphiques</hi> certain
<hi>Mysteries</hi> also that they do not make <hi>Common;</hi> but
only communicate them in <hi>private</hi> to <hi>Rich Widows,</hi>
and other <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>Godly People,</hi> that are <hi>well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers</hi>
to the <hi>Society.</hi>

               <p>How do I long for the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>It was at first,
foretold by the <hi>Lord</hi> to the <hi>Seraphique Patriarch,</hi> that
the more the Society increased, the more Provision
he would make for them.</p>

               <p>So that at first dash

<hi>Patriarch,</hi> fearing now, that when the <hi>Good

               <p>Why, what a Merciful Providence was This now?

               <p>It was <hi>Reveal'd,</hi> in the <hi>Fourth place;</hi> that

            <sp>

               <p>Is there any more?</p>

               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>Why, ye have
heard Nothing yet. The <hi>Fifth Revelation</hi> was This:
That the Enemies of this <hi>Seraphique Order</hi> (as they
have but too many, the more's the Pity) should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
arrive at half the Age that God had otherwise
appointed them, without making away themselves;
but that they should all die miserable, before their
Times.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! we have seen many Instances of
This; as in the <hi>Cardinal Matthaeus,</hi> who had a very
<hi>Ill Opinion</hi> of this <hi>Society,</hi> and <hi>spake</hi> as <hi>hardly</hi> of them;
he was taken away, as I remember, before he was
<hi>Fifty years of Age.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very true; but then he
was an Enemy to the <hi>Cherubique Order,</hi> as well as to
the <hi>Seraphique;</hi> for he was the Cause, they say, of
burning the <hi>four Dominicans</hi> at <hi>Berne;</hi> when the
matter might otherwise have been Compounded with
the Pope, for a Summ of Money.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>But these <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans,</hi>
they say, had set up most Horrible Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which they labour'd to support by <hi>False Visions,</hi>
and <hi>Miracles;</hi> as that the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> was tainted
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54880:132"/>
with <hi>Original Sin;</hi> nay that <hi>St. Francis</hi>'s <hi>Prints</hi> of the
<hi>Five Wounds</hi> were <hi>Counterfeited:</hi> They gave out that
St. <hi>Catharin's</hi> were more <hi>Authentique.</hi> But the <hi>Perfectest</hi>
of all, they promised to a <hi>Layick Proselite</hi> they had
got, whom they made use of for this Action; abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Lords Body</hi> in the <hi>Government</hi> of this <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi>
even with <hi>Clubbs,</hi> and with <hi>Poyson.</hi> And they
say further, that this was not the Contrivance of one
<hi>Monastery</hi> alone, but of the <hi>Principals</hi> of the <hi>Whole
Order.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>Yes,
you shall have the <hi>Sixth Apocalyps;</hi> wherein the Lord
bound himself by an <hi>Oath</hi> to St. <hi>Francis,</hi> that all the
<hi>Favourers</hi> of This <hi>Seraphique Order,</hi> let them live
never so <hi>wickedly,</hi> should find <hi>Mercy</hi> in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi>
and <hi>end their days in peace.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Why what if they

               <p>That

make good.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>But what must a man do, to entitle
himself to a Right of being call'd Their <hi>Friend?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>What? Do ye question That? He that <hi>presents</hi> them,
he that <hi>clothes</hi> them, He that makes the <hi>Pot boyl,</hi> That
man gives Evidences of his <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>But does not
he love, that <hi>Teaches,</hi> or <hi>Admonishes</hi> them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>That's
<hi>water into the Sea;</hi> they have a great deal of This at
home: And it is their Profession to bestow it upon
<hi>Others,</hi> not to <hi>receive</hi> it <hi>from</hi> them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Our Saviour</hi>
promised more, I perceive, to St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s <hi>Disciples,</hi>
than ever he did to his <hi>Own.</hi> He takes That as done
unto himself, which for his sake one Christian does
to Another; But I do not find where he promises

               <p>That's
no wonder, my Friend, for the <hi>Transcendent Power</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is reserv'd to <hi>This Order.</hi> But ye shall
now hear the <hi>Seventh,</hi> and <hi>Last Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Let's

have it then.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>Our Saviour sware further, to St.
<hi>Francis,</hi> that <hi>no man should ever make an Ill end, that
dy'd in a Franciscan</hi>'s <hi>habit.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>But what is it that
you call an <hi>Ill end?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>When the <hi>Soul</hi> goes directly
out of the <hi>Body,</hi> into <hi>Hell;</hi> from whence there is no
<hi>Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>So that the <hi>Habit</hi> does not free a
Man from <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>No, not unless he dies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s <hi>day.</hi> But is it not a great matter, do
ye think, to be secur'd from <hi>Hell?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>The greatest
of all, no doubt. But what becomes of Those that
are put into the <hi>Habit</hi> when they are <hi>Dead already?</hi>
for They cannot be said to <hi>die</hi> in't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>If they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi>
it in their <hi>Life-time,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> is taken for the <hi>Deed.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>But I remember once in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> I was in the
Chamber with some Relations of a Woman that was
just giving up the Ghost. There was a <hi>Franciscan</hi>
by, (a very Reverend man) who observing the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to Yawn, and just upon her last Stretch, he put
one of her Arms into his <hi>sleeve,</hi> and so recover'd that
<hi>Arm,</hi> and part of the <hi>shoulder.</hi> There was a dispute
rais'd upon't, whether the <hi>whole Body</hi> should be <hi>safe</hi>
for't, or only <hi>That part</hi> which he had <hi>touch'd.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>There is no doubt, but the <hi>whole Woman</hi> was <hi>secur'd;</hi>
as the <hi>Water</hi> upon the <hi>Forehead</hi> of a <hi>Child</hi> makes <hi>the
whole Child a Christian.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a strange thing, the
dread that the <hi>Devils</hi> have of <hi>This Habit.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>Oh!
they dread it more than the sign of the <hi>Cross.</hi> When
the Body of <hi>Eusebius</hi> was carry'd to the <hi>Grave,</hi> there
were <hi>Swarms</hi> of <hi>Black Devils</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> as thick as
<hi>Flies;</hi> that would be <hi>buzzing</hi> about the Body, and
<hi>striking</hi> at it, but yet durst not <hi>touch</hi> it: I saw This
my self, and so did many others.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>But methinks
his <hi>face,</hi> his <hi>hands,</hi> and his <hi>Feet</hi> should have been in
<hi>Danger,</hi> because (ye know) They were <hi>Naked.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>Snake</hi> will not come near the <hi>shadow</hi> of an <hi>Ash,</hi> let
it spread never so far: Nor the <hi>Devil,</hi> within <hi>smell</hi> of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54880:133"/>
                  <hi>That Holy Garment;</hi> 'tis a kind of <hi>Poison</hi> to them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>But do not these Bodies putrifie? For if they do, the

               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>What
you say, is not improbable.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>How happy is the very

But while the Robe is going to the <hi>Grave,</hi> what is it
that protects the Soul?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>The Soul carries away
with it the Influence of the <hi>Garment,</hi> which preserves
it to such a degree, that many People will not allow
any of that Order to go so much as into <hi>Purgatory.</hi>

               <p>If this be true, I would not give this part of
the <hi>Revelation,</hi> for the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn:</hi> For
here's an easie, and a ready way cut out, without
<hi>Labour, Trouble,</hi> or <hi>Repentance;</hi> to <hi>live Merrily</hi> in <hi>This
world,</hi> and <hi>secure</hi> our selves of <hi>Heaven Hereafter.</hi>

               <p>And so it is.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>So that My wonder is over, at
the great Esteem that is paid by the World to this
<hi>Seraphique Order.</hi> But I am in great Admiration on the
Other side, that any Man should dare to open his

            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>You may observe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ye see them, that they are Men given over to a
<hi>Reprobate sense,</hi> and blinded in their Wickedness.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>I shall be Wiser for the future than I have been, and
take Care to die in a <hi>Franciscan Habit.</hi> But there
are some in this Age that will have Mankind to be
justify'd only by Faith, without the help of Good
Works: But what a Priviledge is it to be sav'd by a

               <p>Nay, not too fast, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecous.</hi>
It is not said, <hi>Simply without Faith;</hi> but it is
sufficient for us to <hi>Believe,</hi> that the things I have now
told ye were promised by our <hi>Saviour</hi> to the <hi>Patriarch</hi>
of the <hi>Order.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>But will this <hi>Garment</hi> save a <hi>Turk</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>It would save <hi>Lucifer himself;</hi> if he had the

               <p>Now I had thought that <hi>all Christians</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
the Rule of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> But if the <hi>Franciscans</hi>
be a <hi>Gospel Order,</hi> it looks as if <hi>all Christians</hi> were
bound to be <hi>Franciscans;</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> with his <hi>Apostles,</hi>

               <speaker>Th.</speaker>
               <p>It

               <p>There is something I must confess

a man of Credit too) that he was got drunk, and
fast asleep in the <hi>Franciscans Church,</hi> in the Corner
where the Women sit to make their <hi>Confessions;</hi> Upon
the singing of their usual <hi>Nocturns</hi> he awak'd, but
durst not discover himself. And when the <hi>Office</hi> was
over, the whole <hi>Fraternity</hi> went down into a place,
where there was a large <hi>deep Grave</hi> ready made; and
there stood <hi>two young men,</hi> with their hands ty'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them: They had a Sermon there, in praise of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;</hi>
and a promise of Gods Pardon for all their
sins; and not without some hope of Mercy from the
<hi>Brotherhood,</hi> upon condition, that they should <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi>
go down into the <hi>Pit,</hi> and lay themselves upon
their <hi>Backs</hi> there. So soon as they were down, the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were drawn up, and the Earth presently thrown
upon them by the <hi>Brethren,</hi> where they bury'd them
alive.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>But did the <hi>Polander</hi> say nothing all this

This?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Yes, they may; when the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi>
is in question: For see what came on't. This Man, when
he had made his Escape, told what he had seen, in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
where he came; which brought a great <hi>Odium</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Seraphique Order:</hi> And <hi>had it not been better now,

               <p>It may be it had.

               <p>This Injunction was <hi>moderated,</hi>
for <hi>two Reasons</hi> The <hi>One</hi> for fear they should tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Money</hi> at Unawares: The <hi>Other,</hi> for fear they should
<hi>catch cold,</hi> or take any harm by <hi>Thorns, Snakes, sharp

Dignity of the <hi>Injunction,</hi> the Rule is sav'd by a <hi>Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che:</hi>
For ye may see <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Foot naked</hi> through the

               <p>They value themselves much upon their Profession of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Perfection,</hi> which (they say) consists in <hi>Gospel
Precepts:</hi> But about those <hi>Precepts,</hi> the Learned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

               <p>And what a difference

               <p>The thing is manifestly true. But what

               <p>Well; But by what Secret Arts
hast thou preserv'd thy self in Health and Youth,
so long; without either Gray Hairs, or Wrinkles?
There's Fire and Spirit in your Eyes: Your Teeth

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Upon condition that

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I'll
do't with all my Heart; and therefore begin the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>GLYCION.</speaker>
               <p>I went directly into my own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and by that time I had been there about a year,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54880:142"/>
I began to bethink my self, what Course of Life to
chuse, as a matter of great importance toward my
future Peace. And so I cast my thoughts upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Examples, good and bad; some that succeeded,
others that miscarry'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>This was a point of
Prudence more then I expected; for you had none of
these sober Considerations about ye, when I knew
you at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>That was before I had <hi>sow'd my
wild Oats,</hi> as we say. But you must know, my
good Friend, that I did not do all this neither,
purely by my own <hi>Mother Wit.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I was indeed
a little surpriz'd at it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>The Course I took, was,
in short this. The first thing I did was to find out
a Person of the most general Reputation, for Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
Wisdom, and long Experience in the whole
Neighbourhood: and one that in my own Opinion
was the happiest of Men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Very discreetly
done.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>This Man I made my Friend and my

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>With a fair Portion, I hope.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>So so: But
in a competent Proportion to my own Fortune;
and just enough to do my business.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>

               <p>How so?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Il'e shew ye now. 'Tis the Practice of the World,
to <hi>Love</hi> before they <hi>Iudge,</hi> but I <hi>Iudg'd</hi> before I
<hi>Lov'd.</hi> Not but that I took this Woman more for
Posterity sake, then for any Carnal satisfaction:
And never a happier Couple under the Sun, for the
eight years, that we lived together, but then I lost
her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Had you no Children by her?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Yes,
<hi>Four;</hi> that, God be prais'd for't, are yet alive:
two Boys, and two Girls.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>And what's your

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Why
I have a publick Commission. It might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54880:142"/>
but there's Credit enough in't to secure me
from Contempt, and then 'tis free from vexatious
Attendances: which is as much as I ask; so long as I
have sufficient for my self, and somewhat upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to spare for my Friend; which is the very height
of my Ambition. And then I have taken care to
give more Reputation to my Office, then I have
received from it. I hope I have done well in't.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>At this rate of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
my Life has been long and easie to me, and I
am grown old in the Arms and good esteem of all
my Companions, and Friends.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But there's a

He that has no Enemies, has no Friends. Envy
never fayls to tread upon the Heel of Happiness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Right, if it be a splendid, pompous Felicity: But
in a state of Mediocrity, a Man's quiet and safe.
I have made it my perpetual Care and study, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to raise any advantage to my self, from the
Miseries, or misfortunes of other people. I have
kept as much as possible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the cumber of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
especially from invidious Employments, that
could not be discharg'd without making many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Nay, as near as I can, I would not disoblige
one man to help another. In case of any misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
I do what I can, either to excuse and soften
it, or to let it fall, without taking notice of it; or
else, with good Offices to set all Right again. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lov'd Squabbling and Contention; but where
there's no avoiding it, I chuse rather to lose my
Money then my Friend, upon the whole, I am for
<hi>Mitio's</hi> Character in the Comedy. I affront no
man; I carry a chearful Countenance to all. I sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
or resalute, with Heart and Good-will: I cross
no mans Inclination: I censure no mans purposes or
doings; I am not so Self-conceited, as to despise
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54880:143"/>
other people, and it never moves me, when I see
men over-value themselves. That which I would
have kept secret, I tell to no Mortal. I never was
curious into the Privacies of other Men; and if any
thing of that Nature came to my knowledge, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
blab'd it. 'Tis my constant Practice, either to
say nothing at all of the Absent, or to speak of them
with kindness and respect: For half the Quarrels in
the World take their Rise from the intemperance of
the Tongue. I have made it my Rule, never to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
Differences, or to heed them: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
so much as in me lay, either to moderate,
or to extinguish them. By these means I have kept
clear of Envy, and secur'd my self of the Affection
and Esteem of my Country-men.</p>

               <p>The sharpest

happy in the enjoyment of the common Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of our Children: but since Providence had
otherwise determin'd, Duty and Religion told me,
that Gods way was best for both, and that it would
be both foolish, and wicked to torment my self in

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54880:143"/>
some body else, in an Epigram under his Name) has
summ'd up the Evils or <hi>Inconveniences</hi> of humane
Life. And the Resolution is this: That <hi>it is best not
to be born.</hi> Now that Humour of <hi>Metrodorus</hi> pleases
me a great deal better, in his Abstract of the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi>
of Life. 'Tis a more comfortable Prospect,
and it sweetens the Disgusts, and weaknesses of Flesh

be transported with any violent <hi>Inclinations</hi> or <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:</hi>
and this secures me, whether my Fortune be

whether it be from the sense of an Indignity or

After Dinner I have a Collation of edifying
Discourse or Stories, or else some-body to Read
to me; and I never Plod at my Book above
an hour at a time. When that's over, I take
my Lute perhaps, and a walk in my Chamber,
either Groping it or Singing to't; or ruminating
it may be, upon what I have heard or read.
If I have a good Companion with me, I give
him part on't: and after a while, to my Book
again.</p>

               <p>Yes at first, but in a matter of four days he

               <p>When my Friends saw my
Father at last, upon the very point of Dis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting
me, they brought him to this Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that I should renounce the <hi>French Woman,</hi>
and Marry one of our own Countrey.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>There had past some
words in the <hi>Future Tense</hi> (as <hi>I will Marry ye,</hi>
for the purpose) but then, to say the Truth,
there follow'd <hi>Carnal Copulation,</hi> in the <hi>Present

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And how could you dissolve

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Why, it came out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,

               <p>So that you have a Wife, it seems.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes,

               <p>The

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54880:145"/>
the Name of <hi>Polygamus,</hi> was a Prophet. But they
were all Barren perhaps.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, I have a <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

               <p>So many

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>So much, that if my <hi>Eighth</hi> Wife

'tis hard, in my opinion, that a <hi>Man</hi> may not be

               <speaker>PAMPIRVS,</speaker>
               <p>I was no sooner return'd from
<hi>Paris,</hi> but the good Old man my Father prest me
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54880:146"/>
earnestly to enter into some Course of Life, that
might probably advance my Fortune; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a full Consideration of the matter, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
I should betake my self to the business
of a <hi>Merchant.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot but wonder, Why,
that choice rather than any other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I
was naturally curious to know New things; to
see several Countries, and famous Cities; to learn
Languages, and to inform my self in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
and Manners of Men. Now thought I,
this is no way better to be compassed, then
by Negotiation, and Commerce: besides a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
understanding of things, that goes along with
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well! But</hi> Gold it self may be bought too

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>It may so, but to be short. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
put a good Sum of Money into my hand to
begin the World withal: Wish'd me good Luck
with it, and gave me his Blessing. At the same
time, he laid out for a Rich Wife for me, and
pitch'd upon so Virtuous, and so Amiable a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
that she would have been a Fortune in her
very Smock to any honest Man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>

               <p>No, for before ever

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Wrack'd, I suppose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Yes, yes,

               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>No, no; this is forty times

               <p>No, but it is a place infamous for a thousand

               <p>So, and what was my Father I
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54880:146"/>
prethee; to trust a young Fop with such a gobb
of Money! But it was in fine, the Rock <hi>ALEA
Anglicé, The Devils Bones,</hi> that I was split upon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>And what did you do next?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Was your
Father so implacable then? For such a loss might
be made up again: and the first fault must be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
foul, not to be Pardonable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Why you have
Reason, perhaps. But in the mean while, the
poor Man lost his pretty Mistress; for so soon
as ever her Relations came to understand what
they were to trust to, they resolv'd to have
nothing more to do with me. Now I was in
Love, you must know, over Head and Ears.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>In troth, I Pitty thee with all my heart. But
what did you propose to your self after
this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Only to do as other people do in
desperate Cases. My Father had cast me off;
my Fortune was irrecoverably lost, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
my Wife: and the best Treatment I
could get in the World, was to be pointed at,
for a <hi>Debauche, squandring Sot.</hi> Without more
words, it was e'en come to Cross or Pile, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I should take up in a Cloyster or hang my
self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>You were cruelly put to't. But I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
you had the Wit to pitch upon the easier
Death of the two.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Or rather, the more
painful; so Sick was I, even of Life it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>And yet many people cast themselves into <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,</hi>
as the most comfortable State of living.</p>

               <p>Well! The first thing I did, was to put a

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and there was I made a <hi>Regular</hi> of that Order,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54880:147"/>
that wears <hi>Linnen above,</hi> and <hi>Woollen</hi> to the

               <p>Did you spend your Winter there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, two Months only, and then for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>How came it you staid no longer?
Did you take Check at any thing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>The
Discipline was not severe enough methought, for
a Wretch that hanging it self would have been too
good for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And how went Matters with you
in <hi>Scotland?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>I e'en chang'd my <hi>Linnen</hi> Habit
for <hi>a Leathern</hi> one, among the <hi>Carthusians.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>These are the Men that are in strictness of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
dead to the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>So methought,
by their Singing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Are the dead so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
then? But how many Months were you
there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Betwixt five and six.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>A strange
Constancy, to hold so long in a mind!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>You
took no offence at any thing among the <hi>Carthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
did ye?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>I could not like so Lazy, a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sort of Life. And then, what with Fumes,
and Solitude, I phancy'd several of 'em to be <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed:</hi>
and for my part; having but little Sense
already, I durst not stay, for fear of loosing the
rest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Whither did you take your next
flight?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Into <hi>France:</hi> among those that give
to understand by the <hi>Colour</hi> of their Habits, that
they are <hi>Mourners in this World.</hi> I speak of the
<hi>Benedictines:</hi> and of those particularly, that wear
a kind of a <hi>Netted Hair-Cloth</hi> for their upper
Garment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>A terrible Mortification of the
Flesh, I must Confess.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>I was among them,
<hi>eleven Months.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And how came you to
leave 'em at last?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I found they layd
more stress upon <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> then <hi>True Piety.</hi> And
then I was told that the <hi>Bernardines</hi> were a much
more conscientious Order, and under a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54880:147"/>
Discipline: Those I mean that are Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
in <hi>White,</hi> instead of <hi>Black.</hi> I went and liv'd a
matter of <hi>Ten Months</hi> among <hi>These</hi> too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And what Dusgusted you here now?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>I
dislik'd nothing at all: For I found them very
good Company. But I had an Old saying in
my head: That <hi>such a Thing must either be done,
or it must not be done:</hi> So that I was e'en Resolv'd,
either to be a <hi>Monk</hi> in <hi>Perfection,</hi> or <hi>no Monk
at all.</hi> I was told after this, that the Holiest
Men upon the Face of the Earth, were those
of the Order of <hi>St. Bridget.</hi> And these were
the People that I thought to live and dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>And how many Months were you with
them, I beseech ye?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Neither <hi>Months</hi> nor
<hi>Weeks;</hi> but in Truth <hi>almost Two Days.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>You
were mightily fond sure of this kind of Life,
to stay so long in't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>They take no body
in, you must know, but those that are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>profest,</hi> and I was not so mad yet, as to put
my Neck into such a Noose, that it could never
be got out again. And then the Singing of the
<hi>Nuns,</hi> put me out of my Wits almost, with
reminding me of my last Mistress.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Well!
And what after this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>My Heart was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set upon Religion, but yet upon this Ramble
from one thing to another, I could not meet
with any thing to my mind. But walking up
and down afterwards, I fell into a Troop of
<hi>Cross-Bearers.</hi> Some carry'd <hi>White Crosses;</hi> Others
<hi>Red, Green, Party Colour'd,</hi> some <hi>Single,</hi> some <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
some <hi>Quadruple;</hi> and some again, several <hi>Sorts,</hi>
and <hi>Forms</hi> of Crosses. I had a Reverence for the
<hi>Christianity</hi> of the <hi>Memorial,</hi> but I was confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54880:148"/>
which <hi>Form,</hi> or <hi>Colour,</hi> to make choice of,
before another. So that for fear of the worst,
I carry'd some of every sort. But upon the
whole matter, I found there was a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the <hi>Figure</hi> of a <hi>Cross</hi> upon a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and a Cross in the <hi>Heart.</hi> When I had
Hunted my self weary, and never the nearer my
Journies end; it came into my Head that a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> would do my Work. For
let a Man go to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a very Devil he comes
back a <hi>Saint.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>And thither you went then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Upon whose charge I prethee?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>That should have been your first Question.
But you know the Old Proverb. <hi>A Man of
Art will Live any where.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>And, what's <hi>your
Art,</hi> I beseech you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Palmistry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Where

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>What's that to

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Under what <hi>Master?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>The
great Master of <hi>all Sciences;</hi> the <hi>Belly.</hi> In lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
I set-up for a <hi>Fortune-Teller:</hi> And there
did I lay about me, upon the <hi>Topique</hi> of things
<hi>Past, Present,</hi> and to <hi>Come.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Upon good
grounds, I hope.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>The Devil a bit that I
knew of the matter: But I set a good Face
on't, and ran no <hi>Risque</hi> neither: For I was paid
still before hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>That ever so senseless
an Imposture, should find a Man Bread.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>And yet so it is, that I maintain'd my self, and
a Brace of <hi>Lacquies,</hi> very decently upon the
Credit of it. Why, how should <hi>Knaves</hi> live,
without a World of <hi>Fools</hi> of both <hi>Sexes</hi> to
work upon? So soon as I got to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> I put
my self into the Train of a Rich Noble-Man,
of about <hi>Seventy Years of Age,</hi> that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54880:148"/>
have Dy'd in Peace, he said, if he had
not blest his Eyes with the sight of that Holy
Place.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>He had no Wife, I hope to leave
behind him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and six Children into
the bargain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>A most Impious, Religious
Old Man! But you came back I suppose, a Man
of another World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>No, but to deal plainly
with you, somewhat worse then I went.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>So that your Zeal for Religion was cool'd, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, on the contrary, hotter then
e're it was. And therefore, I return'd into <hi>Italy,</hi>
and apply'd my self to a <hi>Military</hi> Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>You sought for Religion in the <hi>Camp</hi> it seems:
the most unlikely place under the Heavens, to
find it in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but it was a <hi>Holy War.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Against the <hi>Turks,</hi> perchance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, a <hi>Holier</hi>
War then that; or the Doctors were <hi>besides the
Cushion.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>How so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>It was the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Iulius the Second,</hi> and the <hi>French.</hi> And then
I had a phansie to a <hi>Souldiers Life,</hi> for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it gives a Man of the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>It
brings a man to the <hi>knowledge</hi> of many things,
that he had better be <hi>Ignorant</hi> of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>I found it so
afterwards, And yet I suffer'd more hardship in
the <hi>Field,</hi> then in the <hi>Cloyster.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Well and
where were you next now?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I was
thinking with my self, whether I should back
again to the business of a <hi>Merchant,</hi> that I had
laid aside; or press forward in the pursuit of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
that fled before me. While my thoughts
were in this Ballance, it came into my mind,
that I might do both under one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>What?
And set up for a <hi>Merchant,</hi> and a <hi>Monk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

They flie over Sea and Land. They see, they

               <p>I lik'd them all well enough if I
might but presently have enter'd upon Practice,
and Commerce. But when I found, that I was to
be slav'd a long time to my Offices in the
Quire, before I could be qualified for the
trust; I began then to cast about, how I
might get to be made an <hi>Abbot.</hi> But said I to my
self, <hi>Kissing goes by favour,</hi> and 'twill be a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Work; and so I quitted that thought too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
After some <hi>Eight Years</hi> trifled away, in shifting
from one thing to another thus, comes the
News of my Fathers Death: So home I went;
took my Mothers advice, Marry'd a Wife, and
so to my first course of <hi>Traffique</hi> again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>Well!
And how did you behave your self, in your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
shapes; for every <hi>New Habit,</hi> made you
look like a <hi>New Creature.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>Why 'twas all

               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>But be so
Honest now, as to tell me, only which is the
condition, in this Variety of Adventures, that is
most to your liking?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>So many Men, so many
minds.</hi> But to be free with you, that of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
is most agreeable to my inclination.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>But yet there are great Hazzards and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54880:149"/>
that attend it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>There are so; and
'tis the same Case in any other State of Life.
But since this is my Lot, I'll make the best
on't. <hi>Eusebius</hi> his turn is yet to come, and I hope
he will not think much of obliging his Friends,
in requital with some part of his History.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, if you please, the whole Course of it is
at your service.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>When I left <hi>Paris,</hi> It took
me a Years time at Home to consider, what
course of Life to settle in: And not without a
strict Examination of my self, to what Study or
Profession I stood most inclin'd. I was offer'd a
good handsom <hi>Prebendary,</hi> as they call it: And
I accepted it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gl.</speaker>
               <p>That sort of Life has no great
Reputation among the People.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>But, as the
World went, it was to me very welcome. It was
no small Providence, to have so many advantages
fall into a Mans Mouth upon the suddain, as if they
had been dropt from Heaven; as Dignity, Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Houses well furnish'd, a competent Revenue,
a Worthy, and a Learned Society: And a Church
at hand, to serve God in, when he pleases.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pa.</speaker>
               <p>I was Scandaliz'd at the <hi>Luxury</hi> of the Place; the
Infamy of their <hi>Concubines;</hi> and the strange Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
those People had for Letters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis
nothing to me, what others do, but what I do
my self: And if I cannot mend the Bad, I chuse
the best Company however, that I can get.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>And is this the condition that you have spent your
whole time in?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>All but some Four Years, a

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>And what did you

there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>I Studied <hi>Physick,</hi> a Year and half;
and <hi>Divinity</hi> the rest.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eu.</speaker>
               <p>For the
sake both of my Soul and Body; and that in
both Cases I might be helpful to my Friends. I
Preach't upon occasion too, <hi>according to my Talent.</hi>
Under these circumstances, I have led a Life, easie
and quiet enough: So well satisfied with one Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice,
that I did not so much as wish for any thing
beyond it; and if another were offer'd me, I should
refuse it.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I wonder what's become of the rest of

               <p>I could
say somewhat of <hi>Them</hi> too, but we are just at the

in the same Inn, and talk o're the rest at

Where did you take up this Rubbish? (<hi>Harry</hi> a

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hugh:</speaker>
               <p>You would do well

               <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
               <p>But 'tis not so long Sirrah, since I
saw you throw <hi>half a Dozen Carthusians</hi> in the Dirt
tho': And you like a <hi>Schellam,</hi> stood Grinning, and
making sport at it when you had done, to see them
Rise <hi>Black Carthusians,</hi> instead of <hi>White Ones.</hi>

               <p>And they were well enough serv'd too: For they lay
