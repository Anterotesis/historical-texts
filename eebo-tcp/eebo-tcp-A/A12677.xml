            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>True it is, that after my departing from you (which was on Michelmas day (if I forget not) my passage was with good speede to Holland, and thence also with no lesse opportunitie to
<pb facs="tcp:2413:4"/>
Spaine, for that finding good occasion of imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation my haste, was the greater and so I ariued in Calliz of Andaluzia, by the end of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, from whence passing within two or three dayes to the porte of S. Maries (which is but one or tvvo howers sayling by water as you know) I had fitt occasion to informe my selfe very particularlie of the first pointe whereof we had hard so much in Ingland, and I promised to write you the truth to witt of the publique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of so many Inglish Soldiars to the Catholique Romaine faith, as were at that tyme detayned prisoners in the Gallies of Spayne, which gallies commonly for the winter tyme doe reside in this porte of S. Maries as fittest of all Spayne for that purpose to resist the incursion of the moores. And for that this was the first matter wherof you and I talked and disputed so much in Ingland vppon the vncertaine relations that Souldiers brought vs thither from Spayne, you suspecting the matter to be feigned and I thinking the contrary; I shal first assure you in this that the whole hapned as we were informed, to witt, that aboue nyntie Inglish, partlie cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines, <note place="margin">Nynty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glis men reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Spayne.</note> and officers and partlie marchaunts and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Souldiers, who had byn very resolute a long tyme in their religion, and had oftentymes affirmed to the Adelantado their general and other Captaynes and frendes which dealt with them in that behalf, that they would rather dye then relent therin, yet afterwardes vppon three or foure dayes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference with an Inglish father
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2413:4"/>
or two of this side, they offered al most willingly to chainge their opinions and become catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, and that at such a tyme, when as they saw themselues out of al dainger if they would haue continued in the contrary, for that they had now this kings warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, both for their liues and liberties, and that the inquisition should in no wise touch them for their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which I doe ad to the end you may not thinke parcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that they did it for feare, but rather of their owne free vvil and electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, professing themselues with teares and extended handes (as heer most cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diblie it vvas tould me) that theyvvere, all most fullie satisfied, persuaded &amp; conuinced, &amp; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently desired with, earnest request to be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Catholicke Romaine fayth and church; and so they were, euery one being first confessed of all his life past, and afterward al to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in solemne procession vvere caried to the great church of the port, &amp; there hard masse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, vvith extraordinary shew of contrition and repentance for the tyme past, &amp; masse being ended, they al receaued the holy Sacrament of the aulter most deuoutly, &amp; the Adela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tado with diuers other noble men kinghts and Captaines were communicated with them, for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and deuotion: &amp; that ended, the Adelantado (vvho is a most noble and honorable gentleman and affected excedingly to the Catholiques of your nation) had them all home to his owne house, &amp; gaue them a ryall dinner himselfe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">A dinnet made to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>By al which you may see, if you wil (my good Sir) that it is true vvhich so offen I haue vrged <note place="margin">A consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration vppon the former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> uersion.</note> vnto you and others not greatly learned, who are so determinate in your opinions without knowing the groundes wheron you sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or at least not those vvherin others doe founde them selues, or vvhat truly may be said vvithout heate of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the one or agaynst the other, so if (I saie) you would be content but only to heare and examine the matter and confer with some learned of the other side vvith indifferent desire to know the truth &amp; to acknowledge it when in conscience you should discouer the same; it vveare an easie matter to come to that vnion so much desired, as many haue do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, which sincer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vvith christian disposition before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned haue bine content to treate of this affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. but others as your selfe and some friends of ours ther with you are vvont to apprehend so vehementlie euery new opinon that you fall on, as ther is no reason or argument, may be hard to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2413:5"/>
the contrary &amp; so no maruaile though you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine still with your owne perswasions. And so much by this occasion against you good Sir, and novv to the course of my narration againe.</p>
            <p>From the porte of S. Maries I vvent to Siuil agaynst Christmas and in the vvay I passed by <note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish hou se and Church of S. George in S. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars.</note> S. Lucars vvher I founde the Inglish Church of S. George appartayning in tymes past vnto the Inglish marchantes (vvhich is an other poynte also vvher of you desired to be informed) deliuered vp into the handes of Inglish Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary priests, together vvith all the houses, groundes, and other emoluments belonging therunto, and it seemeth that the place hath gotten much by this chainge, for that the same church (which I knevv some yeares ago while it was in your marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts handes) much in decay, is now very vvel repaired and kept in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and fayre habitation is in buylding about it, vvhich they say shal serue, not only for the priestes to lye therin, but also for the marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the Inglish nation, to make ther assembly vvhen occasion is offred, and to these buvldings and reparations not only the Duke of Medina Sidonia Lord of the towne, and the Cardinal of Siuil metropolitan of the place, doe giue their fauours and assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the recouery of all such commodityes as euer belonged to that Church and house, but the King also himselfe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other fauours gaue them two thousand Crownes in money tovvards the said buylding this yeare past, and so it is like to be one of the
<pb facs="tcp:2413:6"/>
fayrest houses and churches that is in the vvhole city of S. Lucars.</p>
            <p>This house is to serue principally for a resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note place="margin">Residèces of Inglish Priests in Libon &amp; in the por te of S. Maries.</note> of Inglish Priests as I haue said, and there is a Doctor of diuinity of your nation prouost therof at this present, and there end is as I am informed not only to keepe vp and serue that house and Church, but also to intertaine such Inglish, as passe in and out to the Seminaries. For vvhich cause also the Duke of Medina Celi lord of the porte of S. Maries is about to erect au other reside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce like to this in that his tovvne; and an other ther is alredy erected in Lisbone, &amp; an Inglish graue Priest. Superiour therof vvith great probability to haue a Seminary also and colledge of Inglish students in that city short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as al ready ther is one of Irishmen and an other of the same nation in Salamanca stirred vp therunto by the example of the Inglish.</p>
            <p>But to passe forwards in my iourney I arriued <note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish hou se and Seminary in Siuill.</note> about Christmas at Siuil vvher I found a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inglish Seminarie newly begone &amp; brought to such perfection as in two monethes only ther weare almost fiftie persons in the same, and the said Colledg is placed in the middest and best situation of all the towne, and so vvel setled and prouided for euery vvay as if they had byn ther many yeares: for that the good vvil and affection of the people toward them, is exceeding greate, and they seeme to be rauished as it vvere vvith a kinde of admiration of them, to see so many Inglish tender youthes, al bred and borne in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2413:6"/>

            <p>An other day vvas the feast of S.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by one <hi>Don Alonso de Columna,</hi> brother to the general of the Kings galleons. Two Sermonos vvere made bv two Inglish scollers, the one in Latine, towards the midle of masse, after the gospel which indured about au houre, the other in spanish after the masse vvas done, which Was somvvhat shorter, but I can assure you that both the preachers acquitted théselues in such order, as they gaue vvonderful contentement &amp; drew many teares from the hearers, as I can be witnes, and I must nedes confesse, also that al beit I be not harde to persuade my selfe vvel of Inglish men as you may gesse yet easely should I not haue beleued that your countrymé could so vvel haue framed themselues, to giue satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

in other countryes if I had not seene and hard this my selfe, though alwaies I haue knowne Inglish mens talents and abilityes to be great, vvherunto soeuer they list to apply themselues.</p>
            <p>Thus passed that day vvhich vvas the 29. of December and fift day of Christmas, vvherin <note place="margin">S.

Iohn, vvher Christ setteth downe the difference betwene the good shepheard &amp; the bad, for that the bad shepheard and hireling runeth avvay vvhen he seeth the vvolfe comming to deuoure his sheep, but the true shepheard stayeth &amp; sticketh to the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of his sheep, and offreth his life for the same if need be, as our Sauiour sayeth in thes wordes. <hi>Bonus Pastor animam suam dat pro ouibus suis</hi> the good Pastor giueth his life for his sheep.</p>
            <p>These vvordes the first of the tvvo scollers that preached in Latin, tooke for his theame, &amp; applyed them to the present feast of S. Thomas, vvhich he said did appertaine to euery seueral sort and degree of people there present, and that
<pb facs="tcp:2413:8"/>
for diuers perticular reasons vvhich he touched in his preface, vvhich preface for that it setteth foorth the great variety of honorable personages that vvere at his sermon, I shall not omit to put it downe here vvord for vvord as it vvas vttred &amp; that also in Latine, although you be no great Latinist, but I shal take payn also to put the same in Inglish. Thus then he began vvith as much commelynes, grace of speach, and feruour of spirit, as euer I remembre to haue hard any man in my life before.

                        <p>Hitherto is the lettre of the greate Turke vnto your Queene, that is to say, of that greate proude and barbarous enemy of Christes holy name and religion, wheruppon this <hi>Dydimus</hi> doth deduce dyuers considerations of importance &amp; consequence, as namly first of al, about religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note place="margin">Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations vppon the Turkes letter.</note> and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, saying who would haue thought when Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pretence of purer seruing of Christ, did first seperate it selfe in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest of Christian kingdomes, that it would haue come in so few yeares, to that passe, as to make recourse to Christes open enemye &amp; persecutor, &amp; that agaynst Christians? as also that for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of some one Christian Prince, to seke to put into Christes enemyes handes, so many millions of his subiects as are in Spayne? and to put in hazard al Christendome besides.</p>

                        <p>The second consideration is of wisdome and pollicy te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral, for what wisdome or pollicy in the world can ther be in this, sayeth he (though we set a side al feare of God and religion) to call so potent an enemye as the Turk is, into Spayne, or to thinke that he would be a better frend to the state and subiects of Ingland, that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, then the king of Spayne, that is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, or to imagin that when Spayne should be lost, Ingland could be safe, or when this ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tyrant should haue enthralled the spai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards,

he would suffer the Inglish to liue at their liberty? was not Constantinople? was not Africa and many other realmes lost from Christianity by this most diuelish and miserable enuy, of one realme and Prince agaynst a nother.</p>
                        <p>A third consideration is of honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which seemeth excedingly to be touched and distayned by many poyntes in this lettre discouered, for what a thing is it sayeth he, that Ingland which was wont to be a kingdome of so great honour, nobility, and valor in kingly proceding, should now come to make such a narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the great Turke, as here is set doune, by the tyrants owne letter, to witt, that the kinge of Spayne meant to make him selfe lord of al Christedome, and monarch of al the world; that he hath taken Portugal by violence from <hi>Don Autonio</hi> the lawful king, &amp; lawfully created, vvheras al the world knoweth that the Kings title to Portugal was decided by the lawes of that kingdom it selfe, and by the approbation of the last king Cardinal of the same, vvho also pronounced <hi>Don Antonio</hi> for an open knowne bastard, vvhom all the nobility afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused and no man euer created him king, but only a few of his owne seruants and some other of the baser vulgar people sollicited by them in Lisbone and other partes neare ther about: and yet that Ingland to the Turke should aduoutch him playnly for a lawful king and put out by violence, exhort the Turke to restore him by his forces according to the custome of his noble

Or if they had persuaded her grace to haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the religion of Caluin plainly and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely as he taught and exercised thesame, then had they entred therby into communion and frenship vvith Geneua and diuers others states of Swizerland, as also vvith the Princes of the religion, called the reformed in France Flanders and Scotland, and by thes meanes, at least had they gayned some new party to be assured to our realme, by this band and vnion of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the strongest and most durable of al other.</p>

at that tyme, to serue fitly their turnes for to put downe the old, and bring al matters into their owne handes, to place new bishops, Deanes, Atchdeacons and other like dignityes vnder the name of the Queene: yet was it most dangerous and preiudicial to the weal publique, in that it was peculiar, solitary and differét from al other, as hath bin declared, and consequently must needs expect a perpetual warr and contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that, not only at the catholiques handes, but much more and sharper at the other two parties aboue named, if the catholique party could be extinguished, so as the laberinth of Inglish state and religion, seemeth hereby to be inextricable, and much approued was the saying of <hi>S.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2413:28"/>
but only to inuite them with rewards of preferment: it is very like that matters had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as quietly this day in Ingland as they do in Germany, where al are quiet, and the princes safe, and little contradictions or falling out for such affayres. And seing that Inglish men do come of Germayne race, it may be they would haue followed them in this poynt also, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer that be, most likely it is that matters had neuer come to those open broyles, hatreds and mortal enimyties that now they are come vnto in Ingland: for men being not pressed, many would haue had little care of being zelous or heddy on eyther part: &amp; preferment only would haue moued infinite people to follow that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might haue profited: and others not stinged or compelled to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, would haue remayned doubtful, but yet quiet in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations, what way to follow, and so should her Maiesty haue bin serued of al, and hated of none, and aduauncments sufficient would haue remayned for al such as would haue bin fotward in that her Maiesty had most fauored.</p>
                        <p>But now by this other course, that hath bin taken, of tormoyling, tormenting, and beating men to their religion, the state is growne to be both odious a broad, and dangerous at home, and not durable. First, for that as the poet saveth. <hi>Nitimur inuetitum semper,</hi> mans natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to esteeme and desire that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him, and to reiect that, which is thrust vppon him by viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But yet in no one thinge
<pb facs="tcp:2413:29"/>
so much is this seene, as in matters of religion, which of al other affayres, is the poynt that most requireth liberty, both of iudgment and will, &amp; least beareth the force of strayning: and so we see by experience, that her Maiesty at the beginning, entering and raigning for some yeares with mildnes, found no difficulty, (to speak of) on any part though at her entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the whole real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me was, settled in an other religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. but now after twenty yeares pressing men with restraints, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonments, losse of goodes and liues, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is founde euery day more greater of them, that openly make resistance, and do lesse respect and reuerence both prince law and gouuerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and so euery day wilbe more and more, both of Catholiques and puritans for the reasons afore said. Which thing certayne pollitick councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of, Iulian the Emperor surnamed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata obseruing by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of al the rigorous courses of former Emperors before hym, they persuaded him to change that course of forcing, into alluring, and so he did, and wrought more effect in few yeares by that meanes, then the other had done by the contrary in many, and would (no doubt) haue done much more, if his life and reigne had not bin so short.</p>
                        <p>To this discourse said one of the company, if <note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> this be so, how then do catholiques vse rigor in punishing them that are not of there religion, and do preuaile therin, as we see by experience of Spayne and other countryes, wherofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes thes new religions beginning to budd vp haue

bin kept downe and vtterly extinguished by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
                        <p>To this answered an other saying, they wil <note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvere.</note> saye that the cause of this is the truth of their religion, and the falshood of the other, &amp; that it is peculiar to their religion, by promise of Christ, to endure for euer, and triumph ouer al sects: but for that this is not graunted by al but remayneth in dispute, (I wil quoth he) yeald an euident difference heerof in pollicy and reason, which is, that Catholique Princes which by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and punishment, haue extinguished other religions, and sects that began to spting vp in there realmes, did take thos new blossomes at the begining whiles they were yet grene, and not wel setled and their followers not many, &amp; so I do confesse that all religions may be rooted out, sauing only the trew which Christ himselfe defendeth, and so many do thinke that if Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the Emperor had apprehended Luther at his first seing him in <hi>Augusta,</hi> (as many of his counsel perswaded him) he had crushed perhapps his doctrine in the very kyrnel, and the like may be said of Caluin and Beza, as also perchaunce of the puritans in Ingland if rigor had bin vsed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them at their first rising: though this last of the Puritans be very doubt ful, for that their foundation being (as after shalbe shewed) the very doctrine it self that by publique authority is set forth, taught, and maynteyned now in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: it must needes continually rise out of the same, as the heate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fyer so as it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to nourish the one &amp; extinguish the other.</p>
                        <p>As for the Catholiques in Ingland, the reason <note place="margin">Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques not easely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed.</note> is far different, for they being no new beginers but old possessors of the realme, they vvere so many at her Maiestyes first entraunce to the crowne, as they could not wel be al extinguished together, except the land should haue bin left wast, nor can be easely at this day extinguished by force in any reason of state or probability that I can see: for I do not comprehende those only by this name, which are recusants and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vnto the world (for those might easely perhapps be made away as many do su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is meant by the late statute of restrayning them to certayne places) but much more do I vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by this people those also, who goe not so far forwardes as to discouer their religion (at least wise to put themselues within danger of lawes) and yet in mynde, wil, and iudgement, are they nothing behinde the rest, yea so much the more feruent inwardly, agaynst the state, by how much more they are forced by feare to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble outwardly their iudgements, and keep in their affections, and thes are also of two sortes, the one knowne or suspected, though nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be layed agaynst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by law, but the other not knowne nor suspected at al, but of good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the realme, and so much the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous when occasion shalbe offred.</p>

before in the narration hath bin touched, and out of thes haue and do come euery yeare into Ingland Priestes in such abundance, as my Lord Tresorer himselfe confesseth that for one that came into Ingland before, ther commeth now seuen, and perhapps he might haue said seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, and albeit aboue a hundreth of them haue bine put to death, yet more hundreths grow of them euery day, and in the meane space her Maiesty waxeth old, the realme groweth to more dissention and confusion in religion, the Puritans become very hoat and heady, the people wearyed and amazed, whith thes manner of procedings, what the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shalbe thee end at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght of this course think you?</p>
                        <p>Truely quoth one of the company for this poynt of the Catholiques, I know not vvhat to saye, the euent being doubtful, for the causes &amp; experience which you haue now alleaged: but for the puritans I haue hard some men of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course auouch in Ingland, that they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be extinguished, if the Queenes Maiestie liue any number of yeares for that the whol councell semeth fully bent therunto, &amp; were it not for my L.

                        <p>Tush, you are deceaued said the other, nay <note place="margin">VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Puritans may be rooted ont or not in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</note> much more possible &amp; likely it is that the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan shal ouercome the protestant then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for that the puritan buyldeth directly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the protestants first groundes in religion, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:2413:32"/>
deduceth therof clearly and by ordinary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence al his conclusions, which the protestant cannot deny by divinity, but only by pollicy &amp; humane ordination, or by turning to catholique answers contrary to ther owne principles: and therfore it is hard for any man sincerly to be a protestant, but that he wil easily passe on also more or lesse to be a puritan: and only they in effect wilbe agaynst them, who are interessed in the other side, as Archbishopes, Bishopes, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, chanons, notaryes, registers, ciuil la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers &amp; the like, for not leesing their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modityes, and some few councellors also perhaps for not offending the Queene, who aboue al others is interessed in this affayre, and yet al these, being but the lesser number in respect of the multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de (though of most power for there present au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) it shalbe impossible to extinguish the Puritans, except they extinguish first the principles and foundations of protestants religion, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon which puritans do grounde.</p>
                        <p>Which thing my L.

And albeit in this last parliament, to content the Queene, my L. of Canterbury, and some others of the councel that fauour them not, and to get others to stick the lesse at yelding to the statute agaynst catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, he vvas content also to let passe an acte agaynst the puritans: yet is it so qualified vvith
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2413:32"/>
fauorable clauses in their behalfe (put in diuers of them by his honor as is thought after the parliament ended) as is easily discouered that he wisheth them vvel, and the very last clause of al the act, wherin it is sayd, that the vvhole act shal indure no longer then vntil the next session of parliament, playnely declareth the great feare which the whole state hath of them, and that the councel vvalketh on thornes and standeth doubtful as yet vvhat the euent vvilbe, &amp; how this first act agaynst the puritanes vvilbe taken and digested by them, and according to this, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure your selfe the execution of the statute shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be, and consequently feare you not, the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the puritans, but rather lett the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants loke vvel to themselues vvho haue by this proceding of my L.

                        <p>To this discourse al held their peace for a
<pb facs="tcp:2413:33"/>
vvhile, looking the one vppon the other who should answere, vntil at length one sayde. As for the puritans (Sir quoth he) I am fully of your <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities that puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes vvill preuaile.</note> opinion, that it wilbe a hard peece of vvork to roote them out, but rather that they are like to ouercome in the end, both protestants and papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes: the protestants, for the reasons you now haue giuen, that they do buyld vppon the very first groundes of al Inglish protestants, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Caluins doctrine, and do seme to pretend but only the perfection and true vse therof, and consequently that reason of yours hath much fitted my vnderstanding, that their can scarce be a zelous Inglish protestant (for I meddle not vvith Lutherans in Germany) but that he vvil passe easily to be a puritan, if some particuler in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest do not hinder him, which cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed of the maior part, and so in tyme if this religion hold in Ingland, it must needes be, that this partye also of the Puritan vvil certaynly forward in like manner, and preuaile agaynst the other, but especially if once a Prince should enter that did fauour them indede, as easely may be imagined, that any other protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce lightely vvil do, after her Maiesty, vvho shal not be so setled in this manner of gouerment as her Maiesty is, nor so perswaded agaynst thes men as this Queene is, and hath bin hitherto by al her councellors, and by none more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs in tyme past, then by my L. Tresorer who now being of an other mynde and designement (as is presumed) though he dare not vtter it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2413:33"/>
to this Queene, yet vvil he easely finde reasons to perswade the same to an other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that shal come after, if he liue to that day as perhapps he may hope to doe, alleaging and <note place="margin">Reasons for the puritan religion.</note> laying before him that now tymes causes and circumstances are altered, and seing the puritans now so strong it may be dangerous to resist them, and that their religion is not to take any thing from the Prince, but rather to bring vnto him, for as the protestants religion brought abbyes, Nunryes, and other religious houses to the temporal Prince, so this wil bring Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop rikes, <note place="margin">As landes also of colleges in tyme.</note> Bishoprickes, Deanryes, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconryes with other semblable good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of welth, by which reasons it vvil not be hard, to perswade any other Prince, that hath not the auersion imprinted in him as this Queene hath, to enkendle his zeal to be a puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. And this is the likelyhoode that I concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue that puritans wil preuaile in tyme against the protestants: and this tyme I beleeue is not so far of as that you shal euer see this act now made agaynst them continued, or renued, in any other parliament &amp; so it is likely that those of their partye wel vnderstoode it vvhen they lett this statute passe in this parliament, rather to awaken the puritans therby in deed then to seeke their redresse or conformitye in religion. For what? doe you thinke that any Puritan in the world wil euer be forced to make that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of recantation and humiliation to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, which is set downe in the statute? to
<pb facs="tcp:2413:34"/>
vvit, <hi>that I do humbly confesse and acknowledge that I haue greuously offended god in vsing and frequenting disordered and vnlawfull conuenticles vnder pretence &amp; colour of exercise of religion, &amp;c.</hi> Nay I thinke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryly the protestant shal first make him eate his communion booke which he so much dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth) before he shall driue him to make this recantation. It may chance driue him to buckle with the protestant <hi>de summarei,</hi> somewhat soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then he had thought before, therby to try which of them shall haue the vpper hand to force the other to recat, but him I thinke, verely they shal neuer bring vnder, but rather by eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him put him sooner vp, vvho first or last wil rise aboue the other, at leastvvise this is my iudgment of the matter take it as you wil.</p>
                        <p>And as for the papist, me thinke the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of victory is much lesse agaynst him, eyther for putitan or protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that wilbe ridd of him, seing that now by this act of parliament (as hath bin sayde) they haue him by the legg and so tyed vp &amp; limited, as they may eyther ruine or weary him at their pleasure, whensoeuer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion or need shal require.</p>
                        <p>To this an other replyed, that as the puritans <note place="margin">An other opinion that puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans shal not so easily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile.</note> had great opportunity to grow and go forvvard vvhile the Queene and councel were occupied in repressing papistes, so did not he thinke not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that their victory vvas so suer or easie on eyther side, that is to say, eyther agaynst protestants or papistes, as this man made it, for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2413:34"/>
as for the state present (sayeth he) it is certayne that authoritie is so bent agaynst them, for seing the ruyne that by them is iminent, as it is like, they vvil neuer cease to pursue them: &amp; wheras you say, that ther is neuer a protestant of zeale but vvil easely passe on to be a puritan, except he be stayed by interest, it may be so in many, vvho do only runne forwards from poynt to poynte of new doctrines and religions, with such heate and greedines, as they neuer looke further but to that which is before them, but in many others it may breed perhapps a contrary effect, to witt that they vvil rather draw back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards agayne, considering ther is no stay, not ende, nor certanty in running so much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, as we haue seene in our dayes, from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists to Lutherans, from Lutherans to Svvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians, from Swinglians to Caluinists, from Caluinists to puritans, and now last of al from puritans agayne of a mylder sort, vnto heddy Brownists, &amp; this effect it is thought this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration may vvorke, especially in diuers of the priuy councel it self, who being men of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ryper discourse wil soner fal into such an accompt.</p>
                        <p>And this for the state present of Ingland: but as for any other Prince protestant that may suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceade <note place="margin">Of the Prince that shal follovv.</note> hereafter, the matter is vncertayne how he vvould be inclined in such a case, and the reason which you alleaged, that the puritan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion wil take nothing from him, but add much vnto him, as bishoprickes deanryes and
<pb facs="tcp:2413:35"/>
the like, it is very doubtful, with me how it would synck into him, and to his councel. For first it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the puritan religion taketh from the Prince al his primacy and authority ecclesiastical, which in a protestant gouerment is one of the chiefest pillars and foundations of al the rest. The Brownists also do take away his authority to make lawes, appoynt orders, &amp; subiecteth him to the excommunications and censures of vulgar ministeres and mutinous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and the practise therof we se partly in Scotland where the king is tossed and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by troblesome people as it pleaseth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters vvithout heades, to blow into their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, so as neyther he nor they haue any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of stay at all.</p>
                        <p>The reason also of adding bishoprickes and other ecclesiastical liuings to the crowne is very doubtful and ambiguous with me, for seing they are alredy at the Princes disposition, I see not vvhat great gift or additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it can be to him, if any man wil pul them downe to his handes: nay it is now by experience of some yeares brought in question, vvhether it vvere profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for temporal respects vnto king Henry the eight, to pul downe the monasteryes altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and distribute there possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to particular men as he did, or to haue permitted them to stand, and now and then to haue fleezed them of ther wealth, seing many are of opinion (and so am I also) that it is more gayne ful to sheer euery yeare a sheepe &amp; now and then to pul of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2413:35"/>
frute from a tree, then to take at one tyme the woll and flesh of the one, or the frute &amp; vvood together of the other, and this for the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</p>
                        <p>In like manner I do not think the puritans victory agaynst the papist is like to be so easy as <note place="margin">The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> you imagin, for as for the massacre (if any such thing should be mtended as I vvould thinke ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no) at least it is not probable that it vvilbe suffred in this Queenes dayes; first for the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and peril that such an act might bring vnto the common vvealth: and secondly for that therby the puritan should be strengthned and much armed to oppresse also the protestant, if once this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terpoyze of the papist vvere cut of.</p>
                        <p>And as for after her Maiesties death, vntrl an other Prince be setled, of the many that are like to pretende it may be thought, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique vvil prouide sufficiently for himselfe, not to be oppressed by any sudden violence; which the more easily he shalbe able to do, for that it is impossible any such matter to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted generally without some former desigme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts conferences and consultations, seing that many must be the executioners therof, and as impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, to haue any such consultations or desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gments, but that some, notice vvil come to the catholiques before hande, seing ther is no coure councel, campe, or company lightly in Ingland, but that it hath some or other, eyther by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, religion, kindred, allyance, frenship, obligation or affection deuoted to some of
<pb facs="tcp:2413:36"/>
them, yea the very partyes themselues that must be executioners of this act in euery shire, if it be done, let them be as forward other vvise in any religion as they vvil, yet is it impossible but for some of the afore sayd causes they wil shew some frenship, as it is easely sene in al the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that commonly are commaunded, vvhich being concluded neuer so secretly, are yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fore knowne more or lesse by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and much more wilbe so bloody &amp; boy sterous an actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a massacre or general slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vvould be: and therfore my opinon is, <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> that thes three partyes and factions of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, puritans, and papistes, vvil buckle toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther longer yet, then you do imagin, and which part shal haue the vpper hand in the ende, God only knoweth: and therfore if my L. Burley or Sir Nicholas Bacon, might haue anoyded this garboyle in the begining (as some here haue affirmed and it seemeth euident) or might haue tempered the same sithence, vvith a more mylde manner of proceeding vvithout bringing the matter into this disperate conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the state into so euident dainger: no doubt but (as you say) they nether vvere nor are to be accoumpted men of grear vvisdome, or gouerment: as some haue esteemed them, thus much vvas spoken of thes affayres.</p>

                        <p>To this speach of the Gentleman, al that were present stoode very attentiue, marueling much to heare him name so great a number of competitors to the crowne, affirming that they had neuer hard that ther we are so many, or so resolute euery man to make good and set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde his particuler title. Some said that in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland they had hard in tymes past, that the Queene of Scots had a title, which men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb facs="tcp:2413:39"/>
commonly, was cut of by her late at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder: some talke also there had bin of the Earle of hertfords children, and now lately of one Arbella whom men saye that the Earle of Licester vvent about to haue marryed her to his sonne, and so to haue made her Queene, some speech ther hath bin also of an old title of the Earle of Huntington, which commonly men thought was litle to the putpose: but of so great a numher as this man speaketh of, and that euery parte should hould so pregnant hope of preuayling, they saide they neuer imagined: and desired the Gentleman very earnestly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte with them more in particuler what he knew in that affaire, and so did especially a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Ciuilian Lawyer newly come from Italy Spayne and France, wher he had both trauayled and stndyed as also he had donne in some partes of Germany, and semed much giuen to matter of state, and therfore made instance to the Gentleman to say some what of this argument, and subiect, offering also to adioyne his verdicte vvhere any thing should offer it selfe within the compasse of his profession reading or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                        <p>To vvhich the Gentelman answered, this is a matter (quoth) he that I haue studied diuers yeares and conferred in Ingland with men of diuers factions and affections in this behalfe, who though the statute forbid treating of these poynts, yet in secret do they discourse very lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2413:39"/>
therof with men whom they dare trust, and notable packing and negotiation ther is vnder hand about this busines in secret, euery parte for his prince pretended, and nyne or ten plotts I haue hard of, for so many persons that do or may pretend it, all which for that you request me sayeth he, and do promise to say your oppinions also as occasion shalbe offered, and we are now fallen into that matter, &amp; the the tyme serueth conuenient enough, I shall here very willingly impart vvith you by vvay of discourse, not fearing the statute of treason for determinyng any mans right in succession to the crowne, both for that this place is out of Ingland, as also for that I meane to determyne nothing at all, bur rather to follow the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Philosophers in this affayre whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession was to argue and dispute on euery side, and to conclude nothing: nay my very purpose shalbe (said he) to shew you that I do not know what to conclude, and that the matter is so doubtful ambiguous, and disputable, on euery side, as God only and the sword must make the conclusion, and this in my opinion, is the cheifest and most certayne and very vvorst poynt of al other in this great busines.</p>
                        <p>If this be so, (said one of the company) why is ther not order taken by parliament for so great an inconuenience, and how commeth it to passe that we heare out of Ingland that some were committed to prison this last parliament
<pb facs="tcp:2413:40"/>
for offering to treate in this affayre? No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile <note place="margin">VVhy it is for bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to treate of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</note> said the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman, for that to treat of this matter now, when ther is none to succed that may be presumed by the neernes of bloode to desire more the Queenes safty then ther owne commodity, (as it would be if she had children of her owne) weare to put her Maiestyes state &amp; person in no smale danger, vvhich she pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently foreseing hath for bidden to haue the question debated in her dayes. Wherin no doubt (sayeth he) she hath great reason in allawe of pollicy: for that she hauing no kynred so neer in bloode as obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature may assure her Maiesty of ther fidelity, it were a perilous poynt to make determination of her succession now, for it were to put vp aulter agaynst aulter, and a rising sonne agaynst a falling sonne: It were to fill mens heades with new discourses hopes and designme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to moue passions feares enuies hatreds Ielozies &amp; ambicions, it were to breed new practises negotiations and canuasses, and to fill the realme with vnquiet humors. And for her Maiesty, it were to gyue her matter of perpetual care, sollicitude and danger for it were in deade to treat of her burial whiles she is yet in health, and to deuide her patrimony whiles she is yet in possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvhervnto I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle not yf she be vnwilling to yeeld.</p>
                        <p>To this may be added also for iustifying of her Maiesties proceeding in this poynt, so highly mislyked by dyuers sortes of men, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2413:40"/>
it is not probable that this prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if it should be made by parliament, for the next successor, and at this tyme, and as things now stande, would be greatly auaylable eyther to the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, or to the party in whose fauour it should be made, not to the realme, for that vvee see by many experiences of actes of parliaments made for succession both in King Henry the eight his tyme, and much more before, in tyme of controuersy betwene the two houses of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster and York, as also before that agayne in King Richard the first his dayes, for the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Artur the Duke of Britany, and other the like, actes, that they were neuer obserued or respected afterwards, when a stronger preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor came to plead his cause, so as those actes serued for nothing els but to exasperate more the competitor agaynst vvhom they vvere made.</p>
                        <p>To the partye also for whom they should be made, they do sealdom any good at al, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do put him in far greater dainger then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and namely they would do so now in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, things standing ther as they do, to witt, the Prince in possession being so far of in kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred as she must needes liue in Ielosy of that party, and the other competitors being so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, strong and apparent in ther pretences, as they may be egged heerby to work the distru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction both of the one &amp; the other: for al which respects and many other that may be alleaged,
<pb facs="tcp:2413:41"/>
I thinke this order taken in Ingland, not only needful, but reasonable also and commodious, said this Gentleman.</p>
                        <p>No doubt said the Ciuilian, but it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious yf you respect the present only, for that it doth eschu both garboyles to the realme and cares and periles to both partyes as you haue said, I meane both to the Queene and her heyre apparent that should be declared, who must needes be a mortal enimye vnto her Maiesty the very first hower that he is declared, for that his next desire after such declaration once obteyned must needs be, that her Maiesty were quickly dead, and he or she in her place; and for that her Maiesty must needs know and feare this, &amp; the other must needs imagine, that she knowing and fearing it, would seeke to preuent the same, betwene thes feares I say and hopes, thes hatreds and suspitions, thes ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioris and Ielosyes, no peace frenship or long endurance could be expected.
