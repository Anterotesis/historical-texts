            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Proverbs xxix. v. 2.</bibl>
               <q>When the righteous are in authority the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
rejoyce, but when the wicked beareth
rule, the people mourne.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN all Nations Two things are Cauſes of
a Common Proſperity, good Government,
and Good Obedience; a good Magiſtrate
over a Perverſe People is a Sound Head, as
hath been well obſerved, on a ſurfeited Body,
a good Commonwealth and a bad Ruler is a
healthful Body with a Head Aching; A good
Governour is a skilful Ship-Maſter, that takes
the ſafeſt and the ſhorteſt Courſe, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102277:5"/>
ſo ſteers as the Rocks and Shelves, which
might Ship-wrack the State, be avoided, and
the Voyage ever made with the greateſt ſpeed,
beſt profit, and moſt eaſe; but a wicked Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
is a Wolf made Leader of a Fold, that
both ſatiates his Cruelty, and betrays his Flock
to danger.</p>
            <p>Upon which account no doubt it was, that
we find <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo frequently adviſing all in
Authority to the conſtant practice of Vertue
and Goodneſs, as knowing full well that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would prove more Inſtrumental to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
any Nations happyneſs, then Men of
ſuch Sober and Excellent Principles: For 'tis
too viſible in the World, that when the
Wicked get up into Power, and ſuch as take
no care to oppoſe the growth of wickedneſs,
and to keep every Man within the bounds of
his Duty, are in Places of Truſt and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as they open a Sluce to all manner of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
ſo ſuch as are Vertuous muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
groan under the intolerable weight of their
grievous Oppreſſions; but when Juſt and
Merciful Governours make Vertuous Men by
their Example become more numerous, then
doth a Kingdom begin to Thrive and grow
Happy; then appears a Publick Joy and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
throughout all the Community, then do
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102277:5"/>
all Fears ceaſe, all Jealouſies are laid aſide, all
dreadful apprehenſions of the Peoples Inſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
do perfectly vaniſh, the Face of Publick
Affairs appears Fair and Serene, and nothing
move's eccentrically, but in a Juſt and Regular
Order, which ſeems to be the full Senſe and
Meaning of the Wiſe-man's Aphoriſme, <hi>When
the Righteous are in Authority the People rejoyce, but
when the Wicked beareth Rule, the People mourn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which words,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I ſhall conſider firſt, That there is always
great Joy when Righteous and Good Men bear
Publick Rule and Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you, that
there is very great reaſon for ſuch Publick Joy
and Exultation, becauſe as God is on their ſide,
ſo the whole Kingdom feels the Bleſſed Effects
of it:<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 12.</note> For as <hi>Dionyſius Carthuſianus</hi> obſerves well
upon <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 12. <hi>Ex hoc bonum Commune, &amp;c.</hi>
From hence the Common Good and Safety of
the People, and the Glory of God are procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
preſerved, and promoted: And St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
whom he there quotes, agrees with him in his
Notion concerning this matter, <hi>Illi qui vera pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
praediti, &amp;c.</hi> They who being endued,
ſaith he, with true Principles of Piety, live
Good and Vertuous Lives, if withal they have
but attained to any Skill and Knowledge of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102277:6"/>
governing the People, muſt needs render that
Community extreamly happy, where God is ſo
propitious to confer upon them Authority:
<hi>But when the Wicked beareth Rule, the People mourn,
gemet populus,</hi> ſaith the ſame <hi>Dionyſius</hi> upon the
place, <hi>timens exactionari, gravari, &amp; opprimi, &amp;c.</hi>
dreadfully fearing the great Exactions, Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and Oppreſſions, that will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
enſue.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> And laſtly, I ſhall apply all to our ſelves by
ſome neceſſary and ſeaſonable Inferences.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider that there is ever great
Joy, when Good Men are in Rule and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
for if as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> obſerves, <hi>Rebus rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
pretium facit,</hi> the rarity of any thing adds a
Price and Value to it; then if Vertue in a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
appear more Orient than ordinary,
the uncommonneſs of the thing uſually creates
a greater Reſpect and Veneration for the
Perſon.</p>
            <p>For Vertue hath an Innate Beauty and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
which is very taking, whereever it is
viſible, and if in a private Sphere, its Charms
are very great; Virtue and Goodneſs, when
in Men of Birth and Power, like a Curious
Picture inchaſed with Gold and Diamonds is
ſet off with a far greater Luſtre.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102277:6"/>
Men have naturally a great Opinion, Value,
and Veneration for true Goodneſs, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
others may think of it, Vice can never ſo
far change its own Nature, or ſo fairly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Vertue as by the moſt Alluring Charms
or Features to gain the ſame eſteem.</p>
            <p>And although Virtue and Vice are reputed
by ſome Perſons only to be Arbitrary things,
founded either in Mens Imaginations, or in
the Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions of the World,
and not in the Nature of the things themſelves,
and ſo there is no Good and Evil, but what the
Supreme Authority of a Nation declares to be
ſo, yet it will moſt certainly appear, that there
is a vaſt difference betwixt Good and Evil, a
Natural Comelineſs in Virtue, and a Natural
Deformity in Vice by the Univerſal Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Mankind about it, and by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Verdict of Humane Nature concerning
it.</p>
            <p>And to make this a little more Intelligible by
ſome particular inſtances to this purpoſe; Will
Violence and Injuſtice, will Perjury and Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs,
will Unrighteouſneſs and Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and ſuch like horrid Crimes paſs off
with as great Eſteem, Honour and Reputation,
as the contrary Virtues are wont to do? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
then the Reverſe of all that which we now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102277:7"/>
call Virtue were ſolemnly Enacted, and the
Practice of Fraud and Rapine, Perjury, and
Falſeneſs to a Mans Word, and all manner of
Vice and Wickedneſs were Eſtabliſhed by a
Law; I ask now in the words of a very great
and Learned Divine, <hi>If the caſe betwixt Vertue and
Vice was thus alter'd, would that which we now call
Vice in proceſs of time gain the reputation of Vertue,
and that which we call Vertue grow odious and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
to Humane Nature?</hi> Is it poſſible a Man,
that by all unjuſt and indirect means imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
takes away from his Neighbour, that which
is really his own, and daily builds his Fortunes
upon the Ruines of other Men, ſhall either
have the ſame credit while he lives, which he
hath, that deals fairly and honeſtly with all
the World, or when he dies, ſhall leave the
ſame Monument of laſting Honour and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
behind him, which Truth and Fidelity
perpetuate to Mankind?</p>
            <p>Nay is it not common with ſome even of
thoſe, who are of the vitious part of the World,
to revile and ſpeak againſt, and pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
and abhor thoſe who have been more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
than themſelves for their Crimes and
Villanies?</p>
            <p>Not but that wicked Perſons may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
honoured by ſuch as do not know them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102277:7"/>
to be wicked, and on the other ſide thoſe that
are good may by others be eſteemed and uſed as
the Rubbiſh and Off-ſcowring of all things, but
this is to be aſcribed to their miſtake and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of them; but the generality of Mankind
have heretofore, and ſtill do pay the greateſt
Reverence and Reſpect to any Perſons, whom
they believe to be Innocent and Vertuous,
whereas Shame, Scorn, and Diſgrace is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the Lot and Portion of wicked Men,
which is plain from that of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 13.
5. <hi>A wicked man is loathſome and cometh to ſhame;</hi>
which word <hi>loathſome</hi> denotes all ſuch kind
of Perſons to be as nauſeous and offenſive to
the judgment of others, as the moſt loathſome
and unſavoury things are to their Taſte and
Smell.</p>
            <p>On the contrary the Wiſe Man ſpeaking of
Religion ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be an ornament of grace to thy
head, and as a chain about thy neck; exalt her and ſhe
ſhall promote thee, ſhe ſhall bring thee to honour, when
thou doſt embrace her</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 4. 8.</note>: By which we may ſee
that nothing will ſooner raiſe Mens Eſteem,
and make them Great in the World than a
Righteous Converſation, for this will render
them illuſtrious both in the ſight of God and
Man; <hi>For</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pſ. 84. 11.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord will give grace and glory, and
no good thing will he withhold from them that walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly;</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102277:8"/>
and to this purpoſe may the words
of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> not improperly be underſtood,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and
gladneſs for the upright in heart:</hi> Beſides the inward
ſatisfaction, which all good Men doe natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reap by Vertuous Actions, the Publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
that do daily likewiſe Accompany

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> But I proceed to the ſecond thing, to ſhew,
<hi>That there is great reaſon to rejoyce when righteous men
are in authority,</hi> becauſe as God is on their ſide,

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> God is on their ſide, and takes the part
of ſuch as are Righteous Governours, and
therefore the People have great reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
under ſuch a Government: Nothing doth
more endear Men to God, and render them
Gratious and Acceptable in his ſight than an
Holy and Vertuous Converſation: Now it is
Natural to take care of, and preſerve ſuch
things as are of the higheſt Value and Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by conſequence good Rulers being
God's more ſpecial Favourites, hence hath
he a more peculiar regard for them, eſteeming
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102277:8"/>
them as the very apple of his Eye, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it as poſſible for the Sons of Violence to
come near and touch that, as to do them any
Injury by their malitious Machinations.</p>
            <p>Nay ſtill further, as God claims a peculiar
propriety in them, ſo he ſets the higheſt Marks
and Signatures of his Favour and Affection
upon them; <hi>For they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord
of Hoſts, in that day when I make up my jewels, and
I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own Son that
ſerveth him.</hi>

            <p>When the Wicked ſhall ariſe up in Tumults
againſt them, when they encompaſs them like
Bees, flaming with Rage and Fury, as if they
would preſently conſume them, then ſaith
God, Mine Hand ſhall hold them faſt, and

down their Foes before their Face, and plague

            <p>And what ſhould be the reaſon of all this
kind Care and Regard, of this favourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
and Protection, which God affords
them, but becauſe thoſe Perſons indeavour to
imitate God in thoſe his excellent perfections
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102277:9"/>
of Juſtice and Truth? God as he is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
of the Univerſe, and the Great Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the World performs his promiſes and
impartially diſtributes his Juſtice to Mankind,
and thoſe who are his Vice-Gerents and Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
here on Earth cannot more ingratiate
themſelves in his favour, then when Judgment
runs down like Water, and Righteouſneſs like
a Mighty Stream; <hi>For to do Juſtice and Judgment
is more acceptable to the Lord than any Sacrifice.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 21. 3.</note>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As God doth conſtantly Patronize
all ſuch Righteous Officers, ſo the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
feels the Bleſſed Effects of it, and this is
a further reaſon for the Peoples Joy and Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
Now we cannot better know the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Fruits of a Righteous Government, then
by the Joyful Experience of it, for from hence
it is, that true Religion is incouraged, and
kept up, maugre all oppoſition in its true Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
and Glory, whileſt all Prophaneneſs and
Impiety is utterly diſcountenanc'd and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
as the very Bane and Peſt of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society; whereas under Evil Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
Vice grows Daring and Couragious, it
throws off all the Vizors and Masks of bluſhing
Modeſty, and becomes Brazen-fac'd, Ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and highly Impudent, and by being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
countenanc'd by ſuch as are in Authority,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102277:9"/>
it gains too great Reputation and Authority to
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Again. When good Men ſit at the Helm of
Government, Oaths are not reputed Withs,
nor Laws as Cob-webbs, which every vile Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor
may be allowed to break through, the
Princes Rights are inviolably ſecured, and the
Peoples Properties as ſafely hedged about;
Oppreſſion and Violence dare not in the leaſt
peep abroad, nor Perjury and Detraction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
bare-fac'd at Noon-day as Advocates for
Truth; Fraud and Treachery ſculk about in
the dark, and can hardly eſcape undiſcovered
from their watchful Eye. Their Diligence and
Integrity is very ſignal and remarkable, and
all the Wheels of Government being kept up
and preſerved in a very regular motion, the
good and wellfare of the whole Community is
moſt entirely promoted by their prudent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Management of Affairs, by ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Debates, and ſober Counſels, by ſerious
Advice and proper Reſolutions, and God doth
many times by his ſecret Providence ſo concur
with their Endeavours, ſo ſtrengthen their
Counſels, ſo proſper their Debates, and Crown
with Succeſs all their Projects and Deſigns,
that they enjoy ſuch meaſures of Temporal
Felicity, as neither the Plots of Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102277:10"/>
nor the Machinations of Domeſtick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries
can ever be able to undermine.</p>
            <p>Nay God is many times pleaſed to enrich a
Nation with Peace and Plenty, with Eaſe and
Liberty, and with all the outward Bleſſings
both of the upper and neather Springs for the
ſake of good Men, they in their reſpective Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being very inſtrumental likewiſe towards
the procuring ſuch things; whereas wicked
Men carry a Curſe with them, wherever they
come, and like the dreadful <hi>Baſilisk,</hi> dart out
nothing but Ruine and Deſtruction before
them; ſo that no People are ſafe where ſuch
Perſons are in Authority, becauſe all their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies
and Projects prove commonly Fruitleſs
and Abortive.</p>
            <p>And if under all Governments Wickedneſs
hath been the main Obſtruction to all the brave
Deſigns and moſt Glorious Exploits, that have
been ſet on foot, then Vertue and Holyneſs is
the moſt prevailing Intereſt in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God is ever ſure to be on that ſide; I
confeſs indeed Policy and Courage are the two
great Pillars of any Government, but unleſs
Vertue be the Baſis to ſupport thoſe very Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
they will prove like the Earthen Legs of
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, which will at laſt grow
feeble and impotent, and fall away to nothing:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102277:10"/>
It is therefore both a wiſe and a true obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which hath been ſufficiently
experienc'd in all Ages, <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a
Nation, but ſin is a reproach to any people. Prov.</hi> 14.
34. That is, Religion and Vertue are the great
cauſes of all Publick Happyneſs, for they raiſe
a Nation to the higheſt degree of Temporal
Felicity and Glory, and make both Officers and
People to flouriſh in the greateſt Reputation
and Renown.</p>
            <p>This it were eaſie to enlarge upon from the
Records of Time and Annals of Hiſtory: The
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Commonwealth is a very ſignal inſtance
of this Nature, for whil'ſt both Rulers and
People made it the chief of their buſineſs to do
Juſtice and love Mercy, and walk humbly with
their God; How did the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and the State proſper, and nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terven'd
to Eclipſe their Glory?</p>
            <p>And thus again, whil'ſt <hi>Greece</hi> flouriſhed,
<hi>Reges Philoſophabantur, &amp; Philoſphi regebant,</hi> thoſe
Common-wealths being more numerous than
their Neighbours in nothing but in the ſincere
Exerciſe of their Reaſon: And we find though
<hi>Lycurgus</hi> in <hi>Lacedemon, Ariſtides</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> and
<hi>Epaminondas</hi> at <hi>Thebes</hi> were not born to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
their Vertue beſtowed on them what
their Birth deny'd: And when Tyranny and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102277:11"/>
Pride had by waſting theſe Common-wealths
made place for the <hi>Roman</hi> Glory, nothing did
ſo enlarge the Conqueſt of that Renowned
State (whoſe Center, as one ſpeaks, was Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and Circumference Fame) as their Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Actions: Upon which account <hi>Attalus</hi> King
of <hi>Pergamus</hi> did by Legacy leave them his
Kingdom, as to thoſe whoſe Vertues deſerv'd
it as a Reward, which occaſion'd St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to
fall into that Eloquent Expreſſion, <hi>Becauſe God</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>would not beſtow Heaven on the</hi> Romans,
<hi>they being Pagans, he beſtowed the Empire of the
World upon them, becauſe they were Vertuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though <hi>Nobis non licet eſſe tam beatis,</hi> tho'
we cannot at preſent be as great as other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ſuch Conqueſts and Enlargements
of our Dominions are not in this Age as yet
the Fate and Portion allotted to us; and more
the pity, that under ſo Great and Puiſſant a
Prince, who by his Matchleſs Courage and
Conduct would make us as Renown'd and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
as ever, our own Vices ſhould clip
the Wings of His Triumphant Victories; Yet
would we once be perſwaded to become Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
over our ſelves, and over all our Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Paſſions and Appetites, we might then
at leaſt have this aſſurance, that we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be Conquered, and triumph'd over by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102277:11"/>
thoſe, who now apparently watch for our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And if we are not ſo happy now as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be, 'tis becauſe we are not ſo Vertuous
and Honeſt as is neceſſary for ſuch happyneſs,
for till our Vices leſſen, our Succeſs will never
be great, nor can we hope to retrieve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
and Honour of our Illuſtrious Anceſtors,
till we reſolve to fetch back amongſt us their
Ancient Manners and Heroick Gallantry: And
indeed if we could but recover the good <hi>Engliſh</hi>
plainneſs of Heart and Habit and Integrity of
Spirit, for which our Progenitors were ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
Renown'd, we ſhould then quickly find
the Tide turn upon us with an over-flowing
Torrent of Glory and Proſperity.</p>
            <p>But whil'ſt there is ſo much Artifice and
Guile, ſo much Treachery and Selfiſhneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, while like prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> we can be
willing to ſell all our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Birth-rights and
Properties only for a Meſs of * Pottage;<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 33, 34.</note> and
under the Mask of True <hi>Engliſh</hi> Patriots do our
Enemies Work to their hands, what can we
expect indeed at this rate, but to become a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
and forlorn People, a Scorn to others,
and a Reproach to our ſelves? Nay what can
we expect, but to be made, as a juſt puniſhment
for ſuch impardonable perfidiouſneſs, Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102277:12"/>
Vaſſals at laſt without another Miracle of
Providence to the moſt Domineering Monarch
in the Univerſe?</p>
            <p>Since then Proſperity and good Succeſs doth
uſually attend Righteouſneſs, and ſuch Honeſt
Governours as are the Patrons of it, ſince Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
reſiſts Vice, and Vices do not only
make Enemies to themſelves, but by a Civil
War as a Juſt Judgment upon them deſtroy one
another, happy muſt that People needs be,
where God is pleaſed to beſtow upon them ſo
Unvaluable a Bleſſing, and there cannot be
occaſion of greater Joy, than when ſuch Men
are advanc'd into Power and Authority by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that mighty influence, which both their
Actions and Examples have commonly upon
all Inferiour Perſons who are under their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> What remains then but in the third place to
apply all to our ſelves by ſome ſeaſonable Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and ſo to draw to a Concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> And firſt, If Righteous Men in Authority
occaſion great Joy, then the Choice of ſuch
Governours appears from hence to be a thing
of the greateſt moment and conſequence: For
when the Lot of Government falls into the Lap
of good Men, Oh, how happy are the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
in the inveſtitures of ſuch Perſons?
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102277:12"/>
and what Advantages do accrue both to the
City and Countrey from the Wiſdom of their
Counſels and Excellent Adminiſtrations? The
Voice of Oppreſſion then utterly ceaſeth, and
there are no Complaints to be heard in the
Streets, when Juſtice is Adminiſtred, it is done
without partiality, and the Poor and Deſtitute
receive Comfort and Relief, the Widow and
the Fatherleſs find Patronage and Protection,
and their Souls are redeemed from Deceit and
Violence, the Rights of the Injured are with
great Equity aſſerted, and all things are ſettled
upon the moſt durable Foundations of Truth
and Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>For the True Stateſman is inviolably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
to his moſt Excellent Principles of Virtue,
and Religious Prudence, his Ends are Noble,
and the Means he uſeth Innocent, he hath a
ſingle Eye on the Publick Good, and meets it
in its ſeveral Preſſures with ſutable Reliefs.
Nay if the Ship of the State miſcarry, he had
rather periſh in the Wreck, then preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon the Plank of an Inglorious Subterfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge;
his Worth had led him to the Helm, the
Rudder he uſeth is an Honeſt and Vigorous
Wiſdom, the Star he looks to for Direction is
in Heaven, and the Port he aims at is the
joynt-well-fare both of Prince and People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:102277:13"/>
So that when ſuch places of Truſt are thus
carefully diſpoſed of, and ſuch Noble Enſigns
of Honour conferr'd upon Worthy Patriots,
the greateſt happyneſs doth then moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accrue to that Community, which they are
deputed to govern, that their hearts can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
wiſh or deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Power of good Men admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
great Joy, then Self-Intereſt as well as the
general good of that Community to which they
belong ſhould make all Men in Authority ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Active in all ſuch Religious Performances,
and Righteous Practices: Nothing ſure can be
a more powerful Encouragement to goodneſs,
than to conſider what an Univerſal Satisfaction
it generally creates in the Minds of Men,
for the very Old Men in the Gates will riſe
up and pay it a juſt Deference and Veneration,
and the Children cannot but warble forth its
Praiſe in the moſt Melodious Acclamations;
for every one looks upon a Righteous Ruler as
a Tutelar Guardian to the People, and the
greateſt Bleſſing to his Countrey, whereas
they who are Wicked are the greateſt Traitors
to their Nation as well as their God, and they
frequently betray both Prince and People into
the moſt Diſmal Calamities by the Crying Sins
of Unrighteouſneſs and Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:102277:13"/>
So that no Man that is a well-wiſher either
to himſelf or Country, but will reſolve upon
ſuch Virtuous and Upright Courſes; for is
it not much better to be inſtrumental towards
a Bleſſing than a Curſe, the firſt of which is
only attainable by Vertuous Actions? Is it
not a greater ſatisfaction to be capable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Proſperity of a People, than to haſten
their Ruine and procure their Deſtruction?
Is it not more grateful to the Ear to receive
the joyful applauſes of Worthy Atchievements,
than to be haraſs'd even to Death with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Taunts and Execrations of a flouting Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
for the Vileſt Misdemeanours! and to
be in the midſt of the Congratulations and
happy Wiſhes of the People, whoſe Hearts
and Affections they entirely poſſeſs, then to
have only the Command of their Bodies, and
not the leaſt of Charming Empire over their
Souls, which is the more Noble part of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
If Men then in Authority would but
conſult their own Intereſt, they cannot do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for themſelves, they cannot do better for
the People, than by an inviolable Obſervation
of the Laws of Equity and Juſtice, which ſome
Unfortunate Politicians having neglected to
do, have too often made a woful Shipwrack
both of their Honour and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:102277:14"/>
Which brings me to the third and laſt thing,
That whenever God affords us ſuch Publick
Bleſſings by ſuch Righteous Rulers, we ought
to give him all the Praiſe and the Glory of it:
And this is <hi>Dionyſius Carthuſianus</hi> his Gloſs again,
<hi>In exaltatione juſtorum multa gloria eſt, exultant enim
in Deo:</hi> There is great cauſe of rejoycing in
God, when he ſends juſt Governours amongſt
a People, for by that means they glorifie God,
who confers on them that happyneſs.</p>
            <p>And ſince perhaps to the very Envy of our
Adverſaries this is our Caſe at this time, Let
us not any longer affect to be the moſt Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Pictures of ſuch horrible Ingratitude
and Ill-Nature, as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Climate is not
uſually acquainted with, nor by a down-look't
Male-Contentedneſs, and Unreaſonable Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs,
by our repining againſt Providence,
and Carping at the Government provoke God
to deprive us of ſo great a happineſs.</p>
            <p>I confeſs if Ignorance and Blind Devotion,
if Superſtition and Idolatry, if Subjection to
His Holineſs, and a Tame Condeſcenſion to
his Unjuſt Uſurpations be things in themſelves
ſo deſirable and to be admired, if it be a thing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102277:14"/>
ſo Meritorious to advance the Intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and make this Kingdom again part of St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony, and ſo to introduce <hi>French
Dragoons</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Janezaries</hi> to be our conſtant
Gueſts and Companions; if ſuch a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
will prove ſo Comfortable a <hi>Jubilee,</hi>
and changing the preſent Scenes after ſuch a
faſhion will become ſo Advantageous to us,
there is reaſon enough indeed for our vehement
ſtriving and impatient ſtruggling for it.</p>
            <p>But if there is a Train of Bleſſings clear of
another Nature, which doth manifeſtly attend
us, if we are now under ſuch an Heroick King,
who is as Tender of our Religious as Civil
Rights, under ſuch Wiſe Councillors, who will
neither flatter their Prince to His Ruine, nor
diſpenſe with his Laws to the prejudice of his
People, if under ſuch Worthy Governours,
which though Loyal to the Crown will never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
not forget the True Intereſt of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
then where is any room left for Murmurs
or Complaints? Or what reaſon is there for
any one to Rail or Revile, to beſpatter or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
againſt ſuch a Government, whoſe Yoke
compared with others round about us is eaſie,
and whoſe Burden is Light?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:102277:15"/>
Nay if theſe be ſuch Mercies as would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be eſteemed ſo by all but a few Unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
peeviſh Spirits of our own Nation, who do
not deſerve the Benefit of what they ſo baſely
Deſpiſe, let us who have learned better things,
think of nothing elſe but what we ſhall render
unto the Lord for ſuch benefits as theſe which
he hath beſtowed upon us.</p>
            <p>Any Nation but we would never think they
could thank God enough for them, let us then
not be worſe than other People, but let us by
our outward Teſtimonies of Joy declare our
inward ſatisfaction for the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and let us turn all our Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
into Prayers and Supplications for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of it; let us conſtantly pray for the
Well-fare and Proſperity of ſuch as are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that we may lead quiet and peaceable
Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty; and let
us have no reſerve in our Prayers againſt any
of them, and hope to come off at laſt with
ſome ſuch like trimming Apology as that of
<hi>Naaman,</hi> the Old <hi>Syrian</hi> Courtier, <hi>In this thing
the Lord pardon me</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Kings 5. 18.</note>, for this is but in plain
terms to equivocate with God Almighty, and
to pray backward, as Conjurers, they ſay, are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102277:15"/>
wont to do when they raiſe up their Familiars,
or as Bells are wont to ring at General Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations.</p>
            <p>To Conclude all, let us zealouſly endeavour
to promote in earneſt what we ſo fervently
pray for, not by Calumnies and Reproaches,
not by be-ſpattering Their Majeſties, or any
of Their Miniſters of State, and blackning and
defaming the Eſtabliſhed Government, not by
rendring every thing both in Church and State
odious and abominable in the ſight of all the
People by Forgery and Detraction; but by an
unfeigned integrity to God in the firſt place,
by a ready ſubmiſſion to all our Superiours in
the next, by a generous Condeſcenſion to our
Inferiours, and by a meek and quiet and
peaceable Deportment amongſt our Equals, let
us make our Kingdom Glorious, and our ſelves
entirely happy. <hi>Which God of his Infinite Mercy
