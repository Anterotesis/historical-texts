            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE cannot but with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
acknowledge the
wonderful Goodneſs of
God to you, in your Return to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of your remaining Truſt; and to
our ſelves, and your Forces under our
Commands, (after ſome difficulties) in
bringing of us, by a tedious March, in
ſuch ſafety to this place, to wait upon you
in aſſerting the Freedoms of our Native
Country: and being here, (as we have
to our utmoſt Hazard and Power been
inſtrumental in your Return, ſo) we
ſhall be ſtill ready to purſue your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
ſo far as poſsibly we may. To
evidence which, we have obſerved and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
your late Orders in relation to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94463:3"/>
Chains, Poſts, and Gates of the City;
which was ſomething grievous to Us, and
to the Officers and the Souldiers under
our Commands; and that becauſe we
do not remember any ſuch thing was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
upon this City in all theſe Wars;
and we fear that many ſober people are
much grieved at it, and apprehend fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
force to be offered to them, while
they ſeem principally to deſire the ſpeedy
filling up of the Houſe, which you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
for, as well as we have expreſs'd our
juſt deſires of; and are apt to doubt, leſt,
what we have done, may be ſo far from
anſwering the expected end, as that it may
encreaſe the diſcompoſure of mens ſpirits
in the Nation. Upon this occaſion, it
comes freſh into our minds, that when
by the treachery of ſome Officers of the
Army you were interrupted, we declared
to the world, That <hi>the Ground of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94463:3"/>
was not onely your return to your
Truſt,</hi> but alſo, <hi>the Vindication of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the People, and the Preſervation
of the Rights of our Country, the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and encouragement of the Godly and
Faithful therein, as the eſtabliſhment of
the Peace of theſe Nations.</hi> Which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
made before the Lord, Angels
and Men, in the day of our Extremity,
we (as we expect the bleſsing of the Lord
upon our future Undertakings) cannot
but ſtill own, and ſtand by.</p>
            <p>We finde that the aſſerting of the juſt
Liberties of the People, is that which the
generality of the Nation is much in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of; and that many ſober people
(together with our ſelves) are under fears
leſt this great price that God hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your and our hands, (as your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants)
ſhould not be improved, but that
we ſhall run in Confuſion again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94463:4"/>
we humbly crave leave to preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, ſome Grounds of our Fears:
We are affraid that the late wonderful
and unparallell'd Deliverance, is not ſo
publickly and ſolemnly acknowledged as
it might be, that the Lord (who wrought
ſo ſtupendiouſly) may have the Glory
of all: We are troubled that ſome as yet
do ſit in the Houſe, who are impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Treaſon: We cannot but obſerve
that divers Members of your Houſe,
(who contrary to their Truſt, acted in
that Illegal and Tyrannical Committee
of Safety) are not actually diſabled from
ſitting there: notwithſtanding Colonel
<hi>Lambert</hi> hath onely the Vote of Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pnity
to ſecure him from as High Crimes
as have been committed in this Nation,
and is not obedient to your Orders, yet
he ſeemeth to be winked at. We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> upon bare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94463:4"/>
is permitted to ſtay about the City,
to the great Diſſatisfaction of your beſt
Friends; that there are dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations,
and that of thoſe who had a
chief hand in your late Interruption, and
the hazarding of the whole Nations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our Expectation. VVe find
continued in the Army ſome Perſons of
dangerous Principles, and ſuch who were
active enough in the late Defection.
Though we are far from wiſhing the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of any, yet we could deſire that your
ſignal Indulgence to late Notorious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
did meet with that Candid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
from them, as to be ſo much the
more ingenuous in their profeſſed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
But we obſerve that many of them
do ſeek to juſtifie themſelves, and are not
without their Agents in print to palliate
their foul Enormities; which maketh us
yet to ſuſpect that we are in ſome danger
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94463:5"/>
of returning into the late diſtempers that
You and the Nation are but newly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from.</p>
            <p>We are not ignorant, that there are
thoſe who lately ſtruck at the Root of
<hi>Engliſh Parliaments</hi> in Practiſe and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
thereby have inflamed the Nation,
and given great advantage to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy, yet they are not without a
ſtrange confidence to precipitate men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a belief, that they are the only Perſons
againſt the One, and for the Other. With
grief of heart we do remember and
would lament over the too palpable
Breach of Engagements in this Nation;
Therefore we ſhould think it a duty ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to mourn over the ſame, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
any new Oath to be taken at this
time: Yet we perceive that there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to provoke the Parliament to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
an Oath upon the Nation, and do
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94463:5"/>
take notice, that amongſt others, there
are ſome who are moſt forward to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the ſaid deſign, who have made the
leaſt (if any) Conſcience in keeping En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
already taken. Here we muſt
not ſilence our deep reſentment of a bold
Petition, and of dangerous conſequence,
which was lately preſented to you, the
conſequence whereof (if you ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
their deſires) would be to exclude
many of the moſt conſcientious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſort of men from ſerving under you
in Civil and Military Imployments, who
have and would prove themſelves moſt
faithful; and a door would be opened in
deſign to retrive the Intereſt of thoſe who
have (by the juſt Hand of our Gracious
God) made themſelves ſo apparently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious.
Moreover (which is not the
leaſt part of the Venome of that Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94463:6"/>
we clearly ſee the ſame Spirit, which
of late would have pull'd away the by-you-declared-juſt Maintenance from
Miniſters, would now provoke you by
an Oath to endanger the forcing away of
many of the moſt Godly from their
Maintenance. In urging our fears from
the premiſes that concerns ſome of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
principles from us, we would not be
thought to (as we do not) deſign any
thing that may incur the cenſure of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
rigidity. We freely profeſs our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
that tenderneſs of Conſcience may
have its full juſt liberty, but we cannot
in judgment, account that tenderneſs
of Conſcience which will not ſcruple at
treachery it ſelf; or any Unrighteouſneſs
to carry on corrupt Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Having preſented You with our fears,
we ſhall adde our Reſolution, That by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94463:6"/>
the help of God we ſhall ſtand by You
in the purſuance of what we have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for: And therefore do make this
humble Requeſt to You: We could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
That whilſt You ſit, Your utmoſt
endeavours may be to manifeſt your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
deſires for the Publick Good
of theſe Nations; Our further deſire is,
That thoſe Regiments under your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
(whoſe Officers are not) may
be ſpeedily paſs'd. And in regard we
find that the Grand Cauſe of the preſent
Heats and Diſ-ſatisfactions in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, becauſe they are not fully Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
in Parliament, and ſeeing no other
probable Expedient whereby to keep
the Nation in peace, then by filling up
your Number; We muſt therefore
make this our main deſire, upon which
we cannot but inſiſt, that you would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94463:7"/>
proceed to Iſſue forth Writts in Order to
Elections: For the better effecting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we entreat, That you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
upon due and full Qualifications,
that not only thoſe who have been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in Arms againſt the Parliament may
be excluded, but alſo ſuch who in the late
Wars betwixt King and Parliament
have declared their diſ-affection to the
Parliament: And becauſe the diſtracted
condition of this Nation is at this hour
ſo evident and preſsing, we are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the juſt maintenance of Your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and the ſatisfaction of all true En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Men, earneſtly to deſire, That all
the Writts may be Iſſued forth by <hi>Friday</hi>
next, returnable at the uſual and legal
time; For we think it convenient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, that to pacifie the minds of
this Great City, in the proſecution of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94463:7"/>
your late Commands, the Chief of Us
did give an aſſurance thereof.</p>
            <p>And we muſt not forget to remember
you, that the time haſtens wherein you
have declared your intended Diſſolution,
which the People and our ſelves deſire
you would be punctual in. Hereby the
Suſpition of your Perpetuation will be
taken away, and the People will have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
that they ſhall have a Succeſsion
of Parliaments of their own Election;
which is the undoubted Right of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Nation: You have promiſed and
declared no leſs: Both the People and
your Armies do live in the Hope and
Expectation of it. That we may the
better wait for your full and free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
to theſe juſt Deſires on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
behalf, upon Mature Deliberation,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94463:8"/>
we have thought it our duty as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the uſual Guards for the ſafety of
your ſitting, ſo for the preſent to draw the
reſt of the Forces under our Command
into the City, that we may have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opportunity to compoſe ſpirits, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
a good underſtanding in that great
City, formerly renowned for their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
adhering to Parliamentary Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and we hope that the ſame ſpirit will
be found ſtill to breath amongſt the beſt,
moſt conſiderable, and intereſſed perſons
there. This Action of ours, as we hope
it will receive your favourable interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
ſo we do believe it will (through
the bleſsing of God) be of good uſe for
the preſent Peace, and future ſettlement
of theſe Nations. Theſe are our thoughts
which we communicate to you, in the

Names of our ſelves, and the Officers
