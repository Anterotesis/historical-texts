            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ABout the time of the foundation of the Universitie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the ancient Historians have diversly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: some affirmed that it was founded when the most ancient Britains first inhabited this Island, and that from <hi>Greeklade,</hi> a Town in <hi>Wilt-shire;</hi> this Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy was translated to <hi>Oxford,</hi> which some will have called <hi>Ouseford,</hi> from the River of <hi>Ouse</hi> (by the <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Isis</hi>) which giveth name to the next adjoyning Island, called <hi>Ousney.</hi> Others say it was founded when the City of <hi>Oxford</hi> was first builded, many years before the Incarnation of our Saviour Christ. Others say it was builded, or at least restored, by King <hi>Vortiger:</hi> But the chiefest conclude and agree, that <hi>Elfred,</hi> of some called <hi>Alured,</hi> King of the West <hi>Saxons,</hi> about the year <hi>872,</hi> was the chief and Principall Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof: And that (besides the ancient Hostles for Scholars, which is evident were there remaining after many overthrows of warres) he caused to be erected therein three Colledges or publick Schools, for the teaching of Grammer; Philosophy, and Divinitie, sending thither his owne son <hi>Ethelward.</hi> Since which time, by reason of divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions and continuall wars which were daily in this land, between the <hi>Britains, Romans, Saxons,</hi> Kings of this Heptarchie, <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> the light and glory of this Academy was not onely of old eclipsed; but even since the Conquest (in the Barons wars) also obscured and defaced. And it is most certaine, as the destructions were many, so the restaurations thereof shortly ensued by one Prince or other: so that at length recovering the fame and dignity which it holdeth amongst other Christian Academies of <hi>Europe,</hi> it is now worthily reputed one of the most famous Universities in the world; the ancient and noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Veres</hi> having been long Earls thereof, and so still remain. And howsoever the Hostles, Hals, Innes, Schools, and religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, whereof this University since the Conquest did consist, and which now are wholly defaced, or in part converted into some of the present Colledges, were for their number, and for the number of Students in

               <hi>them, much above all that now are extant,</hi> viz. Divi Fridswidi Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. S. Mariae Aula, Divi Jacobi Aula Divi Gregorii Aula. D. Johan. Baptist. Aula, D.

Margaretae Aula, Regis Aula, Reginae Aula, Pittantii Aula, Green-Aula, Corbetti Au'a, Parvae Academiae Aula, Stapul. Aula, <hi>and many others; yet at this present there are eighteen goodly Colledges and houses erected, maintained with the lands and revenews of their founders; and seven Hals that Students live in at their own charge, not having endowment of land to maintain them. Besides there are publick Schools and a Library, whose Fabrick by the bounty of many royal, noble, and religious persons, was of late years finished, which no Universitie in the world can in all points pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel. These are the nurseries of Gods true religion, and Seminaries of good literature.</hi>
