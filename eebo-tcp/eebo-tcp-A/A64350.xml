            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </item>
               <item>The second Branch of their Subordinate End, is the settling

               <item>This is proved still more improbable. <hi>p.</hi> 12,

               <item>Also, it is shewed that Parties tolerate each other no longer
  then one gets Power to suppress the rest, with publick safety. <hi>p. 14.

               <item>The Second End of the Dissenters is more Principal, and the

               <item>That this End cannot be obtained by Dissenting from our
  Church, is shewed</item>
               <item>From Reason. <hi>p. 18. to p.</hi> 25.</item>

               <item>But, there are Reasons to perswade us that upon the

               <item>By virtue of the Premisses, Dissenters are perswaded to

            <head>AN ARGUMENT FOR UNION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Take it for granted (seeing a Truth so very plain needs no
formal Proof) that the ready way to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a Church,<note place="margin">The
  Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> is, first to divide it. It is, also, too manifest, that
our Dissentions are <hi>Divisions,</hi> properly so called, or Publick
Ruptures. It is true, notwithstanding these Ruptures, the Church still lives,
and, in some good measure, prospers: But how Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal these Breaches may, at
last, prove, through their Continuance and Increase, a Man, who has but a
Competency of Judgment, may easily foretel. It is, therefore, the business of
every Good Man, as far as in him lies, to disswade, with Prudent Zeal, from
these Divisions; which are, in their Nature so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, and so perillous
in their Consequence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52398:4"/> Now, one way of moving Men to desist from their
Undertakings, is, the shewing of them, with calmness of Temper, and plainness
of Reasoning, that their <hi>Ends</hi> are not likely to be obtain'd: As, also
that, by the <hi>Means</hi> they use, they will bring upon themselves those
very Evils which they fear, and of the removal of which they have
Expectation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I have chosen an <hi>Argument</hi> of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in
order to the persuading of <hi>Dissenters</hi> to joyn in the Exercise of
<hi>Constant Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And I
have, here, endeavoured to make it evident to them; that, in attempting to pull
down this <hi>Establish'd Church,</hi> they, unwarily, turn their own force
against themselves, and prepare Materials for the Tombs of their own
Parties.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Argument</hi> is, here, offer'd to them in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of
Christian Charity, and without any design of exposing or exasperating any
person who differs, is his Notions, from the sence of the Writer. For he had
rather lie at the Feet of the meanest Man who is overtaken with an errour, then
spurn insolently against him.</p>
            <p>Now, in the managing of this Argument, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to shew
two things.<note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it self. Its Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and
  Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>What those Ends are which are proposed by the
Dissenters?</hi> I mean, <hi>those</hi> which seem, with any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable colour
of Reason, fit to be proposed; and which are designed by the better and wiser
of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What Reasons may make it manifest that the Ends
which they propose, can never be procured by the Dissettlement of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things being shewed, there shall follow such a
<hi>Conclusion,</hi> as is suitable to the Premisses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52398:4"/> 
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Ends of
  the <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
               </note> For the <hi>Ends</hi> proposed by the more
<hi>Prudent Dissenters,</hi> they are of <hi>two kinds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> End is <hi>Subordinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is <hi>Principal:</hi> Or the End to which the
former serventh in the quality of the <hi>Means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Subordinate End</hi> is, the <hi>Establishing of
themselves.</hi> And it hath two Branches.</p>
            <p>Either, the setling themselves <hi>(First)</hi> as a <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Church:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, <hi>(Secondly)</hi> as several distinct Churches, giving
undisturbed Toleration to one another.</p>
            <p>For I am not willing to believe all of them to be given up to such
a degree of Infatuation, as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent only upon beating down, without
considering what is fit to be set up. That is the way of Tempests, and not of
Builders.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Principal</hi> is, the further Advancement of the Reformed
Religion. This also, hath two parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Removal of Popery.</item>
               <item>2. The Introduction of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion in
  grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Purity and Perfection, then the Church of <hi>England</hi> is (in
  their Opinion) as yet, arrived at, or can probably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to by vertue of its
  present Constitution.</item>
            </list>
            <p>If there be amongst them, Men disturbed in their Understandings,
by the heat of <hi>Enthusiasm;</hi> if there be amongst them, any Men whose
Wisdom is sensual and worldly; who presumptuously make Heaven stoop to Earth,
and conceal their private and secular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs under the venerable name of
<hi>Pure Religion;</hi> I do not concern my self with them in this
<hi>Persuasive to V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> The former cannot, and the latter will not be
convinc'd: For there is no Ear so deaf, as that which Interest hath stopp'd.
And there is a great deal of earnest Truth suggested in the Jocular Speech of
<hi>Iames</hi> the fifth of <hi>Scotland;</hi> who, when his Treasurer desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52398:5"/> liberty to be plain with him,<note n="*" place="margin">Melvil's <hi>Memoirs</hi> p. 2.</note> drew out his Sword, and
said merrily to him, <hi>I shall slay thee, if thou speak against my
profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> Branch of the <hi>first,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The first Branch of the first End of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters:
  <hi>viz.</hi> Union in a National Church.</note> or <hi>Subordinate End</hi> of
the <hi>Dissenters</hi> is, <hi>the Establishing of themselves as a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is either designed by <hi>All of them,</hi> or by a
<hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> which believeth it self to be most sober, and most numerous,
and most likely to prevail over the rest; so far at least as to become the
State-Party.</p>
            <p>For <hi>All of them</hi> to expect to be united in one Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Body, is to hope, not only against the Grounds of Hope, but of Possibility.</p>
            <p>For the Parties are very many, and very differing, (or rather very
contrary) and they cannot frame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, any common Scheme in which their
As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents can be united.</p>
            <p>What Communion (for Example sake) can the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
have with <hi>Arians, Socinians, Anabaptists, Fifth-Monarchy-Men, Sensual
Millenaries, Behmenists, Familists, Seekers, Antinomians, Ranters,
Sabbatarians, Quakers, Muggletonians, Sweet-Singers.</hi> These may associate
in a <hi>Caravan,</hi> but cannot joyn in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a Church. Such a
Church would be like the <hi>Family of Errour</hi> and her Daughters, described
in Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi>'s <hi>Fairy-Queen,</hi> of which none were alike,
unless in this, that they were all deform'd: And how shall the <hi>Christians
of this present Church</hi> be disposed of to their just satisfaction? They
will never Incorporate with such a Medly of Religion; and they are such, both
for their Quality and their number, as not to be beneath a very serious
Consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52398:5"/> 
               <hi>For the Prevalent Party,</hi> there seemeth
to be both <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> against their hopes of
Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves as a <hi>National Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>These Reasons,</hi> amongst others, have moved me to entertain
this Persuasive concerning them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Such a Party not maintaining <hi>Episcopal
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> which hath obtained here from the Times of the
<hi>Britaines</hi> (who in the Apostolical Age, received the <hi>Christian
Religion)</hi> and which is so agreeable to the Scheme of the Monarchy; It is
not probable that they shall easily procure an exchange of it for a newer
Model, by the general consent of Church or State. I may add, the Body of the
People of <hi>England,</hi> whose <hi>Genius</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them tenacious of
their Antient Customs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> All the Parties amongst us, have of late
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, for Mutual Forbearance. They cannot, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be consistent with
themselves, if they frame such a National Constitution, by which any Man, who
Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents from it, shall be otherwise dealt with, then by personal Conference;
which, also, he must have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty not to admit, if he be persuaded it is not
fit or safe for him. And such a Body without any other nerves for its strength
and motion; for the Encouragement of those who are Members of it, and the
Discouragement of those who refuse its Communion; will not long hold together:
Nor hath it means in it, sufficient for the Ends to which it is designed. And
indeed by this means, the Spiritual Power of Excommunication will be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of none Effect. For, what Punishment, what Shame, what Check, will it be to
Cross and Perverse Men, if being shut out of the <hi>National Church,</hi> they
may with open Arms and with Applause due to real Converts, be received into
this or the other particular Congregation, as it best suiteth with their good
like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52398:6"/> 
               <hi>Furthermore,</hi> It is commonly said, that
since the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> have gathered Churches out of Churches, there
are not many true and proper <hi>Disciplinarians</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be so, then <hi>Independency</hi> is amongst
<hi>Dissenters,</hi> the prevalent side; and I know not how a <hi>National
Church</hi> can be made up of Separate Independent Churches; for each
Congregation is a Church by it self, and hath, besides the general Covenant of
Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, a particular Church-Covenant; and therefore, it is difficult to
imagine how all of them can be, by any Coherence of the Parts, united into one
intire So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>But, be it supposed, that the <hi>Disciplinarians</hi> are of all
Parties, the most numerous and prevalent; yet <hi>Experience</hi> sheweth how
hard a Work it is for all of them to form themselves into a Church of
<hi>England.</hi> In the late times of Publick disquiet, they had great Power;
they had in humane appearance, fair and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising Opportunities; and yet there
grew up at their Roots another Party, which, in Conclusion, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropped them,
and brought their Interest into a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble decay; it being the nature of every
Faction, upon Victory obtain'd over their Common Adversary, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divide. In
the Year 1640,<note n="*" place="margin">July 17. 1640. <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s
  Memorials p. 45.</note> 
               <hi>The Commons had a debate about a new form of
Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction: And they agreed that every Shire should be a
several Diocess. That there should be constituted, in each Shire, a</hi>
Presbytery <hi>of Twelve Divines, with a President as a Bishop over them, That
this President with the Assistance of some of the</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, <hi>should
Ordain, Suspend, Deprive, Degrade, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. That there should be a</hi>
Diocesan Synod <hi>once a Year; and each third Year, a</hi> National Synod.
<hi>A while after,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">A. 1644. Id. ibid. p.
  117.</note> 
               <hi>it was voted by them, that, to have a</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery <hi>in

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52398:6"/> Many other Steps were made in favour of the
Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. The <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> was removed; an Assembly of
Divines was Established: Their Directory was introduced; they were united in
the Bond of a solemn League and Covenant. There was sent up<note n="*" place="margin">

the County of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> a Petition signed with 12000 Hands for the

it self, a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dissension. Mr. <hi>Sympson,</hi> and some others,
favoured an <hi>Independent;</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and some of his Admirers,
an <hi>Erastian</hi> Interest. There was a Party in the Nation who were then
called <hi>Dissenting Brethren;</hi> and to these the Directory was as
offensive, as the Canons and Liturgy had been to those of the
<hi>Discipline.</hi> They drew up Reasons<note n="*" place="margin">Id. ib.
  <hi>p.</hi> 116. A. 44.</note> against <hi>the Directory of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by</hi> Presbyters.</p>
            <p>They afterwards Printed an open Remonstrance <hi>against</hi>
Presbytery,<note place="margin">Ib. A. 45. p. 189.</note> 
               <hi>of which the
Assembly complain'd to the House, as of a Scandalous Libel.</hi> And there were
those who Reproach'd the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in the same Phrases in which
they had given vent to their displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against the Liturgy of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> The Ministers of <hi>Lancashire</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Harm Consent. <hi>p.</hi> 20.</note> complain'd concerning them,
<hi>That they had compared the</hi> Covenant <hi>to the</hi> Alcoran <hi>of

            <p>Other Historical Memorials might be here produced, relating to the
hopeful <hi>Rise,</hi> and mighty <hi>Progress,</hi> and equal
<hi>Declension</hi> of the <hi>Disciplinarian Party.</hi> But, in such cases, I
choose rather to take of my Pen, then to lean too hard upon it. Yet the nature
of my <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> did necessarily lead me to the former Remarks; and if
useful Truth smarts, let Guilt suffer a Cure, and not kick against the
Charitable Reporter.</p>
            <p>In Sum, the longer the Church of <hi>England</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled,
the greater daily grew the confusion; and the division of Sects was multiplyed
not unlike to that of Winds in the Marriners Compass, in which Artists have
increas'd the Partitions, from four to two and thirty. Insomuch, that the very
Distractions which were among us did, in some measure, prepare the way for the
return of the King, and the Restitution of the Church: men finding no other
common Bottom on which the Interests of Religion and civil Peace might be
established.</p>
            <p>Now, if the Dissenters could not then, when so fair Opportunities
were in their hands, carry on their cause to any tolerable Settlement; much
less may they now hope to do it. For there are now, many hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances which did
not then lie cross their way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Platform of Discipline, so highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded,
so earnestly contended for, during the Reigns of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> and
King <hi>Iames,</hi> hath now been in part tryed; and the presence of it (to
omit other Reasons) hath abated the Reverence some had for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is not at this time, such an Union
amongst Dissenters, as appeared at the beginning of our late Troubles. The
number of those Dissenters <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52398:8"/> who were not for the
<hi>Discipline,</hi> was then very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable. But in a few years, they
brake, as it were, into Fractions of Fractions. Insomuch, that the
<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> of the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> expressed the
Estate of things in the Year 47, on this manner.<note n="*" place="margin">Testim. to the Truth of I. Chr. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note> 
               <hi>Instead
of Vnity and Vniformity, in Matters of Religion, we are torn in pieces with
Distractions, Schisms, Separations, Divisions, and Subdivisions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Those who then favoured the <hi>Discipline,</hi>
are much departed from their former Scheme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, inclining to
<hi>Independency,</hi> which they once denyed to be <hi>God's
Ordinance</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

once called, The <hi>last and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hold of</hi> Satan.<note n="‖" place="margin">The Title of Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>'s book. 1647. See Testim. of
  <hi>Min.</hi> p. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> At the beginning of our Disturbances, many Men
of Quality, and such who had a Zeal of God, favour'd the Settlement of the
<hi>Discipline</hi> in the simplicity of their hearts. They had not then seen
any Revolutions; they had not discovered the secret Springs of publick Motions;
nor the vile Interests of many men which lay concealed under the disguise of
<hi>Pure Religion.</hi> They saw (what all Men may see in all times) abuses in
Church and State; and the very name of <hi>Reformation</hi> was sweet to
them.</p>
            <p>Now, notwithstanding the sincere zeal and the power of these Men,
the <hi>Discipline</hi> could not long be carried on; much less could it be
perfected by them.</p>
            <p>There is, therefore, at this time, a much greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability
of Success in the like design. For many considerable men, Piously inclin'd,
have seen their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and will not be a second time engaged: And they will
not say of our late changes, as the Protector did, 
<note n="*" place="margin">Oliver's <hi>Speech in the</hi>
  Painted Chamber. <hi>Ian.</hi> 22. 54 at the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv.</hi> of the
  <hi>Parl.</hi> p. 29. 33.</note> 
               <hi>That they were the Revolutions of God, and
not humane designs; That they were the Revolutions of Christ upon whose
Shoulders the Government was stayed.</hi> They are <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52398:9"/> not of
the same mind with him who told the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, 
<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryl</hi> in Ep. Ded. bef.

               <hi>That if they
acted Faith, then the Records of those Times on their side, should bear thus to
all Posterity, the Book of the Wars and Counsels of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also, since those days, through the laxation of Discipline during
the licence of the War, the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of great and black Hypocrisies, the
multiplication of Parties and Opinions, the publishing of many lewd and
irreligious books from Unlicens'd Presses, <hi>Atheism</hi> hath made very
formidable Advances. And they say, that some undisguised <hi>Sceptics</hi> and
<hi>Atheists</hi> have, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times since the King's Return, been much used in
the Cause of our Dissenters. Now, if well meaning zeal could not establish the
Discipline, it is not likely to be promoted, much less settled, by the help of
such hands of which the outsides are not washed by so much as an External form
of Godliness.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Branch</hi> of the first End of Dissenters,<note place="margin">The s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cond Branch of the 1st End
  of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters. <hi>viz.</hi> Union by mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.</note> seems
more improbable then the first, <hi>viz.</hi> The settling themselves as
several distinct Parties, giving undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed Toleration to each other.</p>
            <p>This seems not probable upon many accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Some Dissenters believe some of the Parties to be
incapable of Forbearance, as maintaining Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples destructive of Christian
Faith and Piety. This Opinion they still have (for instance sake) of
<hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Muggletonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they formerly declamed against the Toleration of divers
others. They publish'd here (by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so called) an Act of the Assembly at
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi>

            <p>The Ministers of the <hi>Province</hi> within the <hi>County

the Ministers of the Province of <hi>London,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd their Judgments in
these zealous Words. <hi>A To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration would be a putting of a Sword into a

for the Devil to fly to—<hi>A proclaiming Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the Wolves to come
into Christ's Fold to</hi> prey upon his Lambs—<hi>A Toleration of
Soul-murther (the greatest murther of all others) and for the establishing
whereof, damned Souls in Hell would accurse Men on Earth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would it
be</hi> to provide for tender Consciences, but to take away all
Conscience.—<hi>If error be not</hi> forcibly <hi>kept under, it will
be</hi> Superior.</p>
            <p>It seems, they were not then of the later Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the

in this Land, <hi>That they were All</hi> the Flock of Christ, <hi>and the</hi>
Lambs of Christ, <hi>though perhaps under many unruly Passions and Troubles of
Spirit whereby they gave</hi> disquiet <hi>to</hi> themselves and others:
<hi>And that they were not so to God as to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> There is no firmness or social influence in the
nature of this Union. It is the Union of a multitude who meet and disperse at
pleasure. and he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth this way as the means to knit Men into
Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Communion, is like a Projector who should design the keeping of the
stones together in the strength of a firm and lasting House, by for bearing the
use of <hi>Cement.</hi> The Union that lasteth, is that of the Concord of
Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in an Uniform Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover,</hi> It is to be consider'd, that there are no
Parties in this or any other Nation, so exactly poised, that they have equal
<hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Interests.</hi> There is <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52398:10"/> always
one of them which over-ballanceth the rest. And one of the several ways must
always be favoured as the Religion of the State. And it is natural for the
strongest side to attempt the subduing of the weaker. And though this be not
soon effected; yet 'till one side getteth the mastery, the Parties remain, not
as distinct Bodies settled in peace within themselves, and towards each other,
but as Convulsions in the common body of the State.</p>
            <p>Some think this Inclination to the swallowing up of all other
Parties to be found almost only in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>But there is something of it to be discerned (I will not say in
all Churches, seeing I well understand the good Temper of our own which
suffered <hi>Bonner</hi> himself to live) yet in all Factions and Parties;
though the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of Power makes it not seem to be alike in all of
them.</p>
            <p>The Catt hath the same inward Parts with the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they
differ much in size: And some such likeness they will find who dissect humane
nature, and Bodies civil.</p>
            <p>There is this Disposition in Men, whether they be the Politick, or
the Conscientious.</p>
            <p>The External practice of all Parties is answerable to this inward
Disposition.</p>
            <p>There is this inward Disposition in men who espouse any Faction,
whether their Ends be designs of State, or of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Parties who are not (otherwise then in shew) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for
Religion, will perpetually covet Power af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Power. And Parties who are
serious and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious in their way, whatsoever it is; will not remain in
an indifference of tempers towards thosewho treadin contrary Paths, and with
whom they do not maintain <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52398:10"/> Communion. For therefore they
with draw from them, because they believe Communion with them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
Otherwise they have no Judgment in the price of Peace and Unity, if they
willingly part with it, when they may, without sin, enjoy it: and if they
esteem their way sinful, and believe those persons who remain without their
pale, to be so gone astray, as without Repentance, to be eternally lost;
Charity it self will urge them to use all means probable towards the reducing
of them. And they will be apt to think, that the suffering of them in their
Wandrings, declares them to be contented with their Perdition.</p>
            <p>The External Practice of all Parties do's shew plainly what is
their inward Disposition.</p>
            <p>All would do what is good in their own eyes; but I do not perceive
that any are willing to let others do so. Where there is Power, there is little
Forbearance: And the same men, as their Conditions alter, speak of
<hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Iustice.</hi>

good intelligence. They desired to go thither in order to the further
instruction of the <hi>American-people,</hi> and the education of Youth. They
obtained leave, procured Letters of Credence, were furnished with money for the

commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble end. And I heartily pray to God to prosper all Christians who
persue it by fit and lawful ways.</p>
            <p>But the Methods of <hi>Dissenters</hi> do not so well lead to it
as those of the established Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bare Reason</hi> maketh this manifest. It may be also proved
to us by <hi>Historical Inference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This likewise, is the <hi>Iudgment of the</hi> Papists

shall enter in through the Breaches of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, Common Reason</hi> sheweth, that the Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, may be Dissension, be given to this Church, will rather weaken, then
improve the <hi>Protestant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</hi> both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abroad,</hi> the Protestant Interest will suffer much, in the
overthrow of this Church. For, by such means, a principal Wheel is taken out of
the Frame of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Nay, <hi>Signior Diodati</hi>

               </note> was wont to praise it in a more
excellent Metaphor, and to call it the Eye <hi>of the Reformed Churches;</hi>
and it is plain to considering Men that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which
had greater regard to the Primitive Pattern than some others of the
Reformation, can give a more full and unperplexed <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52398:12"/> answer
to all the Objections of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> then some other Churches, who
are cramped in a few points unwarily admitted. If therefore Dissentions put out
this eye of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches, the dark Doctrines and Traditions
of Popery will the sooner spread themselves over Reformed
<hi>Christendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At Home,</hi> the Dissettlement of the Church of
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will sooner introduce then root out Poperty. I am constrain'd
thus to judge by the following Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The design of keeping out Popery by the Ruine of
this Church, is like the preposterous way, of securing the Vineyard by pulling
up of the Fence; or of keeping out the Enemy by the removal of our
<hi>Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark.</hi> Under that name this Church is commonly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and
they do not flatter it who give it that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Its Constitution is Christian,
and it is strong in its Nature; and if such a Church hath not ability (with
God's assistance) to resist the assaults of <hi>Romish Power,</hi> much less
have they who dissent from it. And it is <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism</hi> properly so
called, or Religious <hi>Frenzie,</hi> to lay aside a more probable means, and
to trust that God will give, to means which are much less probable,
super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aid and success.</p>
            <p>God supporteth a good Cause by weak means (if they are the only
means he hath put into our power) agaisnt a bad Cause though externally potent.
But he, who in cases of emergence assisteth honest Impotence and Infirmity,
will never work Miracles in favour of Mens Presumptions and Indiscretions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanists</hi> are a mighty body of Men; and, though there
are Intestine Fewds betwixt the Secular and Regular Clergy, as likewise betwixt
the several Orders, yet they are all united into one common Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and
grafted into that one stock of the Papal Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52398:13"/> They
are favoured in many places by great Men; they have variety of Learning; they
pretend to great Antiquity, to Miracles, to Martyrs without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to
extraordinary Charity and Mortification; they have the Nerves of worldly Power,
that is, banks of Money, and a large Revenue: They have a Scheme of Policy
always in readiness; there are great numbers of Emissaries posted in all places
for the conveying of intelligence, and the gaining of Proselytes; they take
upon them all shapes, and are bred to all the worldly Arts of Insinuation.
There is given to their way, in the <hi>Iargon</hi> of Mr.
<hi>Coleman</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Coll. of Lett. <hi>p.</hi> 8.
  &amp;c.</note>, a very fit name of <hi>Trade, Traffick, Merchandize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against all this Craft and Strength, what (under God) can
<hi>Protestants</hi> oppose which is equal to the Power of the Church of
<hi>England?</hi> A Church Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, learned, pure, and not embased with the
mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> or Superstition.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Church, which</hi> is able to detect the Forgeries and
Impostures of <hi>Rome; which</hi> hath not given advantage to her by running
from her into any extream; <hi>which</hi> is a National Body already formed; a
<hi>Body</hi> both <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> and <hi>Legal;</hi> a <hi>Body</hi>
which commendeth it self to the Civil Powers by the Loyalty of its
Constitution; a Body which hath in it great numbers of People judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
devout, and who are judged only to be few<note n="*" place="margin">See
  <hi>L. de Moulin's</hi> Advances, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 26.</note>, because they
are not noysie, but prudent, though tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exemplary, in their Religion.</p>
            <p>And, there is in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> something more
considerable then number; for Union is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then Multitude. Take the
Character of this Church from <hi>Monsieur Daille</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">De Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. Advers. <hi>H. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi> c. 1. p. 97,
  98.</note>, a Man whose Circumstances were not likely to lead him, in this
matter, into any partiality of judgment; and who, at that time, was engag'd in
a learned Controversy with one of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52398:13"/> The
Character is this. <hi>As to the Church of</hi> England, <hi>purged from
Forrein wicked Superstitious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships and Errours, either Impious or
dangerous, by the Rule of the Divine Scriptures; approved by so many and such
illustrious Martyrs; abounding with Piety towards God, and Charity towards</hi>
Men, <hi>and with most frequent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of good works; flourishing with an
increase of most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wise men from the beginning of the Reformation to
this time; I have always had it in just esteem, and till I die, I shall
continue in the same due Veneration of it. And,</hi> indeed it is to me a
matter of astonishment, that any men who have been beyond the Seas, and made
Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations upon other Churches and States, should be displeased at
<hi>Ours</hi> which so much excel them.</p>
            <p>Now, is it probable that such a Church as this is, should have
less strength in it for the resisting of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, then an inferior number of
divided Parties, of which the most Sober and most Accomplish'd, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so
Primitive, nor so learned, nor so united, nor so numerous, nor so legal: And
against which it will be objected by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that it is of
Yesterday?</p>
            <p>Amongst these Parties, <hi>there are some who have not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared themselves.</hi> And who knows whether they have not a Reserve for the
<hi>Romish</hi> Religion, against a favourable Opportunity, though sometimes
they speak of <hi>Rome</hi> as of <hi>Babylon?</hi> I mean those People who are
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who speak in general of their <hi>Light;</hi> and in
such doubtful manner, that Inquisitive Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet understand from what
quarter of the Heavens it shineth. The Men of design amongst them may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
any Religion, and the melancholy will make a tolerable Order amongst the
<hi>Romans;</hi> and the Priests will find for them a second St.
<hi>Bruno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52398:14"/> 
               <hi>Again,</hi> There are some who though
they have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselves against Popery, yet they have scarce any formed
way of keeping it out. For what hindreth a crafty Jesuite from gathering a
particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of many others, and modelling of it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
according to his pleasure? and what a gap do they leave open for Seducers, who
take out of the way all Legal Tests, and admit Men who are Strangers to them to
officiate amongst them upon bare pretence of Spiritual Illumination?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furthermore,</hi> the <hi>Romanists</hi> have more powerful
ways of drawing Men from the Parties of the <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> then they
have of enticing them from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for such Men (too
frequently) go out from us through weakness of imagination, for which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath variety of Gratifications.</p>
            <p>They will offer, to the <hi>Severe,</hi> such strictnesses as are
not consistent with the general Laws of a National Church, which being framed
for Men of such various <hi>Conditions,</hi> must have some Scope and Latitude,

there might have been a Diversity here (I mean such as there is in our present

<hi>Romish</hi> Preacher comes forth out of an obscure Cloyster into the
Pulpit, and appears all heavenly in the Exercise: And having excited a warmth
in their affection, he retires again, and does not mix with Conversation, and
is not observed (as other Ministers) by many eyes; and the People never seeing
him but in this Divine Figure, look upon him as an Angel coming to them out of
Heaven, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thither again.</p>
            <p>It may be observed, also, that the <hi>Romanists</hi> have greater
<hi>shews of self-denial</hi> for the moving of <hi>English</hi> Pity, then the
<hi>Dissenters.</hi> They have rough Cords, mean Garments, bare Feet,
Disciplines, Whips, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of not touching Money, or enjoying Property;
though some of these are often no other then Arts used by ordinary Beggars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> they have ways, not only of humouring the
<hi>infirmity,</hi> but even the <hi>Foppishness</hi> of Humane Nature.
<hi>Processions</hi> and other Rites of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion are 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52398:15"/> so ordered as to be Games for Diversion; and the <hi>Mass
with Scenes</hi> pleaseth, though it be not understood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dissenters</hi> do now think, that Popery may be very easily
subdued by their Arms: But if Recluses were once crept out of their dark Cells
(as Serpents from under the deadly night-shade) they would have cause to alter
their Opinions, and not to think too highly of themselves, after a wilful
removal of the Church of <hi>England</hi> which is sufficient (under God) for
this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. This Church designs to make Men good by making them first
Judicious, as far as means can do it. But some others desire to bring them to
their side by catching of their Imaginations; and by that way they can neither
reform nor fix them. Some new Device shall, in time, bring them over to a new
Party.</p>
            <p>Dissention it self amongst <hi>Protestants</hi> weakneth their
Interest; and that which weakens one side, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens another.</p>
            <p>And many men, entangled in Controversy, and wearied with endless
wrangling, are too apt, for mere ease and quiet sake, to cast themselves, in
servile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, into the Arms of pretended <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Dissentions have already introduced too much of that which is
the very spirit of <hi>Iesuitism,</hi> the doing of Evil that pretended Good
may come of it; the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a Cause by any means, whether they be just or
unjust.</p>
            <p>Some Dissenters do accidently prepare the way for <hi>Romish</hi>
Religion by running into an other extream upon pretence of avoiding Popery; by
decrying the Church of <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Antichristian</hi> and
<hi>Popish;</hi> and by condemning that as <hi>Popish</hi> which is Christian
and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. [As, Episcopacy, Liturgy, Observation of the Nativity of Christ,
and other Festivals, Reverence of bodily Gesture, particularly in receiving the
Holy <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52398:15"/> Communion; Preservation of places and things set
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for Holy uses, with reverend care.] By this means they bring Popery into
Reputation. Men will be apt to say, if such a Body as the Church of
<hi>England</hi> be <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish,</hi> it is fit we set down and consider of it;
for sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are not so inclined without weighty Reasons. If the Clergy of
it be inclined to that Religion the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of which, together with great
numbers of the Popish-Clergy, will diminish their preferment; it must be the
Power of Truth which moveth them against their worldly Interest. They will
continue their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and say further; if such good things as these
abovementioned be <hi>Romish,</hi> and it be lawful to judge of the whole by
the parts of it which are before us, surely that which is <hi>Popish</hi> is
also Primitive and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical. That which we have examin'd is good, and that
which we have not, may probably be of the same kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the History of our late Revolutions shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that Popery will not be smother'd in the Ruines of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> but rather be advanced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>It made great Progress in the late Times; insomuch, that the
Dissenters do remove the Odium of the late King's execrable Murther from
themselves, and lay it upon the <hi>Iesuites;</hi> thereby tacitly
acknowledging that they had so great a power over some of them, as to make them
to become their Instruments for the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Lord's Anointed.</hi>
For if they will not allow <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Ireton</hi> and some
others of that Order, to have been Dissenters, properly so called; yet
certainly they must not deny that Name to Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn
Goodwin</hi> and many like to them, who appeared pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in that very black
and insolent wickedness. How far it is true that the Jesuits influenc'd those
Counsels, <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52398:16"/> I do not now examine, nor do's my Talent lie in
My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of State. But that in the late Revolutions, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery was not rooted

            <p>This Church was still in being, though in Adversity. She had
strong Vitals and did not die, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was some Distemper in her
Estate. There was still a Constitution where Primitive order and decencie might
be found, and in which Men of Sobriety might be fixed. And great numbers of the
Church-men, by their constant adherence to their Principles, under publick
contempt and heavy pressure, gained daily on the People, and convinced the
World that they were not so <hi>Popish</hi> and Earthly-minded as popular
clamour had represented them. Also, their learned Books and Conferences reduced
some, and establish'd many, and we owe a part of the stability of Men in those
times to God's blessing on the Writings of Arch-bishop <hi>Land,</hi> Mr.

            </p>
            <p>But neither in this is their expectation likely to be
answer'd.</p>
            <p>For First, <hi>The means towards the settling of themselves is the
Dissettlement of that which is well fixed.</hi> And this is the way, not to a
greater purity in Religion, but to the corruption of it.</p>
            <p>For, it removeth Charity which is the Spirit of the Christian
Religion. It letteth loose great numbers who cannot govern themselves; it
moveth <hi>Unbelievers, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> to pour Contempt
upon the Church of Christ; and confirmeth them in their evil course. It
exposeth the Church as a Prey to the Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Thus the Divisions in
<hi>Africa</hi> gave encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Arms of the barbarous Nations; and
those, in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Churches, made way for the <hi>Saracens.</hi>
And the Proposal of the maintenance of Charity and pure Religion by the
overthrow of a tolerable Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Constitution, is as improbable a
Project as that of <hi>Flammock;</hi> who, in <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th's
time,<note n="*" place="margin">L. Bac. H. 7. p 164.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a
Rebellion without a breach of the Peace.</p>
            <p>And it is here to be considered, that those who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from a
National Church, do generally make use of such Junctures, as are apter to
debase, then refine Religion. They often move for Alterations in the Church
when there is a great heat and ferment in the State: And in such Seasons, the
Form of a Church may be pulled in sunder, but there is not temper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and
coolness of unbyass'd consideration to set it together to advantage. Such times
are the Junctures of State Dissenters, and amongst them Revolutions ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
begin, though without the pretence of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, they are not carried
on amongst the <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52398:18"/> People. For it will not serve their purpose
to say plainly, they are against the Government, because the Government is
against their <hi>Interests.</hi> Now, when well meaning Dissenters are in the
hands of such worldly Power, they will not be able to establish what they think
is purest, but that which pleaseth their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Leaders. A change in the

can secure the Event for the better? The words of Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi>

Reign of K <hi>Iames,</hi> touch this Point, and they doubtless are worth our
observation. <hi>When</hi> (said he) <hi>they have made the State present
naught, no Remedy; we must have a better for it, and so a change needs: What
Change? Why! Religion, or the Church-Government, or somewhat (they know not
what well): stand a while, ye shall change your Religion (said they of this day
[the</hi> Gun-powder-Traytors]) <hi>and have one for it wherein, to your
comfort, you shall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand a word (not you of the People) what you
either sing or pray; and for variety, you shall change a whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for
an half. Now, a blessed exchange, were it not? What say some others? You shall
change for a fine new Church-Government; a</hi> Presbytery <hi>would do this
better for you than an</hi> Hierarchy, <hi>and (perhaps) not long after, a
Government of States, then a Monarchy. Meddle not with these Changers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when a State is either disturb'd or dissolv'd, men cannot
foresee all the ill Consequences of it. When the Vessel is stirr'd, the Lees
come up, which lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore undiscerned in the Mass of the Liquor. And so it is
in Religion; it is not fined, but rather render'd less pure, by motions in the
Body Spiritual or Civil. Then Politicians use conscientious Instruments no
further then they serve a present purpose; and for new Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they find new
Instruments. One of the Assembly <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52398:19"/> of Divines<note n="*" place="margin">D. <hi>J. L.</hi> on Psal. 4. 4. Feb. 24. <hi>A.</hi> 1647.</note>
discoursed, on this manner, at a publick Fast. <hi>Have not these Trumpets and
these poor Pitchers had their share, and a good share too, in bringing down the
Walls of</hi> Jericho, <hi>and the Camp of</hi> Midian? <hi>and have not they
(like the Story in</hi> Ezekiel) <hi>if I may so express it,</hi> Prophesy'd
you up an Army? <hi>The Witness of these things is in the whole Kingdom, and a
Witness of them is in your own Bosomes.</hi> Yet the Preacher was very
sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the same time, that those whom they had help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Power, were
turning it against them, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to pieces by dashing
<hi>Independency</hi> against them. Aspiring Men make fair Promises, till they
have gained their point; but when that is once secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they take other
Measures. They say<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Melvil</hi>'s Mem. p

<hi>Empire,</hi> used secret <hi>Preachings</hi> to please the <hi>Protestant
Princes</hi> [the <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> the <hi>Dukes</hi> of
<hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh;</hi>] and went openly to <hi>Mass</hi>
to please the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bishops</hi> of <hi>Mentzs, Triers,</hi> and
<hi>Collein.</hi> Also, the claims of the worldly increase with their Power:
And (for illustration-sake) when the <hi>House,</hi> being garbell'd had much
less <hi>right</hi> but more <hi>force</hi> (the Army as yet agreeing with them
and the good King being in their hands) then they gave to the Declarations of
their Pleasure the Title, not as before of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> but of
<hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi>

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52398:19"/> By such means it comes to pass, that the

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It appeareth, by the <hi>History of our late

fit (left we partake in other Mens sins, and thereby be in danger to receive of

Blasphemies, and damnable Heresies vented and spread abroad therein, tending to
the Subversion of the Faith, contempt of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry and Ordinance of
<hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Ministers <hi>made a like acknowledgment,
saying,</hi> Instead<note n="‖‖" place="margin">Testlm. to Truth of
  <hi>I. Chr.</hi> p. 31.</note> of extirpating Heresie, Schism, Profaness; we
have such an impudent and general inundation of all these evils, that
Multitudes are not asham'd, to press and plead for publick, formal, and
universal Toleration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again,</hi> We the Ministers of Iesus Christ, do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
testify to all our Flocks, to all the Kingdom, and to all the Reformed
Churches, as our great dislike of Prelacy, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastianism, Brownism, and
Independency; so our utter abhorrence of Anti-Scripturism, <hi>Popery,</hi>
Arianism, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism, Arminianism, Antinomianism, Anabaptism, Libertinism,
and Familism; with all such like, now <hi>too rise</hi> among us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> some Dissenters, by the <hi>Purity of
Religion,</hi> mean agreeableness of Doctrine, Discipline, and Life, to the
dispensation of the New Testament, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of humane Inventions: and
thus far the Notion is true; but, with reference to our Church, it is an
unwarrantable Reflexion. For it hath but one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Rule, and that is the
Holy Scripture; and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate rules in pursuance of the general Canons in
Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ, are not to be called in our Church, any more then in the pure and
Primitive Christian Church, whose Pattern it follows, humane Imaginations, but
rules of Ecclesiastical Wisdom and Discretion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52398:20"/> But there are others among the Dissenters,
who, by the <hi>Purity of Religion,</hi> mean a simplicity as oppos'd to
composition, and not to such mixtures as corrupt the Circumstances, or parts of
Worship which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are pure. <hi>Quakers</hi> and some others believe
their way the purer, because they have taken out of it Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and External
Forms of Worship, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured (as they phrase it<note n="*" place="margin">G. Fox <hi>in.</hi> J. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot<hi>'s Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things brought to
  light.</hi> p. 11.</note>) <hi>to bring the Peoples minds out of all
Visibles.</hi> By equal reason the <hi>Papists</hi> may say their Eucharist is
more pure then that of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> because they have taken the
Cup from it. But that which maketh a pure Church, is like that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a
pure Medicine; not the sewness of the <hi>Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> but the good
quality of them how many soever they be; and the <hi>aptness</hi> of their
Nature for the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Health.</p>
            <p>Men <hi>who have this false</hi> Notion <hi>of the purity of
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, distill it till it evaporates; and all that is left is a dead and
corrupt Sediment. And here I have judged the following words of Sir</hi> Walter
Rauleigh <hi>not unfit to be by me transcribed, and considered by all.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Hist. of the <hi>World. l. 2. 1. part
  c. 5. p.</hi> 249.</note> The Reverend Care which <hi>Moses</hi> had in all
that belong'd even to the outward and least parts of the Tabernacle, Ark, and
Sanctury—is now so forgotten and cast away in this <hi>Superfine
Age,</hi> by those of the Family, by the Anabaptist, Brownist, and other
Sectaries, as all cost and care bestow'd and had of the Church, wherein God is
to be served and worshipped, is accounted a kind of <hi>Popery,</hi> and as
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an Idolatrous Disposition: Insomuch, as time would soon bring
to pass (if it were not resisted) that God would be turned out of Churches into
Barnes, and from thence again into the Fields and Mountains, and under the
Hedges; and the Officers of the Ministry (robbed of all Dignity and Respect) be
as contemptible as these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; all Order, Discipline, and Church-Government
left <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52398:21"/> to newness of Opinion, and Men's Fancies: Yea, and
soon after, as many kinds of Religions would spring up as there are
Parish-Churches within <hi>England:</hi> Every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious and ignorant person
clothing his Fancy with the Spirit of God, and his Imagination with the gift of
Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; insomuch, as when the truth, which is but One, shall appear to the
simple multitude, no less variable then contrary to it self, the Faith of Men
will soon after dye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by degrees, and all Religion be held in scorn and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If several contrary Parties be established by
way of sufferance; no progress is likely to be made towards the perfecting of
Religion. For the suffering of divers Errors is not the way to the reforming of
them. One Principle only can be true; and the blending of such as are contrary
with it, createth the greatest of ties; a mixture of that which is profane,
with that which is sacred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Many <hi>Dissenters</hi> are not likely to erect
a Model by which Christianity may be improved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, because they lay
aside Rules of discretion, and rely not on God's assistance in the use of good
means, but depend wholly upon immediate illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the aids of
Prudence: And some of the more sober amongst them, have inclined too much
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this extream.</p>
            <p>In Reformation (<hi>said one</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mr.
  <hi>S. Sympson</hi> In A. 1643. Reform. Preservat. pl 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>in his
Sermon before the</hi> Commons) do not make reason your Rule nor Line you go
by. It is the line of all the <hi>Papists.</hi>—The second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant doth
forbid, <hi>not only</hi> Reason, <hi>but all</hi> Divine Reason, that is not
contain'd by Institution in the Worship of God.—God's Worship hath no
ground in any reason but God's Will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52398:21"/> 
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There are already provided
in this Church, more probable means for the promoting of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then
those which have been proposed by all or any of the Dissenting Parties. It is
true, each Church is capable of improvement, by the change of obsolete Words,
Phrases, and Customs; by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Forms upon new Occasions; by
adjusting discreetly some Circumstantials of External Order. But, to change the
Present Model for any other that has yet been offered to publick consideration,
is to make a very <hi>injudicious bargain.</hi> There are in it, all the
necessaries to Faith and Godliness; there is preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Primitive Discipline,
Decency, and Order: And, under the means of it, there are great numbers grown
up into such an improvement of Judicious Knowledge and useful, prudent, serious
Piety; that it requireth a Laborious Scrutiny to find Parallels to them in any
Nation under the Heavens.</p>
            <p>I do not take pleasure in distastful Comparisons. Yet I ought not
(sure) to pass by with unthankful negligence, that excellent Spirit which God
hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up among the Writers and Preachers of this Church; their labours
being so instrumental towards the right information of the Judgment, and the
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of the Lives of unprejudic'd Hearers.</p>
            <p>It must be confessed, that there is some trifling on all sides:
And it will be so whilst Men are Men. But there is now (blessed be God) as
little of it in the Church of <hi>England</hi> as in any Age. And the very few
who do it, appear plainly to be what they are, Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticks, and Actors,
rather then Preachers. But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Parties, the folly and weakness puts
on a more venerable pretence, and they give vent to it with studied shews of
mighty seriousness, and deliver it so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly as the immediate dictate of God's
Holy Spirit. <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52398:22"/> And I cannot call to mind one Minister in
this Church, who would (for instance sake) have delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately used these words
of Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> in a solemn audience,<note n="*" place="margin">Ruth. <hi>on</hi> Dan. 6. 26. <hi>p.</hi> 8. A. 1643. bes. the
  Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> and after his <hi>solemn</hi> manner. <hi>God permits Sins,
and such Sins, that there may be room in the Play for pardoning Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seemeth also, not unfit for me to take notice, that the Changes
formerly made in Church-matters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Dissenters, were not so
conducive in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the edifying of the Body of Christ, as the
things illegally removed. The Doctrine of <hi>God's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret decrees</hi> taught
in their <hi>Catechisms,</hi> was a stronger and more improper kind of meat
then that with which the Church of <hi>England</hi> had fed her Children.
<hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a Bishop,</hi> accompany'd with <hi>Presbyters,</hi> was
more certain and satisfactory then that by <hi>Presbyters</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a
Bishop.</p>
            <p>There was not that sobriety in many of the present and
<hi>unstudied Effusions,</hi> which appeared in every of those publick Forms
which were considered and fixed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it sounded more decently (for example
sake) to pray in the Churches words, and say, from <hi>Fornication Good Lord
deliver us;</hi> then to use those of an eminent Dissenter,<note n="*" place="margin">Prayers at the end of Farewell Sermons. Mr. U's Prayer bef. Serm.

            <p>Neither did it tend less to edification, to repeat the <hi>Creed

            <p>Neither was the Alteration of the Form of giving the Holy

            <p>Nor did the forbidding the Observation of Christ's Nativity and

               <p>IF then, Dissenters are not likely to obtain their Ends; of
  Establishing themselves, of rooting out of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and promoting pure
  Religion, by overthrowing the Church of <hi>England;</hi> the
  <hi>Inference</hi> is natural, they ought, both in Prudence and Christianity,
  to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after <hi>Vnion</hi> with it.</p>
               <p>They will (it may be) say to me, can Men be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded two

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Though a Man cannot at the same time whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

  to the People, carry a great Club in their <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52398:23"/> hand. But
  neither do I think that the best way to remove pernitious error from Men, is
  never to give them any disturbance in it.</p>
               <p>I have <hi>two things</hi> only to recommend, first to the
  <hi>consideration,</hi> and then to the practice of such as
  <hi>Dissent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This is a time of <hi>Prosecution,</hi> and a
  time of <hi>Adversity</hi> is a proper time for <hi>Consideration,</hi> and
  <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> is a means to make us hold fast that which is good, and
  reject that which is evil. I beseech you, make such advantage of this Juncture.
  Sit down, and think once more of the Nature of this Church. Confer with the
  Guides of the National Religion; read without prejudice, the Books commended by
  them to you. Peruse seriously the Books which Authority hath set forth. Some
  who have spoken against them, have by their own <hi>confession,</hi> never read
  them. Examine, and Judge. Many of your Scruples have arisen from what you have
  heard, and read; they would not have otherwise been ingendred in your Minds.
  Hear and Read for your Information, as well as your entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Do as much as you can do. Do as much as the
  <hi>Dissenters,</hi> who are most eminent for Learning, Piety, Preaching,
  Writing, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>and</hi> Fame; sometimes actually do. They have owned
  our Communion to be lawful.<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Lawf.</hi> of

  <pb facs="tcp:52398:24"/> have bred up Children to the Ministry of this Church. They have
  joyned in the Liturgy. They have been Married according to the Form of it. Nay,
  one who assisted in making the <hi>Directory,</hi> would have his own Daughter
  (in those times) be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the way of the Book of Common-Prayer.<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi> in Hist. of Indep. 1

  <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>Praying,</hi> which is better liked, can ballance
  the evil of Separation from a Church, which imposeth no terms of Communion
  which are sinful.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Peace</hi> sake, let that be more constant, in which
  your <hi>Conscience</hi> alloweth occasional exercise. A <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> who
  joyns himself to any established Church, and also to any Churches which are set
  up, not as legal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of it, but as Forts against it, seems to be a
  kind of <hi>Wooden Legg;</hi> if I may represent so grave a matter by so light
  a Similitude. He is tyed on, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, at pleasure; he is not as, by
  natural Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <pb n="43" facs="tcp:52398:24"/> and Nerves, knit to such Ecclesiastical
  Bodies. If all would do constantly what they can <hi>in Conscience</hi> do
  sometimes, they would create a better Opinion of themselves, in the
  <hi>Governours,</hi> and move them to all due favour, and hinder all the
  destructive breaches amongst us. For the remain of other Dissenters would be so
  <hi>inconsiderable,</hi> as to abide in the Body of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as
  ill humors thrown off to the extream parts, from which there may arise some
  little pain, but no mortal danger.</p>
               <p>Now, the God of <hi>Peace</hi> grant <hi>Peace</hi> to us
  always, by all fit means.</p>
