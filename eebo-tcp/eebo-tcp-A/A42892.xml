            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Diſcourſe ſetting forth the unhappy Condition
of the Practice of Phyſick in London, and
offering ſome means to put it into a better; for
the Intereſt of Patients, no leſs, or rather much
more, then of Phyſicians.</head>
            <p>THE Art of Phyſick hath had in
common with other Arts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
the infelicity to be abuſed
by the Profeſſors thereof; who,
either out of inſatiable avarice to make the
utmoſt advantage of gain to themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
or out of Pride and State, or Humour,
have given juſt occaſion to the World to
judge, that they had not that care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the Lives and Healths of Perſons
with whom they had to do, as, in Humanity,
Reaſon and Conſcience, they ought to have
had. Admitting this to be inexcuſable, as to
the Perſons guilty of it, yet it may be ſaid, as
to the preſent Profeſſors thereof, having the
Legal Right to practiſe in the City of <hi>London;</hi>
and undertaken on their behalf, that there
was never in any Age, leſs greivance or cauſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94829:3"/>
of complaint upon any ſuch account. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that diſtinction between the Vices of
Perſons, and of Arts or Profeſſions, is ſo cleer
and obvious, that whoſoever transfers thoſe
of the one upon the other, muſt needs appear
deficient in the uſe of his Reaſon, or elſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and injurious.</p>
            <p>As to the Art it ſelf, though it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that it is, as all Humane Knowledge in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinds, imperfect and defective; yet, that
it ſhould be an impoſture (as ignorance in
conjunction with confidence may ſurmiſe or
charge upon it) the World doth ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with Perſons learned and judicious, and
(though not profeſſed Phyſicians) competent
to judge thereof, as to render it ſuperfluous to
go about to vindicate it from ſuch an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Neither is the imperfection and defect
of knowledge in things relating to, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the Art, ſo great, as to render it an
empty or meer notional Speculation; but
though it, as all other Arts and Sciences (the
Mathematicks excepted) hath too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
with Notions and Speculations want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
foundation in Nature and Experience;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94829:3"/>
Yet it may Vye with any other for number of
real Truths and Diſcoveries, ſufficient to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
and take up the beſt intellectual abilities
and ſtudies of any perſon addicted to it, for his
whole life: and eſpecially in this Age, after
great improvement lately made therein, by
many happy diſcoveries in Nature, of great
advantage and concern thereto.</p>
            <p>According to the grand importance of this
Art, imployed in the conſervation of the Life
and Health of Mankind, it hath been the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Princes and States, to provide for the
Encouragement of the Profeſſors thereof, by
liberal Maintenance, Privileges and Powers,
honorary and advantageous for the exerciſe
thereof, whereby Perſons of eminent Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Education and Abilities, might be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to betake themſelves to an Art ſtanding in
need of ſuch Accompliſhments; without which,
in an inferiour way of Education, perſons could
not attain to any ſuch improved judgment,
as is requiſite to the underſtanding and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of the vaſt variety and exquiſite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of the things conſtituting the Subject of
that Art, or relating thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94829:4"/>
Accordingly, it hath been no leſs the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Princes and Parliaments of this
Kingdom, to provide for the Encouragement
and good Regulation of the Profeſſion of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
therein, eſpecially in <hi>London:</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that by Law and Cuſtom, it hath had
as great advantages in the kinds before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
with us, as in any Country in the World.
And therefore it is the more to be taken notice
of, that at this time it ſhould be reduced, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
to the worſt condition that it is in, any
where; more then probably, to ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as cuts off all hopes of honourable or free
maintenance of the Profeſſors thereof, or the
moſt part of them, and of improvement in
the Art it ſelf, for the future; as may in ſome
meaſure appear by what followeth.</p>
            <p>The dividing and ſeparating of that part of
the Art of Phyſick, which concerns the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Compoſition of Medicaments, from
the body of it, ſo as to put the practice of it
into other hands, was never heard of in the
Ages of <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and other ancient
Phyſicians; and hath been judged by ſome of
the cheif Authors in Phyſick, to be of unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94829:4"/>
conſequence to it, upon ſeveral accounts.
Hence many Phyſicians, while there was a good
underſtanding between them and the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
(theſe keeping within their own
bounds) thinking it became them, in civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
to leave all to theſe, that belonged to
their Art, and ſo not concerning themſelves
to be judicious and verſed therein, became
ſtrangers to the Materials and Preparations of
Medicines; and by conſequence, leſs able to
preſcribe the making of them, to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
And this the Aporhecaries have not
been wanting to make their Advantage of, to
the diſparagement of the Phyſicians: So that
it is juſtly to be accounted an error and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
in ſuch Phyſicians; who if they had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
their minds to it, might have been as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
in, and as well acquainted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
of Remedies, whether Vegetables, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
or Minerals, and all the more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ways of preparations thereof, as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Phyſicians, or any Apothecaries; by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Viewing, Inſpection and Obſervation,
and chiefly by experimenting and exerciſing
themſelves in preparations more accurate and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94829:5"/>
of greater importance, Chymical, or other:
which are the ways that enable a Phyſician au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentically
to preſcribe.</p>
            <p>And yet, notwithſtanding ſuch an error and
neglect of ſome Phyſicians occaſioned by it,
the diſtinct Practice and Exerciſe of that part
by Apothecaries, as it hath been uſed in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
had its advantage; and was looked upon
as a great eaſe and happineſs to the Practice of
Phyſick. For by this means Phyſicians were
freed from ſome troubleſom and inferior em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
and they had the advantage of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
account, and making appear, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
all that was done on their part, by their
preſcriptions extant in writing, in caſe of any
ill ſucceſs, (which might happen by error upon
other account) or ſuſpition of hurt done to a
Patient by any thing adviſed by them.</p>
            <p>But theſe are really, and upon the whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
advantages to the Profeſſion of Phyſick,
only upon this ſuppoſition, that Apothecaries
keep within the limits of their Work and
Trade, not medling with the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
themſelves; the Preſcriptions of Phyſicians
being faithfully and ſafely lodged with them,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94829:5"/>
to the uſe of their Patients, and the benefit of
the Apothecaries in their Trade. Otherwiſe,
neither the Advantages before mentioned, nor
any other, can ever compenſate the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and detriment, not only to the Profeſſion
and Profeſſors of Phyſick, but to the Publick:
in conſideration whereof, it were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a ſmall inconvenience, for Phyſicians
to put themſelves to the Drudgery of making
all the Medicaments they have uſe of in their
Practice, if need were; and to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own ſingle reputation and credit
with their Friends and Patients, for their Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
as the Caſe ſhould require.</p>
            <p>In compariſon to Phyſicians, it may eaſily
be made out, what advantages Apothecaries
taking upon them to practiſe, may have in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
upon their particular communication of
all their Remedies, to them, to get the whole,
or ſomuch of the Practice from the Phyſicians,
as ſhall not leave a competency for them to
ſubſiſt upon. For the Apothecaries being bred
up all the time of their Youth as Apprentices
in <hi>London,</hi> (while Phyſicians are ſtudying at
the Univerſities) and having ſo much the more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94829:6"/>
advantage to get a numerous acquaintance (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that by keeping open Shops, more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
notice may be taken of them) when they
ſhall be able to pretend to, and make oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being Maſters of, or knowing all the
Secrets and Practice of all the Phyſicians in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
it is obvious, how much this muſt take
with the Vulgar, and with all ſuch perſons, as
being not bred up to Learning themſelves,
cannot be ſenſible of the advantage of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Education in all kinds of Learning, for
improving the Mind and Underſtanding, and
enabling of it to exerciſe ſuch a piercing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and large Comprehenſion of ſo ſubtile
and numerous natures and things, as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
whereof is requiſite to the Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.
And therefore though there be not ſo
much danger of ſuch oſtentation prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Nobility, Gentry, and Perſons of
Learning and Parts in the City; yet how far it
may, amongſt others, who are the great number
and bulk, is not hard to conceive by what hath
been experienced.</p>
            <p>For, allowing a Phyſician, in his youth, to
have had the reaſon, parts and ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94829:6"/>
of another of his age; and then to have been
bred up in learning of Languages, to render
him Maſter of the Knowledge contained in
Books written in thoſe Languages; then, in
Arts, ſome whereof miniſter Advantages to the
underſtanding of the nature and cauſes of
things; all do improve the Mind and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
by Exerciſe at leaſt, to diſcern and
judge of things: then ſuppoſing him to apply
his ſtudy to Natural Philoſophy, ſuch as is
more real and ſolid in this Age, by many happy
Experimental Diſcoveries in Nature: and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Art of Phyſick, and the knowledge of
the Body of Man, withal the parts of it, by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomical
Adminiſtrations, Experiments and
Obſervations; of the Actions and Uſes of the
ſame; the Diſeaſes to which they are obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
with the Remedies thereof: and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Phyſician to make it his continual Work,
to improve in the knowledge of all theſe
(which his intereſt muſt incline him to do)
by the Study, Practice and Experience of
twenty years or more: now ſuppoſing all
this, in the common reaſon of mankind,
he muſt have a manifold advantage to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding

of the Nature, Cauſe, and Cure
of a Diſeaſe, above another, whoſe educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath rendred him uncapable of any of the
accompliſhments before mention'd, or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conſiderable ſhare thereof: and yet many
times it is found, that one that is illiterate and
can ſpeak no reaſon of any thing, but only make
oſtentation with a few canting terms; yea
ſometimes a Nurſe, or ſuch kind of Woman,
by a confidence ariſing out of ignorance, ſhall
arrogate more knowledge or ability to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſhall be better thought of among
the unlearned and incompetent to judge, than
ſuch a Phyſician as hath been deſcribed before:
and how much more may an Apothecary, upon
the pretenſions before mentioned, carry a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with ſuch people, above ſuch a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician?</p>
            <p>And if the Art of Phyſick, or one half of it,
were the knowledge of Receipts or Forms of
Medicines to cure Diſeaſes, Apothecaries
might have more pretence to vye with Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;
but, to be ſure, that is far the leaſt part
of it; and a manifold greater proportion of
Judgment and Skill is requiſite to diſcover the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94829:7"/>
Diſeaſe, than to apply the Remedy; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuch diſcovery, abundant and frequent
miſchief may be done, even to the deſtruction
of life, by applying Medicines in themſelves
ſafe, and (according to the vulgar term)
wholſom: and not only ſo, but by the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the proper Remedies in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
through the ſame want of judgment;
which miſchiefs by omiſſions, as well as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
whoever pretends to the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
hath to anſwer for. In ſuch caſes, how
can that be a ſufficient plea (which paſſeth for
currant generally) That nothing was done, but
only ſome Cordial given, or what was very
ſafe? (though at beſt nothing to the purpoſe)
whereas in the beginning of many Diſeaſes,
while the opportunities of applying the Great
Remedies, and doing to the purpoſe, are either
only, or to the beſt advantage to be taken, that
doing nothing but <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the undoing of the
Patient, if loſs of life be ſo to be accounted;
there being ſo much difficulty and danger in
many Diſeaſes, that carry the leaſt appearance
of either, as to require the firſt and earlieſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
for a Phyſician to act towards their
Cure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94829:8"/>
This communication of Medicines by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
to Apothecaries (whereby they come to
be ſo great Maſters of Receipts) is in the plain
reaſon and nature of the thing, a Truſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they are free to make the advantage or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
that belongs to their Trade, by ſelling ſuch
Medicines at valuable rates, according to their
coſtlineſs or elaborateneſs in their preparation:
but the advantage of directing and preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their uſe in all caſes, belongs to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian:
and the hindring him herein, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
him of his Practice, is a breach of Truſt,
and unworthy, as well as injurious dealing by
him, as may farther appear by the following
Conſideration.</p>
            <p>All Laws of N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ture and Nations, all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
Equity, and Reaſon of Mankind, do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to every perſon the benefit of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;
which, if it be of that Nature, that
the bringing of it into uſe and practice,
doth neceſſarily import the diſcovery of it,
according to our Laws, Patents for terms of
years are granted: but if an Invention be of
ſuch a nature, that it may be concealed in the
uſe and practice, no limitation for private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94829:8"/>
or profit thereby, is ſet by Law; it is
only Honeſty, Ingenuity or Intereſt, that can
reſtrain from making unreaſonable or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable
advantages in ſuch caſe. Now any
Medicines or Receipts for Cure of Diſeaſes,
invented by Phyſicians, or coming to their
private knowledge only; or any new uſe or
virtue of an old known Medicine, diſcovered
by any Phyſician; in relation to thoſe Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
by whom they have been invented or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
(as far as they are of any conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or value) are of this Nature, that is, Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that may be kept ſecret by them; and
whereof nothing hinders them from making
the advantage; the Laws of the Land (as well
as in other Countries) allowing and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Phyſicians to practiſe their Art in all its
parts and members, and ſo by conſequence to
make any Medicines, themſelves. The caſe
being thus, how unreaſonable and unequal is
it, that when a Phyſician hath by his Induſtry
found out, or by ſome Felicity lighted upon a
Diſcovery that hath proved remarkably ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
in ſome particular diſeaſe or caſe; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his communication of it to an Apothecary,
he ſhall have only an inconſiderable matter?
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94829:9"/>
(not worth the owning many times) in caſe
the Patient come or ſend to him; or at moſt
an ordinary Fee in caſe of Viſiting the Patient;
whereas the Apothecary being one that takes
upon him to practiſe, ſhall not only repeat the
ſame Medicine many times over, to the ſame
Patient, but alſo give into any other Patients,
whoſe caſe he judges to be the ſame, or of affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to it; and drive a Trade with it all his
life time; and ſo gain (as it is well known,
and hath been upon occaſion, by ſome confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
or boaſted of) by one Receipt, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times as much as the Phyſicians Reward
or Fee for preſcribing it: ſo that he only
cures the Patient once for an ordinary Fee at
moſt, and teaches the Apothecary, when the
ſame caſe occurrs, to do it ever after.</p>
            <p>The conſequence of this to Phyſicians, muſt
be the impoveriſhment of many; who, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the charges of their Education, and
the uſe and conſequence of their Profeſſion,
deſerve to get as great Eſtates, as are gotten in
any Profeſſion or way of Trading, and yet ſhall
ſcarce be able to ſubſiſt, though as Learned
and able in their Profeſſion, as their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
who thirty or forty years ago, got great
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94829:9"/>
Eſtates, when the Apothecaries kept within
their own bounds, or inconſiderably incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Phyſicians. For now a Phyſician
will be of uſe only amongſt great perſons, or
perſons of learning and parts to value him:
whereas others that are of ability enough for
Eſtates, and would be ready to entertain him,
are ſo amuſed by Apothecaries, their oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and pretenſions before mentioned, their
canting upon the common notions and terms of
Humours, Fumes, Obſtructions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which an
empty illiterate pretender, having confidence
enough, may ſo manage, as to make a more
graceful ſound, than the moſt ſolid and able
Phyſician) that they are generally entertained
in the beginning of ſickneſſes, and made Judges
whether or no, and when any, and what Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
ſhall be ſent for: (being accounted a
check upon the Phyſician by ſuch a ſort of
People) who for the moſt part, is not called,
till the other is willing to go no farther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not his intereſt, that the perſon
ſhould die under his Cure; and then he ſays it
is work for a Doctor; who ſhall have nothing
to do amongſt theſe people but in deſperate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94829:10"/>
caſes: whereas (as hath been hinted already)
in difficult caſes, the beſt Phyſician may ſtand
in need of all advantages, eſpecially timely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
to apply proper and effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
for Cure.</p>
            <p>And where the Apothecary hath the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Phyſician, it is eaſily judged, what
one he is like to be, that is one between whom
and him a deſign is driven of mutual furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or one that he knows will comply with
him, that is content to ſucceed him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of what he hath done before; or one
that is noted in general to preſcribe moſt for the
Apothecary's profit. Upon ſuch accounts ſome
Phyſicians are cryed up, and others decryed (if
not traduced) of no leſs, or of much more and
longer approved ability, worth, and honeſty.
To be ſure no Phyſician taken notice of to
have and give any Medicine of his own prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
ſhall be called in, if the Apothecary
can hinder it. Perſons may if they pleaſe be
undeceiv'd upon this account, and underſtand
how little reaſon they have, and how little it
may be their intereſt to be ruled by Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
in their choice of Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94829:10"/>
And if Patients underſtood their intereſt,
they would take no ſuch ſatisfaction, as they
ſeem to do, in the Viſits of Apothecaries; but
rather wiſh them in their Shops to make, or
overſee the making of their Medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by Phyſicians, which are left to their
Servants, many times raw and ſlovenly Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
while the Maſters ſpend their time abroad,
Phyſician-like, in Viſiting.</p>
            <p>Another conſequence muſt be utter diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to ſtudy, or endeavour after, or to
make uſe of, by preſcribing to Apothecaries,
any more excellent or effectual Medicaments;
ſince the advantage will be ſo inconſiderable
to the Phyſicians themſelves, in compariſon of
what it may be to others, who have ſo little
right thereto, and deſerve ſo little from them.
So that all encouragement to, and hope of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of the Art it ſelf, by the preſent
Phyſicians is cut off: and for a ſucceſſion, if
the preſent ſtate and condition of the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
continue, how can it reaſonably be expected
or ſuppoſed, that perſons of conſiderable learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parts, or abilities, will ever apply themſelves
to the ſtudy of Phyſick? and what the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94829:11"/>
of all may be to the Publick, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their eſtimation, who are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
to judge of the great concerns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>The profeſſion of Phyſick being under ſo
hard a condition, and not to be exerciſed in
the ordinary way, but upon the diſadvantages
before ſet forth; the Remedies of the ſame,
and the means to reduce it to a better ſtate,
muſt needs deſerve ſerious conſideration, being
of importance, not only to the Phyſicians, but
alſo to the Publick good and ſafety, as the lives
and healths of perſons are conſiderable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Theſe may be ſeveral and of different
kinds; ſome relating to the higher Powers,
as proviſion of good Laws in this behalf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And indeed in this Kingdom, the Wiſdom of
Princes and Parliaments hath not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in providing for the Regulation of the
Profeſſion; according to which, no perſon not
legally authorized, can practiſe without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Laws in that behalf, or incurring the
penalties of them; which, according to the
times wherein they were ſet, were very high;
but in theſe times, they are eaſier to be born,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94829:11"/>
rendring the adventure ſo much leſs, which is
a great imboldening of perſons having no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
right to practiſe, to run the hazard of thoſe
Penalties: beſides, the difficulty of Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Proof, the tediouſneſs in Proceſſes,
and proſecution of the advantages by thoſe
Laws againſt Delinquents, not without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
in the iſſue, as in other caſes never ſo
juſt, do much more encourage ſuch perſons;
till there may come a time and opportunity for
ſupplying any defects in the Laws already
made.</p>
            <p>But if there be any advantage in the power
of Phyſicians themſelves, which they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
honeſtly, and fairly make uſe of, to put
themſelves into a better condition for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of their profeſſion, it may be of good
conſequence to conſider thereof. Since all
Law, Equity, and Reaſon allows them as well
as others (as was touched before) to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their own Inventions, and ſince
they are of ſuch nature, as they may keep
them ſecret to themſelves, in the uſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of them, they being not bound to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them to Apothecaries or any others, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94829:12"/>
free to prepare them themſelves, as hath been
made appear: whether may not this Courſe
ſet upon, though attended with ſome trouble
and inconvenience, be an effectual means, at
leaſt in reaſonable time, very conſiderably to
advantage and better the condition of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in their Practice?</p>
            <p>In this undertaking it is not at all neceſſary,
that any Phyſician ſhould be put to the drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or trouble of making, or overſeeing the
making of every Medicine, that he may have
occaſion to uſe; or to have a Magazine fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with all common things, as Diſtilled
Waters, Syrups, Conſerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Phyſick, may eaſily by able and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Phyſicians be managed with the tenth
part of the things commonly in uſe, and the
Remedies reduced accordingly, and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
ſo far from being a detriment, that it
may be a great improvement of the Art.</p>
            <p>The College of Phyſicians of <hi>London,</hi> in
compiling their Diſpenſatory, following the
Example of other Societies of Phyſicians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
have ſet down the ancient Forms and
Compoſitions of <hi>Galen</hi> and the old Greek
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94829:12"/>
Phyſicians, of <hi>Meſue</hi> and the Arabians, with
ſome other of later Authors; in conſideration
of the reverence due to the antiquity of ſome,
with the approved uſe and experience of all.
And it may vye with any publick Diſpenſatories
in Forreign parts, as to choice and uſefulneſs of
the Preſcriptions it contains, being as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant
in Superfluities, and deficient in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
as they: but it was never intended
or pretended that it ſhould contain all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
neceſſary to Practice, or the beſt of them;
and therefore the Invention and Uſe of others
was ever allowed to able Phyſicians; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
withal, at what uncertainty the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Interpreters of thoſe Authors, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the Arabians, are concerning ſome
words and the Ingredients thereby ſignified;
and at what diſadvantage we muſt have and uſe
the Medicaments produced in their Countries,
upon tranſportation ſo far, or production in
colder Climates; all which muſt render thoſe
Compoſitions leſs certain and efficacious:
wherefore they did not think themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to make that Book ſo much their own,
as that there might be no impertinencies, irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94829:13"/>
preſcriptions, or (perhaps) errors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
whence it is no wonder, that ſuch a foul-
mouth'd impudent ſcribler as the Tranſlator
of it (for want of better employment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him in his neceſſitous condition) ſhould
take occaſion to make ſuch work as he hath
done about it; and the more, through his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and confidence, calumniating falſly in
divers particulars.</p>
            <p>This being the condition of that Book, the
Phyſicians of the College have no ſuch
cauſe as the common People may think, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
them the Tranſlation of it; nor have they
any ſuch Treaſure of it, as they may ſuppoſe
themſelves: nor is it the tranſlating of all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick-Books
extant into the Vulgar Language,
that will edifie much, or inable Perſons of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
employments to be their own Phyſicians
(whatever may be thought otherwiſe) or the
reading of them in their own Language by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries,
who have Latine enough ſo to
do, that will make them Phyſicians, ſince
there are innumerable particular Caſes, that
fall out every day, requiring anſwerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
to be diſcovered and made out upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94829:13"/>
an Habit, and Principles, enabling to Judge
and Diſcern, not to be found in Book-caſes,
all which put together do not reach or compriſe
them. And the Diſpenſatory before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or any other, is far ſhort of preſcribing
Remedies for them all. And as to the Forms
or Receipts of which it is made up; it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
judged otherwiſe by able Phyſicians, but
that there are in them many Ingredients imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
and ſome contrary to the main inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for which they are in uſe: beſides irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
proportions and quantities, though upon
the whole, they have been Succeſsful; and
that ſuch Phyſicians are far from being ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them in their Practice, as being able to
invent better, more eaſie to be prepared, more
grateful and convenient for uſe. For a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Ingredients (wherein many of thoſe
ancient Receipts are luxuriant, upon a deſign
to bring in every good thing into our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
is ſo far from bringing a Compariſon,
that it is, at the beſt and for the moſt part, an
Alloy to it, and renders it leſs effectual;
whereas a judicious choice of a few ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
is the greateſt advantage to the virtue and
uſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94829:14"/>
Whoever with judgment peruſeth the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Diſpenſatory, may ſoon eſtimate, to what
an Epitome it may be reduced, how many
Compoſitions may be ſpared, how many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,
almoſt in every Compoſition: and
whoever with the like judgment conſiders and
caſts up the main Intentions and Indications
that occur in Practice, it will not be hard for
him to ſtate the Remedies adequate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to ſuch intentions as are of greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and by conſequence to be ſtored with
Preparations and Compoſitions ready made of
the choiceſt materials, to the beſt advantage
for Uſe and Practice, more grateful and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
and every way more conſiderable than
the Shop-Medicines; as Purges, Cordials, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which by judgment and Chymical
Art, as the caſe may require, may be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
as to laſt long without impairing the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
by keeping, and therefore to be always
ready; to be of ſuch form as is convenient to
be given, either alone, or with ſome Vehicle,
which may eaſily be had, or prepared by the
Patient, or any about him.</p>
            <p>And if Patients knew all, they would not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94829:14"/>
be beſt ſatisfied in the greateſt number and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of the Medicines adminiſtred, &amp; the moſt
frequent plying of them therewith: for this
may be (as was hinted before) of deſign in
ſome Phyſicians, to render themſelves the more
acceptable to Apothecaries in general, as uſing
to preſcribe much Phyſick; or upon ſome
combination between the Phyſician and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
mutually to advantage each other; or an
intention in the Phyſician to oblige ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
in hope of ſome anſwerable return: as
on the contrary it hath been the complaint of
the Apothecary ſometimes, that the Phyſician,
of ill will, hath preſcribed little, and chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things; both which are great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to their Bills: whereas when they are
made up of numerous particulars of things leſs
chargeable, how much ſoever is gained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
they appear more reaſonable to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.
Now though in ſome caſes, there may
be need of more Medicaments, in greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
and more frequently plyed: yet in moſt
other caſes, a rational and judicious choice of
one, or a very few Medicines, may ſignifie
much more to the good of the Patient, than a
luxuriant variety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:94829:15"/>
And it will not be hard for a Phyſician,
making uſe only of a Servant or Servants (who
ſhall be no ways capable of diſcovering his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
but only fit to kindle Fires, tend a Still
or Furnace, beat at a Mortar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to overſee
and with his own hands prepare and compound
what is neceſſary for himſelf to do; and by
this means, though he be in full Practice, at the
expence of a few ſpare hours, to ſtore himſelf
ſufficiently for all his occaſions, of ſuch great
Remedies and Secrets of importance: and for
other Medicines of leſs value and conſequence,
they may be had at the Apothecaries, or taught
the Patients or thoſe about them (as was ſaid
of Vehicles) without any conſiderable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to the Practice of Phyſick. To be ſure,
it were far better to teach Patients any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
then practiſing Apothecaries; for thoſe,
if they have any ingenuity, will be ſenſible of
the benefit, and at moſt, but uſe it again for
themſelves, ſome friend, or the poor for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
whereas theſe will not only uſe it <hi>toties
quoties</hi> to the ſame Patient, but make a trade
of it to all others, whom they have to do with,
and judge in the like condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:94829:15"/>
Nor can it be any diſhonour to a Phyſician,
thus to employ himſelf between whiles, in the
making of ſuch choice and important Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines;
as it is upon record and clearly appears,
that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Galen,</hi> and other
ancient Phyſicians, did the like: nor is there
the leaſt appearance that they had any Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,
or ever wrote Bills to any. And to be
ſure, in our times, we ſee, how worthy Ladies
and Gentlewomen of quality, do employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in making Confections, and Medicines
internal and external: and it is known, what
Counteſſes and great perſons of both Sexes
have done the like; (whence ſome Medicines
have their names) to none of which it was ever
reputed a diſhonour: and how then can it be
to Phyſicians? whoſe employment in this
kind need not be more troubleſome or labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and in reſpect of the neer relation of it to
their Profeſſion, muſt be to the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and more general concernment of the
life and health of mankind.</p>
            <p>If it be thought, that this Expedient of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
making their own Medicaments, comes
now too late for the ſecuring of the Practice
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94829:16"/>
of Phyſick to themſelves; the Apothecaries
being already ſo ſtock'd with innumerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
for all Caſes, upon the communication
of the Practice of Phyſicians for ſo many years,
or ſome Ages, that they need no more: It is to
be conſidered what great variety of new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
do daily emerge, what Diſeaſes, and new
faces and conditions of Diſeaſes, every year
almoſt produceth, not to be found deſcribed
in all Phyſick Books extant; for which they
may not have one proper Receipt in all their
ſtore, or if there be any ſuch, it may be long
enough before they find it: nor is there any
other way but by Principles and Habit of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and diſcerning in a Phyſician to come to
the knowledge of ſuch Diſeaſes and Caſes,
their Nature, Cauſes, and Cure; ſo that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
father communication to Apothecaries,
they muſt come to be at a loſs, for all their
great ſtock and ſtore of old Receipts.</p>
            <p>And it is farther to be conſidered, that the
conſequence of Phyſicians exerciſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the preparation of Medicines will be
the Invention of ſuch as ſhall be more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
pleaſant and convenient for uſe than the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94829:16"/>
Shop-Medicines, and ſhall among thoſe that
have experienced them, beget a nauſeating of
and averſation to the other, and beat them
quite out of uſe or eſteem.</p>
            <p>And conſidering how Apothecaries may
and do cenſure the whole Practice of ſome
Phyſicians, and of thoſe in the fulleſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to be upon a few ordinary or inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Preſcriptions; and pretend their own
to be upon rare Secrets or choice Preſcriptions
of ſome moſt eminent ancient Phyſicians, and
ſuch as have proved moſt ſucceſsful: it is high
time for Phyſicians to go out of the road, and
do ſomething extraordinary to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from ſuch imputation.</p>
            <p>If upon the conſideration of the great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Diſeaſes and Caſes, it be queſtioned
how a Phyſician will be able to apply proper
Remedies, out of a few choice and effectual
Medicaments of his own preparation; it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
by Compoſition, and by addition of
others, in ſome caſes, though of leſs importance
of themſelves (eaſily to be directed to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,
or any about the Patient, if the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
do it not himſelf) ſufficient variety of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94829:17"/>
Medicaments, accommodated to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Diſeaſes and Caſes, may be produced; as we
ſee what infinite variety of articulate Sounds
are, by various compounding or placing the
twenty four Letters of the Alphabet. And to
be ſure one may be at a greater loſs, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
amongſt a multitude of ſuperfluous,
impertinent, luxuriant and inconſiderable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,
than amongſt a ſmall number of
Choice and Effectual ones: with which a ſmall
Cloſet furniſhed, may afford more to anſwer
all Intentions, than many of the greateſt ſhops
of Apothecaries, as they ſtand now furniſhed,
put together; and may better inable Phyſicians
to make good that Diſtich,
<q>Et quoniam variant Morbi, variabimus Artes;
Mille mali ſpecies, mille ſalutis erunt.</q>
Beſides the ſecuring of the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
to Phyſicians, and the preventing its fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into other hands, which is a more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
advantage; there is another of happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
and more honourable, which, by this
courſe of Phyſicians making their own Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94829:17"/>
may be attained; that is, a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
in the Art it ſelf, hinted before.
For when judicious Phyſicians come to be more
familiarly acquainted with the materials of
Medicaments, and alſo to experiment and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
Operations and Proceſſes upon them;
eſpecially the more Accurate and Artificial, as in
Chymical Preparations; they will diſcover the
moſt advantagious ways of Preparation, and
the moſt rational proportions in order to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
and come to contrive and invent
new Medicaments, exceeding others in their
kinds, and improve, beyond what they can
imagine of themſelves, before they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
this way, and what they can ever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
attain; as ſome learned and ingenious
Phyſicians have done. Nor can it be denied,
that in this courſe, ſome Empiricks have
ſtumbled upon very conſiderable and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Medicaments, wherewith in ſome particular
caſes, they have outdone learned Phyſicians:
and by the advantage of making their own
Medicaments, they bear up, and will do, till
they be outdone in the ſame kind by ſuch Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94829:18"/>
Nor hath a Phyſician any way of vying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
equal terms, with an Empirick, but by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Medicines, as well as he; and by
concealment, ſecuring them from Cenſure or
Undervaluing, as the other doth: and much
leſs can he vye with a practiſing Apothecary,
when called in to a Caſe, after he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
and adminiſtred according to his skill:
for in this caſe, it is not his intereſt, that a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
ſhould have better ſucceſs than himſelf:
and therefore, how faithfully and accurately
the Phyſician's Preſcriptions will be prepared,
may be a doubt: but to be ſure, nothing is
more obvious, than for the Apothecary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
them, and to ſay, that the ſame, as
good, or better have been given already;
which ſuggeſtions, how falſe ſoever, cannot
but raiſe a diffidence or prejudice in the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to diſadvantage of the ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>There is one farther advantage of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
by the Phyſician's giving his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations;
that is, the certainty he ſhall be at
in all his Medicaments, as to their efficacy,
ſtrength and operation; much beyond what
can be in the way of writing Bills to Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94829:18"/>
It is ſufficiently known, and moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
experienced, that, let a Phyſician write
the ſame Bill to ſeveral Shops, the Medicine
ſhall be very different in the ſenſible qualities,
ſcent, taſte, colour, ſtrength, pleaſantneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
according to the goodneſs of the Ingredients,
or the cleanly and accurate making; which may
cauſe great difference, and in reaſon cannot
but cauſe ſome in the Operation, while in the
mean time the Phyſician muſt anſwer for all,
and all reflects upon him: whereas a Phyſician
uſing always the ſame Preparation or Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
will be at a certainty of the effect, on the
part of the Medicine; and any difference muſt
be, in the diſpoſition of the body on which it
operates.</p>
            <p>But how can it be honourable for a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to ſell Medicaments, may be a queſtion: to
which may be anſwered, that for a Phyſician to
drive ſuch a trade for its own ſake, or meerly
for profit that might accrue to him thereby,
could not be of credit; but in order to ſo
neceſſary an end, as the ſecuring of his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and the benefit of his own Induſtry to
himſelf; and to ſo good an end as the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94829:19"/>
of his Art to the benefit of others, it can
be no more diſhonourable to him to ſell Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
than to perſons of Honour, and great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
to ſell their Corn, Cattel, Wooll; or
forreign Princes their Wines. But another
queſtion may hereupon ariſe, how it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to ſatisfaction, that he deals reaſonably
and honeſtly in the prices and rates of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines;
it may be anſwered, that in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
dealing of Apothecaries with their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers
(whom they call their Patients, but
very improperly, except when they take upon
them to be their Phyſicians) by their Bills and
the names of the particulars therein, it doth
not at all appear, how reaſonable their rates
are; all the ſatisfaction is in the good opinion
of their honeſty, and in their aſſertions and
proteſtations concerning the reaſonableneſs of
their prices; which indeed are arbitrary, and
can hardly be other, becauſe of the endleſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Medicines preſcribed, not being of
the cogniſance of others (except Phyſicians
and Apothecaries, upon peruſal of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts)
as are the Wares and Commodities
wherein other Tradeſmen deal. And if Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94829:19"/>
have the happineſs to be thought ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
men, amongſt their Friends and Patients,
they may give them as good ſatisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their uſage of them in this kind.</p>
            <p>To be ſure, the Apothecaries, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that the Medicines prepared and vend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, are not of the cogniſance of the
Patients, or, however, are concealed from
them, may make ſeveral advantages to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
not only of unreaſonable profit to the
burdening of the Patient, but alſo of undue
reputation among the injudicious, to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Phyſician. That they may ſet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
rates on their Medicines is obvious
to conceive, and that they have done, is not
unknown, upon diſcovery whereof, they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
all, by alleaging their expence of time,
and attendance; and this clearly infers, that
they may in effect, by ſuch means arbitrarily ſet
unreaſonable value upon their time and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and ſuch as may amount to more than
the Phyſicians fees come to, all put together,
when he hath been entertained and daily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
from the beginning of the Diſeaſe to
the end: and if, when by occaſion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94829:20"/>
of Patients to Phyſicians, notice hath
been taken of ſuch prices ſet upon ſome Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
preſcribed by them (requiring no great
time or trouble to prepare) as may make the
Apothecary a gainer at the rate of ninety in the
hundred; with as good reaſon when they are
ſole Phyſicians, may they ſet yet higher prices on
their Medicines, in conſideration of their advice
into the bargain, if they be not allowed diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for it. Whence it is the leſs wonder, how ſo
many young Apothecaries as ſet up anew, and
open Shops in every corner almoſt of the City,
ſhould ſubſiſt: for it requires no great ſum to
purchaſe fine painted and gilded Pots, Boxes, &amp;
Glaſſes; and a little ſtock is improveable to a
manifold proportion of what it is capable of in
other Trades. And it is as little wonder, if many
Apothecaries in any conſiderable time grow
rich; and more great Eſtates be gotten among
them, in proportion to their number, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Phyſicians (upon ſuch advantages beyond
them, and incroachments upon their rights)
contrary to what was ever known of old.</p>
            <p>And they may take upon them to cenſure or
pretend againſt the preſcriptions of Phyſicians
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94829:20"/>
(as it is eaſie to carp or find fault with what is
moſt perfect or innocent, and moſt obvious,
out of ignorance or ſelf-conceit ſo to do) and
by this means puzzle and diſ-ſatisfie the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
(while no opportunity is afforded to the
Phyſician to give ſatisfaction, or vindicate
himſelf) and by raiſing prejudice, hinder the
good effect of the Medicine, or divert the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
from the uſe of it.</p>
            <p>And they may (and whether they have done
ſo, is not known) vary from the preſcription
of the Phyſician, to impoſe upon him; and
ſo, if the Medicine have a good ſucceſs, they
can tell the Patient, that it was not as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
preſcribed it, but as they have altered it
for the better, knowing his conſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or
in plain Engliſh, none of his, but theirs; if it
prove not ſucceſsful, they can be ſilent; and
by this means arrogate to themſelves all good
ſucceſſes, and leave the other to reſt upon the
Phyſician, which latter, by ſuch a practice they
may be the Authors of: ſo that at this rate, all
the reputation and ſucceſs of the Phyſician
may be in their power and at their mercy.
Such moſt injurious and intolerable abuſes,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94829:21"/>
there is reaſon to expect from practifing Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,
who are Emulators of Phyſicians, and
indeed no better than Enemies unto and a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
againſt them; as ſome ſufficiently diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves in publick when time ſerved, by
their vilifying and diſparaging the Phyſicians
before a Committee of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
Now how much it concerns Phyſicians,
and what reaſon they have to take any courſe,
rather than ſo to be impoſed upon by them, let
the World judge.</p>
            <p>They that can vary from the Phyſicians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
upon ſuch an account, may with leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty
do it for ſaving, by leaving out in
whole or in part, ſome chargeable Ingredients,
which in many Compoſitions cannot be miſſed
to ſenſe, though in reaſon they cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
pretending, if it be diſcovered, that
the Medicines may be more proper for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
without them. And as to the goodneſs
of their Drugs (on which the due eſtimation
of their Rates depends) which doth no more
appear to others, than the unreaſonableneſs of
the Rates, they may (whether they do or not)
put off ſuch as are defective, decayed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94829:21"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in ſuch reſpect, of little value:
for, as hath been ſaid, all failure of ſucceſs, or
ill ſucceſs, is imputed to the Phyſician, whence
it clearly may be inferred, how much better
ſatisfaction and ſecurity againſt defectiveneſs
in Medicaments, there may be in dealing with
the Phyſician, than the Apothecary; ſince the
perfection of any Medicine, is of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
to the ſucceſs, which is the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Phyſician (and the more, while he
acts alone) unleſs he be ſuppoſed ſo wicked,
as to be corrupted to do miſchief to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
and in ſuch caſe the Apothecary being
corrupted, not only when he practiſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
but when imployed under a Phyſician, by
adding to, or altering what is preſcribed, or
giving one thing for another, may eaſily do the
like miſchief, undiſcovered, with the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of imputation to, or reflection upon
the Phyſician.</p>
            <p>For it often falls out in Practice, that Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments
in themſelves ſafe and gentle, have
rough and violent operations upon the body,
meeting with ſome cauſe thereof within; and
much more may ſtronger and churliſh Phyſick
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94829:22"/>
have the like, which a Phyſician may ſometimes
be neceſſitated to preſcribe, except he will
meerly trifle with the Patient and let him dye:
now a little alteration of ſuch a Medicine by
the Apothecary may be the death of a Patient;
wherein he cannot be detected, and therefore
it muſt reſt upon the Phyſician.</p>
            <p>For avoiding ſuſpition, where the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
may gain by the death of a Patient, as of a
Parent, Wife, or Relation to whom he may be
Heir, or any other by whoſe death ſome appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
advantage may accrue to him, it hath been
the prudence of Phyſicians to decline acting
alone, though no jealouſie or caution on the
part of the Patient hath given occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and by this courſe it is in the power of
Phyſicians to ſecure themſelves from the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of Patients, from the practice of any
ſuch wicked deſign againſt them, whereby
thoſe may become acceſſory to their death. In
other caſes, upon conſideration it may clearly
appear how much more the life and recovery
of a Patient is the intereſt of a Phyſician, than
of an Apothecary who only prepares the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
for the Patient by the Phyſicians preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94829:22"/>
The Apothecary may loſe a Cuſtomer
and Friend, by whom in time to come he might
have made good advantage; the Phyſician
anſwerably may loſe a Patient and Friend, who,
in reaſon, might have been at leaſt as beneficial
to him. But this may be the leaſt part of his
loſs, for, beſides this conſideration, upon the
death of a perſon, eſpecially of note, eſteem,
or intereſt in the world, all neer relations,
friends, and dependants take notice of, or are
inquiſitive after the Phyſician, and (though he
be of eminent general repute, yet except he
have the happineſs to be well thought of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, or the advantage to give them a
ſatisfactory account) are ready to ſuſpect ſome
want of ability or judgment in him to diſcern
the Diſeaſe or apply proper Remedies, or ſome
want of care, conſideration, or diligence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to the caſe; and thereupon to cenſure
either the doing, or the omiſſion of ſomething
as dangerous or fatal. Hereupon they have an
averſation unto, or prejudice againſt that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
for the future, ſo as to be inclined to
make uſe of any other rather than of him;
which conſequence upon the death of a Patient
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94829:23"/>
may much more impair the Phyſicians practice,
than all he can be ſuppoſed to loſe by ſuch a
particular Patient. Now there is no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
or ſuſpition concerning the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary
(except any thing notorious be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt the goodneſs of his Medicines)
whence it is ſeen amongſt paſſionately affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
perſons, upon the loſs of Children, neer
Relations, or dear Friends, that they are averſe
to the ſight of the Phyſician that took care of
them (though there hath not been the leaſt
ground or cauſe in reaſon ſo to be) and yet
the Apothecary is in as good eſteem with
them as ever. Hence it is rational to infer,
that whoever engageth a Phyſician in an action
ſo much againſt his intereſt, as the being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
to procure the death of any perſon,
muſt bid very high for it: and ſince his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
is only while perſons are ſick or taking
Phyſick; and ſince it is ſo feaſible towards
perſons in ſickneſs or health, by the ways and
artifices of Poyſon to diſpatch them (wherein
others are more verſed than the Phyſicians of
<hi>England</hi> were ever known to be, and which are
uſually managed and diſpenſed in Dyet, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94829:23"/>
which a Cook, Butler, other Servants,
or any that may be frequently about the perſon,
have more opportunity than a Phyſician, and
in reaſon may be corrupted at eaſier rates) it
may be preſumed a Phyſician will not be made
uſe of to ſuch a purpoſe; according as there is
little extant in Hiſtory, and little reported of
Phyſicians imployed in ſuch work, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may ſo eaſily do, and have ſo frequently
done.</p>
            <p>As to the Rates of Medicines, if the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
did to all Patients, that do not underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
them in their fees (though giving but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ordinary and accuſtomed rates
time out of mind in <hi>England</hi>) give all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
of their own preparation they ſhould
need to uſe; the condition of the Profeſſion
muſt be better, than by communicating to
Apothecaries to give them ſuch advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
themſelves as have been ſet forth: whence
it is clear to infer, at how much cheaper rates
a Phyſician may afford Medicaments, than an
Apothecary; and therefore in all reaſon, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
them to be men of honeſty, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their own intereſt, they will do ſo.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94829:24"/>
And no doubt the event will ſhew it, upon
dealing with Phyſicians that take this courſe,
when the difference ſhall appear, by comparing
the charges, upon entertaining ſuch a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
alone, with what hath been uſual, upon
making uſe of a Phyſician and Apothecary both
together, in like caſes; or upon making uſe
of an Apothecary alone, whereby many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think that great matters muſt be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
whereas if the Medicines brought in by
him amount to ten ſhillings, he may get little
ſhort of a Phyſicians fee; but how much they
multiply, and ply the Patient with Medicines,
in ſuch caſes, is ordinarily ſeen; and a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
that hath no end in favour of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,
may do the work with that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to far the leaſt part of what is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obtruded in ſuch caſes; and though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome fees, yet may be leſs chargeable to
the Patient, than an Apothecary entertained,
as well as more ſatisfactory all ſuch as
allow more ability to a Phyſician in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
than to an Apothecary.</p>
            <p>It may be an objection againſt the courſe of
Phyſicians preparing Medicines for their own
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94829:24"/>
peculiar uſe, that it will cut off all free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
between Phyſicians, and render
Conſultations inſignificant. To this may be
anſwered, that thoſe Phyſicians engaged in this
work, between whom there was a good
underſtanding and a free communication for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
may as freely communicate upon their
peculiar preparations; or at leaſt ſuch account
of them may be given, as ſhall be ſufficient for
judgment, whether they be proper in the
peculiar caſe before them, or not. But it is
not to be expected that all the conſiderable
Phyſicians ſhould engage in this Courſe, ſome
being in full practice in combination or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with Apothecaries, from whom it is not
to be expected they ſhould trouble themſelves
about preparing Medicines; and ſome depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon Apothecaries to bring them into
notice and acquaintance; who muſt therefore
comply with them not only in writing Bills to
their beſt advantage, but alſo, as occaſion
ſerves, enter on their leavings of Practice, and
perhaps conſult with them. In ſuch caſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is not reaſonable to expect that any
Phyſician ſhould communicate a peculiar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94829:25"/>
of his own to another, that can make
no uſe of it but by divulging it to an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But as to conſultation it may be ſaid, that
any ſuch Phyſicians meeting may proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Shop-Medicines to as good advantage as
formerly; neither is any Phyſician that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
his own Medicines the leſs able (to be
ſure) to write Bills to Apothecaries, but rather
the more, in that reſpect, as far as he is free
thereto.</p>
            <p>There remains one grand Objection, that
this courſe of Phyſicians making their own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
muſt ruine the Apothecaries, who are
numerous, and a Company of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
incorporated by Charter: to this it may
be anſwered, that the Apothecaries are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo numerous in the City of <hi>London,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
probably, upon encouragement by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
taken againſt Phyſicians, to practiſe
themſelves; and againſt Patients or Cuſtomers
to ſet as high prices as they pleaſe: and it is
eaſily granted, that without ſuch courſes a
great part of them cannot ſubſiſt: whereas it
may be ſaid of all the Phyſicians in <hi>London,</hi>
having any legal right to practiſe; that they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94829:25"/>
might live well on their Practice, in the old
courſe of writing Bills to Apothecaries, were
it not for the practiſing Apothecaries and other
Empiricks: However, the numerouſneſs of
Apothecaries, doth not juſtifie illegal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
advantages taken againſt Phyſicians,
(no more than the numerouſneſs of neceſſitous
perſons doth their indirect and unwarrantable
courſes of living) during which the preſent
courſe of writing all in Bills to Apothecaries,
muſt ruine the Phyſicians, whoſe Education
doth coſt a good Eſtate or Stock, and a great
part of the time of their lives, before they can
arrive to get any thing; and who in <hi>London</hi>
are a Society incorporated by Charter, having
that Charter and other Priviledges eſtabliſhed
by Acts of Parliament, as the Authority or
Priviledge of them and others to practiſe elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
depends upon the Charters and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the Univerſities, which are alſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by Acts of Parliament: ſo that for a
legal Eſtabliſhment, the Apothecaries can no
ways vye with the Phyſicians. And as to the
merits of the Cauſe, and Equity, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
that the Phyſicians did part with, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94829:26"/>
freely allow one part of their Profeſſion to be
exerciſed by others, yet never quitting the
right of exerciſing that alſo themſelves; whence,
as elſewhere, ſo in <hi>England,</hi> it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
free (and the Law expreſly allows it, and
there is an expreſs Reſerve in the Apothecaries
Charter to that effect) for Phyſicians to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
their Art in all its parts: that upon this,
advantage is taken by Apothecaries to invade
the whole, by giving advice as well as making
and ſelling Medicines; and ſo by conſequence,
if the Phyſicians ſhould not reſume the other,
they themſelves muſt be ruined, upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes
and advantages taken againſt them before
ſet forth: and it will ſoon appear, whether it
be not more equal, that the Phyſicians ſhould
preſerve themſelves by recovery of their own,
than the other by invading theirs, and getting
all from them; to which the former have all
the right, and the latter none at all.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing ſuch a courſe univerſally
taken up, of Phyſicians making their own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
of importance, for their uſe in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
a ruining of Apothecaries would not
neceſſarily follow; they would yet practiſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94829:26"/>
upon the meaner ſort, and perhaps many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whom for want of judgment, they would
by their canting and oſtentation, and by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
prejudice againſt Phyſicians, draw into a
better opinion of themſelves; beſide the trade
of their Shops: but becauſe ſuch Practice of
theirs muſt be gained by falſe ſuggeſtions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ignorance and credulity of the people,
and is illegal, and may do more miſchief than
good in the Kingdom; this anſwer is not to
be accounted ſatisfactory, therefore, it is to be
taken notice of, that though the making of all
Medicines for his own uſe in his Practice do of
right belong to a Phyſician; yet no ſuch thing
hath been here abſolutely propounded or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
but only of ſome choice ones of great
importance and efficacy, and ſo many as may
ſecure the Practice of Phyſick to the Phyſicians,
which may be far the leaſt part of what there
will be occaſion to uſe in the whole practice of
a Phyſician: and ſo (beſides the ſale of Shop-Medicines
not only by retail, but whole-ſale,
whereby it is known many have gotten great
Eſtates, without diſpenſing Phyſicians Bills) all
other Medicines directed by Phyſicians may be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94829:27"/>
had of Apothecaries; who according as they
approve themſelves fair and faithful to Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
will have the more furtherance in this
kind from them. For what was ſaid before of
teaching Medicines and Vehicles to Patients,
was intended to ſhew, how a Phyſician, if he
were put to it, might go through in a Cure,
without an Apothecary, notwithſtanding
which, it is free for him to preſcribe all ſuch
Medicines to any Apothecary that he is ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in. And it is far from the intention hereof
to brand all Apothecaries; many of whom are
allowed to be honeſt and conſcientious, as well
as eminently able and skilful in their profeſſion,
and ſuch as may be truſted by Phyſicians, any
of whom, as they appear to be ſuch, for all that
hath been ſaid, may have as much to do in their
own proper Work and Trade as formerly, or
within a ſmall proportion, while Phyſicians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
no farther in giving any thing of their
own preparation, than the practiſe of Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
hath neceſſitated them unto. And even
as to thoſe Medicaments to be prepared by
Phyſicians, they alſo may be lodged with ſuch
Apothecaries, to be uſed by the Phyſicians
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94829:27"/>
preſcription, or allowance, and not otherwiſe
(for preventing miſ-application by ſuch as are
ignorant of them, and ill ſucceſs or fail of
ſucceſs thereupon, to the detriment of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
and undue defamation of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines)
and vended at ſuch rates, as may make
him a ſaver (which ought to ſatisfie him ſince
Concealment in his deſign) and the Apothecary
a reaſonable gainer, and yet not be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to the Patient: by which means, when
there is a good underſtanding between the
Phyſician and the Apothecary, and no cauſe or
provocation given, there need be no notice
taken to the Patient of any ſuch Medicine of
the Phyſician's preparation adminiſtred, but
all things may be ſuppoſed prepared by the
Apothecary. And this Tranſaction between
ſuch Phyſicians and Apothecaries as ſhall agree
upon it, will bring this whole affair into as
good a condition for the benefit of the latter,
as to their own Work and Trade, as ever it
was heretofore when they kept within their
own bounds, and as of right it ought to be:
and therefore ſhould ſeem very deſirable and
readily to be imbraced by them, for avoiding
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94829:28"/>
greater inconveniences and diſadvantages,
which by tranſcending their bounds, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
above their capacities, while they
injuriouſly invade the rights of the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
they may moſt juſtly bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

            <head>A Poſtſcript.</head>
            <p>THIS Diſcourſe was written above five
years ſince, not in any haſte to be made
publick, but to give vent to and diſcharge the
mind of the Author, of ſome working thoughts,
wherewith it was frequently occupied, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of what he had long obſerved, and
could not but take notice of, tending to the
ruine of the Profeſſion of Phyſick, by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and deſigns of the Apothecaries, if they
ſhould hold on the courſe they have uſed theſe
many years, and nothing ſhould be done to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
the world concerning them and their
actings to the diſadvantage of Phyſicians. It
was ſome ſatisfaction of mind to make out in
any rational deduction and coherence of things,
what had ſo much exerciſed and taken up his
thoughts, though it were but to lye by, or be
communicated to private Friends at moſt:
and there being at firſt little thought or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to publiſh what was ſo conceived in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the Plague and the Fire did ſucceſſively
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94829:29"/>
for a long time after divert from any ſuch
thoughts. If an account be demanded, why
this Diſcourſe comes forth in publick at this
time; there ſhall no neceſſity of it be pleaded,
as the manner is with ſome Authors to make
the World believe them upon ſome account
or other neceſſitated to publiſh their works:
neither ſhall importunity of Friends be inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon, though ſomething in that kind might
be alledged. And, if the Author may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
it was no deſign of private advantage
by gaining profit or credit, that induced him
to the publiſhing hereof. They have been
far different ways (and eſpecially compliance
with Apothecaries) that have been in uſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
to improve a Phyſician's practice: and
therefore this, in reaſon, may be a courſe to
ruine it; except he be one that hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of ſome reputation for approved abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and honeſty, attended with ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſucceſs. All that the Author alledgeth
for this publication, is, that the cauſes exciting
and provoking him to exerciſe his thoughts this
way, and to put the ſame in writing, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and increaſing (that is the invaſion of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94829:29"/>
Practice of Phyſick by Apothecaries, and their
actings to the prejudice of Phyſicians) begat
a preſumption in his weak judgment, that ſuch
a Diſcourſe as this might do ſome right to the
Profeſſion of Phyſick, &amp; might give occaſion to
Phyſicians of acting ſomewhat towards the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of it from utter ruine (eſpecially while
it might be coincident with the honour of the
Art) by improvement of that part which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the preparation of Medicines; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
proſtituting or expoſing what they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thereby, to thoſe that have no right to
make ſuch advantage thereof, as hitherto they
have done againſt Phyſicians, upon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
to them on the behalf of Patients.
Another preſumption was, that it might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
the people in reference to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
advantages of good received, or charges
ſaved, by making uſe of ſuch Apothecaries in
place of Phyſicians, as take upon them to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
Phyſick.</p>
            <p>It hath been far from the intention of the
Diſcourſe to hinder Apothecaries, much leſs to
ruine them (if that were poſſible) in the Trade
that they have any right to exerciſe, that is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94829:30"/>
the making and ſale of Medicines; or to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the Practice of Phyſick, by the ſale of
any, of the Phyſicians own preparation: but
(according to what was before expreſſed) to
give occaſion to Phyſicians to conſider how
much it concerns them in this age to endeavour
the invention of better than the Shop-Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
(toword which their own exerciſe and
experience in the preparation will give great
advantage and reſerve them to themſelves,
that they may have ſomething more than any
Apothecaries can pretend to be Maſters of,
in order to improve the Art, as well as ſecure
the practice to themſelves; which by this
means it is both lawful and fair for them to
do. And though it be free for them to be ſo
furniſhed as to be able to go through with
any Cure without imploying an Apothecary (as
the Apothecaries do, without Phyſicians) yet
this is not inſiſted upon, except in caſe of juſt
provocation or neceſſitating thereto: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
the hinderance of the Apothecaries in
the Trade that of right belongs unto them,
may be inconſiderable or in a ſmall proportion,
according to what is offered in the concluſion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94829:30"/>
of the precedent Diſcourſe; and that it ſhould
be any at all, is but what they have deſervedly
brought upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>As to Empiricks ſwarming ſo numerouſly in
the City of <hi>London,</hi> and all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
it hath not been the work of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to animadvert upon them; becauſe
though many of them may be leſs fit to be
tolerated in the practice of Phyſick than ſome
Apothecaries, yet their practice is more obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to publick notice, and they having no ſuch
relation to Phyſicians as Apothecaries have,
are in no ſuch capacity of betraying any truſt
committed unto them by Phyſicians (which the
communication of their practice to Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
in the nature of it, is) or of fighting againſt
Phyſicians with their own weapons.</p>
            <p>In the Diſcourſe there hath been no affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſtyle or language, only an endeavour
after expreſſions adequate to the things intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
neither hath there been any ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of method; whence ſome things or
paſſages, in effect the ſame, are more than once,
upon ſeveral occaſions, brought in; but all in
this kind amounts not to ſo much, as to carry
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94829:31"/>
an appearance of a deſign'd inlargement. If
the main intention thereof prove grounded,
and of any good importance to be publickly
taken notice of; the defects or faults are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
not to be more or greater than a candid
Reader, may connive at, or pardon.</p>
