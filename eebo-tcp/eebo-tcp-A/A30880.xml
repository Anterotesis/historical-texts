            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO write of Architecture and its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts, of <hi>Situation, Platforms</hi> of
Building, and the quality of <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi>
with their <hi>Dimenſions</hi> and <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
To diſcourſe of the ſeveral Orders of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,
of the <hi>Tuſcan, Dorick, Ionick, Corinthian,</hi> and
<hi>compoſit,</hi> with the proper inrichments of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals,
<hi>Freete</hi> and <hi>Corniſh,</hi> were to tranſcribe a Folio
from <hi>Vitruvius</hi> and others; and but miſpend the
Readers and Writers time, ſince we live in an Age
and Country, where all the Arts belonging to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture
are ſo well known and practiſed: And
yet at the ſame <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> to write an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
for the Artiſt may ſeem a greater trifling. In a
time when ſince the <hi>Grecian</hi> Greatneſs their Arts were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50855:3"/>
never better performed. In a place where Buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dings
are generally ſo well finiſh'd, that almoſt
every Houſe is a little Book of Architecture; and
as the ancient Artiſts made <hi>Athens</hi> and the reſt of
their Cities famous by their Buildings, and ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the memory of the places by the ruins of
their excellent Arts: ſo the Artiſts of this Age have
already made the City of <hi>London</hi> the Metropolis of
<hi>Europe,</hi> and if it be compared for the number of
good Houſes, for its many and large Piazzas, for
its richneſs of Inhabitants, it muſt be allowed the
largeſt, beſt built, and richeſt City in the world.
But ſuch is the misfortune of Greatneſs to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied.
The Citizens,nay the whole Nation is aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at the flouriſhing condition of this Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,
to ſee every year a new Town added to the
old one; and like men affrighted are troubled with
miſapprehenſions, and eaſily impoſed on by the falſe
ſuggeſtions of thoſe that envy her Grandeur, and are
angry with the Builders for making her ſo great.</p>
            <p>The Citizens are afraid that the Building of
new Houſes will leſſen the Rent and Trade of
the old ones, and fancy the Inhabitants will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
on a ſudden like Rats that they ſay run away
from old Houſes before they tumble.</p>
            <p>The Country Gentleman is troubled at the new
Buildings for fear they ſhould draw away their
Inhabitants, and depopulate the Country, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50855:3"/>
they want Tenants for their Land. And both
agree that the increaſe of Building is prejudicial
to the Government, and uſe for Argument a <hi>ſimile</hi>
from thoſe that have the Rickets, fanſying the
City to be the Head of the Nation, and that it
will grow too big for the Body.</p>
            <p>This is the Charge that is laid on the Builders:
Therefore the deſign of this Diſcourſe is to anſwer
theſe aſperſions, to remove theſe fears and falſe
conceptions, by confuting theſe Popular Errors,
and ſhewing that the Builder ought to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
in all Nations as the chief promoter of their
Welfare.</p>
            <p>This is done by ſhewing the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Building, and the <hi>Effects;</hi> as they relate to
the <hi>City,</hi> to the <hi>Country,</hi> and to the <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Cauſe.</head>
               <p>THE Cauſe of the Increaſe of Building is
from the <hi>natural increaſe of Mankind,</hi> that
there is more born than die. From the firſt bleſſing
of the Creation, <hi>Increaſe and multiply,</hi> joined to the
good Government of a Gracious King.</p>
               <p>There are three things that man by nature is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a neceſſity to take care of, to provide <hi>food</hi> for
himſelf, <hi>Clothes</hi> and a <hi>Houſe.</hi> For the <hi>firſt,</hi> all the reſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50855:4"/>
of Creation as well as man is under that neceſſity to
take care of: For life cannot be maintained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>food.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> belongs only to man, and it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
by ſome, whether it is required of him by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or cuſtom, becauſe in ſome Countries (and
thoſe cold) men go naked.</p>
               <p>But as to the <hi>laſt,</hi> it is moſt certain, that Man is
forced to build by nature, as all thoſe Creatures
are, whoſe young are born ſo weak (like the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
of Mankind), that they require ſome time
for ſtrength after their birth, to follow their Parents,
or feed themſelves. Thus the Rabbit, the Fox and
Lion make themſelves Burrows, Kennels, and Dens
to bring forth, and ſhelter their young, but the
Mare, Cow, Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bring forth in the open
field, becauſe their young are able to follow them as
ſoon as folded.</p>
               <p>So that the natural cauſe of Building a Houſe
is to provide a ſhelter for their young; and if we
examine man in his Natural condition without
Arts, his Tenement differs little from the reſt of
Nature's Herd: The Fox's Kennel though not ſo
large; being a leſſer creature, may yet for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
in its ſeveral apartments be compared with
any of his Cottages: Earthen walls, and covering
are the manner of both their Buildings, and the
Furniture of both their Houſes alike: Now as the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50855:4"/>
Rabbits increaſe, new Burrows are made, and the
Boundaries of the Warren are enlarged. So it is
with Man, as he increaſeth, new Houſes are built,
and his Town made bigger.</p>
               <p>When Mankind is civilized, inſtructed with
Arts, and under good Government, every man
doth not dreſs his own <hi>meat,</hi> make his own
<hi>Clothes,</hi> nor <hi>build his own Houſe.</hi> He enjoys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of Land and Goods, which he or his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
by their Arts and induſtry gained. Theſe Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
make the difference among men of rich and
poor. The rich are fed, clothed, and houſed by
the labour of other men, but the poor by their own,
and the Goods made by this labour are the rents of
the rich mens Land (for to be well fed, well
clothed, and well lodged, without labour either of
body or mind, is the true definition of a rich man.)</p>
               <p>Now as men differ in Eſtates, ſo they differ in
their manner of living. The rich have variety of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
ſeveral ſuits of Clothes, and larger Houſes; and
as their riches increaſe, ſo doth their wants, as Sir
<hi>William Temple</hi> hath obſerved, men are better diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by what they want, than by what they
injoy. And the chief buſineſs of Trade is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and ſelling all ſorts of Commodities to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their occaſions. For there are more hands im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to provide things neceſſary to make up the
ſeveral diſtinctions of men. Things that promote
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50855:5"/>
the eaſe, pleaſure and pomp of life, than to ſupply
the firſt natural neceſſities from hunger, cold, and a
houſe only to ſhelter their young. Now the Trader
takes care from time to time, to provide a ſufficient
quantity of all ſorts of Goods for mans occaſions,
which he finds out by the Market: That is, By the
quick ſelling of the Commodities, that are made
ready to be ſold. And as there are Butchers, Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Cooks, Drapers, Mercers and Taylors, and
a hundred more, that furniſh him with food and
clothes; ſo there are Bricklayers, Carpenters, Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterers,
and many more Traders, that build houſes
for him, and they make houſes of the firſt, ſecond,
and third rate of building in proportion to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of the ſeveral degrees of men, which they find
out by the Market, that is by letting of Houſes alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
built: ſo that if it were throughly believed, that
Mankind doth naturally increaſe; this miracle of the
great increaſe of Houſes would ceaſe, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neceſſary to ſhew that man doth naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
               <p>This may be ſufficiently proved by Sacred
Hiſtory, That the World was firſt peopled by
the increaſe from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
repeopled by <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and
<hi>Japhet.</hi> That the <hi>Jews</hi> began from the ſingle ſtock
of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſo from <hi>Jacob;</hi> and when
<hi>Moſes</hi> numbred them, which was not long diſtance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50855:5"/>
of time (being computed to be about Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and ſixty years from <hi>Jacob)</hi> they were above
Six hundred thouſand fighting men, reckoning
only from Twenty years old and upward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Women and Children. And when num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
by <hi>David,</hi> which was about four hundred
and fifty years after, they were grown a very
great Nation, being Thirteen hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
fighting men of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the late Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales</hi> in his
Diſcourſe on this ſubject was not contented to
relye wholly on Arguments from Authority of
of Holy Writ, and therefore takes other To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks
to confirm the relation of <hi>Moſes</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the beginning of the world, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleing
of it by a natural increaſe.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>From the novity of Hiſtory,</hi> That no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Hiſtory is older than four thouſand
years, and none ſo old as <hi>Moſes</hi> of the Beginning
of the World.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>From the Chronological Account of Times.</hi>
That the <hi>Aſſyrian, Egyptian,</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Accounts
are to be found out in what year of the World

the times of the firſt invention of Husbandry
and making of Wine are as well known, as the

               <p>V. <hi>From the beginning of Religions,</hi> That the

That conſidering the time of his firſt Procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <p>Afterwards he comes to a particular Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Increaſe of <hi>England</hi> by comparing
the preſent State of it with the Survey ſet down
in the Doomſday-Book, and makes an Inſtance
in <hi>Glouceſter-Shire,</hi> by which it appeareth, that
the Inhabitants of that County ſince that time
are greatly increaſed. And laſt of all he argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Increaſe of <hi>London</hi> from the <hi>Bills of

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the Arguments of the late Lord
Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales,</hi> to prove that Mankind
naturally increaſeth, of which he diſcourſeth at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50855:7"/>
large in his Book of the <hi>Origination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
and therein anſwereth all the Objections
to the contrary. And becauſe theſe two laſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
from the Survey of the <hi>Doomſday-Book,</hi>
and <hi>Bills of Mortality</hi> carry with them
the greateſt force, for they beſt diſcover the
matter of Fact as to our own Nation. I have
therefore made it my buſineſs to make a ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
into the truth of them: As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> it is
eaſie to make it appear that there is thirty times
more people in <hi>England</hi> than they were in <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
the Conqueror's time, when the Survey was
taken. And as to the <hi>latter,</hi> I ſhall have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to diſcourſe of at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>And if it were neceſſary to uſe any further Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for the proof of this Matter, they would
plainly appear by comparing ancient Hiſtories
with Modern in the Deſcriptions they give
of the Countries. As to the <hi>great Woods,</hi> the
many <hi>little Governments,</hi> and the <hi>manner of the
Peoples living without Arts:</hi> But not to wander
over many Countries, and among ſeveral Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
I will only take the ſhort deſcription
that <hi>Caeſar</hi> giveth of our own, to ſhew how it
differs from what it now is.</p>
               <p>He ſays, <q>That the inner part of <hi>Britan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

or Invaſions, and after the War was
ended they continued in the Poſſeſſions they
had gained, and were called by the name of
the Cities from whence they came.</q> It is true,
he ſaith, <q>The Country is very populous and
well inhabited, with Houſes like unto them in
<hi>Gallia.:</hi>
                  </q> But that muſt be underſtood as other
Countries of <hi>Europe</hi> were then. It appears that
in <hi>England</hi> there were many Governments
and little Colonies of people, <q>for he reckons
four Kings in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> beſides ſome
little States.</q> And he ſays, <q>Moſt of the Inland
people ſow no Corn, but live on Milk and
Fleſh, clothed with skins, and having their
faces painted with a blew color to the end they
might ſeem more terrible in fight. The <hi>Britans</hi>
Towns, he ſays, is a place ditched about to
make a ſhelter for themſelves and Cattel.
And their manner of fighting was by making
ſudden Excurſions out of the Woods, and then
retiring into them for ſhelter.</q> All which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
ſhew the Country was not ſo popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as now.</p>
               <p>For were there are great <hi>Woods,</hi> there is not
room for Paſture or Corn, to feed Mankind:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50855:8"/>
Beſides they are a ſhelter for beaſts of prey,
which man as he increaſeth doth every where
deſtroy, and ſuffers no Fleſh-eaters to live but
himſelf, except the Dog and Cat, which he
maketh tame for his uſe. The Lion, Wolf,
and the Bear are not to be found in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Country; and it is the firſt buſineſs of
all the Planters in <hi>America</hi> to deſtroy the wild
Beaſts, and the Woods, to make room for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to plant in.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon probably of thoſe <hi>Roman</hi>
Cauſways, that we find in <hi>England,</hi> was to make
Roads through great Woods to the ſeveral <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Colonies; though at this time we find
them in open Champaign Countries; for had
the Country been ſo then, they would certainly
have made them ſtraiter than we now find them.</p>
               <p>The many <hi>little Governments</hi> ſhew the infancy
of a Country, for from ſingle Family-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
firſt began; thoſe Governments were but ſo
many families of great Men: Now the large Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
that ſo many <hi>little Governments</hi> take up
in a Country, make one half of the Country
uſeleſs: For men are afraid to plant or ſow too
near their enemies Country for fear they ſhould
loſe their Harveſt. Therefore the ſame Land can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
feed ſo many people as when it is under
but one Government.</p>

Beſides <hi>without Arts, a great number of People
cannot live together;</hi> the earth by the arts of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
produceth ten times more food than it
can naturally. And neither can there be any great
Cities, for the Inhabitants have nothing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for their food, for it is the Arts of the City
which are paid for the proviſions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>To conclude, nothing is ſo plain from ancient
Hiſtory as that <hi>Aſia</hi> was firſt peopled, and (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Deſcription of <hi>Moſes)</hi> began about
<hi>Babylon:</hi> And as Mankind increaſed, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

               </p>
               <p>And all the ancient Deſcriptions of the

Greatneſs, are juſt ſuch as are now
given of <hi>America,</hi> and differs vaſtly from what
they are now, in the number of Cities, Towns,
and Arts of Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>For were <hi>America</hi> ſo well peopled as
<hi>Europe</hi> is, thoſe great Countries that are
poſſeſt there by the <hi>Spaniards, French, Dutch</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50855:9"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſome of them bigger than their own
Countries in <hi>Europe,</hi> could not be ſo quietly held,
and injoyed by not a hundredth part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of their own Country.</p>
               <p>And although the valor of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers,
and their affected Bravery (grown as it were a
faſhion, and a popular Emulation) conduced
much to the greatneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; yet
nothing promoted its ſucceſs ſo much, and gave
it ſuch large extent as the Infancy of <hi>Europe</hi> at
that time, being thinly inhabited <hi>with people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Arts,</hi> and full of <hi>little Monarchies aud States.</hi>
For had it not been ſo, <hi>Caeſar</hi> could never have
over-run <hi>Gallia, Belgia, Britany,</hi> and ſome part
of <hi>Germany,</hi> and kept them in ſubjection with
only ten Legions of Soldiers, which was but
fifty thouſand men; for we have ſeen within
theſe late years much greater Armies in <hi>Belgia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
(that is within the Seventeen Provinces, and
amongſt them men not inferior either in courage
or skill in War, and yet have not wholly ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one Province. And perhaps had theſe Forces
at the ſame time been ſent into <hi>America,</hi> they
might have extended their conqueſt over as
much ground and over as many people as <hi>Caeſar</hi>
did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50855:9"/>
Nor was <hi>England</hi> ſo populous then as now it
is; For had it been, <hi>Caeſar</hi> would never at firſt
have ventured to invade it with two Legions;
and at the ſecond time when he deſigned a full
conqueſt brought over with him but five Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
that is but five and twenty thouſand
men.</p>
               <p>For although ſome may think from the
great Armies we read of; neer two Millions
of men under <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Xerxes</hi> in <hi>Aſia;</hi> and of vaſt
ſwarms of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> in
their Invaſions under King <hi>Attila</hi> and others,
that the world was more populous than now,
becauſe we hear of no ſuch numbers of late;
yet if it be conſidered, it demonſtrates only
the <hi>manner of their fighting,</hi> and the <hi>infancy of the
world;</hi> The <hi>want of people,</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> rather than
<hi>that it was populous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Gentiles Armies were made up after
the manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by taking all that were
able to bear Armes, reckoning from about 20
years old to ſixty. For when <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſlain the
Army of the <hi>Nervii,</hi> being about 50000 men, (a
valiant people, one of the Seventeen Provinces);
the old men and Women Petitioning for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
declared that there was not 500 men left in
the whole Nation, that were able to bear Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50855:10"/>
And if the King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould reckon
his Army after this manner; Of his eight Million
of Subjects (as they are computed to be) there
could not be leſs than three Millions that were
able to bear Armes, which would be a greater
Army than ever we read of; which muſt ſhew
that the world was <hi>thin of People;</hi> ſince the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Empire the oldeſt, and therefore moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
did never raiſe ſo great a number.</p>
               <p>And thoſe great numbers ſhew that they
<hi>wanted Arts;</hi> for we read that the <hi>Athenians</hi> a
ſmall but learned people baffled and deſtroyed
all the great Army of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> reckoned by ſome
to be Seventeen hundred thouſand men; And
<hi>Alexander</hi> with a ſmall number of skilful and
valiant <hi>Greeks</hi> ſubdued the then inhabited
World.</p>
               <p>And although the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the
Cold parts of the World made their Invaſion
for want of room to live in, yet that proceeded
from the <hi>want of Arts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For by <hi>Arts</hi> the Earth is made more fruitful,
and by the invention of the <hi>Compaſs</hi> and <hi>Printing,</hi>
the World is made more habitable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable:
By the <hi>firſt</hi> the Countries Traffick
and Exchange the Commodities they abound
with, for thoſe they want. The Timber, Pitch
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50855:10"/>
and Tarr of the cold Countries are Exchanged
for the Wine, Brandy, and Spices of the hot.
By the <hi>latter</hi> all Arts are eaſier diſcovered;
By Traffick and Arts the Inhabitants of
the cold Countries are better fed, better clothed,
and better lodged; which make them indure
the Extremities of their Climates better than
formerly; and as they increaſe they build new
Towns, inlarge their Cities, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their own Country; inſtead of invading
and deſtroying their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>But to return home: It is plain that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
increaſe of Mankind is the cauſe of the
increaſe of the City, and that there are no more
Houſes built every year in it, than are neceſſary
for the growth of the Inhabitants: As will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
appear by the number of <hi>Apprentices</hi> made
free, and <hi>Marriages</hi> every year in the City.</p>
               <p>By the beſt computation that I can learn,
there are no leſs than ten thouſand Married
every year in the City; which is no great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
conſidering the number of Inhabitants: And
if we ſhould allow two Weddings in a Pariſh
every week one with another, (there being a
hundred and thirty Pariſhes in all) it will much
exceed this proportion. Now in ſome Pariſhes
there is ſeldom leſs than ten in a week. And in
<hi>Dukes-place,</hi> and St. <hi>Katharine</hi>'s, being privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50855:11"/>
places, there is ordinarily twenty or
thirty in a week.</p>
               <p>As to the number of Apprentices that come
every year out of their time, there are not leſs
than Nine thouſand; which will not be thought
too great a number, if we reckon the Houſes
in the City, to be about Fourſcore thouſand:
And if the fourth part of this number be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
for the Gentry, or thoſe which live
without Trades or Profeſſions; and the three
other parts being Sixty thouſand, for Trades or
Profeſſions; and one Aprentice to every Houſe
(though in ſome Houſes are three or four Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices);
and that in ſeven years the
whole number come out of their time; then
in every year a ſeventh part of Sixty thouſand,
(which is about Nine thouſand a year) will come
out of their time. Now if Mr. <hi>Grant</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
be right, that theſe Houſes contain
Eight perſons, one with another, then there ought
to be a thouſand Houſes at leaſt built every
year for theſe Nine thouſand Apprentices that
come out of their time, and the Ten thouſand
Weddings to have room to breed in. And this
proportion is only ſufficient to lodg them, and
not for places to Trade in, for nine Traders can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live in one Houſe. Therefore ſome of their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50855:11"/>
Maſters, or other Traders muſt either die, break,
or being grown too rich give over their Trades to
make room for ſome of them to have places to
Trade in, beſides thoſe that are furniſh'd with
places by the new Houſes.</p>
               <p>But I find Mr. <hi>Grant</hi> much miſtaken in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
about the number of Inhabitants in each
Houſe in the out-parts; Perhaps it was from the
rebuilding of the City with Houſes more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious
and more in number. For in this laſt five
and twenty years: the Inhabitants are now
a third part more, as appeareth by the Bills of
Mortality; For in the year 1660 and 1661 there
died between Thirteen and fourteen thouſand
a year, and now there dies betwixt Twenty
one and twenty two thouſand a year. So that
there ought to have been built above Twenty
ſix thouſand Houſes in theſe twenty five years,
which is above a thouſand Houſes a year to lodg
this increaſe, which are much more than have
been built in the out parts, for it appears by Mr.
<hi>Morgan</hi>'s Map of the City that there have not been
built in this time 8000 Houſes, that is not 300
Houſes one year with another.</p>
               <p>But this is certain, that there are no more
Houſes built every year than are occaſion for;
becauſe there are Tenants for the Houſes,
when built, and a continuancee every year to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50855:12"/>
build more. For the Builders will do as
other Traders, who, when the Market is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocked
with their Commodities, and no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for thoſe already made, forbear to make
any more, or bring them to Market, till a
new occaſion requireth them. And when they
find they cannot lett thoſe already built, they
will deſiſt from building, and need no Act of
Parliament to hinder them. So that we may
as well complain that there is too much Cloth
and Stuff made, too much Corn ſowed, too
many Sheep or Oxen bred, as that there are
too many Houſes built; too many Taylors,
Shoo-makers, Bakers and Brewers, as there are
too many Builders.</p>

               <p>NEW Buildings are advantageous to a
City, for they raiſe the Rents of the old
Houſes. For the bigger a Town is, the more of
value are the Houſes in it. Houſes of the ſame
conveniency and goodneſs are of more value
in <hi>Briſtol, Exeter</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> than in the
little Villages adjoyning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50855:12"/>
Houſes in the middle of a Town are of more
value than thoſe at the out ends; and when a
Town happens to be increaſed by addition of
New Buildings to the end of a Town, the old
Houſes which were then at the end, become
nearer to the middle of the Town, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
in value.</p>
               <p>Houſes are of more value in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and
<hi>Cornhill,</hi> than they are in <hi>Shoreditch, White-Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
Old-Street,</hi> or any of the Out-parts; and
the Rents in ſome of theſe Out-parts have
been within this few years conſiderably advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the addition of New Buildings that
are beyond them. As for inſtance, the Rents of
the Houſes in <hi>Biſhopſgate-Street,</hi> the <hi>Minories,</hi> &amp;c.
are raiſed from fifteen or ſixteen pounds <hi>Per
Annum,</hi> to be now worth thirty, which was
by the increaſe of Buildings in <hi>Spittle-Fields,
Shadwells</hi> and <hi>Ratcliff-Highway.</hi> And at the
other end of the Town thoſe Houſes in the
<hi>Strand</hi> and <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> are worth now fifty
and threeſcore pounds <hi>Per Annum,</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this thirty years were not Lett for above
twenty pounds <hi>Per Annum,</hi> which is by the
great addition of Buildings ſince made in St.
<hi>James</hi>'s, <hi>Leiceſter-Fields,</hi> and other adjoyning
parts. But in thoſe Our-parts where no New
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50855:13"/>
Buildings have been added, as in <hi>Old-Street,
Grub-Street,</hi> and all that ſide of the
City which does not increaſe, Houſes continue
much of the ſame value, as they were twenty
years ago: And the reaſon of this is; becauſe
Houſes are of value, as they ſtand in a place
of Trade, and by the addition of new Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
the place becomes to be a greater
Thorough-fare, by the paſſing and repaſſing of
the Inhabitants to theſe new Buildings.</p>
               <p>2. They are advantageous to the City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they increaſe the Trade of it: The Trade
of the City is either <hi>Wholeſale,</hi> or <hi>Retail.</hi> Now
the New Buildings of <hi>Bloomsberry, Leiceſter-Fields,</hi>
St. <hi>James</hi>'s, <hi>Spittle-Fields, &amp;c.</hi> are like
ſo many new Towns for the Wholeſale-Trader
to Traffick in. The Inhabitants of theſe places
do eat, wear Clothes, and furniſh their Houſes,
and whatſoever Commoditie they uſe, come
firſt from the Merchants, or Wholeſale-Trader.
For the City is the great Mart for Goods,
from whence all other places muſt be furniſhed;
ſo that the New Buildings are beneficial to the
Wholeſale Trade of the City. And it appears that
they are likewiſe advantageous to the Retail-Traders,
becauſe they can afford to give more
Rent for their old Houſes, than they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50855:13"/>
for otherwiſe none would believe that
the Tenants of <hi>Biſhopſgate-ſtreet,</hi> and the <hi>Minories</hi>
could ſubſiſt and pay double the Rent for their
Houſes within this thirty years, had they not a
better Trade in thoſe places than formerly.</p>

               <head>Of the Effects of New Buildings as they

               <p>NEW Buildings are advantageous to the
Country: I. By taking off the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of the Country,</p>
               <p>The Materials of theſe Houſes, as Stones,
Bricks, Lime, Iron, Lead, Timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
all the Commodities of the Country. And
whatſoever the Inhabitants of theſe New
Houſes have occaſion for, either for food,
Apparel, or Furniture for their Houſes, are at firſt
the growth of the Country; And the bigger the
Town grows, the greater is the occaſion and
conſumption of theſe Commodities, and ſo the
greater profit to the Country.</p>
               <p>II. New Buildings provide an habitation
and livelihood for the Supernumerary and uſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50855:14"/>
Inhabitants of the Country. The younger Sons
of the Gentry, the Children of the Yeomen and
Peaſants are by theſe means provided with Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Imployments, and Habitations to exerciſe
them in; which ſhould they have continued in
the Country, would have been burdenſome, and
chargeable to their Friends for want of Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>For there is always Inhabitants enough left
in the Country for the imployments of the
Country. For if the Country wanted people,
there would be a want of their Commodities,
for want of hands to provide them.</p>
               <p>Now there is as much Land Plowed, and
all ſorts of Grain ſown, and reaped every
year, as there is occaſion for; and ſometimes
more: For the Crown in ſome years hath been
at charge to Export it. And there is as much
Wooll provided and made into Clothes and
Stuffs, as the Market can take off, and ſo for all
other Commodities of the Country.</p>
               <p>Nay there are more of all the Country Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
every year made than formerly:
There are more Stuffs, more Clothes ſent up to
<hi>Gerard</hi>'s and <hi>Blackwell-Hall,</hi> as appears by the
Entries of thoſe Halls; and more Sheep and
Oxen ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and eaten, than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50855:14"/>
For there are more people in the City to be
fed; ſo that there muſt be more hands in the
Country to provide this greater quantity of
Commodities: And the Country does increaſe
as well as the City, as hath been already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the <hi>Doomſday-Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore if the Rents of the Lands fall in
the Country, it muſt not be aſcrib'd to the
<hi>New-Buildings draining their Inhabitants,</hi> but to
ſome other occaſions; Which probably may be
from the great improvements that are made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Land in the Country, either by drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Fens; improving of Land by <hi>Zanfoin;</hi>
or other profitable Seeds; incloſing of grounds,
or diſparking and plowing of Parks, by which
means the Markets are over ſtock'd and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at a cheaper rate than thoſe Lands can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fford,
who have had no advantage from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements:
Or elſe the Market is removed
at a greater diſtance, and the Lands are forced
to abate in their price for the carriage; The
Town perhaps is decayed, that they uſed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and the Trade removed to ſome other
flouriſhing place at a greater diſtance; occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
ſome times by the death or removal of
ſome great Clothier or Trader; or ſome other
natural obſtruction of the place; as the choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50855:15"/>
up of ſome Haven, and the forſaking of
the Sea, which is the reaſon of the decay
of the Cinque-Ports. Theſe or ſome other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
may make ſome particular mens Farms
fall in value; but there is never a County in
<hi>England,</hi> where the Land of the whole County
doth not produce a third part more in value
than it did within a 100 years, and whoſoever
will compare theſe preſent Rents, with what they
were then, will find them generally increaſed.
Therefore the New Buildings of this City can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prejudice the Country, but are greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to it.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Effects of the New Buildings, as
they relate to the Government.</head>
               <p>1. NEW Buildings are advantageous to
the King and Government. They are
inſtrumental to the preſerving and increaſing
of the number of the Subjects; And numbers of
Subjects is the ſtrength of a Prince: for Houſes
are Hives for the People to breed and ſwarm in,
without which they cannot increaſe; And unleſs
they are provided for them from time to time in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50855:15"/>
proportion to their increaſe, they would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to go into the Plantations and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
for habitations; and ſo many times become
the Subjects of other Princes; but at the beſt the
Country loſeth the profit of feeding them; for
they that live in a City are unskilful and unfit for
Country-life; and this is the reaſon why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Scotch</hi> Citizens are wandring Pedlers: and
that every Town in <hi>Europe</hi> hath a <hi>Scotchman</hi> for
an Inhabitant.</p>
               <p>And that this will be the Effects will appear
plainly by examining the growth of the City of
<hi>London,</hi> ſince the Buildings have flouriſhed, with
its condition, when the Buildings were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited;
And we cannot make a better diſcovery
of it than by the Bills of Mortality, for it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
among ſuch a number of Mankind, ſuch
a number ſhould die; and whether it be in ſuch a
proportion as one in three and thirty, as Mr.
<hi>Grant</hi> and Sir <hi>William Petit</hi> have obſerved, is not
not ſo material to this purpoſe; but it is a certain
demonſtration, That if the Burials have increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
the number of Citizens hath increaſed,
though the proportion may be uncertain.</p>
               <p>Now to begin the Obſervation from the firſt
Bills, that were Printed, which was in the year
1606, for the ſpace of ſix and ſeven and twenty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50855:16"/>
years, we ſhall find very little increaſe in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for in 1606 and 1607, there died between
ſix and ſeven thouſand a year; and in the years
1632 and 1633 there died betwixt eight and
nine thouſand; Now the reaſon of this was
the People of <hi>England</hi> were a little before that
time under the ſame miſtake, as they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
now, and cried out againſt the Builders,
that the City would grow too big; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the 38 of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> they made
a Law to prohibit Buildings in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
which though it was but a probationary Act,
to continue only to the next Seſſions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(which was but a ſhort time) yet its effects
were long; For it frighted the Builders, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
the growth of the City; and none built
for thirty years after, all King <hi>James</hi> his Reign,
without his Majeſties Licenſe; But for want of
Houſes the increaſe of the People went into
other parts of the world; For within this ſpace
of time were thoſe great Plantations of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Virginia, Mariland,</hi> and <hi>Burmudas</hi> began;
and that this want of Houſes was the occaſion is
plain; For they could not build in the Country,
becauſe of the Law againſt Cottages. For peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may get children and ſo increaſe, that had
not four Acres of ground to Build on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:50855:16"/>
But the People of <hi>England</hi> at laſt were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of this popular error, and petitioned in
Parliament his Majeſties K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr,
that he would take his reſtraint from the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and if the next period of ſeven and twenty
years be examined, wherein there was a greater
liberty of Building, though in this ſpace there
was a great Rebellion and Civil Wars, which is
a great allay to the growth of the People, yet
there appeareth a much greater increaſe of the
City of <hi>London;</hi> For in the years 1656 and 1657,
the Burials were twelve and thirteen thouſand,</p>
               <p>But the flouriſhing condition of the City of
<hi>Londen</hi> raiſed a new clamour againſt the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and <hi>Oliver</hi> the Uſurper glad of any pretence
to raiſe a Tax, made uſe of this clamor, and laid
it upon the new Foundations; but though it was
an heavy and unjuſt Tax upon the Builders, yet
he got little by it, for the whole Summ collected
was but Twenty thouſand Pounds clear of
all charges, as appears by the Records of the
Exchequer; however it had the ſame ill effects
to ſtop the Builders, and growth of the City;
for the People for want of Houſes in that time
began that great and flouriſhing Plantation of
<hi>Jamaica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50855:17"/>
Now if the laſt Period ſince his Majeſties
happy Reſtauration be examined, wherein the
Builders have had the greateſt liberty, it will
appear that the Inhabitants of the City have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
more than in both of the former Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods;
for the yearly Bills of Mortality are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two and three and twenty thouſands, ſo
that the City is ſince increaſed one third, and as
much as in ſixty years before.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient to ſhew that a Nation cannot
increaſe without the Metropolis be inlarged, and
how dangerous a conſequence it may be to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
its growth, and diſcourage the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
It is to baniſh the People, and confine
the Nation to an Infant Eſtate, while the
Neighbouring Nations grow to the full
ſtrength of Manhood, and thereby to render it
an eaſie conqueſt to its enemies.</p>
               <p>For the Metropolis is the heart of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
through which the Trade and Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it circulate, like the blood through
the heart, which by its motion giveth life and
growth to the reſt of the Body; and if that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines,
or be obſtructed in its growth, the whole
body falls into conſumption: And it is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſymptome to know the health, and thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of a Country by the inlarging of its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50855:17"/>
for the chief City of every Nation in
the world that flouriſheth doth increaſe.</p>
               <p>And if thoſe Gentlemen that fancy the City to
be the Head of the Nation, would but fancy it
like the heart, they would never be afraid of its
growing too big; For I never read of ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
that the Heart was too big for the Body.
And if we are of <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s opinion, this <hi>ſimile</hi>
is the beſt, for he ſaith, that Citizens make no
good Counſellors, for having raiſed their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
by Parſimony and Induſtry, they are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
too ſevere in puniſhing of Vice, and too
niggardly in rewarding of Vertue.</p>
               <p>2. It is the intereſt of the Government, to
incourage the Builders; not only becauſe they
preſerve and increaſe the Subjects, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
an imploy for them, by which they are fed,
and get their livelihood.</p>
               <p>There are three great ways that the People in
all Governments are imployed in: In provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
<hi>Food, Clothes,</hi> and <hi>Houſes.</hi> Now thoſe
ways are moſt ſerviceable to the Government,
that imploy moſt of the People; Thoſe that are
imployed in feeding of them, are the feweſt in
number: for ten men may provide food enough
for a thouſand: but to cloth, and build Houſes
for them, requireth many hands: And there is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50855:18"/>
that peculiar advantage that ought to be aſcribed
to the Builder, that he provideth the place of
birth for all the other Arts, as well as for man.
The Cloth cannot be made without hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to work it in. Now beſides the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of People that are imployed in digging and
making the Materials, the Bricks, Stone, Iron,
Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all thoſe Trades that belong to the
furniſhing of an houſe, have their ſole depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies
on the Builders, as the Upholſterers,
Chair-makers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which is the greateſt advantage, they
do not only provide a Livelihood to thoſe
that belong to the building, and furniſhing of
Houſes, but for the Tenants of thoſe New
Houſes: For the People being collected and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
together in one Street, they ſerve and trade
one with another: For Trade is nothing elſe but
an exchange of one mans labour for another: as
for inſtance, ſuppoſing an hundred men which
lived at great diſtance before; ſome in <hi>Cornwall,</hi>
others in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and ſo diſperſed over all the
Countries in <hi>England,</hi> live together in one Street;
one is a Baker, the other a Brewer, a Shoo-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
Taylor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo in one Trade or other
the whole hundred are imployed; The Baker gets
his living by making Bread for the other ninety,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50855:18"/>
and ſo do all the reſt of them; which while
they were diſperſed at diſtances, were uſeleſs,
and could not ſerve one another, and were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſtarve for want of a Livelihood.</p>
               <p>3. But they get not only a Livelihood, but
grow rich: There ariſeth an emulation among
them to out-live and out-vye one another in
Arts. This forceth them to be induſtrious, and
by induſtry they grow rich.</p>
               <p>4. The increaſing of Buildings, and inlarging
of Towns, preſerveth the peace of a Nation; by
rendring the People more eaſily governed. Firſt
it is the Builders intereſt of all ſorts of men to
preſerve peace: Every man that buildeth an
Houſe, gives Security to the Government for his
good behaviour. For War is the Builders ruin.
The Countryman may expect to enjoy his Land
again, though for a time it be laid waſt; the
Merchant may hide his Goods, or remove
them; but when the Town is beſieged, the
Houſes are fired, the place made deſolate, and
nothing is left to the Builder but ruins, the ſad
remembrance of his condition.</p>
               <p>Beſides, all Cities are more inclined to Peace,
than the Country; the Citizens Eſtates are in
Trade, and in Goods; many of which
grow uſeleſs in War, and lye in other Peoples
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50855:19"/>
hands, and their Debters run away, and take
Sanctuary under the Sword; And Citizens being
uſually rich, cannot endure the hardſhip of
War. Next, great Cities are more eaſily Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
becauſe they are under the eye of the
Prince, as generally the Metropolis is; or elſe
under ſome Governour, who by his rewards
from the Crown, is engaged to be very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in preſerving the Peace; ſo that if they ſhould
grow factious, they are more eaſily correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Thus the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Power governs his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
by deſtroying Villages and leſſer Towns,
and driving the People into Capital Cities,
which by the preſence of ſome <hi>Baſha</hi> are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.
Thus the King of <hi>France</hi> in his late
Conqueſts in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Alſatia,</hi> burnt ſome
hundreds of Villages; but <hi>Luxembourg, Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
and other great Towns are preſerved.
And the bigger the City, the more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to the Government; for from thence
they are on a ſudden the better ſupplied with
Men and Ammunition, to ſuppreſs any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
or oppoſe a Foreign Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50855:19"/>
Laſtly, New Buildings increaſe his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Revenues, not only by the Chimney-Money,
which makes it a growing Revenue;
but by the Cuſtoms paid for the Materials to
build and furniſh the Houſes. Beſides they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cauſe of the increaſe of the City, all
the increaſe of the Revenues from the Exciſe
and Cuſtoms (ſince the Cities increaſe) muſt
be aſcribed to them: which are a fourth part
more than they were five and twenty years
ago. And the Exciſe is not only increaſed in
the City, but it is ſo in the Country; which
muſt not be aſcribed ſolely to the good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
but chiefly to the natural increaſe
of the People. For if there be a third part more
People in the City than there were five and
twenty years ago, there muſt be a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
increaſe in the Country to provide Food
and Clothes for them.</p>
               <p>To conclude, It was upon theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
That by the building and inlarging of
a City, the people are made great, rich, and
eaſily governed: That thoſe ancient and famous
Governments, <hi>Thebes, Athens, Sparta, Carthage</hi>
and <hi>Rome,</hi> began their Dominions, and inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them with their Cities; and of late the
States of <hi>Holland</hi> have followed theſe Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:50855:20"/>
The Citizens of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> have thrice flung
down their Walls to inlarge it; ſo that from
a little Fiſher-Town within leſs than 200
years it is become the third or fourth City of
<hi>Europe:</hi> and the reſt of their Cities have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
their Pattern; and made Grafts and
Streets at the charge of the Government; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to outvie one another by giving
Priviledges to incourage the Builders and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
And theſe States have found the
effects of it; for by this means they have
changed their Style from the Poor Diſtreſſed
States, (as they wrote to Queen <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> to
the High and Mighty States of the United
Provinces.</p>
               <p>And if the City of <hi>London</hi> hath made ſuch
a Progreſs within this five and twenty years,
as to have grown one third bigger, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
already the Metropolis of <hi>Europe,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Popular Error the Nation
have been infected with, and the ill cenſures
and diſcouragements the Builders have met
with; had they been for this laſt hundred years
encouraged by the Government, the City of
<hi>London</hi> might probably have eaſily grown three
times bigger than now it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:50855:20"/>
And if we conſider what the natural effects
of ſo great a City muſt have been; To be
furniſhed with ſuch large Proviſions for War
ſuitable to its greatneſs; Such a vaſt number
of Ships; being ſituate on an Iſland and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
River; filled with innumerable Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
of ſuch natural courage as the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
are; and to be ſo eaſily tranſported on a ſudden
with all things neceſſary for War, it would
long before this time have been a Terror to all
<hi>Europe;</hi> and now would have had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
under the Government of ſuch a
Martial Prince as now reigns, to be made
the Metropolis of the World; to have cauſed
<hi>England</hi>'s Monarch to be acknowledged Lord
of all the Navigable Cities and Sea-port-Towns
in the World; to have made an Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
over the Seas, an Empire no leſs glorious,
and of much more profit, than of the Land;
and of larger extent, than either <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s or
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s.</p>
