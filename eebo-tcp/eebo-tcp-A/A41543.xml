         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Was by your intreaties invited to Preach this Sermon, and by your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities have been drawn to this Publication of it: whether this Apology will be ſufficient for its coming abroad, I know
<pb facs="tcp:109021:3"/>
not; tis all I have, if not, I muſt be content with what meaſure is meted to me The Providential occaſion to which it relates, was ſad and grievous to many more then your ſelves: That Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Deare Relation of yours, at whoſe Funeral it was Delivered (and for whoſe ſake I doubt not of ſome Acceptance it will find with many, for all its own unworthineſſe) being one, who for her ſingular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues was Generally beloved, and Honoured; Her death cannot be lamented as Immature, for ſhe lived to a good old Age; Tis the Peculiar Priviledg of the Godly, they cannot live too long, nor dye too ſoone. It was
<pb facs="tcp:109021:3"/>
my obſervation of her, that her declining age of Nature ſeemed to be Her improving age of Grace; when her natural ſtrength, and Abilities began to run low, and on Tilt, as it were; Her Spiritual affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeemed as if but freſh broached. This is rare, and ſo much the more excellent, To ſee in natures Autumn, a ſecond ſpring of Grace. O tis ſad to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the many declining Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of theſe dayes! many who had once a very good complexion in Religion, how are they now tand by walking much abroad without the Covering of cloſe Communion with God in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. The Lord make you
<pb facs="tcp:109021:4"/>
wiſe herein, and faithful to the eternal intereſts of your Soules; by taking heed to your ſelves in theſe Perilous times, that you ſteere a right courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the left hand of Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Carnality, and the Right hand of Schiſme, and Novelty. Looke firſt with all Poſſible care to your foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it be well laid in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and heart-renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then build upwards, as high as you can in a holy life, and heavenly Converſation. Make Religion your Buſineſſe, and let the Exerciſes of it in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Private and Secret have the Preheminence of all your Employments. Beſtow the zeale
<pb facs="tcp:109021:4"/>
of your Affections on the Great, and weightier matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Faith and Godlineſſe, and let it not evaporate or waſte it ſelfe on the mint and Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min of Formes and opinions. Looke on the world, and things of it, as this Sermon gives you a Proſpect of them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but for a while, the Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them Paſſing away; Eſtates, and Honours, Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Gentry, Lords and Ladies are things which ſhortly will be quite out of Faſhion, and Chriſt will be All in All.

There are, Chriſtians, you hear things eternal, and you to whom I am ſpeaking of theſe things are all of you ſuch as muſt live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally amongſt things Eternal. The Continuances of your beings here among things ſeen, may be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from each other, ſome may be longer, others ſhorter; but in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109021:27"/>
world to come however in kind your beings may differ infinitely, as farre as heaven and hell, yet in duration they will all agree to be Eternal. Many of us live as if they had never heard of things Eternal, moſt as if they did not believe any ſuch things, and truly even the beſt of us do not improve as we ought the knowledg of things Eternal. Now my exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to you all is, that you would ſeriouſly Conſider and meditare on thoſe things Eternal. I will direct my exhortation of you to three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars for your Meditation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Meditate ſeriouſly on Eternity it ſelfe; which is the Interminable, Infinite, endleſſe duration of a being. Eternity makes good things infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, and evil things infinitely evil. The happineſs of the Saints in heaven, and the miſery of the damned in hell, have both of them a vaſt Circumference; but the very Center of both is this one thing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; The Crowns of Glorified Saints, and the Chains of torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sinners are both made ſo weighty by this inclining of Eternity. The
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109021:28"/>
mind of man is a veſſel too narrow indeed, to form or contain a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which may bear any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Eternity: yet ſome Devout men have well improved their medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to helpe to affect us with the thoughts of Eternity. One diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eternal ſufferings of the damned in hell, thus repreſents them; if (ſayes he) the whole world from the loweſt bottome of the earth, to the higheſt top of heaven, were filled with ſmall grains of ſand as cloſe as they could poſſibly lye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and every thouſandth year an Angel ſhould come and fetch away one of them, untill the whole heap were ſpent; if then the priſon door of hell might be ſet open, and the damned ſet at Liberty, it would be jowful News to them, yet thoſe years, although innumerable, are nothing to Eternity. Another thus, if God ſhould make this Motion to the damned, that every thouſandth year they ſhould ſhed one ſingle tear, all which ſhould be kept together, untill they amounted to the quantity of a great Ocean, and,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109021:28"/>
then with this ſea of their tears he would quench the fire of hell and their torments ſhould be at an end; there would (ſayes he) be great joy in hell at this merciful motion, but the weight of Eternity in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, preſſeth them down every day lower and lower, with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, unſupportable miſery. O Eternity, My Brethren, if you could make your thoughts but ſtick to it, if you would every day task them to ſome ſolemn meditations of it, if you would breath them every day, by walking up this high hill Eternity, and there be taking a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of things that are not ſeen, you would find it exceeding health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to your ſoules, I would commend it to you as a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Phyſick to cure all ſoul-diſeaſes and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. If I were asked what were good to make a proud man humble; Let him meditate ſeriouſly on Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; what will make a vain man ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, a covetous worldling heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded; a looſe liver, ſtrict and preciſe; a wicked man good, and a good man better and better; let
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109021:29"/>
them all daily ſeriouſly thinke on Eternity. Your hearts, it is likely, will be very averſe from the practiſe of this duty, as a foul ſtom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orce it down, let it be part of thy daily Spiritual dyet, ſome warme draughts, ſome ſerious thoughts of Eternity. Many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent advantages and benefits might be ſhewn you, would follow from this duty. This would make Jeſus Chriſt ſweet and precious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to you that have obtained him, whether you look on Eternal good things, or eternal evil things; he being a Sun by which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated <note place="margin">Pſal. 84. 11.</note> to you all eternal good things; and a ſhield by which you are defended from all Eternal evil things. And you that are yet out of Chriſt, how anxious and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous would this make you to obtain him. In this life thou canſt make a ſhift without Chriſt, thou art well provided againſt the evils of this life, and well furniſht with the good things of it. Many friends thou haſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109021:29"/>
who profeſs themſelves thine till death, but Chriſt can only make good to a Soul, Thine eternally. This would keep your hearts in awe of ſinne, for fear of after claps and after-reckonings in Eternity; This would put you upon exact and circumſpect walking; This would make you like, and chuſe the wayes of holineſs. I have read of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane looſe witty Gentleman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeriouſly asked what he thought of the ſevere ſtrict life of Religious men, and what of the voluptuous, ungodly debauch'd courſes of ſuch as himſelf; he anſwer'd, <hi>Cum iſtis mallem vivere, cum illis mallem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> I had rather live with theſe, but I would be glad to dye with thoſe, ſaid he, as <hi>Balaam, let me die the death of the righteous;</hi> Serious fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent meditations of Eternal things would make you willing to live with them, as well as to die with them; to faſt and pray, and ſowe in teares with them on earth; as well as to feaſt, and triumph, and reap in joy with them in heaven. This would make you leſs earthly and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109021:30"/>
minded, this would make you chuſe ſuffering before ſinning, the reproaches of Egypt before the pleaſures and honours of Pharaohs court. This would make Chriſts yoke eaſie, becauſe of Eternal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and ſins yoke heavy, becauſe of Eternal wrath: this would make you fight the good fight of faith va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly, and hold out to the end without fainting; in hopes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that incorruptible Crown of Eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>Having meditated on Eternity in General; let thy next ſtep be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thy Eternal things in particular; Having ſet before thy thoughts Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joyes, and eternal torments, eternal happineſs, and eternal miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a Heaven Eternal, and an hel eternal; O my ſoul, which of theſe Eternals will be thine? for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, thou art well enough, thy lot is fallen into a good ground, thou art well ſituated, well accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Wealth, Honours, Houſes, Lands, Friends, Relations; but theſe are thy temporals, thy <hi>Moment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea;</hi> What are thy Eternals? this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109021:30"/>
world is but thy Inne, where muſt thy home be, in Heaven or in hell? I do but ſojourn here, where muſt I dwell and abide? where will my Eternal manſion be? who muſt be my Eternal Companions God and his Saints, or the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? muſt I dwell with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> with the <hi>innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Juſt men made perfect,</hi> or with <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> with the Divel and his Angels and Legions of unclean Spirits? 'tis ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 25. of <hi>Judas</hi> at his death he <hi>went to his own place.</hi> Brethren, as ſure as you have all places of abode here on earth, which you call your own homes, ſo ſhall every one of us have either in heaven or hell a home that ſhall be our own place. In this world neither the wicked nor the Righteous are in their own places; here for the moſt part the wicked and the ungodly have got the upper places, the Children of God ſit low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-moſt, <hi>Dives</hi> ſits at his table feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> lies at his Gate begging; Beltſhazars place here is

a throne of Majeſty, and righteous <hi>Daniel</hi> a priſon and a Den of Lions. But it ſhall be quite otherwiſe when all by death enter into their own proper places in Eternity; The worſt places in the world are too good for ſinners, and the beſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are prepared for Saints, <hi>who in Chriſt are bleſſed with all Spiritual bleſſings in heavenly places.</hi> Me thinks this ſhould be a very affecting medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 3.</note> O my Soule where wilt thou be when thou art gone to thy own place! when thou art removed from hence, and ſhalt have left Husband, and Wife and Children, Neighbours and Friends, and all theſe things that are ſeen, where will thy abiding place be?

Eternity better or worſe. My houres preaching and your hearing at this time will adde either to both our eternal happineſs, or to both our eternal miſeries. All that we now do will rebound againe upon us in Eternity; As when we put a lump of Sugar into a cup of wine or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: it falls preſently to the bottome out of ſight, but there it diſſolves and diffuſeth it ſelfe over the whole cup, and may be taſted in every parcel of it, thus do all our actions ſinke as it were out of ſight, and out of memory into the bottom of Eternity; there they operate and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect either our happineſs or miſery, which will be felt and taſted by us throughout all Eternity. Every wound which thou now giveſt thy Soule by ſinne, kept never ſo ſecret now, will then fall on bleeding open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſmarting Eternally. O what miſerable abuſed Soules will then be to be ſeen: moſt cruelly hackt and hewen with ſin, all over full of brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and putrified ſores! every good action and holy duty will then be ſeen, bloſſoming forth Peace and

upon her name, in the Memorial of her vertues, I need not feare to meet with (as the good Woman in the Goſpel did) any ones diſpleaſure or indignation.

This is a Chriſtians Holy of Holies, a heart poſſeſt of Chriſt, A Soule Beautified with Saving Grace, Parts and Natural Edowments: Moral Habits and Virtues of themſelves without Grace, are but <hi>Splendida Peccata,</hi> Glittering Sinnes: <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent coram hominibus, coram Deo ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> In compariſon of Chriſt, they are but dirt and dung.

            <p>I cannot but mention an excellent ſpeech of hers a few dayes before her ſickneſſe, to a worthy perſon, and dear Relation, <hi>Let us</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>love one another more and more, and let us not love our ſelves in one another, but Chriſt in one another; that love will be ſure to laſt and abide.</hi> Her love to the Ordinances and Saints might be remembred; ſhe had, like God her Father, a General <gap reason="foreign">

Her Compaſſionateneſſe to thoſe in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery was eminent, and her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity even to her enemies; for ſuch ſhe wanted not altogether, though altogether undeſerved; making good thereby that old ſaying, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera eſt fortuna quae caret inimico;</hi> which I'l Engliſh in our Savior Chriſts

our time is but ſhort. Concerning Temporal things, when we have them, we muſt rejoice as though we rejoiced not; and when we miſſe them, we muſt weep as though we wept not.
