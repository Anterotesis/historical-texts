            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I had not inſiſted ſo long upon this Gentlemans gallant carriage, had he not been eminently both active and paſſive, as the Scene varied, for the ſame Intereſt; and were not a large ſhare of the loyal expreſſions in the enſuing Narrative juſtly due to him. In ſhort, the ceremony was ſo ſplendid, ſumptuous, and regular, that it will almoſt ſeem incredible that a place comparatively ſo little, ſhould equal many more conſiderable Towns; and that our Miniſter having ſatisfied his duty in Divine offices, (and which is more, the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſo numerous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their Majeſties were conducted afterwards through the ſtreets richly hung, and at the noyſe of the Canons to their lodgings, where all the Corporation, preſented alſo by the Duke of Eſpernon, waited upon their Majeſties this day, and made them their ſubmiſſions.

On Saturday the 30th of June, the Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> Sir <hi>John Robinſon,</hi> Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Tower, their Deputy Preſident, with Col. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and others of the Aſſiſtants accordingly, went to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to attend his Highneſs, and being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him to come into his Bed-chamber, the <hi>L.

                        <p>WE are commanded by the Artillery Company to acquaint you, that at our General Court your Highneſs was with one heart and one hand freely choſen to be our Commander in chief; but we durſt not have ſo preſumed, had we not known that your Highneſs was a Lover of Arms in general, and that in the year <hi>1641.</hi> you mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested ſo much love to that Company in particular, that you honored us ſo far, as to enter your ſelf to be a member of it; and is being the ancient cuſtome of our Company ſtill to have liberty to make choice of one of the members of it to be our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, we do humbly pray your Highneſs will pardon our boldneſs, and be pleaſed to own us as your own Company, and to accept of our earneſt requeſt to be our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, and we ſhall be ready to yeild obedience to your Highneſs Commands.</p>

               <p>Upon which motion his Highneſs did very lovingly accept of it, and them, and promiſed they ſhould ſtill continue their ancient priviledges and cuſtomes, and he would be ready to do what he could for them: Then he asked what number they might be, it was anſwered, about four hundred or five hundred, and that they hoped they ſhould be above three hundred in Arms on Thurſday next to attend him, and if they were commanded, ſhould be ready to wait upon him that very day at White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when the Company was drawn up, they ſhould deliver unto him their leading ſtaff, according to cuſtome: To which he replyed, He would accept of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned them hearty thanks.</p>
