            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Shortly after my Lord ſent for me againe, and then complained that he found his owne health ſomewhat ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: wherefore to leſſen the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a future ſickneſſe, he deſired to reſume a vomit, which the laſt yeare had

Hee finding him the next day in a feveriſh diſpoſition, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the letting of his Lordſhip bloud firſt, which as it was learnedly propoſed, ſo it was preſently executed Afterwards, ſeeing my Lord continue ſicke by an oppreſſion of choller in his ſtomacke, conſented to give him his vomit.

his deare Lady and Children much againſt their will to leave him.</p>
            <p>This yeare has beene fertile of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, many ſtrange eruptions have beene made in the skin that have deſembled the ſmall poxe when it proved otherwiſe, even to the deceiving of the beſt Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, no diſhonour to the profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The cleereſt knowledge of mankind is clouded with errors in all imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>An medicina ars non putanda eſt quam tamen multa fallunt.</hi>

            <p>My Lord being thus parted from his deareſt Lady and children, as a tree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a barke and branches;</p>
            <p>Out of the great zeale the influence of my Lords favours to me, had kindled in my heart, put me into paſſion, which if it makes us blinde and unable to ſee things preſent, much more it does ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure things farre off, and to come. All that I could doe for that time to comfort my Lord and my ſelfe, was to ſay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it was but a ſimple boyling of blood, which he had often formerly had,

            <p>We can rake up coales in their embers, but flames never.</p>
            <p>A faithfull ſervant of his told me, hee was ſo weary of his bed, as hee ſeared it would bee his grave, by theſe words, <hi>I foole away my life to obſerve the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and in my hearing, when hee was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
