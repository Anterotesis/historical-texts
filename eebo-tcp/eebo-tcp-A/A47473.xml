            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Filling each corner with her mournful cryes;</l>
            <l>Sometimes she burns, as when a Fever heats;</l>

            <l>No rest she gains, or if she do, she dreams</l>

            <l>She no Physicians finds; Bold Empiricks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <l>To ease her, that she may suspect no ill,</l>
            <l>But may conclude we choice Physicians be;</l>
            <l>The Pill that they prepar'd was Liberty;</l>
            <l>Curiously gilt it was, and tasted well,</l>
            <l>But when 'twas down she int' an Ague fell;</l>
            <l>Then these State-Mountebanks do her assure</l>
            <l>Jesuits-Powder will effect the cure.</l>
            <l>Yet still she's sick, and seiz'd with stronger fits,</l>
            <l>Which made most think these Drs. all were Cheats.</l>
            <l>Their Physick was of such a composition,</l>
            <l>It made the Body Politick in confusion;</l>

            <l>They did pretend to purge ill humours out,</l>
            <l>That they their black Designs might bring about;</l>
            <l>And th'evil humours which did lurking lie</l>
            <l>In divers parts o'th' Body, grew thereby</l>
            <l>More strong and vigorous, and did disturb</l>
            <l>What nature did before so strongly curb,</l>

            <p>YOU are here presented with a Poem that gives a full Relation of the woful state and sufferings of the Protestant Church from the year 1680. until the year 1688. Together with an Account of those Worthy Christians and Renowned Heroes that suffered du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the same space of time. In the year 1666. I wrote a Treatise called <hi>Sion in Distress;</hi> I then perceiving Popery ready to bud, and would, if God prevented not, spring up afresh in this Land, and then in 1680. came forth a new Edition, with such Enlargements, which made it very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the first Impression, which was entituled also, <hi>Sion in Distress,</hi> or <hi>The Groans of the True Protestant Church,</hi> wherein I shewed the Causes of her Calamities, with an Enumeration of some prevailing Sins; together with the Plots and Contrivances of <hi>Rome</hi> against <hi>Sion,</hi> which Book received general Acceptance. But now this, as the Title assures you, brings better News for our great joy and astonishment at what God hath wrought; he hath graciously been pleased to turn our sorrow and mourning into Rejoicing.</p>
            <p>You have therefore an Account of the glorious Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance both of Church and State from Popery and Slavery by the hand of His now present Majesty, which as it is the Wonderment of this present Age; so it will be, no doubt, of future Generations: But since the excellencies of things appear best, when compared to their contraries, as Light, when compared to Darkness, and Health to Sickness, and Liberty
<pb facs="tcp:63352:8"/>
to Bonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have repeated many things that you have in <hi>Sion in Distress,</hi> which set forth her deplorable condition, that so we may the more clearly discern and admire the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent blessing and future glory of God's Church; but because many grounds of <hi>Sions</hi> Complaint still continue, such I mean as respect the Divisions that are amongst good Protestants, and the sad Enormities of Professors, she doth repeat those her Sorrows with some fresh aggravations and additions of them: And since the Great <hi>Whore</hi> is fallen, and suddenly too in this Kingdom, and many that represent her are in hold, I have added something concerning her Tryal, Sentence or Condemnation, that was in the last, which part lookt to such a happy hour as this is; and tho' we cannot perfectly foresee what God is about to do, as yet, we being but in the morning of the approaching glory—yet are we full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that the work of God in respect of these great and longed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>for blessings, will not go back again, but do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their present Majesties are raised up to be glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments in the hand of God beyond what some ('tis like) may suppose; nor do I doubt but that the slain Witnesses are a-getting out of their graves; time will open things clearer to us: But I am sure we cannot sufficiently adore the Divine Goodness for that Salvation wrought by his own right hand; let us strive to be thankful to God, and labour to live in love one with another, and improve the present Providence; for since God hath graciously been pleased to do wonders for us, let us endeavour to do some great things for him.</p>
            <p>If this may stir up any to act and do valiantly in <hi>Israel,</hi> and be any ways useful to the Church of God, or to any Member thereof, I have my desire,</p>

               <l>And their dire vengeance never could avoid,</l>
               <l>We saw them suddenly before us fall,</l>
               <l>And could not do us any hurt at all.</l>
               <l>A raging sea we seem'd, before, to see,</l>
               <l>Behind us was a raging Enemy,</l>
               <l>But when thy chosen Servant did draw near,</l>
               <l>The threatning waters soon divided were,</l>
               <l>A sure presage Gods presence too was there,</l>
               <l>Who sav'd us from what we so much did fear;</l>
               <l>These are thy doings, Lord, and Marvellous</l>
               <l>Are all thy Dispensations unto us.</l>
               <l>Nay let us not forget, this one thing more,</l>
               <l>As worthy notice, as those nam'd before,</l>
               <l>The People of the Land divided were,</l>

               <l>Yet thou no sooner sent'st thy Servant hither</l>
               <l>But they united, and were join'd together</l>
               <l>All as One man against their comon Foe,</l>
               <l>In prayers, in wishes and in Arms also,</l>

               <l>Their free-born Souls contemn'd the <hi>Romish</hi> Yoke,</l>

               <l>A great Convention, Lord, thou didst convene,</l>

               <l>The Throne they did declare Vacant to be,</l>
               <l>And it to fill again, did soon agree,</l>

               <l>And actest still what seems good in thy sight;</l>
               <l>Ah! how didst thou confound, ev'n in an hour,</l>

               <l>Of bloudy <hi>Rome,</hi> and carried on so long,</l>
               <l>And by such Aids, that they grew mighty strong</l>
               <l>Here and abroad; So that they durst to say,</l>
               <l>All was their own, and they should have the day;</l>

               <l>As soon as thy poor Protestants abroad</l>
               <l>Heard these Strange wonders of our Gracious God.</l>
