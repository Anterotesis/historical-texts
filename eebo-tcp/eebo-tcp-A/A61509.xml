         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that for this neceſſary defence they would be perſecuted to the

where they ſtayed the ſpace of ſeven dayes, ſeveral of the
Countrey groaning under the ſame oppreſſion, &amp; longing for
an opportunity of publick appearing for the cauſe &amp; intereſt
of Chriſt, againſt the Popish Prelatical &amp; malignant faction,
laid hold on this occaſion, to joyne with their Brethren to help
the Lord againſt the mighty; ſo that their number was increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though not to ſuch a quantity as would have been expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
partly through the vvant of ſufficient previous advertish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(not vvithſtanding of vvhat diligence had been uſed,
from the day of their appearance at <hi>Dumfries,</hi> to give notice to
all vvho cordially loved the vvelfare of Zion, of their preſent

vvith them or for them, vvhich had no little influence alſo on
the diſcourageing of ſeveral who came, together vvith the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
raines vvhich laſted night &amp; day, vvhich made many
vvonder that they did not vvholly break &amp; diſſolve. Yet the
mighty power of God on their Spirits, and the lively ſenſe
of their duty, made the moſt part to hold on, and others to
<pb facs="tcp:105606:5"/>
come unto them (beſide ſome who were upon their way and
invincibly hindered from comeing at them) as they marched
thorow <hi>Clidſdale,</hi> where at <hi>Lanreck</hi> they ſolemnely renewed
the Covenant, and thereafter marched Eaſtward to <hi>Bathgate</hi> &amp;
<hi>Colingtoun</hi> the enemy in the meane time purſueing them at the
heels: While they were there, there came two Gentlemen unto
them, pretending a verbal commiſſion from the Enemy (the
one of which Gentlemen, they thought should have come
alongs with the reſt of that Countrey, &amp; joyned himſelf with
them, as a favourer of the godly,) to preſſe their disbanding
upon promiſe of indempnity, &amp; this they urged, but they ſaw
no call of God to deſerte the work ſo: At length that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
conveyeth the other, Early in the morning before break
of day, thorow their guairds towards the Enemy, who (as many
think) advertiſed the Enemy of the way they were to march to
morrow; yet not withſtanding before they marched, they ſent
with that Gentlem. a letter to the General of the King's forces,
showing the occaſion of their being together in that place and
in that poſtour, to wit, to preſente their grievances unto the
Council (ſeing there was no other acceſſe for petitioning) and
therefore deſiring a blank paſſe to ſuch of their number, as they
would ſend with their ſupplication unto the Council. When
the Gentleman (who had told the Honeſt party, that he had
taken upon him, in their name (though without their warrand)
to promiſe unto the General that, He engageing not to move
further towards them, until he returned the next morning,
They should do the like) returneth to the General with this
letter, he found him marching contrare to his promiſe: The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
party, having not engadged to ſtay, marched as they ſaw
opportunity Weſtward toward <hi>Pentland.</hi> The enemy being
advertiſed, very probably, as is ſaid, caſt themſelves in
their way, ſo that they came shortly in the view of other.
The honeſt party, at this time were hardly 700 horſe and
foot, among the Horſemen ſcarce one hundereth were fixed
in arms, The Footmen, beſide ſome ſwords, had only ſome
broken picks, ill appointed fire locks or muskets, many corne
forks, and ſome had ſyths: And at this time all of them, were
much wearyed with long &amp; toyl ſome marches, hunger (for
<pb facs="tcp:105606:5"/>
theſe parts of the Countrey, thorow which they came, can
bear witneſs to their ſobriety and moderation, refuſeing even
to take what was offered, becauſe they had not money to
pay for it) and cold (by reaſon of the continual and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great raine;) while they are thus in the view of other,
The Enemy ſendeth forth a party of choiſe men, who were
met with by a troup of the honeſt party, and after ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put,
moſtly by ſwords, were put to the flight, and fled alongs
the edge of the hill by sheep-rodes, ſo that there was no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
to purſue by horſes, but a party of foot was commanded
to follow the purſute, whereupon the Enemies horſes were
forced to quite their ground and betake themſelves to other
ground no leſſe inacceſſable by the honeſt party. After near
two houres, the Enemy, perceiveing that neither party could
approach to other as they ſtood, becauſe of a precipice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, came towards a plaine at the foot of the hill, and
drew up in battalye. The honeſt party now ſeing that the
Enemy was willing to offer battel, and that if they should
withdraw, the Enemy would be encouraged, and many of
themſelves unavoidably diſcouraged, &amp; if they should delay
till tomorrow (the ſun being now near ſetting) feared that
many should fainte &amp; flee away in the night time, and others
should be leſſe able to fight thorow hunger &amp; cold, ſeeing no
way how to relieve themſelves with neceſſaries at that exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
reſolved to imbrace that occaſion, &amp; ſee what the Lord
of Hoſts would be pleaſed to do; and therefore reſolved after
prayer to draw off the hill towards the Enemy, keeping ſtill
what advantage of ground they could: when thus they have
approached, the Enemy ſend forth a troup, which was
rancountered with another of the honeſt party and beate into
their body, ſomewhat (as ſome think) inconſideratly upon
the part of the purſuers. Thereafter the Enemies ſend off
another party to relieve the former, which was met with by
another of the Honeſt party, But with ſome diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tage
to the Honeſt party, becauſe they were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
neare unto the very body of the Enemy, ere they
could prove a reliefe unto their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormer party: Yet through
<pb facs="tcp:105606:6"/>
the help of the Lord, they made their made their adverſare-party
flee shamefully. The enemy perceiving how they had been
beaten three times in end, in fighting by partyes, and ſeeing
how the ſtrength of the Honeſt party, ſtood in thoſe
troups which had not as yet rallied, nor returned to their
ground in order, advanced with their whole body of horſe,
in a full breaſt, with a pretty gallop, upon the two troup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
as they were ſcattered, and drave them back upon the body
and thus, (the only wiſe God, who doth all things after the
councel of his owne will, ordering it) in a short time broke
them all. And yet it is obſervable that moe were killed by
the countrey men in their eſcapeing, then on the fields, The
Enemy ſtayed on the fields all night and buryed their dead,
who were not a few, The priſoners which were taken were
carryed into Edinbrough, and though by theſe in power, in
humanely enough uſed, yet by ſome, (whoſe labour of love
both towards the dead on the fields &amp; to the priſoners, the
Lord will not forget) tenderly provided and cared for,
though in a clandeſtine way. Of theſe priſoners who were
taken on the fields, &amp; others afterward apprehended by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
men, there were Six and Thirty or thereby publickly
hanged at <hi>Edinbrough, Glaſgow, Aire</hi> and other places; and
their heads and other members of their members of their body are upon
poles unto this day, to keep the memory of this Noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploite
fresh upon the Hearts of the Godly. I shall not further
recapitulat what is ſaid concerning this by <hi>Naphtali:</hi> Only I
would ſay this, That though many might have been tempted
to think, &amp; poſſibly the Enemy might have imagined, That
now their cauſe was confirmed with a witneſſe, &amp; the honeſt
patriots condemned by God the righteous judge; yet after
experience made it appeare, that the honeſt cauſe was never
more confirmed then by the death and ſufferings of theſe,
whom they cruelly murthered as traitours and rebels, The
Lord ſo viſibly owneing them to the conviction of on lookers,
that they were no more afrayed of death then of a quiet
reſt in their beds, being aſcertaned of the Lord's accepting
of them and their weak endeavours, to reſtore the Kingdome,
however He, who is wiſe in counſel thought it not for
<pb facs="tcp:105606:6"/>
his glory, to proſpere them in their undertaking, at that time:
And this very conſideration did much help to reſtraine the
remainder of the wrath of the adverſary, who were ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiged,
that few thought they should ever have ſiſted, till
they had executed all who were their captives.</p>
            <p>Yet the generation of the prelaticall and Malignant facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(judicially hardened by this diſpenſation, becauſe as ſo
many carnal ſenſualiſts, if they beleeve at all that there is a
God, they meaſure him and his wayes by their owne yaird,
and judge of his approving or diſproveing of actions by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
diſpenſations, to whom I shall ſay no more, but <hi>Careat
ſucceſſibus opto, quiſquis ab eventu facta not and a puter</hi>) did not
ceaſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant after the determinations of the cruel &amp; bloody
Council, and cry out upon thoſe Noble and worthy patriots,
(whoſe memory shall be in everlaſting remembrance) as Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
and Rebels juſtely condemned and executed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the author of <hi>Naphtaly</hi> thought himſelf called of
God, to write in juſtification of theſe innocents. And
becauſe he ſaw it was the ſame Spirit of madneſſe and malign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
which had raged againſt the work of Reformation,
from the very beginning, that did act thoſe in power againſt
theſe worthies; and that there was no material or ſubſtantial
difference betwixt the way which theſe late worthies took,
and the way which our fore-fathers, in the valient main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineing
the intereſts of Chriſt, and promoveing the work
of Reformation in our land, had followed in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
therefore he thought it neceſſary and uſeful to make a
cleare deduction of the oppoſition, which that poor Church
met with at the hands of a Popish Prelatical, and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
faction; And of the conſtancy, valour and Zeal of the
Lovers of God and of his intereſt, in adhereing thereto, and
maintaineing the ſame, againſt all the rage and fury of the
adverſary; &amp; of the Lord's bleſſing their Noble endeavours
with ſpecial and remarkable ſucceſſe: And all alongs
did clear their innocency, and vindicate them from the
aſperſions that wicked Enemies could lay againſt them; and
their actions from ſuch objections as wickedneſſe it ſelf did
or could make againſt them; And at length after a clear
<pb facs="tcp:105606:7"/>
repreſentation of the furious genius of the Malignant Apoſtat
generation of this age, by their publick and avowed acts
and actings, and of the ſad calamities, which the honeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herers
to the cauſe and Covenant of God hath ſuffered, did
shew the riſe and progreſſe of that loyal interpriſe, and did
fully vindicate the actors therein, from the crime of Sedition,
or Rebellion, with which they were moſt unjuſtly charged,
and for which cruely and tyrannically executed.</p>
            <p>But the Menſworne generation of prelatical Apoſtats,
finding themſelves nearly concearned in that affaire, thought
it of their concernment to try, what could be ſaid in defence
of this tyranny (exerced moſtly for them, and at their
inſtigation) ſet ſome on work to write againſt that book.
And therefore they published to the world. The I.
Part of a <hi>Survey</hi> of that book entituled <hi>Naphtali,</hi> and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
doctrines in <hi>Lex Rex</hi> and the <hi>Apolog:</hi> (which had been
at reſt for ſome conſiderable time, eſpecially <hi>Lex Rex,</hi> after
they had been burnt into ashes, as being judged no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
anſwerable but by a fiery faggot, till this Man began
to rake in the ashes of theſe dead Martyres, and finde ſome
bones of doctrines yet unburnt, which he thinketh now to
honour with a more ſolemne burial.) But with what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and demonſtration of truth, he hath managed
the queſtions handled in this firſt part, thou mayeſt judge
by what is here replyed, in vindication of that ſolemne truth,
which he endeavoureth, according to his poor ſtrength, to
dethrone and tread under foot.</p>
            <p>Though we have not followed the Surveyers Methode,
diſireing to be as ſuccinct as might be, and to cleare that
maine queſtion controverted, touching the lawfulneſſe <hi>of
privat perſons defending themſelves and their Covenanted Religion,
from the manifeſt violence, tyranny and intolerable oppreſſion of the
Soveraigne and inferiour Magiſtrats</hi> to the edification of all;
yet we have not dealt with him, as he hath done even with
<hi>Naphtali,</hi> the book which mainly he ſetteth himſelf againſt:
For he is ſo far from anſwereing that book of which he
offereth a <hi>survey,</hi> that the moſt part of the grounds, and
arguments made uſe of there, to prove the thing intended,
<pb facs="tcp:105606:7"/>
are not ſo much as touched by him in all this voluminous
pamphlet: But we have fully examined and anſwered all
which he hath aſſerted, leaving not one material ſentence,
which was to the purpoſe, in his whole book, untouched.
The judicious Reader will finde this true upon ſearch; And
no man will think we were called to anſwere the ſame thing
oftener then once, though he was pleaſed to fill up many pages
with meer repetitions. The methode we have followed,
all who know what it is to cleare controverſies, vvill
acknowledge, to be the moſt ſolide, ſatisfying, ſuccinct
and perſpicuous; and ſuch, againſt which no man can juſtly
except. We ſuppoſe alſo That we have been as plaine and
cleare as the nature of this controverſy vvould ſuffer us; (and
ſome poſſibly vvill think VVe have been too too plaine; but
they knovv vvhom to blame, for giving us this occaſion,)
for vve made it our deſigne, to bring this queſtion, vvhich
did concerne common people no leſſe then the learned, (ſeing
it was a matter of life and death unto them, no leſs then
unto others) home, ſo far as was poſſible, to the capacity
of the meaneſt, that they might know, and be diſtinct in
the knowledge, and perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe, of the
grounds of their acting in ſuch a vindication of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and libertyes. The truth we have confirmed by many
arguments, reduceing them to their ſeveral heads, the better
to cleare and confirme the matter, and to ſettle the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all in the apprehenſion of the Truth: and all of
them we have ſo framed, that every one of the loweſt reach,
may ſee how they plainely and peremptorily force home the
poynt cotroverted, with a demonſtrative perſpicuity, and
irrefragable ſtrength. So that whoſoever shall undertake
to draw this ſaw againe, muſt not think to leave any one
of all the arguments which are here adduced (&amp; if he reckon
aright he will finde moe then a hundereth, which I
shall make good if put to it) un-examined; for if any one
hold, (And I am not afrayed that many of them shall be
found feeble) the cauſe vvhich vve contend for is uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertably
yeelded, ſeing one reaſon, which is unanſwerable,
is enough to captivate the judgment unto an aſſent unto the
<pb facs="tcp:105606:8"/>
truth: &amp; one argument deſerted of the adverſary, declareth
his cauſe deſperate.</p>
            <p>We have alſo dealt faithfully and ingenuouſly, touching
on every thing, vvhich vvas offered to us, and vvich vve
thought might conduce unto the clearing of this contraverſy:
&amp; becauſe we finde ſome thing belonging unto this queſtion,
ſaid by the author of the <hi>Second part</hi> of the <hi>Survey</hi> (vvhich is
now come to hand) in the laſt chapter <hi>Pag. 263.</hi> &amp;c, We
shall a little touch upon that here, reſerving the examination
of the reſt of this 2. Part until a fitter opportunity, when,
if the Lord will, we shall diſcover the weakneſſe of all his
reaſonings, and vindicate the truths vvhich he ſetteth himſelf
againſt, vvith as much clearneſſe and ſuccinctneſſe, as
may be.</p>
            <p>He cometh, in the place now named, to conſider the defence
made by the impanelled unto what was objected, or what
further defence, <hi>Naphtali</hi> (whom after the old manner he
ſtileth the <hi>Lybeller</hi>) makes for them. And 1. He tells
us. [<hi>They were poſed, where they had learned, that under pretence
of Religion, it is lawful for Subjests, to riſe in Rebellion againſt
lawful authority.</hi>] And then addeth. [<hi>That to this Queree, this
advocate declines to give a direct anſwere, where ſuch a thing, is
read or could be inſtructed.] Anſw.</hi> Who doth not ſee, That this
was a Queree utterly unbecomeing ſuch as pretended to
occupy the places of lawfull judges in ſuch matters, to
propoſe to perſones Empanelled upon their life; it being
nothing but a meer caption, like unto that which is called
<hi>Multiplex interrogation,</hi> unto which, both the impanelled, and
this Advocat (as he calleth him) might lawfully have declined
to give a direct anſwere: Becauſe it ſuppoſed 1. That their
riſeing was <hi>againſt lawful authority</hi> Whereas it was rather
a riſeing for lawful authority, while againſt perſons abuſeing
their authority, and not walking in the right line of ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
unto the Supream Magiſtrate and Governour of
Heaven and Earth, but rebelling againſt him in makeing
lawes contrary to his lawes, and executing them contrary to
his will and command. 2. That their riſeing was <hi>in rebellion</hi>
while as it was rather in loyalty to God and the Countrey,
<pb facs="tcp:105606:8"/>
againſt ſuch as had erected a Standart of rebellion againſt the
High and mighty Prince Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and Supream
Governour, and were deſtroying his intereſts: And in
loyalty to that Supreme law <hi>The ſaifty of the People,</hi> defending
themſelves againſt manifeſt and intolerable tyranny. 3. That
it was in <hi>pretence</hi> of Religion, when as it was really and
unqueſtionably for the re-eſtablishing of our religion
reformed in doctrine, worshipe, diſcipline, &amp; government,
confirmed, ratifyed and approved, by Solemne Covenants,
Subſcriptions, vowes, oathes, engadgments, declarations,
profeſſions, publick actings, acts and Statutes, of King,
Nobles, perſons of all ranks, Parliaments and judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Higher &amp; Lovver: Whereas the true Queree was this
<hi>Where they had learned to riſe in their owne defence, and in the defence
and maintainance of the true reformed Religion, againſt Such in
power who were tyrannically oppreſſing them, and destroying the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Religion, contrare to Vowes, Covenants, Promiſes, Compacts,
Declarations, Proteſtations, Solomne Engagements, Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp;c.</hi> And if the Queree had been thus propoſed, it
might have received a direct anſwere, To wit, That they had
learned this from the law of God, the lavv of Nature, the
civil lavv, the lavv of Nations, Sound reaſon, and the
practices of Chriſtians, both under the law, and under the
goſpel not onely at home but alſo abroad.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Naphtali</hi> ſaid That it was a cleare beging of the
queſtion to ſuppoſe that the late riſeing vvas only in pretence
of Religion. This <hi>Surveyer</hi> anſwereth That <hi>it is a very poor
quirck.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>He should know</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that in ordinary
language, a thing is ſaid to be done under pretence of another,
whether the pretenſion be yet dubious or under controverſy, or
whether it be falſely made or trely? Anſw.</hi> Such language as
this may be ordinary with him, it may be, and his complices,
that corrupt fraternity, with whom pretences are real, and
real things are pretences; but ſure to all ſuch, as underſtand
plaine language, this queree did praeſuppoſe that the riſeing
was not <hi>really</hi> but <hi>in pretence</hi> for Religion: Did ever theſe in
power, make it out, or offer to make it out, that it vvas
not really for Religion? <hi>Naphtali</hi> ſaid more over <hi>That the Queree
<pb facs="tcp:105606:9"/>
it ſelf ſeemed to imply aud grant, That for subjects to riſe in armes
really, for the defence of Religion, againſt the invaſion of the powers,
under the pretence of lawful authority, is both lawful and laudable.</hi>
This, ſayes the <hi>Surveyer, is as vaine a quirck</hi> How ſo? <hi>for,</hi>
(ſayes he) <hi>let it be ſo, that the objection was meaned only of riſeing
upon meer pretences of Religion, will this inferre, that therefore there
might be a riſeing upon real intentions for Religion, againſt the
Magiſtrate? Anſw.</hi> Sure to all of common ſenſe, it ſayes
that the propoſers of the objection did yeeld ſo much, having
hinted nothing to the contrary. Did they ſay <hi>giving but not
granting it lawful to Subjects to riſe in armes really in defence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
&amp;c.</hi> Why then might it not have been taken for
granted, that the objecters durſt not condemne this, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſeing the maine ſtreſſe did lye upon that ſuppoſed <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi>
Ay but he tels us, That he <hi>affirmeth That upon neither
of the two, inſurrection againſt the Magiſtrate is lawful,—and
that theſe people did not riſe really for Religion, but to maintaine
themſelves in the courſe of atheiſtical contempt of Religion and God's
ordinances, to pull down all authorities in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And whether there be a truth in what he here affirmeth or
not, we leave the Reader to judge, when he hath read, and
conſidered what we have ſaid in the following vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Next Some texts of Scripture vvere objected, as 1. that
1 <hi>Sam. 15: ver. 25. Rebellion is as the ſin of witchcraft. To which</hi>
(<hi>ſayes</hi> Naphtali Pag. 156.) <hi>One of themſelves did roundly and
clearely anſwere, that, the ſentence being ſpoken by the Prophet to
the King, becauſe of his diſobedience and contempt of the command
of God, and not to Subjects, would ſooner conclude his accuſers then
himself to be a rebel.</hi> This the <hi>Surveyer, Pag. 264.</hi> calleth <hi>a
very poor anſwer.</hi> And yet ſo pertinent and plump that it ſtopped
the mouth of the accuſers, &amp; filled their faces with shame:
But why was it ſuch a poor anſwere? <hi>For albeit,</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>that high rebellion immediatly againſi God be principally meaned,
yet the ſoveraigne Magiſtrate being the Lord's deputy, and bearing the
<pb facs="tcp:105606:9"/>
image of his Soveraignity upon Earth, whom he commands to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

<hi>the deſpiſer of the Soveraigne Magistrate, &amp; a rebel against him doing
his duty, is a rebel against God Anſw.</hi> Thoſe words <hi>Doing his
duty</hi> were very well added: But ſure when ſuch are rebelling
againſt God, enacting things diametrically oppoſite to his
law and teſtimony: perſecuting the Subjects becauſe of their
adherence to the lawes of God, to their vowes and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants;
and by force, &amp; cruelty overturning the covenanted
Religion, deſtroying the intereſts of Chriſt, the true and
lawful liberties of the people, and the common good, they
are not doing their duty, nor carrying themſelves as the
deputies of God, bearing the image of his Soveraignity,
but rather as manifeſt and avowed Rebels to God. And
therefore, what ever can be ſaid from this place to prove it
rebellion, and as the ſin of witchcraft, for ſubjects to deſpiſe
the Soveraigne Magiſtrate, and to rebel againſt him doing
his duty, neither from this place nor any other can it be
demonſtrate, that the late Riſers vvere guilty of Rebellion.
Did not the author of <hi>Naphtali</hi> tell him. <hi>2. That riſeing up
againſt authority it ſelf, the Ordinance of God, and disobeying the
powers therewith veſted, ſtanding and acting in their right line of
ſubordination, is indeed rebellion, and as the ſin of witchcraft; but
to reſiſt and riſe up againſt perſons abuſeing ſacred authority, and
rebelling againſt God the Supream, is rather to adhere to God as our
liege Lord, &amp; to vindicate both our ſelves, &amp; his abuſed ordinance,
from mans wickedneſse and tyranny,</hi> What meaned he then to ſay
the ſame thing which <hi>Naphtaly</hi> had ſaid? Is this to anſwere
his adverſary? And not rather to yeeld the cauſe? Ay, but
left we should take theſe words <hi>doing his duty</hi> as importing
any confeſſion. He addeth. <hi>Yea ſuppoſe, we are never to
follow the Magiſtrate, when his commands are contrary to God (for
that were to leave our line<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of ſubordination to God,) yet when he
ſwerves and goes out of his line, to take the ſword against him, is
but to ſtudy to cure his ſin by our owne; And becauſe the King one
way leaveth his line of ſubordination to God, therefore to leape out of
our owne line in that ſubordination in another way. Anſw.</hi> This
Man ſpeaketh contradictions, when he maketh a ſuppoſition
<pb facs="tcp:105606:10"/>
that we are not to follow the Magiſtrate, when his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
are contrary to God, and yet ſayeth if we do follow,
we leave our line of ſubordination to God. We ſee what the
Man's Spirit would have carryed him to, if he durſt have
vented it. But how proveth he that this is our ſin or a leaping
out of our line of ſubordination, to reſiſt tyranny, and men
abuſeing their authority to the ſubverſion of Religion,
libertyes, and the common good of the Subject? we have
proved the contrary, and anſwered all, which he or his
collegue, the author of the former part hath ſaid, and
shall be ready to ſay more when any nevv ground is
given.</p>
            <p>The next paſſage of Scripture which was objected, was
<hi>Mat.</hi> 26: 52. <hi>To which</hi> (ſaid <hi>Naphtaly) it was ſufficiently anſwered
(without any reply) by one of theſe impeached (whom they accounted
diſtracted, though without the leaſt appearance of impertinency, by
opponeing</hi> Luke 22: 36.] What now fayeth the Railing
pamphleter? <hi>Certanely</hi> (ſayes he) [<hi>This libeller ſeemeth not to
be far from ſome meaſure of diſtraction, while he alloweth the
diſtracted man's anſwer as ſufficient: Who of ſound judgment will
think that a ſcripture is ſufficiently anſwered by produceing another,
which ſeemeth contradictory thereto? This is not to ſolve an argument

               </gap>ok upon that man as, nor yet ſay that he
was, diſtracted, and ſure his anſwere being ſo appoſite and
pertinent, as that it did confound the objecters, ſo as they had
not what to reply, might have more then ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
them of their errour, ſeing thereby they might have
perceived, that when they little regairded the ſolid and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
confutations which God ſuggeſted to ſuch, as they
could not but ſuppoſe both wiſe and ſober, God would
prompt one whom they accounted diſtracted, to give ſuch
a rational, ſolide, and binding anſvvere, as all their vvit &amp;
learning could not frame a reply unto; It ſeemeth if this
<hi>Surveyer</hi> had been rideing on <hi>Balaam's</hi> aſſe, he vvould have
been more furious and mad after the revvard, then vvas that
vvicked vvretch, and vvould have thought himſelf more
brutish then the aſſe, to hearken to vvhat the Lord did put in
<pb facs="tcp:105606:10"/>
the mouth of the aſſe to ſay, by way of rebuke. Thinks he
that no man of ſound judgment vvill think a ſcripture ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
anſvvered, by produceing another; And that this is
but to ſet the ſcripture by the eares? Then it ſeemeth vvith
him, no man of a ſound judgment muſt think that our Lord
Jeſus did ſufficiently anſvvere that paſſage of Scripture
vvhich Satan abuſed, by adduceing another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. But
that Chriſt did nothing but ſet the ſcriptures by the eares, is
this far from blaſphemy? I vvonder vvhere vvas the devils
vvit that he had not this reply to make unto Chriſt's anſvver,
vvhich this <hi>Surveyer</hi> here maketh? It ſeemeth our <hi>Surveyer</hi>
can eaſily out-vvit the devil himſelf, and declare himſelf
better vvorthy of the chaire. But enough of this here, ſeing
it is obviated <hi>Chap,</hi> XVII. <hi>Obj.</hi> 15. The author of <hi>Naphtali</hi> did
further give theſe anſvvers. 1. <hi>That from the place it ſelf, &amp;
all the Euangeliſts, it is moſt evident, that that command was given,
and theſe words ſpoken by our Lord, only for to testify his voluntare
ſubmiſſion unto the fathers will, by laying down of his life for
fulfilling the Scripture, as is clear From</hi> Math. 26. ver. 54.
<hi>and</hi> Joh. 18: 11. <hi>Otherwiſe the context being conſidered, (that
notonly in</hi> Luke. 22: 36. <hi>cited, He, forewarning his diſciples of
hazard to come, adviſeth them to provide ſwords and weapons. And</hi>
Mat. 26. <hi>aſſerts his power to have called 12 Legions of angels to his
aſſistance, which clearly implyes the lawfulneſſe thereof) this Scripture
objected doth more confirme then impugne the lawfulneſſe of defenſive
armes.</hi>] What ſayeth our <hi>Surveyer</hi> to this? He ſayes 1.
<hi>That paſſage,</hi> Luke. 22: 36. <hi>is perverted by him.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe</hi>
Beza, Diodat, and Ianſenius <hi>acknowledge that ſpeach to be wholly
allegorick.</hi> And then addeth, <hi>that in very dead it cannot
ſuſtaine that Chriſt should here enjoyn them to buy ſwords of outward
mettal, ſeing it was not Chriſt's minde that at that time they should
uſe ſuch ſwords, no not in defence of his owne perſon, would he have
them ſell their cloaths to buy ſwords, and then not uſe them? Anſw.</hi>
Though we have obviated this reply, in the place cited
Chap. XVII. and fully vindicated our argument from this
paſſage Chap. XII. Arg. 13. beginning <hi>Pag.</hi> 260. Yet we shall
adde this, that ſure Chriſt's Diſciples tooke him to be ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of vveapons &amp; ſvvords of outward mettal, when they ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:105606:11"/>
to him <hi>here are two;</hi> and as ſure it is, that Chriſt's reply ſaying
<hi>it is enough,</hi> hinteth at no ſpiritual armour othervviſe vve muſt
ſay that his Diſciples at this time vvere ſufficiently fortified
againſt all Spiritual vvars and combats; and yet after expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
proveth the contrary: And no leſse ſure is it that if
Chriſt had here meaned <hi>Spiritual armour,</hi> he vvould have been
loath to have left his Diſciples in ſuch a miſtake, vvhich
vvas of ſo great concernement for all time comeing, novv
eſpecially vvhen he vvas shorthly to be taken from them:
And vvhere do vve finde him rectifying this miſtake of the
Diſciples, or ſaying, That he meaned no ſuch svvords; his
ſaying it is enough, Importeth ſome other thing, as is ſaid:
Againe, if this ſpeech be wholly allegorick, what way will
they expone theſe words, <hi>But now he that hath a purſe let him take
it, and likewiſe his Scripe?</hi> But as we ſee no ground for an
allegroy here, ſo we may not expone Scripture by allegories
when we pleaſe; all know how dangerous it is to do ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
clear warrand. And as for this <hi>Surveyer's</hi> reaſon added,
it is of no weight to force us to accept of ſuch an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for though it was not our Lords minde, that they
should uſe thoſe ſwords further at that time; yet he might
have taught the lawfulneſſe of ſelf defence in other caſes
where there was no poſitive command to the contrary, by
thus ſaying unto them, <hi>He that hath no ſword, let him ſell his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and buy one,</hi> Since he had not made uſe of ſuch forcible
defence before, to have showne them the lawfulneſſe thereof,
as he did of flight, which alſo at this time, he would not
make uſe of; and that they might ſee how voluntaryly and
of his owne accord he laid downe his life, in obedience to
the command which he had received of his Father, who
would not make uſe even of that meane which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
lawful, by adviſeing them to provide ſwords. Againe
the <hi>Surveyer</hi> replyeth, <hi>The queſtion is now anent the lawfulneſſe of
privat mens uſeing defenſive arms againſt all Magiſtrats, without any
shadow of authority: And to prove this he alledges that God by his
abſolute power might ſend 12. Legions of Angels to help Chriſt: God
hath authority above all authorities in the World, and he may imploy
Angels or Men, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hse pleaſeth, and then they have a good warrand
<pb facs="tcp:105606:11"/>
and authority: But what makes this for any privat Mens uſeing the
ſword againſt the Magiſtrate, without authority either from God or Men?
It is wonder us reaſoning from Gods abſolute power, &amp; the efficacy of
Christ's prayer,—to argue the lawfulneſse of privat Mens reſiſtence of
the lawful Magiſtrate without any warrand from God. Anſw.</hi> This is
to us, no ſtrange way of replying, ſeing we have met with
the like ſo often before. No Man ſayeth, let be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh
to prove whether by this or any other argument, that
it is lawful for privat perſons, yea or for Kings and all in
authority, to reſiſt whether lawful Magiſtrats or others,
without a warrand from God. What a non-ſenſical contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
concluſion, should this be? But this we ſay, That it is
not in every caſe unlawful nor wanteth it a warrand from God,
even for privat Subjects to defend themſelves from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of thoſe in power, by forcible reſiſtence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that Chriſt would not ſuffer his followers to make
uſe thereof, in his caſe, which was ſingular: And, among
other things, his ſaying, that he could obtaine by prayer
of the Father 12 Legions of Angels, for his ſuccour, doth
confirme it: For if he might not make uſe of mens help,
neither might he ſeek the help of Angels: So that we argue
not from God's abſolute power, but from Chriſt's profeſſing,
he might, if he would, obtaine the help of Angels, we show
that in itſelf abſtract from a particular poſitive command to
the contrary, it was not unlawful, for the Diſciples to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves and their Maſter, nor for Chriſt to make uſe
of their help, as it was not in itſelf unlawful to make uſe of the
help of Angels. Which yet in that caſe he would not do.
3, He replyeth, <hi>Albeit one part of our Lords deſigne, is to teſtify his
willing ſubmiſſion, to the pleaſure of his Father, yet that is not all;
for any occaſion of this prohibition to Peter, he giveth a general rule to
all his Diſciples being privat Men, and to all private Men, that
they should not take the ſword, God not giving them Authoritie:
Anſw.</hi> If he meane by <hi>Authority,</hi> publick Magiſtratical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
He but begs the queſtion; and if he meane a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
warrand, we grant all: For though privat perſons have
not the Magiſtratical power of the ſword; yet we have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb facs="tcp:105606:12"/>
proved that they have a warrand, in caſes of neceſſity,
to make uſe of the ſword of defence or reſiſtence, in their
owne defence: And Chriſt's Word ſpeaks nothing againſt this.
And if he should ſay, That Chriſt's ſentence being general
admits of no ſuch exception, I would gladely know, how
he will ſalve the lawfulneſſe of publick perſons taking the
ſword, for Chriſt ſpeaks in general to his Diſciples, <hi>He who
taketh the ſword shall perish by the ſword:</hi> and I ſuppoſe he will
not exclude Kings &amp; Magiſtrats from the roll of Chriſt's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
If he ſay, he meaneth all theſe unto whom God
giveth no authority Magiſtratical. How shall he prove this?
If he ſay he ſpeaketh to his Diſciples who were private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
True, but it is as true, That he ſpeaketh to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
who were Miniſters. <hi>Ergo</hi> shall it concerne only
Miniſters? And that he ſpeaketh to his Diſciples who were
Chriſtians. <hi>Ergo</hi> it muſt alſo concerne all Chriſtians &amp; Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats
as well as others. Thus we ſee his evaſions are naught:
And the true meaning is, that all ſuch as make uſe of the
ſword, without God's warrand (which the Diſciples now
wanted, having God's minde revealed to the contrary in
that particular,) shall perish by the ſword: and with this
reſtriction we admit of it, and he cannot reject it: And then
it will make nothing againſt us, as is ſaid &amp; proved. <hi>Naphtaly</hi>
anſwereth 3. <hi>Is it poſſible that men should be ſo far demented by
flattery, as to think that it was unlawful for Ieſus Chriſt, the mighty
God and Lord over all, to have defended himſelf by the aſſiſtence of
his Diſciples, againſt the horrid wickedneſſe and inſurrection of the
vileſt of his creatures, had it not been that it was neceſſary that the
Scriptures concerning him should be accomplished?</hi> The surveyer
ſayeth, <hi>He is inſolent in</hi> ſaying ſo: Why ſo? Becauſe, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it be true, Christ as God, could have deſtroyed by himfelf or his
instruments all the vile creatures that roſe up against him; yet Chriſt
as Man, ſubmitting himſelf in our nature to fulfil all righteouſneſſe,
ſubmitted himſelf to Magiſtracy, as the ordinance of God—
and whatever by God's Law was unlawful for a ſubject to do, (as
rebellion againſt lawfull powers is) the Son of God in the ſtate of his
humiliation ſubmitted that the same should be unlawful to him as
Man &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> It is true Chriſt as Man became Subject to
<pb facs="tcp:105606:12"/>
the Law and to Magiſtracy as the ordinance of God. But
to ſay that therefore He might not defend himſelf againſt the
vileſt of his creatures, who roſe up to take his life, though
abſtract from that particular caſe wherein he had a particular
command of God to lay downe his life, becauſe that would
have been rebellion, is but to begg the queſtion, and we have
ſaid enough to prove the contrary. <hi>Naphtaly</hi> had a 3. anſwer
thus. <hi>Where our Lord ſayeth in the place objected,</hi> all they that
take the ſword &amp;c. <hi>as he thereby only condemneth</hi> unjuſt and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
war; <hi>So the ſaying itſelf by its later part, doth tacitely imply
the lawfulneſſe &amp; juſtice of both</hi> defenſive &amp; vindicative arms, <hi>the
ſame being otherwiſe juſtly founded.</hi> Unto this The <hi>Surveyer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
1. That the firſt part is falſe; for then, ſayes he; <hi>That ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
should not be pertinently applyed to</hi> Peter's <hi>fact or fault, for his
uſeing of the ſword was defenſive and objectively juſt on his part, to
wit, in defence of his maſter, whom they did invade; yet he is
reproved as wanting lawful authority. Anſw. Peter's</hi> wanting
a vvarrand for any further uſe of the ſvvord, made, it
is true, his vvar unjuſt yea and offenſive, for all
lawful war (except where God giveth a particular command
to deſtroy a nation or people, as he commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
to deſtroy the <hi>Canaanits,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Amaelekites,</hi>)
is in a manner meerly defenſive, as ſundry politicians averre,
thinking no ordinare war lawful, but what is defenſive:
And ſo this war being contrare to the revealed will of God,
was unlawful, and ſo condemned by this ſentence. But to
gather hence, that every defenſive war of Subjects is hereby
condemned, is to put more in the concluſion, then is in the
premiſſes. His 2 reply is <hi>That the later is moſt falſly concluded,
if he meane defenſive and vindictive armes againſt the Magiſtrate,
for albeit defenſive and vindictive armes be otherwayes juſtly founded,
the defect of a lawful authority makes them unjuſt and ſinful: And
it is utterly againſt Chriſt's minde, and ſcope of the text, to allow
defenſive as well as vindictive armes againſt the Magiſirate, for</hi>
Peter <hi>was defending himfelf and his Maſter, and revenging the
invaſion made by</hi> Malchus <hi>the Magiſtrats ſervant upon Chriſt,
and yet he is reproved for both. Anſw.</hi> To ſay that the defect of
a lawful authority (as he underſtandeth it) maketh a defenſive
<pb facs="tcp:105606:13"/>
war in ſubjects againſt their Magiſtrats, otherwiſe lawful,
is but to beg the queſtion, and is not proved by any reproof
<hi>Peter</hi> gote, becauſe as we have often tolde him, that was a
particular caſe, it being neceſſary that the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Chriſt should be accomplished, which is only added
by our Lord, as the ground of his diſcharging <hi>Peter</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed:
Chriſt never tels him that it was againſt the lawful
Magiſtrates, and therefore might not lawfully be: Yea
that which made <hi>Peter's</hi> Defence in this caſe unlawful, would
not Permit I. C. to pray to his father for aid or deliverance:
now if he will conclude from Chriſt's diſcharge of <hi>Peter</hi> to
make uſe of the ſword, that it is ſimply unlawful for perſons
not cloathed with publick Authority, in any caſe, to defend
themſelves from the unjuſt violence of Magiſtrates, then let
him conclude alſo from Chriſt's example that it is unlawful
for them to pray for help from God when they are oppreſſed:
for Chriſt gives on reaſon for both. We are willing to
grant him all that can be drawne from the ſcope of the place,
to wit, that when God hath ſo plainly declared by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that there is not ſo much as place left for praying
that the thing where with we are threatned may be avoided,
but that we muſt ſuffer, and that then it is our duety to ſeek to
be ſtrengthened with all might, according to his glorious
power, &amp;c. That in this caſe, to take the ſword is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
this I ſay we willingly grant; but if he would
wreſt the words further to make them ſay what he would
have them he erreth not knowing the ſcriptures nor attending
to their ſcope: Yea, it may be queſtioned if the <hi>Chiefe Prieſts,
Scribes</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> who ſent out that band of ſouldiers, vvere
lawful civil Magiſtrats, at this time, having power and
authority from God, to uſe ſuch civil force and coaction,
and not rather uſurpers. But we need preſſe this no further,
having ground ſufficient, to maintaine what we aſſert, even
yeelding this unto the adverſaries.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Naphtali</hi> had conſidered theſe paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which were objected to the impaneled, He propoſed
two other to be examined: The firſt vvas <hi>Ioh. 18: 36.</hi> 
               <q>If
<pb facs="tcp:105606:13"/>
my Kingdome vvere of this vvorld, then would my ſervants
fight that I should not be delivered to the jevves, <hi>Vnto which</hi>
Naphtaly <hi>anſwered thus.</hi> As the intent &amp; ſcope of our Lord's
anſvver vvas to clear himſelf of that calumny objected
againſt him by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that he made himſelf a King in
oppoſition to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> So the meaning of it is plaine and
obvious, to vvit, That our Lord's Kingdome is not of
the Nature, and for the Ends, for vvhich other Kingdoms
of this World vvere inſtituted; but vvholly ſpiritual, for
declareing the Truth, &amp; thereby gaining ſouls unto glory:
Whence as our Lord vvould there inferred, that he came
not to conquer to himſelf diſciples by outvvard force, and
thereby to gaine follovvers to the ſpoiling of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and
other Princes; So it is vvithout all shaddovv of connexion,
thence to conclude, that a people having received the
bleſſing of the goſpel, and Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt,
should vvithout reſiſtance ſuffer themſelves (to the manifeſt
dishonour of God, and the hazard of the eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of themſelves and their poſterity) to be impiouſly and
ſacrilegiouſly ſpoiled and deprived thereof, vvhen they are
in capacity to defend the ſame. <hi>This the</hi> Surveyer <hi>accounteth</hi>
Pag. 268. an extravagant expoſition; <hi>and why?</hi> Is not
(<hi>ſayes he</hi>) Chriſt's plaine meaning, to declare the nature of
his Kingdome to be ſpiritual, by this, that none of his
ſervants vvere engaged merely upon this account, and
under this formality, that they vvere his Servants, to fight
violently for him? This vvas ſecurity enough to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
&amp; all Magiſtrats for ever, that none of his ſubjects should
take up armes in his quarrel againſt them, but should only
do ſo vvhen Religion came to be <hi>a Lawright,</hi> defenſible
under the Magiſtrats protection againſt all forreigners; But
there is not the leaſt hint of his ſaying, that he came not
to conquere diſciples to himſelf by outvvard force, his
intention being meerly to give aſſurance, that violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
to our proper Magiſtrates, even in his behalfe, is
unſuteable to his Kingdom.] Anſvv. 1. Mr Hutcheſon
<hi>on the palce tels us, that Chriſt's ſcope here is</hi> expreſly to anſvvere
<pb facs="tcp:105606:14"/>
to the accuſation concerning his Kingdome, and ſpeaks ſo
much of it negatively, as might ſatisfy <hi>Pilate,</hi> That it
might vvell enough conſiſt vvith the ſaifty of the <hi>Roman</hi>
State. Therefore he shevveth that his Kingdome was not
a wordly Kingdome; and for proof thereof, he inſtanceth
how far he was from aſpireing to a Kingdome by force
of armes, in that he would not ſo much as permit his ſervants
to fight in his defence, as they offered to do, vvhen the
jewes came to take him.</q>]. This, in my apprehenſion, is
not one and the ſame with the <hi>Surveyer's</hi> gloſſe, and leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant
from <hi>Naphtali's</hi> gloſſe, then is his. 2. What though
it should be granted, that none of Chriſt's ſervants vvere
engaged, meerly upon that account, and under this forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to fight violently for him? Will it hence follow that
Chriſtians in a Kingdome, may not ſtand to the defence of
the profeſſed Religion, received and ſworne to by King
and all rankes, againſt manifeſt tyranny and oppreſſion? I
ſee not the conſequence, ſeing they may do all this as civil
Subjects, good countrey men, and loyal patriots: and this
is enough for us. 3. Himſelf dar not deny, but even Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
ſujects of Chriſt, may take up arms in his quarrel, in
ſome caſes, for he granteth it may be in this caſe, vvhen
religion cometh to be a <hi>Law right</hi> defenſible under the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
protection againſt forraigners; But, is there any
ground for this exception alone in all Chriſt's anſwere? 2.
If there be no ground more for this then for others, vvhy
may not we put in our exception, as well as our adverſary
putteth in his? 3. If it become a <hi>Law right,</hi> why may it not
as well be defended by private ſubjects, as other <hi>Law rights</hi>
and civil libertyes, are and may be, even againſt Magiſtrates?
4. Shall it not be defended even when it becometh a <hi>Law right,</hi>
againſt forreigners, but under the protection of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates?
Then, if Magiſtrates will not concurre, private
perſons may not defend their Religion by force of armes,
againſt an army of Turks Papiſts or Heathens, comeing to
preſſe all to Mahometaniſme, Idolatry or Heatheniſme?
What height of abſurdity were here? 5. Since Chriſtian
Magiſtrats are Servants to Chriſt, as well as Chriſtian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
<pb facs="tcp:105606:14"/>
Why shall it be more lawful for them to engage in
Chriſt's quarrel under this formality, that they are his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
then for meer ſubjects; ſeing Chriſt maketh no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
here, of one or other, nor diſtinction among his
Servants; and ſeeing this ſeemed to be as little ſecurity for
<hi>Caeſar</hi> as the other, if the ſcope mentioned by the ſurveyer
be the true ſcope? 4. The particular mentioned by <hi>Naphtali</hi>
is more ſuteable to the true ſcope, then this vvhich the
<hi>Surveyer</hi> mentioneth: For the queſtion vvas not touching
reſiſtence to our proper Magiſtrates in Chriſt's behalfe. But
whether Chriſt was a King or not: to vvhich Chriſt anſwered
That hovvbeit He vvas a King, yet his Kingdome vvas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
vvith <hi>Caeſars</hi> Kingdome: And as he come not
to conquere Subjects to himſelf by outvvard force,
ſo he minded not to erect a temporal Kingdom by

               <hi>Naphtaly</hi> did adde further. <hi>The truth whereof, together with
the hypocriſy of our adverſaries, may ſoon be diſcovered, if the
question be but ſtated in the tearms of one forraigne and independent
prince's invading another, meerly upon the account of the Chriſtian
faith; and whatever ſolution or evaſion they shall herein make, will
as exactly quadrate to the caſe in hand, it being almoſt ridiculous to
conceive, that the greateſt-aggravations of invaſions of this kinde,
to wit, that it is made by a prince upon his owne ſubjects, (whoſe
profeſſion he himſelf is principally bound to maintaine) should import
any ſpeciality and difference in the caſes.</hi> Unto this I finde no

our own Magiſtrates—then forraigners, becauſe our owne being bound

in <hi>Pag. 159.</hi> and though he miſcite the vvords, and vvreſt
them after his vvonted manner, yet the Reader may ſee it

ſoundly ſaid that if parents should make diſorder in the houſe,
that the children, and reſt of the family, should uſe violence rather
againſt them, when they miſcarry or waſte the goods of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,

Anſw.</hi> To paſſe by the unſuteableneſſe of this Reply unto
<hi>Naphtali's</hi> anſwer, as if <hi>Naphtaly</hi> had concluded that there was
much more reaſon for reſiſting our owne Magiſtrats then
Forraigners, while as an equality would have ſatiſfied him,
as his words clearly import; We ſay this to his reply, That
when he hath demonſtrated to us that Children and Servants,
have as great right unto the goods of the family, and as great
power and privilege in ſetting up their Parents the heads of
the family, and of calling them to account for their miſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement,
as we have proved Subjects have in the common
good, and in ſetting up of Soveraignes, and in calling them
to an account, then shall his reply be noticed as having ſome
parallel; but till then we diſmiſſe it with this anſwere, that
the <hi>ſimile,</hi> as to our poynt, is <hi>prorſus diſſimile,</hi> and can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
nothing: Yea, let us turne is owne weapon againſt
himſelf and ſay, Seing Children and Servants may lawfully,
with force, with hold the heads of the family, when they,
in a fit of phrenſy, are labouring to deſtroy all, to burne the
houſe above their heads, or to caſt all the goods in the houſe
into a fire, and reſiſt them no leſſe then open enemies and
robbers, thinks he if ſoundly ſaid, That if Kings in a fit of
madneſſe &amp; Tyranny shal ſeek to deſtroy the common wealth
&amp; wholly overturne all Religion, to ſet up idolatry &amp; heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,
the Subjects may not withſtand them, &amp; prevent their
owne ruine, and the ruine of Religion, with force of armes,
when no other meanes can availe? What will he ſay to this?
Will he deny this conſequence? If not, have not we enough?
But he addeth, <hi>The Authors error is this, that he looks meerly to
the obligation of the Magiſtrate to us, and not at all to our obligation to
him, even when he fails abuſeing his power. Anſw,</hi> He looks
meerly to the obligation of the Magiſtrate to us, when he
mentioneth the aggravation of his guilt of invaſion upon that
account; And whatever be our obligation to the Magiſtrate,
(which <hi>Naphtaly</hi> did not forget though he was not called ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb facs="tcp:105606:15"/>
to mentione it then &amp; there,) it will not follow that it is
an obligation unto an illimited and ſtupide Subjection to him,
in all caſes; and if the <hi>Surveyer</hi> prove not this (vvhich I
ſuppoſe he vvill not do) he vvill prove nothing againſt us.</p>
            <p>What more ſayes he to this place of Scripture? <hi>Pag. 267.</hi>
after he hath given us, in his vvay; the meaning of theſe
vvords of Chriſt, to vvit, <hi>That Chriſt proves his Kingdome not to
be of this world by this</hi> Medium, <hi>that if it were ſo, his ſervants
(in the quality of his Servants) should take up outward armes and fight
for him, &amp;c.</hi> Then he concludes <hi>that this text will enforce—
that Christ's Subjects (meerly as they are in the capacity of his Subjects)
are not to uſe the ſword againſt Magiſtrates, that are over them, in
his behalfe.</hi> And then ſayes, <hi>he allowes well of</hi> Mr. Hutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's
<hi>note upon the place—Chriſt ſayeth he</hi> by hindering his
ſervants to fight, vvho vvere but private men, as to any civil
povver, hath taught that private men are not vvarranted to
dravv the ſvvord, vvere it even in defence of Religion, but
they ought to maintaine it by ſuffering, when called to that
extremity.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We have showne already how this
man's gloſſe, and <hi>Mr. Hutcheſons</hi> do not every way quadrate.
2. If this text enforce that Chriſt's ſubjects, meerly as they
are in capacity of his ſubjects, are not to uſe the ſword in
Chriſt's behalfe; then, He muſt either ſay that people even
under the conduct of a lawful Magiſtrate can not defend Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
by armes (which yet immediatly thereafter he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
of ſay, that when they defend Religion ſo, they act
not meerly in the capacity of Chriſt's ſubjects. 3. As for
<hi>Mr. Hutcheſon's</hi> note which he oppoſeth to all our rebellious
fancies, we ſay, we wish that that worthy author who hath
given great proof of his dexterity in deduceing poynts of
doctrine from the text, had been, after his uſual manner, more
acurate here, and had guarded his aſſertion better, that it
might have had a more clear riſe, every way anſwering the
ground it was deduced from: for ſure I am, this ground (if
it be at all againſt defenſive armes in matters of Religion)
will as much ſpeak againſt a defence uſed by Magiſtrates,
upon this account, as by privat Subjects; for the ground is
the ſame, to wit, that Chriſt's Kingdome is not of this
world, and alike concerning Magiſtrats and people, and is
<pb facs="tcp:105606:16"/>
no more a temporall Kingdome in regaird of Magiſtrats,
then in regaird of private perſons. And upon the ground
that Chriſt would not ſuffer his Diſciples to fight for
him, at that time, upon the ſame ground he would not have
ſuffered even Magiſtrats to fight for him, for he behoved to
drink the cup that his father gave him: And neither Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
nor privat perſons, could have hindered that by
force, or would have been permitted to do it, by him: And
<hi>if it be ſaid</hi> that from other paſſages it is clear, that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
who are nourſing parents to the Church, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to uſe the ſword. We <hi>anſwere</hi> That we have alſo proved
from ſcripture and reaſon, that people, in ſome caſes, may
uſe the ſword of defence for Religion. Againe it <hi>if be ſaid,</hi>
that his Diſciples were but private perſons, as to any civil
power, and therefore it is only to be underſtood of theſe. <hi>It
is anſwered</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it will as well follow, That becauſe they
were fisher-men, therefore it is to be meaned only of theſe,
and of none elſe; or that becauſe they vvere Church officers,
therefore, only they muſt not uſe the ſword, and ſo all
others may.</p>
            <p>The laſt place which <hi>Naphtaly</hi> mentioned, was <hi>Math. 5:
v. 27.</hi> to the end, where it is ſaid, <hi>Reſiſt not evil but whoſoever shall
ſmite thee</hi> &amp;c. with the parallel places, ſpecially, <hi>Rev. 13: v. 10.</hi>
Unto which he anſwered, <hi>That as theſe places do enjoyn either
patience, when the clear call and diſpenſation of God do inevitably call
unto ſuffering, without which patience were no patience but rather ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of &amp;c.—So thence to inferre that Men should give way to all
violence and ſacrilege (to the ſubverting of Religion and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
is after the manner of Satan, to cheat and abuſe men by the holy
Scriptures.</hi>
The <hi>Surveyer</hi> replyeth thus, (I meddle not with
his impertinent reflections, and ſcurrile jibes, nor vvith his
groundleſſe inferences, vvhich vve have ſo oft met vvith in
the former part.) <hi>The ſcope is, to shew the unlawfulneſſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
revenge, for injuries done to us,—and the place will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
plainely enough violent retaliating the Magiſtrate, when we
think he doth us wrong. Anſw.</hi> The ſcope of the place is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and doth no more condemne private perſons retaliating
the Magiſtrate, then Magiſtrats retaliating privat Subjects;
<pb facs="tcp:105606:16"/>
unleſſe Magiſtrates be exempted from this precept, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
be not to be reckoned among Chriſt's followers.
And as from this place, it will not follow, that one inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
King may not make war againſt another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
defend his rights, nor that one private perſon may not
defend his rights and juſt poſſeſſions againſt an invader, no
more will if follow, that Subjects may not defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Rights, Libertyes, and Religion, againſt
the violent oppreſſion and Tyranny of Magiſtrats. Next
ſayes the <hi>Surveyer, Pag. 269. That every Man in his calling ought
to withſtand violence and Sacrilege to the ſubverting of Religion and
Righteousneſſe, is granted: Yea privat Men may reſiſt the unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of private Perſons, and being under the conduct of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
may reſiſt any that offereth violence, in leſſer concernments
then theſe are: But we ſtill maintaine that this text forbids all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
or violent retaliation upon the Magiſtrate though he abuſe his
power. Anſw.</hi> The queſtion is not what he will ſtill maintaine
that this text doth forbid; but what he can evince that this
text will prove againſt us. How will he prove that this text
doth more forbid private perſons, to reſiſt the unjuſt violence
of Magiſtrats, then to reſiſt the unjuſt violence of privat
perſons, or to reſiſt the unjuſt violence of any, having Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats
to conduct them? Is there any exception in the text?
Doth not the text ſpeak to all in reference to all? To wit, that
they should reſiſt none out of a Spirit of private revenge?
Againe though the text forbid all revenge or violent retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the Magiſtrate, though he abuſe his power; will
it therefore forbid privat Subjects to defend themſelves by
force, in caſe of neceſſity, from manifeſt and unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Tyranny? No: no more then becauſe the text doth
forbid even Magiſtrats to revenge or retaliate, from a Spirit
of revenge, wicked Malefactors, It doth therefore forbid
them to execute juſtice upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Naphtaly</hi> did add, that this was <q>[groſly to exceed
that ſignal rule mainly in theſe places intended, to wit,</q>]
that we should be perfect even as our Father which is in
Heaven is perfect; <q>[Who though he filleth the Earth
with his goodneſſe,—yet doth he love righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:105606:17"/>
and helpeth and delivereth the oppreſſed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
the Zeal of his owne glory (wherein he himſelf
doth often eminently appeare) by the hand of his people,
to take vengeance on his adverſaries.</q> To this the <hi>Surveyer</hi>
replyeth. <q>(What ſtrange argueing is this, that becauſe
God Almighty executeth vengeance upon his adverſaries,
therefore private perſons should follow his perfection in
doing the like albeit they have not his warrand or command</q>
               <hi>Anſw. Naphtaly's</hi> Argument ran mainely upon <q>[helping and
delivering the oppreſſed]</q> Neither doth he conclude
what private perſons may do without God's warrand or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
This he ſuppoſed becauſe he had evinced it. Then
<hi>Naphtaly</hi> cloſeth ſaying, <q>[Let us therefore in the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what is ſaid, <hi>Rev 13: v. 10.</hi>)</q> He that leadeth into
captivity shall goe Into captivity. He that killeth with the
ſword &amp;c., <q>[Both poſſeſſe our ſouls in patience under all the
former ſufferings, and hope and rejoyce in the faith of the
ſucceeding delivery there ſubjoyned.]</q> 
               <q>Upon this
<hi>(ſayeth the Surveyer)</hi> he would found the conſolation, and
patience of his party in all former ſufferings, and his hope
and joy in the ſucceeding delivery.]</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And why
might he not? <q>[That word (<hi>ſayes he) Rev. 13.</hi> toucheth
not, nor threatens the Magiſtrate in the executeion of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
but rebels, who uſe the ſword without God's
warrand, againſt the Magiſtrate, may read their reward
in this text.]</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 
               <q>We ſay not that it threatens the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
executing juſtice. But let ſuch ſee to it, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of executing juſtice, pervert juſtice, and execute the
innocent people of God. And, after the manner of the Beaſt
there ſpoken of, maketh war with the Saints: And ſo may
all rebels againſt God who uſe the ſword without his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.
But as for privat subjects defending themſelves by
the ſword of innocent ſelf defence, againſt unjuſt violence,
and intolerable tyranny and oppreſſion, we have proved that
they want not God's warrand, and therefore they may
look for another reward. And as for his hope and confidence
after expreſſed, we let it paſſe as not worth the mentioning;
for when the hope of the Hypocrit perisheth, his is like to
give up the Ghoſt.</q>

Having thus anſwered all which this <hi>surveyer</hi> hath ſaid,
whether in his firſt part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or now in his ſecond, againſt the
truth which we have maintained, we may ſaifly ſay that theſe
valient worthies were baſely and unworthyly murthered, &amp;
that there was no juſt cauſe to take their lives. This man
<hi>pag. 260. &amp;c.</hi> Will not have them juſtified, and adduceth,
for the moſt part, ſuch reaſons, as make me doubt whether
he can be the ſame man, that drew up the firſt part of this
<hi>Survey,</hi> becauſe they are the very ſame things we heard before
in the firſt part; and is it poſſible the man could have forgotten
himſelf, or think that we could ſo ſoon have forgotten what
we heard in the firſt part, and had anſwered; And if he be
a diſtinct perſon; I wonder what the man meaned, to give
us the ſame thing over againe: did he ever read theſe in the
firſt part, or had he forgotten that ever he ſaw them? Or
thought he that they would have the weight of gold coming
from his Mouth, while they had not the weight of ſtuble
being uttered by his collegue? He beginneth that diſcourſe
with palpable untruthes, ſaying That they <hi>ſuffered not upon
the account of owneing the covenant.</hi> Whereas the maine Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their indictment was. <hi>That all convocations and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing
in armes, or ſubjects entering in leagues without or againſt the
King's authority are treaſonable.</hi> Then he tels us. <hi>That all which
they can ſay for their riſeing was that the Magiſtrate, by moderat
penaliyes according to law, was preſſing them to attendance upon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God, which is an indiſpenſible duty.</hi> This we heard
before and is anſwered Chap. XVI. <hi>pag. 348. &amp;c.</hi> Neither
was the penaltyes moderate, nor were they exacted according
to law, not were they thereby preſſed to attend that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
which is an indiſpenſible duty; But they were preſſed to
a ſinful complyance with abjured prelacy, contrare to their
vow and Covenant, by barbarous tyranny. Then he ſayes.
<hi>Their lives were not ſought upon any tearmes.</hi> See the place now
mentioned where that is ſpoken to alſo: and to all of common
ſenſe it was notour, that their caſe was a caſe of moſt in exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
neceſſity, their miſery being ſo much the greater that
their lives were left them to ſee themſelves miſerable, as if
<pb facs="tcp:105606:18"/>
the barbarous enemy had intended onely to make them liveto
ſee it. Neither was there any flying for a whole countrey ſide,
with their wives and children, and therefore what <hi>Lex Rex</hi>
ſayeth <hi>Pag. 327, 328. 329.</hi> confirmeth the lawfulneſſe of this.
As to their not ſupplicating mentioned by him next, it is
ſpoken to alſo in the place cited: And however he may
think now to incruſtate that tyrannical and irrational act,
forbidding all joynt ſupplications: yet the whole land know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that if that oppreſſed Countrey had attempted any ſuch
thing, they had been accounted guilty of <hi>Laeſe Majeſty.</hi> And
had gotten no other relief of all the illegal impoſitions which
inferiour officers did lay on. Thereafter he cals it a notable
contradiction to ſay that their riſe was <hi>indeliberate,</hi> and yet
<hi>Lawful, Iuſt, holy, exemplary, neceſſary:</hi> And <hi>that the godly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
never enrolled them among martyrs, who by their owne rashneſſe
had occaſioned their owne ſufferings. Anſw.</hi> As if an action might
not be both <hi>lawful just And neceſſary,</hi> though the firſt riſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
might have been unexpected, and a meer ſurpriſal of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
And as if every action were ſinfully rash vvhich
were not long and deliberatly before contrived. So then
by their rashneſs they did not occaſion their ſufferings; but,
by a ſurpriſal of providence. being called to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and to a vindication of their libertyes and Religion,
while they were murthered upon that account, they may very
lawfully be enrolled among the Martyrs. Then <hi>Pag. 261.</hi> he
ſayes. <hi>They were the firſt-aggreſſors, and firſt ſlew one of the Kings
ſervants.</hi> This was told us in the firſt part, and is anſwered:
And who knoweth not that the firſt aggreſſor may be firſt
killed. See what is ſaid to this <hi>Pag. 350.</hi> Then he ſayes <hi>the</hi>
Novatians &amp; Donatiſts <hi>were not accounted Martyrs albeit ſometimes
they were drawn to death by perſecuting pagans-ſuch a foul Staine did
they ſee in Schiſme. Anſw</hi> And indeed upon the ſame ground,
if any of this corrupt apoſtat facton, which hath made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from the received Religion, reformed in doctrine
worshipe diſcipline and Government, and ſworne unto by
our whole Church, were drawne to death by pagans, under
the common notion and name of Chriſtian, they could not
<pb facs="tcp:105606:18"/>
be accounted Martyres, becauſe of their ſinful and perfidious
renting of the body of Chriſt. They, and not the honeſt
party who adhere to their principles, are the ſchiſmaticks,
The <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> who departed from the truth, &amp;
not the honeſt Chriſtians who remained conſtant, were the
true ſchiſmaticks, Nor doth <hi>Naphtaly</hi> fix them in a ſchiſme
when he teacheth, that they were indiſpenſibly tyed by the
Covenant, to abhorre a complyance vvith theſe courſes of
defection, more then the honeſt fathers of old did fix the
honeſt party in a ſchiſme, by teaching that they vvere not to
imbrace the principles and practices of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians.</hi>
The 6. And laſt particular which he mentioneth
<hi>Pag. 262.</hi> is but a heap of groundleſſe calumnies, to vvit,
that their deſigne vvas <hi>to put downe all authority, to deſtroy all
who would not accept of their ſenſe of the Covenant.</hi> to <hi>place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the chaire of authority,</hi> of which ſtuff we have had
enough in the former part, and shall ſay no more now, but
that it is plaine, their cauſe is deſperate and gone, when they

are aſſimulat to the ſpirit which drives him, they will be both

reſiſt him under every shape whereinto he transformeth
himſelf, that he may aſſault &amp; overcome you; ſo shall he at laſt
flee from you, and ye shall be more then conquerours through
him who hath loved you: your <hi>Exit,</hi> though upon a ſcaffold,
will be unſpeakably joyous, and full of glory, and when ye
have made it appeare (if called there to) that ye love his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts
ſo well, that ye continue not to love your owne lives
unto the death; then shall ye be aſſociat with your bleſſed
brethren, and fellow ſufferers, who overcame the ſame
enemy that continues to make war vvith you and the remnant
of the vvomans ſeed, be the blood of the lamb,&amp; the word
of their teſtimony? Ye have not only the advantage of all
your perſecuters, but of many of the profeſſed yea real friends
of the vvork, a great many of vvhom, vvhen called by the
ſame providence to appeare vvith you, unto the help of the
Lord againſt the mighty, did couch under their burdens, and
abode amongſt the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the
flocks, vvhile like true <hi>Naphtali's</hi> ye jeoparded your lives in
the high places of the field, ſome of whom it may be have
added grief to your ſorrow, &amp; have condemned your riſeing,
to juſtiy their owne ſinful shifting, and sitting that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
againſt whom we know ye meditat no other revenge,
then ſtill to love many of them as brethren, &amp; pray that their
leaving you alone may never be laid to their charge. And of
ſome alſo who pretending reſpect to the cauſe, did a great deal
<pb facs="tcp:105606:20"/>
worſe, by aſſociating themſelves with that enemy, vvho
with open mouth did come upon you to eat you up, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of whoſe heart may be dreadful, when he cometh
to make inquiſition for the blood of his ſaints, and they may
tremble at the thoughts of being led out width theſe workers
of iniquity, with whom they joyned themſelves in the day of
your diſtreſſe. I wish that repentance may prevent this ruine:
ye have I ſay the advantages of theſe, &amp; have obtained mercy
of the Lord, to doe and ſuffer for his ſake while many of
your brethren have fainted and fled. keep your ground, for
ye are satans great eye ſore; he ſeeks you, to shake and
winnow you with the ſmooth &amp; flattering inſinuations of the
men vvhoſe great deſigne is to ſecure and ſetle themſelves on
the ruines of the vvork of God, and ſeem to offer ſome
thing, if ye vvill give them ſecurity for your keeping the
publick peace, that is, if ye vvill never offer to put out your
hand to ſtrip them of the ſpoiles of Chriſt's honour, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith
they have cloathed themſelves; this is to keep their
publick peace, to let them live in a peacable poſſeſſion of
vvhat they vvith vvicked hands have taken from Jeſus Chriſt,
and never to trouble that vvatch vvhich they have ſet about
the grave of his buried intereſts, for fear of its reſurrection.
But I hope that he who hath delivered your ſoul from death,
and preſerved you vvhile they hunted for your precious life,
will alſo deliver your feet from falling, that ye may, holding
ſtill your integrity, vvalk before God in the light of the
liveing.</p>
            <p>And though the Lord think good to hide his face for
a time, <hi>Let us waite on him who hideth his face from the houſe
of Iſrael, and let us look for him,</hi> vvho knovves but he be
<hi>waiting that he may be gracious, and that he will be exalted that
he may have mercy upon us: For the Lord is a God of Judgment,

becauſe it will ſurely come and will not tarry. Then they</hi> vvho
are our <hi>enemies shall ſee it; and shame shall cover them who ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:105606:20"/>
unto us, where is the Lord your God? Our eyes shall behold
them, and they shall be troden down as the mire of the ſtreets,</hi>
vve shall <hi>no more be tearmed for ſaken, neither shall our land be

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> That the whole body of the people of Scotland were
engadged to God, by ſolemne Covenants, vowes, purpoſes
and promiſes, frequently renewed, to owne and endeavour,
really, ſincerily, and conſtantly, through the grace of God, in

Prophaneſſe, and whatſoever shall be found to be contrary to
ſound doctrine, and the power of Godlineſſe, leſt they should
partake in other mens ſinnes, and thereby be in danger to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of their plagues: and that they should mutually, with the
Privileges of Parliaments, preſerve and defend the libertyes
of the Kingdo me: and in this common cauſe of religion, liberty,
&amp; peace, aſſiſt and defend all thoſe, who would enter into theſe
bonds, in the maintaining and purſueing thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Not only did the body of the commonalty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
and ſolemnely with hands lifted up to the Moſt High
God, ſweare theſe Covenants and engagements, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Magiſtrats; But the Magiſtrats themſelves, both
ſuperior and inferior, did take on them, in a moſt ſolemne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
theſe ſame vowes and engagements, and ſolemnel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
as they should anſwere to God in the great day, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this covenanted work of Reformation, and to proſecute,
in their places, ſtations and capacities, the Ends of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> When this King (vvho did ſvveare and ſubſcribe
theſe Covenants, before he came to Scotland) vvas crovvned,
and ſolemnely inaugurated, He not only renevved theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
vovves and engagements; But upon theſe termes and
conditions, vvas he admitted; the people declared their vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe
to admit of him, as King, the ſvvord vvas put in his
hand and accepted, the People did ſvveare fidelity, and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
according to theſe Covenants; the like did the Nobles
one by one, viz ſvveare to <hi>be true and faithfull to him, according to
the Nationall, and ſolemne League and Covenant.</hi> And all this
vvas aftervvard, vvhen the King attained the age of 21 years
compleat, in a full and free Parliament, ratified, concluded,
and enacted by King and all the Eſtates of Parliament: vvhere
by as <hi>Naphtals Pag. 72.</hi> vvell obſerveth, the ſame did paſſe into a
perpetual lavv, and became one of the principal fundamental
lavves of the conſtitution of our Kingdome, vvhereupon all
the rights and privileges. either of King or People, are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
bottomed and ſecured. Theſe things, as to matter of fact,
cannot be denyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105606:23"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Whatever was done of late, by King or Parliament,
or enacted, and concluded contrary to theſe covenants, vowes
and engagements, was (as unlawful, ſo) a real and formal
ſubverſion of the fundamental conſtitution of our Chriſtian
and reformed Kingdome; This none will deny who knoweth
the true nature of theſe covenants, and the real intereſt they
had, and yet have <hi>de jure,</hi> in our conſtitution, before this late
revolution, as was now expreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly.</hi> Notwithſtanding of all that hath been done by King
and Parliament, of late, in reſcinding, abjuring, and looſeing
of the obligation of theſe National bonds, and divine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
yet they remaine Covenants, and National tyes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
obligeing, before God, the King, Nobles, &amp; People
of all ranks; and will do, ſo long as <hi>Scotland</hi> is <hi>Scotland.</hi> This is
abundantly made out, by the <hi>Apologiſt;</hi> and is a fixed and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
confirmed truth, in the hearts of all who fear God,
and looke for his appearing as a ſwift witneſſ againſt all ſuch as
ſweare falſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly.</hi> That nothing was allaiged or allaigeable, againſt thoſe
perſones in <hi>Galloway,</hi> and places adjacent, as ground, or cauſe,
or occaſion of all that extremitie and rigour of iniquity, that
was exerciſed againſt them, but their ſimple non-obedience to
the act enjoyning conformitie and obedience to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
authoritie then established, which was diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
unto their vow and promiſe, in their ſolemne and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
covenants. So that really, upon the matter, their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
was meerly becauſe of their conſcience making, and
faithful endeavouring to adhere, through the grace of their
God, unto their covenants and engagements ſolemnely ſworne
and taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly.</hi> It will be eaſily granted by all rational perſons,
That in all Kingdomes and Commonwealths, a free people not
redacted unto a ſtate of baſe bondage and ſlavery, should be
ruled and governed civilly, according to the civil and municipal
lawes of the land, and not by military force and cruelty. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
uſe to lay aſide the wholeſome and eſtablished lawes of
the land, and to rule in an arbitrary manner, by the cruel and
mercyleſſe ſword, becauſe they neither intend, nor ſeek the good
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105606:24"/>
of their ſubjects; But only their owne ambition and baſe ends;
But Magiſtrats who ought to ſeek the good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
and preferre it to their owne particular ends, will have
reſpect to the lawes, and accordingly rule their ſubjects, and
not by an aribitrary cruelty, and force of armes, which are uſed
againſt enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly.</hi> The very law enjoyning this conformity, preſcribeth
the way how the ſame shall be put to due execution, viz. <q>[That
for this end the Council shall call before them all ſuch perſons,
as after admonition of the Miniſter, in preſence of two ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
witneſſes, and by himſo atteſted, shall be given up to
the Council as tranſgreſſours of this act—and the ſame after
hearing of partyes, being duely found, to decerne &amp; inflict the
cenſures and penalties]</q> And although the very law itſelf be
ſo iniquous and intolerable, as would undoubtedly bring ſudden
ruine, to all ſuch as would not obey the ſame, and that in a very
short time; yet if this legal manner of procedour, had been
followed, the execution, (though cruel, and ſufficiently
barbarous, the penalty having no ſuteable correſpondence
with, nor proportion unto, the ſuppoſed tranſgreſſion;
for, can any think that a perſons abſenting himſelf twice or
thrice from his owne parish Church, can be a tranſgreſſion
of ſuch a high nature, as no penalty leſſe then the fourth pairt
of his Eſtate, can compenſate?) had not ſeemed ſo arbitrary or
tyrannical; but when ſuch a grievous law, is more grievouſly
executed, and that arbitrarily, and illegally, is not this a very
intolerable oppreſſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly</hi> It is notourly knowne and unqueſtionably clear, and
alas too too wel demonſtrated by black, Tragical and inde
lible characters of ruine, extirpation, and beggery of many
honeſt families, yea, and of landed and ſufficiently provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gentlemen and others, ſo that none will, or can, (if he
hath not reſolved to beleeve neither what he ſeeth, nor
what he heareth) deny it: That Sr <hi>Iames Turner,</hi> and
his ſouldiers, under pretence of executeing this law, uſed
ſuch inhumane crueltyes, ſavage barbarities, unparallelable
exorbitancies, by illegal amercements, fineings, quarterings,
plunderings, beatings, dragging to priſones, wounding,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105606:24"/>
binding men like beaſts, chaſeing them to moors and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
laying waſte their lands, houſes, and habitations,
devouring what they could with horſe, dogs, &amp; men, burning
plenishing, utenſils and other neceſſaries in houſes, and thus
laying whole parishes and almoſt countreyſides waſte and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate,
and that without reſpect had to conſcience humane, let
be Chriſtian, to law divine, civil, or municipal grievous
or not grievous, yea without reſpect had to perſones guilty or
not guilty; for when they had conſumed the Landlord, they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
the Tennants though not guilty, &amp; when they had ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Tnenants, fel upon the Landlord though a conformiſt,
avowing and profeſſing they came to deſtroy, and they would
deſtroy; nor having any reſpect to poor or rich, widowes or
marryed perſons, old or young, yea, or to ſuch as ſtouped for-age,
to ſick, or bedrid creples, or to one or other; yea and did ſeſſe
and quarter, till perſons were forced to pay ſuch ſummes, as
the civil judges, before whom the cauſe was depending, had
not determined to be juſtly addebted by them. All which is
fully, and particularly laid open by <hi>Naphtaly,</hi> and will appeare
to all who have not renunced humanity, to be more then leſſer
injuries, as the <hi>Surveyer</hi> pag. 70 is pleaſed to account them,
and to be moſt unjuſt, though he make a queſtion thereof, yea
and ſuch grievous and intolerable oppreſſions, the hundereth
part whereof (as <hi>Naphtaly</hi> ſaid well.) would make him and his
complices curſe both God and their King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly.</hi> To all theſe forementioned cruelties and barbarities,
He added this, that he would ſuffer no man to complaine to him
of any wrong they had ſuffered by the brutish and barbarous
ſouldiery, nay nor ſupplicate for relief, and if they did, their
cauſe was helped by doubling their miſeries, yea, and which
might exceed all beleef (if its notoriety were not undenyable)
forced them, after all theſe horrid, dreadful, inhumane, and
brutish outrages and oppreſſions, to ſubſcribe an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
That <hi>he had uſed them civilly and diſcretly;</hi> and there
by neceſſitated them to deny what was as not oure as the ſun at
noonday, and their very common ſenſe and feelings, and alſo
to prejudge themſelves of all hope or poſſibility of getting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
by law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:105606:25"/>
                  <hi>Eleventhly</hi> Though this forementioned acknowledgement
had neither been asked nor granted, yet their condition was
irremediable: for neither they, nor any in the land, might
Supplicat King or Councel, either for relaxation of the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe
of the lawes, or for a more civil, moderate, yea or for
a ſtrick and legal execution of the iniquous and grievous lawes
made, under the paine of treaſon and <hi>leſe Majeſty.</hi> Though
it vvas an old received maxime, and is to this day, vvhere ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
is not avovvedly exerciſed, that <hi>cuivis licet ſupplicare &amp;
proteſtari:</hi> yet the late Parliament concluded, contrary to the
lavv of nature and nations, That petitions vvere ſeditious and
treaſonable. So that hovv arbitrarily ſoever King or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
yea or Council, or any deputed by them, did rage, or
should opprreſſe &amp; injure the Subjects, vvhether in conſcience,
body or goods, there vvas no remedy, nor hope of redreſſe, no
petition or ſupplication how humble ſoever, might be once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by the grieved ſubjects: yea nor durſt they meet together
to poure out their complaint unto the God of heaven, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of prayers, &amp; the righteous judge of heaven &amp; earth. What
height of opprreſſion &amp; tyranny this is, Let all the vvorld judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelvethly.</hi> It is uncertaine, yea much doubted, if Sr. <hi>Iames
Turner,</hi> that ſingular inſtrument of barbarous cruelty, had any
commiſſion form King or Council, impovvering him to ſuch
illegal exorbitancies (whatever he might have had, under hand,
from ſome Members of Council vvho had moſt ſold themſelves
to cruelty, and to the utter extirpation of all who would not
run vvith them, to the ſame exceſſe of riot) ſure if any ſuch thing
be, the records vvill manifeſt it; but ſince they cashired him
and ſome of his aſſociats, and made an offer of cauſeing him
anſvvere for vvhat he had done, it is very probable, he had no
formal commiſſion for vvhat he did; and yet ſince he and others
are permitted to live, after ſuch crueltyes, barbarities, and un
heard of vvickedneſſes, and no reparation made to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones
injured, it is certane he is but too vvell approved in all
he did, and of vvhat uſe this shall be, vvill appeare afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirteenthly.</hi> The intent and deſigne of thoſe poor people
who roſe in armes, was not to dethrone the King, to enjure
him, or to leſſen his juſt and legal authoritie; but to reſiſt, repel, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105606:25"/>
defend themſelves from, unjuſt violence and oppreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to ſeek reparations of the wrongs done them; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of that deteſtable and abjured Hierarchy, the eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and upholding of which, as it was, &amp; is a great provocation
of the anger of God againſt the land, ſo it was the fountaine
and riſe of all theſe horrid oppreſſions which they ſuffered,
and of the making of ſuch grievous ſtatutes, and eſtablishing
iniquitie into a law, and was to be a laſting cauſe and occaſion
of violent. unjuſt and illegal oppreſſions, and intolerabel vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to all the faithful of the land; and withal, to have ſecurity
for their lives, lands, libertyes, conſciences, and Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to the agreement made with his Majeſty, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Covenant, and the Solemne league and covenant, which
he ſolemnely ſwore once and againe, and vowed and promiſed
to defend and proſecute, in all their ends: and that for this end,
all ſuch lawes made for prelacy, and againſt the work of God
and the reformation, which through Gods bleſſing we had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to, might be repealed, annulled and reſcinded. This
and nothing elſe could be the intent and deſigne of theſe valient
though naked worthyes. That they intended no harme to the
King, or to his juſt &amp; lawful government &amp; authority, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure
by the laſt ſpeaches &amp; teſtimonies of ſuch as were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
&amp; publickly executed; &amp; the petition Which they ſent
in to the Council with <hi>William Lauwry</hi> Tutor of <hi>Blakewood</hi> doth
aboundantly teſtify that they would have had the free exerciſo
of their covenanted Religion &amp; freedom from the domeneering
tyranny of Prelats &amp; their adherents; their renewing of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
&amp; Covenant doth ſufficiently cleare that they intended no
inſurrection or rebellion againſt the Kings juſt and lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
for they ſwore to defend the Kings Majeſtyes perſon
and authority, in the preſervation and defence of the True
Religion, and libertyes of the Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>From theſe conſiderations, we shall now lay downe the true
ſtate of the queſtion, thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whether or not, when the whole body of a land, Magiſtrats
higher and lower, People, are engaged by ſolemne
vowes, made to the moſt high God, joyntly &amp; ſeverally, to
promove a reformation, and to extirpat Prelats, &amp; the ſame
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105606:26"/>
covenanted work is becom a chief corne ſtone of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kingdom, and one of the mane conditions, on
which the King is inſtalled on his throne; and when theſe
ſame Magiſtrats Supreme and inferiour, renunce their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, and with the People, overturne the work of
reformation formerly ſworne to, make lawes and ſtatutes to
fortify this defection, &amp; to compel all their ſubjects to run
to the ſame exceſſe of perjury and wickedneſſe, and execute
theſe lawes upon the faithful &amp; ſtedfaſtly loyal ſubjects, not
in a civil orderly manner, but moſt imperiouſly and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
with meer force &amp; cruelty, and the edge of the ſword
of ſouldiers, leavied of purpoſe for this very end, to crush
and oppreſſe all ſuch as made any conſcience of their vowes
and engagements unto God; and when theſe barbarous
ſouldiers exceed their commiſſion, or oppreſſe, plunder, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rash,
ſpoile, rob and pillage the people, and lay waſte the
land, without law or expreſſe order from King or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yea contraire to the expreſſe letter of the law; and
when the oppreſſed have not ſo much as liberty to ſupplicate
or petition for help or releefe; may privat perſons without
the conduct of a Parliament, ſtand to their owne defence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
unjuſt &amp; illegal oppreſſion and tyranny, and oppoſe
ſuch as, without expreſſe commiſſion, endeavour their utter
ruine and deſtruction, though pretending warrant from the
ſuperiour Magſtrats, and allowed of them; and ſeek a
redreſſe of theſe grievous &amp; intolerable injuries, and liberty
for the free exerciſe of the covenanted reformed religion,
with the extirpation of abjured Prelats, the ſpring and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
of all theſe miſeries already come, and to be feared,
while in the mean time they intend no harme to the ſupream
Magiſtrat's perſon or juſt authority, but ſweare to mantaine
the ſame, in the defence of the true religion, and liberties of
the Kingdome?</q> Or a if you will have it shorter.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whether or not, when King and Parliament and Council
have abjured a covenant, &amp; overturned a reformation, which
they ſolemnely ſwore to defend, in their places &amp; capacities,
and made their ſubjects do the ſame, and now with illegal
force, compel the ſubjects to the like perjury and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105606:26"/>
may theſe privat ſubjects, when there is no hope or
poſſibility otherwiſe of releefe, ſtand to their owne defence,
and withſtand the mercyleſſe cruelty of their bloody Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
acting without their commiſſion, or with their allowance,
yet contrare to expreſſe law; and ſeek releef, and ſecurity for
Religion, lives, lands and liberties, having no intention, to
wronge the King's perſon or juſt government?</q>
               </p>
               <p>That this is the true ſtate of the queſtion, is abundantly
cleare from the particulars forementioned, and I think no
Scottish man, who knew the then ſtate of affaires, and hath
not renunced common ſenſe, and reſolved to beleeve nothing
(though he should both heare it, ſee it, and feele it, and it were
as not oure as the light when the Sun shineth) which is for the
vindication of theſe poor people, will with any face or shew
of reaſon, be able to deny this to be the true ſtate of affaires, &amp;
of the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p>Hence we ſee, how the <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſophiſtically &amp; fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſents the ſtate (which he may well call the <hi>great Knot,</hi> as
being no way looſed and laid open by him, as it ought to have
been) of the queſtion <hi>Pag. 19.</hi> when he ſayes [<q>Whether meer

that theſe lawes are not juſt and right) may private
perſons defend themſelves, againſt the violence of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
thus proceeding, even by violent re-offending; yea,
in order to their owne defence, cut off the Prince of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat
whatſoever, or their Miniſters and officers ſtanding in
their way, or when they are punishing them and afflicting
them according to law?] &amp; againe <hi>Pag. 21.</hi> he ſayes [The
true ſtate of the queſtion at this time is, when the corruption
of theſe who are in power leads them to abuſe their authority,
either on making unjuſt lawes, or punishing according to
theſe, whether meer private ſubjects should with violence
oppoſe all Magiſtrats, under whom they are, from the
higheſt to the loweſt, together vvith the plurality of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

avenging and punishing povver upon all? being
only perſons of privat capacity) and to be ſure he repeats
the ſame over againe <hi>Pag.</hi> 24. and ſayes <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. [That the
vvay vvhich vve clearly ovvne is, That every privat perſon

againe <hi>pag.</hi> 27 he tells us [The queſtion is what duty is owed

               <p>That it may appeare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> (though none vvho underſtandeth
the controverſy, &amp; readeth what he allaigeth, is the ſtate of the

perceive his ſubdolous ſohiſtication) hovv far he hath mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented
the buſineſſe, let theſe fevv particulars be pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>1. It is one thing, to ſay that private perſons, may riſe and
take the ſvvord of defence in their hand, and reſiſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats, upon the ground of ſuppoſed vvrongs, or vvhen they
think in their privat judgments of diſcretion, that the
Magiſtrat injureth them: It is another thing to ſay, This
vvay of defence may be uſed vvhen the injuries are real, and
not ſuppoſed, or judged ſo by their private and erring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or diſcretion only. He cannot have the fore-head to ſay
that we maintaine the former; nor can he vvith any colour
of half a reaſon inferre, that ſuch a maintaine this laſt, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially maintaine the former, as men of underſtanding will
eaſiely perceive, and shall be more fully ſpoken to aftervvard
in due place. yea ſuppoſe that ſuch a conſequence could be
drawne, it were not faire, but utterly diſingenuous, and
un-becomeing a faire diſputant, to bring a conſequent which
he wire-draweth from his adverſaries poſition or aſſertion,
into the ſtate of queſtion, and make the world beleeve,
that his adverſary doth, poſitively, clearly &amp; avowedly aſſert,
what indeed he doth not affirme, nay nor granteth to follow
from what he holdeth.</p>
               <p>2. It is one thing, to ſpeak of reſiſtence made to lawes ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoſly
made, and yet but tending to the hurt of ſome private
perſons in ſmaller matters: it is a far other thing, to ſpeak of
reſiſtance made to lawes, whereby the eſtablished religion, and
the fundamentall rights, and baſis of the conſtitution of the
realme is overturned; and ſo not only only mens goods, or ſmaller
matters, but their liberties, religion, conſciences, lives,
and every thing that is dear unto them, is in inevitable hazard: it
were an impudent calumny to ſay that we maintaine the
former.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:105606:28"/>
3. It is one thing, to ſay that any private perſon alone, and
ſeverally, may reſiſt, and repel unjuſt violence offered by the
Magiſtrats of the land: and another thing, to ſay, that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
company, joyning together, upon juſt grounds, may
endeavour their owne faifty. Though the lawes of our land
will ſuffer a privat ſubject to hinder any, in the Kings name, to
poſſeſſe themſelves of his heritage, or of any thing he poſſeſſeth,
till the queſtion be diſcuſſed by the civil judges; yet we ſtate
not our diſput concerning what a private ſingle perſon may do,
in caſe of oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>4. It is one thing, to ſpeak of unjuſt lawes in the general:
and another thing, to ſpeak of unjuſt lawes made by Magiſtrats,
preingadged by ſolemne vowes and Covenants never to make
ſuch lawes, and who have given the people all the ſecurity
imaginable, that they should never be troubled with ſuch ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quous
lawes: This laſt is our caſe.</p>
               <p>5. It is one thing, to ſpeak of lawes (though iniquous and
grievous, yet) executed legally, civily, by way of formal
legal procedure. But it is another thing, to ſpeak of lawes,
in themſelves grievous and iniquous, yet executed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formal,
illegal, arbitrary, tumultuous, cruel and bloody way,
by armed, mercyleſſe and bloody ſouldiers, which looketh
rather like the execution of a bloody act, for maſſacreing, then
of a law made for the good of the Commonwealth. This laſt
toucheth our caſe, as was shovved.</p>
               <p>6. It is one thing, to ſpeak of reſiſting and offering violence
to the very perſon of the Magiſtrate: and another thing, to
ſpeak of reſiſting his bloody Emiſſaries.</p>
               <p>7. So, it is one thing, to ſpeak of reſiſting his bloody Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries cloathed with a commiſſion to exact the penalty impoſed
by law: But it is a diſtinct thing, to ſpeak of reſiſting his
bloody Emiſſaries, exorbitantly exacting what they pleaſe,
without any regaird had to the ſtanding unrepeled law, though
ſufficiently grevious.</p>
               <p>8. It is one thing, to ſpeak of vvhat privat perſons may, or
ought to do when injured &amp; oppreſſed, &amp; there is ſome door
open to get themſelves eaſed of theſe oppreſſions, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineing,
or appealing to the ſuperior Magiſtrats, or by ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105606:28"/>
petition and ſupplications. But it is a far other thing to
ſpeak of what a People may do, when all door of hope is cloſed,
and when ſimple ſupplicating would make them lyable to the
crime of <hi>leſe Majeſty,</hi> which was their caſe.</p>
               <p>9. It is one thing, to ſpeak of what a company of private
perſons may do, in their owne particular caſe, without the
concurrence of the reſt of the community, who are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in their caſe, nor particularly engaged to help and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
with them, in that particular: and another thing to ſpeak
of what privat perſons, though the minor part of a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
may do, in a caſe which concerneth not themſelves
alone, but is common to all; though it ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be, they ſuffer
moſt of the heat of perſecution, upon the account of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cauſe, and in a caſe, wherein all the whole community is
bound and obliged to other, to ſtand to, and maintaine
one another, in the defence of that common cauſe, and
that by ſolemne bonds, vowes and Covenants. Now this
was their caſe.</p>
               <p>10. It is one thing, to ſay that the minor pairt of a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
may riſe in armes, againſt all the Magiſtrats, and ſeek to
exauctorate them, and overturne their power; and againſt all
the reſt of the body, and preſſe them to be of their minde:
and another thing, to ſay they may take armes in their owne ſelf
defence, when tyrannically oppreſſed for adhering to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and cauſe, which the whole body of the land was engadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to maintaine, with lives and fortunes, no leſſe then they,
without any intention to wronge the Magiſtrat's Juſt power
and authority, or to do the leaſt injury to any of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
who would not carry in a hoſtile manner towards
them: Now ſuch was the caſe and carriage of that poor
people.</p>
               <p>11. It is one thing, to ſay that private perſons when injured
by unjuſt lawes, and when able to reſiſt and oppoſe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
may never ſubmite unto undue penaltyes, (which he
ſalſly fathereth on <hi>Naphtaly.</hi>) But it is a far other thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſay
that in ſome caſes <hi>hic &amp; nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>c</hi> privat perſons may reſiſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
and illegal force of Magiſtrats, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is falſe to ſay
that in no caſe imaginable private perſons may reſiſt unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb facs="tcp:105606:29"/>
offered to them by Magiſtrats. Or, which is all one,
that in every caſe whatſomever, it is the duty of privat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
to ſubmit unto the moſt iniquous, illegal, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
impoſitions, penaltyes, and exactions; or unto ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
and unjuſt lawes. Now this is the true ſtate of the
queſtion <hi>in theſi,</hi> and if this be granted, we ſeek no more, as to
that, being perſuaded the <hi>hypotheſis</hi> will follow clearly from the <hi>theſis,</hi> and hing on it, without many knots of arguments to
faſten it.</p>
               <p>12. It is one thing, to ſay that private perſons may call their
ſuperiour Magiſtrats, when making defection, to an account,
judicially proceſſe them, and formally give out ſentence ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainſt
them, vvhich he injuriouſly allaigeth upon <hi>Naphtaly,</hi> as
any, vvho vvill impartially conſult the places by him cited,
vvill finde. But it is a far other thing, to ſay that private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in ſome caſes in way of defence and maintenance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion, may ſtand to its vindication: and this is all
the vindicative povver vvhich <hi>Naphtali, Pag.</hi> 18, 19. (the
places vvhich he citeth) ſpeaketh of, as incumbent to private
perſons.</p>
               <p>From theſe things it is apparent to any of an ordinary
reach, in thoſe matters, hovv far that vvhich he maketh the
knot of the queſtion, is from the true, plaine, full and reall ſtate
of the buſineſſe novv controverted, vvhich vve have laid
dovvne. And vvhat unfaire dealing vve way expect, thorovv
the reſt of his pamphlet, any may judge by what we here finde,
in the very ſtateing of the controverſy. But he vvill ſay, that the
Author of <hi>Naphtali</hi> (vvhom he ignorantly, tearmeth the <hi>libeller,</hi>
but in truth, the honeſt vindicator of the innocency of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
people of God) hath ſo ſtated it, in his book. It is
true, this <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſayeth ſo <hi>Pag.</hi> 21. But vvhy did not he direct
his reader unto the page vvhere ſuch a ſtate of the queſtion vvas
to be found? I appeale to any vvho ever read that book, to
judge, vvhether this man ſpeaks truth or not. Ay but you
vvil ſay, He hath cited <hi>Pag.</hi> 13, &amp; 14. <hi>Naphtalies</hi> very vvords,
and hath cited the pages where theſe are to be found, out of
which words, the State of the controverſy as by him propoſed,
may be drawne. I <hi>Anſwer</hi> It is one thing to draw concluſions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105606:29"/>
or conſequences from the words of an adverſary while he
is proſecuting his arguments, and out of theſe raiſe a ſtate of
a controverſy; and another thing, to ſay that his adverſary
doth ſo ſtate the controverſy, while as he ſpeaks no ſuch
thing: now both theſe are ſoloeciſmes, the one in morality,
the other in way of diſputing: and of both he is guilty, firſt
it is an un truth, to ſay that <hi>Naphtali</hi> doth ſo ſtate the queſtion
as he allaigeth he doth; and it is no better, to ſay that <hi>Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali</hi>
doth ſo ſtate the queſtion becauſe here and there in his
book, he hath ſome expreſſions that ſeem to look there away:
Againe, it is an abſurd way of diſputing, and intolerable, to
draw the ſtate of a queſtion out of a mans expreſſions here
&amp; there uttered in the proſecution of his arguments; Whereas
the ſtate of the controverſy is that which all his arguments
prove &amp; conclude. But what if al theſe expreſſions which he
hath raked together out of <hi>Naphtaly,</hi> will not bottome his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, or the ſtate of the queſtion as he propoſeth it? ſure
every one muſt take him for a meer wrangler, &amp; animpudent
<hi>ignoramus</hi> in the matter of handleing a controverſy, if it be ſo.
And whether it be ſo or otherwayes let us now try. The
words he citeth firſt, are out of <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. <hi>viz.</hi> theſe (which I
shall not curtaile as he doth, but ſet downe fully,) <hi>And it
will alſo appear that the neceſſity of convocations and combinations
(though not only without, but even againſt authority, yet being in
order to ſuch neceſſary and juſt ends) did ſufficiently warrand them
before God and all men, from the breach of any law or act then ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt the ſame, wherewith they might have been charged.]</hi>
But what can he hence inferre? Will he inferre
that the Author of <hi>Naphtaly,</hi> either ſayeth or thinketh.
That any part of the people, (though no Magiſtrate be
amongſt them) may take armes againſt all Magiſtrats, and
violently reſiſt them, when they think their lawes either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
or the punishment executed unjuſt, (as he ſayeth he
doth. <hi>Ibid. Pag. 13.)</hi> By what <hi>medium</hi> will he couple the
antecedent and conſequent together? May not a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow
that any part of the people, though they had all the
Magiſtrats with them, except the Supreame, may take up
armes againſt the Supreame, and violently reſiſt him, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105606:30"/>
they think that the lawes are unjuſt, or the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
executed unjuſt (as I verily think the Author of <hi>Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
will) and yet ſay, That when ſtrong and inevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
urgeth, in order to neceſſary and juſt ends, people
may have their owne convocations, even againſt authority,
and <hi>de jure</hi> be guilty of the breach of no ſtanding law againſt
the ſame, ſeing all know that <hi>ſalus populi est ſupreme lex,</hi> and
that no law or act, vvhen the ſtrik obſervation thereof, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the detriment of the Republick, (for the good of
VVhich, all lavves are made,) is of force. The next paſſage
he citeth is out of <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. vvere <hi>Naphtaly</hi> hath theſe vvords:
[<hi>That the right and privilege of ſelf-defence, is not only founded in,
but is the very firſt inſtinct of pure nature, and ſpring of all motion
and action.</hi> 2. <hi>That it was competent to, and exerciſed by, every
individual, before that either ſociety or government were known.</hi>
3. <hi>That it was ſo far from being ſurrendred and ſupperſſed by the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theſe, that it was and is the great end, and motive, for
which all voluntary ſocietyes and policyes were introduced, and are
continued.</hi> 4. <hi>That it is a principal (and not</hi> the principal <hi>as he
miſciteth it) rule of righteouſneſſe, whereunto that great command
of love to our neighbour, by the law of God, and by the Lord himſelf,
is reſolved, and whereby it is interpreted.</hi>] And then addeth,
[<hi>So it doth infallibly follow, that the ſame right and privilege, is yet
competent to all men whether ſeparatly or joyntly, and needeth no other
pre-requiſite, but that of intolerable injury (which for a man to ſuffer
under pretence of the good of the Commonwealth, would be, for the
deluſion of an empty name, only for the luſt of other, really to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
himſelf of his whole share &amp; interest therein) and is completed
for excerciſe by ſuch a probable capacity, as may encourage the aſſerters
thereof, to undertake it.</hi>] Thus I have ſet down his words,
truely and wholly, and I would faine know what is there
here, that will ground the foreſaid <hi>theſis?</hi> Muſt a man that
ſayeth thus, neceſſarily ſay, That it is lawful for privat ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to take armes againſt their Magiſtrats (when they are
in a probable capacity to carry thorow their matters,) and
the major part of the people, when they think the lawes are
unjuſt, or the punishments executed are unjuſt? Let him
the next time, I pray, prove this conſequenc. For I, and
many moe, do and will deny it. His next paſſage is out of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105606:30"/>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. the words are theſe, [<hi>The propelling by force of ſuch
injuries</hi> (that is, to be violented in the matters of Religon)
<hi>was the juſteſt cauſe and quarrel, that men in their primeve liberty,
could be ingaged in.</hi>] which ſurely is a very innocent and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleſſe
aſſertion, and ſuch as he, nor no rational man,
who knoweth to preferre the intereſt of the ſoul, unto the
intereſt of the flesh, can contradict; and from whence, no
man that knoweth what the exerciſe of reaſon is, can inferre
his forecited <hi>theſis.</hi> The next paſſage he miſerably curtaileth
out of <hi>Pag.</hi> 16 17. but though vve should take it as he hath
ſet it dovvne) excepting that <hi>parentheſis</hi> vvhich he hath ſoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, in the ſame character, to deceive the ſample Reader,
vvhat could he inferre from it? When once ſayeth [<hi>That
combinations for aſsiſtance, in the ſame common cauſe of juſt and
neceſſary defence, whereunto the force of extreame neceſſity, through
the perverſion of that mean of government, appointed for their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
doth ultimatly reduce them, are warranted by the principle
of humanity, &amp;c. and Gods glory, &amp;c. and by this, that whole
Cityes Kingdomes and Empires, for the violation of this duty, in
not releeving the innocents from unjuſt tyranny, even of lawful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
have been overtaken therefore by fearful judgments, to their
utter ruine and ſubverſion.</hi>] Muſt he needs be thought to ſay
and aſſert, That privat ſubjects may combine together and
make inſurrection againſt the lawful Magiſtrat, when they,
in their private judgment of diſcretion, think the ends of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
are perverted? What sharpe ſighted man can be
able to ſee where theſe two shall meet? He tells us next that
<hi>Pag.</hi> 18, 19. it is ſaid [<hi>That not only power of ſelf-defence, but
vindicative and reforming power is in any part of the people, against
the Whole, &amp; againſt all Magiſirates; and if they uſe it not, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cometh on (ſuppoſeing their capacity probable to beare them
forth,) and they shall be punished for there connivance, &amp; not act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in way of vindication of crimes, and reforming abuſes.</hi>] But
who shall read the place cited, will be forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a very great injury done to <hi>Naphtaly,</hi> &amp; that his words
are miſerably repreſented; and yet he cannot draw out of
them, even as he hath minced the, and thrawne them ſo
that they look with another face, then their owne, That,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105606:31"/>
                  <hi>Napbtaly</hi> aſſerteth, That private perſons may, when they
think or imagine, in their privat judgment, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats
and the reſt of the land are in a defection, ariſe in armes
againſt them, vindicate Religion, judge and condemne
ſuch as are guilty; and ſo uſe imperat acts of reformation by
vindication. Sure theſe words in <hi>Naphtaly, [of neceſſity
both from the principles deduced, and from the moſt viſible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God agreable thereto, there muſt be a ſuperiour and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
obligation, to that of ſubmiſſion, incumbent upon all,
both joyntly &amp; ſeparatly, for the maintainance, vindication,
and reformation of religion, in order to the promoting of theſe great ends
of the publik profeſſion of truth, and true worshipe, which the Lord
doth indiſpenſably require</hi>] to ſober, judicious, intelligent,
and impaitial readers, will have a far other import. So,
what can he inferre from that which <hi>Naphtali ſaid Pag. 28.
viz. [That none pleadeth for abſolute ſubmiſſion in the people, and
exemption in the prince, but ſuch as have proſtrated their conſciences
to the Princes arbitrament, in a blinde and abſolute obedience</hi>] and
that [<hi>ſeing ſubjection is principally enjoyned, for, and in order to
obedience, what ſoever reaſon or authority can be adduced to perſwad
an obſolute and indiſperſible ſubjection, will far more rationally and
plauſibly inferre an illimited and abſolute obedience</hi>] Can he, with
any colour of ſenſe or reaſon, inferre that he maintaineth that
<hi>paſſive ſubjection to unjust lawes and punishments, where there is
power to make active violent reſiſtence, is a greater ſin then active
obedience to unlawful commands of Magiſtrats?</hi> Is this a faire
way of diſputing, to ſay that one maketh that the ſtate of the
queſtion, which he draweth from the assertion of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
<hi>Naphtaly</hi> allaigeth that abſolute ſubjection is as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to reaſon, as abſolute obedience; doth he therefore
make this the ſtate of the queſtion, (or give ground for it,)
That abſolute ſubjection is more ſinful then abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?
Againe, what can he draw out of theſe words of <hi>Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly
Pag. 157. [Secondly it is anſwered That riſeing up against au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
itſelf, the ordinance of God, and diſobeying the powers therewith
veſied, ſtanding and acting in their right line of ſubordination,
is indeed rebellion, and as the ſin of witchcraft; but to reſist and riſe
up againſt perſons abuſeing ſacred authority, and rebelling against

it no rebellion, for privat ſubjects, to diſobey Powers act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a right ſubordination, when they in their judgements
of diſcretion, judge that they deviat from that line of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination?
Sure he muſt have ſome needle head that can
ſowe theſe two together.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the particulars whereupon this <hi>Surveyer</hi> thinketh
to bottome his falſely-ſtated queſtion, and by this we may

he ſayeth immediatly thereafter <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. [But what needs
inſiſting on his juſtifying of any number of private perſons
riſeing up and reſiſting the whole Magiſtrates, &amp; Body of
the people, when ever they think they have cauſe? Seing
this is the maine ſcope of his book, and more too, even to
ſtate them in a punitive power of all who are againſt them,
and a power to pull downe all authorities, that are in their
way.] Alas! poor ſoul, ſuch impudent untruthes, will
not much ſtrengthen his cauſe, in the judgment of ſuch as
are judicious, and many will think that ſuch way of dealing
declares him to be unworthy of his wages: for, may not all
who read that book, ſee a cleare other ſcope there intended
then what he here fancyeth; and know that from no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in all that book, can ſuch concluſions be drawne,
as he here ſayeth is the maine ſcope of it. O! but he muſt
be audacious and affronted, to ſay that the author of <hi>Naphtaly
[not only makes a proclamation to all meer private perſones (not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Nobles and Magiſtrats amongst them) to make inſurrections
againſt all Magiſtrats from the highest to the loweſt, and againſt the
plurality of the people (if they think themſelves in probable capacity,)
and not only ſo, but giveth to them a liberty to pull all Magiſtrates
out of their ſeats, to inſtal themſelves, and to punish Magiſtrats,
who (as he ſayes) have forfauted their right by the abuſe thereof</hi>]
as he doth <hi>Pag</hi> 21. What wil not ſuch shameleſſe boldneſſe
adventure to averre, with the greateſt confidence? but
ſuch as are wife will not beleeve every thing, that ſuch as
have made shipwrak of faith and of a good conſcience, and

becauſe this ſeemeth to be an age, wherein the ſpirits of many

and whatever may be ſaid of warding off, and defenſively puting back,

notoure and compleat tyranny, againſt all appearance of law,
manifeſily tending to the deſtruction of the body of a people, or gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater

of, and giving a whole Kingdome to forraigners, or ſtrangers,
or ſome ſuch like; whatever I ſay in ſuch horried caſes (which for most
part cannot befal a prince, in his natural and right wits, (a caſe
wherein proviſion may be made, that he hurt not himſelf, nor
his dominions) may be done, comes not at all within the compaſſe
of our queſtion; although most diſingenuouſly, the diſcontented and
ſeditious, do ſtrive on all occaſions, to aggravate matters ſo, that
the caſe concerning them, may ſeem co-incident with theſe, or the like,
that ſo they may juſtify their violence against the powers.</hi>]</p>
               <p>But howbeit this <hi>Surveyer</hi> think that theſe conceſſions
make little for our advantage; yet to underſtanding perſons,
it will be cleare in general.</p>
               <p>1. That He, and the reſt of the Royal ſociety of Court
paraſites and ſlatterers, ſpeak moſt inconſequentially unto
themſelves; They cry up in their writtings an abſolute, and
indiſpenſible ſubjection, unto the Supreame Magiſtrate,
due by all his ſubjects; and yet when they are ſore pinched,
they muſt clap their wings cloſer, And drawe in their
faire ſailes, &amp; grant that in ſuch &amp; ſuch caſes, not only his E
miſſaries &amp; ſuch as have his commiſſion, but Himſelf may be
reſiſted not only by the <hi>Ephort, &amp; Primores Regni,</hi> but by
very private ſubjects. Did we not but juſt now heare our <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer</hi>
crying out againſt <hi>Naphtaly,</hi> for ſaying That what reaſons
could prove an abſolute &amp; indiſpenſible ſubjection, will alſo
prove an aboſolute &amp; unlimited obedience, as being unwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to heare any thing ſpoken againſt an abſolute &amp; vaſt, ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and yet behold here, he is as willing as the reſt, to
clip the wings of this inviolable ſoveraignity, &amp; ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us a limited &amp; retrenched ſubjection due to the Supreame
Magiſtrate, even by private perſons.</p>
               <p>2. That by theſe conceſſions, He and the reſt cut the
ſinewes of their owne arguments, and cauſe them to halt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105606:33"/>
ere they aſſault us, and teach us away of rejecting or anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eing
them; For, when they produce their arguments,
vvhether from reaſon, or authorities, they cannot but make
them conclude univerſally, and then they are neceſſitated
themſelves to anſvvere theſe univerſal arguments, or
otherwiſe retract their conceſſions; and whatever vvay
they think to evade vvith their conceſſions, and ſuppoſed
caſes, vve vvill finde roome enough to eſcape vvith our caſe;
as for exemple, vvhen this <hi>Surveyer</hi> urgeth that ſubjection
ſpokento, <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> He muſt either grant, that it muſt be
reſtricted to ſuch and ſuch caſes, or elſe plead for an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,
abſolute, unlimited and indiſpenſible ſubjection, and
ſo retract his conceſſions; and if he take the liberty to uſe
his reſtrictions, and ſo interpret the place, as that it shall
not reach his caſes excepted, he muſt grant us the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
to ſay that our caſe is not there meaned, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>3. By theſe conceſſions vve have this advantage, that the
diſtinction vvhich is made, in this queſtion of reſiſtence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt
the Magiſtrate as ſuch, and the perſon or man, vvho
is the Magiſtrate, is not ſo abſurd and ridiculous, as the
Royaliſts give it out to be; for here vve finde them forced
to uſe the ſame, ſo that if it be a defileing diſtinction they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be clean, more then vve: and vve ſee that reſiſtence may
be uſed againſt the perſon of, or the man vvho is, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
vvithout the leaſt contempt, or vvrong done unto the
holy Ordinance of God, othervviſe they muſt of neceſſity
ſay, that in all the forementioned caſes, they very Ordinance
of God is reſiſted; and hovv then they shall reconcile that,
vvith <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> I ſee not.</p>
               <p>4. We ſee alſo, That the Prerogative Royal, vvhich they
ſcrevv up unto a tranſcendent abſoluteneſſe and ſupremacy
above lavv, is but a meer <hi>chimaera,</hi> vvhich themselves muſt
abhominate as a loathſome brat.</p>
               <p>5. We ſee that <hi>ſalus populs eſt ſuprema lex,</hi> the peoples
ſaifty is ſuch a royal thing, that the King himſelf, and all
his prerogatives, yea and municipal lawes too, muſt vaile
the cap unto it themſelves being judges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:105606:34"/>
6. We ſee alſo, that they muſt grant <hi>a court of neceſſity,</hi>
in which private perſones, may judge the Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat,
in order to their reſiſting of him; for, I hope, they
will grant, that in theſe caſes, the people act with judgment,
and as rational men; and if ſo, they muſt ſay, that the people
muſt firſt judge and condemne the Supream Magiſtrate, as
erring, and doing amiſſe, before they can lawfully reſiſt him.</p>
               <p>7. We have this advantage, That the Arguments by
which, They can prove it lawful to reſiſt the Magiſtrate,
in the caſes granted by them, will not be a little ſteadable
to us, in our caſe; and for ſhame they will not condemne
their owne arguments, becauſe in our mouthes.</p>
               <p>8. It will be eaſily granted by all, that our caſe, vvhich
vve have truely ſtated, vvill come nearer the caſes, vvhich
adverſaries do except, then the caſe vvhich he hath ſett
dovvne; and ſo, Hovvever he think the caſes mentioned
by him, do not come vvithin the compaſſe of the queſtion
vvhich he hath ſet dovvne; yet underſtanding perſones
vvil ſee, they are not altogether vvithout the compaſſe of
that vvhich is the true queſtion, and true ſtate of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy;
and that he hath no juſt cauſe to fay, that vve
(hovvever he account us diſcontented and ſeditious) do moſt
diſingenuoſly ſtrive, on all occaſions, to aggravate matters,
ſo that the caſe concerning us, may ſeem co-incident with
theſe or the like.</p>
               <p>But next, more particularly, Theſe conceſſions are much
for our advantage. For,</p>
               <p>1. If it be lawful for a private perſon to defend his life or
eſtate in a moral or legal vvay, by petition, or plea in court,
againſt the Souveraigne, (yea and by actual force, if the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
or any in his name, shal come to poind, or take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
illegally, as our lavves vvill allovv,) vvhy shall it
be unlavvfull, for a conſiderable part of the land, to defend
their Lives, and Eſtates, their Libertyes and Religion, by
forcible reſiſtence, made unto the Magiſtrat's Emiſſaries,
cruel, bloody ſouldiers, vvhen that moral reſiſtence by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
(vvhich yet no rational man can account reſiſtence,
it being rather an act of ſubjection) is, contrare to all lavv
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105606:34"/>
and equity, denyed; and alſo, the legal reſiſtance, by plea
in court, is not admitted? Doth the municipal lavv of the
land permit the one reſiſtence, aud vvill not the lavv of
nature and nations (vvhich no municipal lavv can infringe)
be a ſufficient vvarandice for the other, in caſe of extream
neceſſity? If it be ſaid, The Soveraigne hath law and right
upon his ſide, in this caſe, which he hath not in the other,
till the law diſcuſſe it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Law and Right which he
hath on his fide in this caſe, is but meerly pretended, as in
the other caſe; and is <hi>lis ſub judice</hi> Neither is he, to be
both judge and party in this caſe, more then in the other:
againe, if it be ſaid that in this caſe, He acteth as a Soveraigne,
executeing the lawes, but in the other caſe, he acteth only, as
a private perſon. It is anſwered. 1. That even in the other caſe
He may pretend to be acting as a Soveraigne, following &amp;
executeing the lawes, as well as in this. 2. The Soveraigne as
Soveraigne cannot oppreſſe nor do wrong, &amp; therefore even
in this caſe, when he doth manifeſt injury unto the ſubjects,
contrare to his place, vow and promiſe, he acteth but as a
private perſon, and not as Soveraigne.</p>
               <p>2. If it be lawful for private perſon to warde off, and
defenſively put back perſonal injurious aſſaults, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
and immediat peril of life, without any colour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
of reaſon, of law, or judicial proceeding. Why
shal it not alſo be lawful for private perſons to ward-off,
and defenſively put back, the injurious aſſaults of Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
to the manifeſt peril of Life, Libertyes, States, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely-hoods,
Conſciences and Religion, without any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
or real colour of deſerving, of reaſon of law, of God,
or nations, or judicial proceeding? Shal it be lawful for
one private perſon, in the defence of his owne life, to warde
off ſuch illegal, extrajudicial and irrational aſſaults of the
Soveraigne himſelf; and shall it be unlawful for a body of a
land, or a conſiderable part thereof, in the defence of their
lively-hoods, and ſo of their owne lives, and of the lives of
their poſterity, of their Conſciences, of their Libertyes and
Religion, all ſecured unto them by all bonds, vowes, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
Statutes and Actes imaginable, to warde off the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105606:35"/>
furious, illegal, extrajudicial and mad aſſaults of
the Soveraign's bloody Emiſſaries? Sure rational men vvill
ſee that vvhatever reaſon vvil evince the lavv fulneſſe of the
reſiſtence in the former case, the ſame vvill more ſtrongly
and plauſibly, conclude the lavvfulneſſe of reſiſtence in this
caſe.</p>
               <p>3. If it be lavvfull for a private vvoman to defend her
chaſtity, dearer to her then life, by violent reſiſting the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes
attempts, leſt by non-reſiſtance, she should be
guilty (and oh if all the vvomen of the nation vvere of this
temper.) Shall it not alſo be lavvful for private perſons to
defend their Lives, Liberties, Conſciences and Religion,
dearer to them then their Lives; yea and defend their chaſtity
too, by violent reſiſting of the furious attempts of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes
bloody Emiſſaries, ſent of purpoſe to conſtraine
and compel them to perjury, vvhen their non-reſiſtence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their povver and opportunity, could not but be
interpreted a voluntary and baſe quiteing of the cauſe and
truth, vvhich they vvere bound before God, to maintaine
vvith their lives and fortunes?</p>
               <p>4. If it be lavvfull to reſiſt habited, notour and compleat
tyranny, againſt all appearance of lavv, manifeſtly tending
to the deſtruction of a body of a people, or a greater part
thereof, by hoſtile furious actions: Shall it be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavvſul
to reſiſt notour tyranny, yea compleat and habited
(though not as to re-iterated acts, yet as to the ground laid
dovvne of a moſt compleat and habited tyranny) againſt all
appearance of divine lavv, or juſt and right humane lavves,
vvhich should be conſonant thereunto, tending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Covenanted-libertyes, privileges and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
of the vvhole body of the people; and alſo unto the
actual deſtruction of the libertyes, ſtates, lives and lively
hoods of a great part thereof, by hoſtile furious actions?</p>
               <p>5. If reſiſtence be lavvful in the caſe of violent attempts,
or deſtruction of all known legall libertyes, and the beeing
of religion according to lavv: Shall reſiſtence in our caſe
be unlavvſul, vvhen all the true libertyes of the ſubjects,
once eſtablished by lavves, re inforced by vovves, Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105606:35"/>
ſolemne engadgments, and all bonds imaginable; and
the very being of our Religion, as reformed in doctrine,
vvorshipe, diſcipline and government, ratified, approved,
eſtablished, and confirmed by lavves, oathes, Covenants,
vovves and promiſes, vvhich lavves ſo re inforced vvith
oathes, proteſtations, atteſtations, declarations, ſolemne
vovves and Covenants, are, by all right divine and humane,
irrepelable, being not only in themſelves good and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but alſo becoming hereby ſacred vovves to God, vvhich
muſt be payed, &amp; being alſo fundamentall tearmes of the
conſtitution of the reformed Republick?</p>
               <p>6. If in the caſe of Vendition, Alienation of, and giving
the Kingdome to ſtrangers, violent reſiſtence be allovved;
shall it not alſo be allovved in our caſe, vvhen a land that
vvas ſolemnely devoted, conſecrated, and given avvay to
God by ſolemne vovves and Covenants, and the ſame ovvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
approved, ratified and confirmed by publick acts,
edicts, proclamations, declarations, lavves and ſtatutes of
plenary, and (even as to all formalities) compleat Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
made up of all the Eſtates of the Realme, and
the King also, is novv treacherousſly, and iniquoſly, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to depart from their former principles, to abjure their
former vovves and Covenants, to change their God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
his vvork; and by moſt abhominable, and ever to
be-abhorred acts and ſtatutes, ſold and alienated unto a
popish prelatical and malignant faction and deſigne, under
vvhich, the faithful and true ſeekers of God's face, have,
and can expect, leſſe liberty for their conſciences, then if the
whole Kingdome vvere delivered up into the hands of the
great Turk.</p>
               <p>Thus vvee ſee theſe conceſſions help our cauſe, &amp; vveaken
the adverſaryes not alittle: let us novv proceed to ſpeak to
another particular vvhich vvill help us alſo.</p>
               <p>2. The authors of <hi>Lex Rax,</hi> and of the <hi>Apologetical Relation</hi>
have ſufficiently proved, that the late vvarre carryed on by
the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the King, vvas lavvful,
both in poynt of lavv and conſcience; And if that vvas lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
(as it vvas, and shall be found to be, vvhen he and all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105606:36"/>
his complices have done their utmoſt vvith all their lying
cavills, falſe calumnies, reproaches, and vvhat not, that
Hell can hatch, to diſprove &amp; condemne the ſame;) a vvarre
raiſed by the ſubjects in their owne ſin-leſſe ſelf defence,
without the conduct of their repreſentative, cannot in every
caſe be condemned; particularly not in our caſe now.</p>
               <p>The antecedent, I ſay, is abundantly proved in the books
mentioned, which this windy man thinks needleſſe to run
out upon (but he might rather ſay, he thinks impoſſible to
anſwere, and beyond his poor ſtrength to graple vvith) as
he ſayeth <hi>Page. 20.</hi> vve muſt then take ſome notice of vvhat,
in that Page (vvhich he thinks ſufficient to oppoſe unto the
many arguments produced by them) he is pleaſed to preſent;
[<hi>what ſenſe</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the people of</hi> Scotland (<hi>when they have
come to liberty) have of theſe armes, their late repreſentative have
declared, and it were to be wished, that the memory of ſuch wayes,
were buryed, that the poſterity might never look upon them as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary;
Their progenitors have ſo deeply drunk of the bitter fruites of
the ſame, the reſult of them having been ſo much ſin, shame and
ſorrow, vastation confuſion and deſtruction to Princes and People.</hi>]
I anſwer, 1. What that liberty is, which the people of
<hi>Scotland</hi> are now come to, who can ſee it, for the perfect ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and bondage they are ſold unto? A freedome he talkes
of, when all our libertyes are ſold, and we given up as bond
men and bond women unto the luſt of a Man, and are denyed
the very liberty, which is the privilege of all free ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
yea and that which is the birthright and native privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of all men, viz. to ſupplicate, petition or to pray: what
liberty can he then meane, unleſſe the liberty (which is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe)
to forſake God and our Covenant, to turne
Apoſtats from his truth and our profeſſion, to ſweare &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare,
to drink, debauch, whore, commit ſodomy, &amp; all
ſort of wickedneſſe, without curb or controll? Is this the
liberty he underſtandeth? Sure, all true chriſtians and ſuch
as feare the Lord account that develish ſlavery and bondage.
2. We know what this late Repreſentatives have done, but
whether therein they have acted the part of Repreſentatives,
and given the true ſenſe of the people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> will (it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105606:36"/>
may be) be conſidered, when He and I both are rotten. Sure
they never had any expreſſe, yea nor tacite commiſſion from
the people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to give up all their necks to the
ſtroke the axe, as treatours and rebels, for doing nothing
but ſtanding to their owne defence, againſt manifeſt tyrran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and oppreſſion of both ſoul and body; and to condemne
them and their worthy progenitors who valiently ſtood for
the truth, and the libertyes of Church and State, to the
loſſe of their lives and fortunes; and to proclame and declare
themſelves guilty before God and Men, of all the blood that
was shed in that warre, though moſt lawful and laudable.
3. We are perſuaded, let him with what he will, the
memory of theſe memorable wayes shall never be buried,
but shall ſtand as exemplary monuments to ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
when God shall think it meet to animate them
with the ſpirit of courage, to free the land of tyranny, and of
domineering abjured prelats, withal their taile and traine:
and wiſe men will think that his Repreſentatives have not
taken a courſe fit for burying the memory of theſe wayes;
but rather a way to revive afresh the memory of them, and
to commend them more to the thoughts and hearts of all
who love and pray for the comeing of our Lord's Kingdome.
4. What bitter frutes theſe are, which, he ſayeth, our
progenitours have drunk ſo deeply of, we know not,
They lived and died, ſuch of them as owned, and ſtedfaſtly
adhered to that cauſe and Covenant, in honour and peace;
and their names shall be in perpetual remembrance, when
his, and the names of the reſt of this perjured, Malignant
apoſtate faction shall rot. We needed not have feared that
either ſin, shame, ſorrow, vaſtation, confuſion, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
should have come to Prices or People, if we
had proſecuted the ends of our Covenants, with zeal and
faithfulneſſe according to our manifold vowes, promiſes,
ſolemne oathes and ingagments: But what ever of theſe have
followed, should be, and will be rightly fathered on our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and loſe of zeal: And what ſin and shame, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
&amp; vaſtation, &amp; confuſion, &amp; deſtruction shall now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
both to Princes and People (if they repent not) upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105606:37"/>
this unparallelable defection &amp; Apoſtaſie, whereof now they
are avowedly guilty, none, who is not an utter ſtranger unto
God, his faithful word, and diſpenſations, but may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any extraordinary Spirit of Prophecy, foretell.</p>
               <p>Next he tells us, That theſe diſputes proceed upon a moſt
untrue and malitious miſrepreſentation of matters of fact, &amp;
upon two falſe hypotheſes: Let us heare what are thoſe?
[<hi>As if</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the King had been the firſt invader of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereas it is known, his authority was firſt invaded, his lawes
trodden upon, kis proclamations openly deſpiſed, his caſtles violently
ſeiſed; his armes he took were notinvaſive againſt the Nation, but
defenſive of his owne authority, of his lawes, and the perſones of
orderly walking ſubjects, and for reduceing theſe who ſtrayed from their
duty.</hi>] <hi>Anſw. Quis tulerit Gracchos de ſeditione querentes?</hi>
Who would ſuffer ſuch a manifeſt notorius lyar to ſay, that
others made miſrepreſentations of matters of fact? But,
1. Do not all who then lived, and yet read the publick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and other acts that paſſed then, know that through
the inſtigation of ſome falſe, perfidious, fugitive Prelates,
the King was ſtirred up to make warre on <hi>Scotland,</hi> ere ever
they thought of any ſuch thing? Was not warre concluded
both by ſea and land? Was not free tradeing taken away?
Were not the Scottish Nobility at court made to abjure the
National Covenant, and the General Aſſembly at <hi>Glasgow?</hi>
was there not a declaration emitted Feb. 27. &amp; publickly read
in all the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> wherein the faithful ſubjects
and Covenanters in <hi>Scotland</hi> were tearmed Rebels? Were
not <hi>Berwik</hi> and <hi>Carlile</hi> frontier cities ſtrongly fortifyed and
garriſoned? Was not the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Huntly</hi> made Governour
of the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had ſome foure or five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men in armes, for the King? Was not <hi>Aberdeen</hi> forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
it ſelf, to take in the King's navy of shipes, when it
should come? Was not the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Douglas, &amp; Lord
Haris</hi> ready to riſe with the Papiſts in the South of <hi>Scotland?</hi>
Was not the <hi>Deputy</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> prepareing men to land them in
the Weſt of <hi>Scotland?</hi> Was not the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Arundale</hi> made
the Kings General? and was not the King to have his ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz
at <hi>York</hi> in <hi>Aprile,</hi> and all the English Nobility com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105606:37"/>
to attend him there by a letter written <hi>Ian. 26.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the faithful People of <hi>Scotland</hi> had any army in readineſſe?
What impudency is this then to ſay, the King was not the
firſt invader of the Nation? And as for the ſecond expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Anno Dom. 1640.</hi> managed, and carryed on, by the
Parliament, it was abundantly verified by their publick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that it was purely defenſive. And it is notour, that
before the leavy was made, and appointed, the King had
violated the conditions made; had cauſed burne by the hand
of the Hangman a paper containeing explications of ſome
tearmes uſed by him in the treaty of Peace; had denyed
acceſſe to their commiſſioners, &amp; afterward, when he had
ſignified his willingneſſe to heare ſuch as they should ſend,
ſuch as were ſent were committed to priſone, and one of
them, viz. The <hi>Lord Lowdon</hi> ordained ſecretly to be behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Towr</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> and, in the meane while, warre
was concluded againſt the Realme of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the King's
Council; The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was made <hi>General,</hi> a
Parliament was convocated, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Irland,</hi>
for raiſing of ſubſidies, to the carrying on of this warre;
The Deputy of <hi>Irland</hi> with ſome there, had promiſed much
aſſiſtence. The Prelates of <hi>England</hi> had offered great ſummes
to carry on this <hi>Bellum Epiſcopale,</hi> as they named it; Scottish
shipes were intercepted, their goods taken away, and the
ſeamen caſt into prifſones and miſerably handled; The ſea
ports were cloſed up with frigots; The caſtle of <hi>Edinbrugh</hi>
oppreſſed the City with their shot, and killed many both
young and old. Were all theſe things no beginnings of a
warre, nor no acts of hoſtility? How can he, or any elſe
then, ſay that the King was not the firſt aggreſſor, or that
Scotlands warre was not purely defenſive? 2. As to theſe
things wherein he would make his reader beleeve, that the
Honeſt people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were the firſt invaders, what a
malitious fool doth he manifeſt himſelf to be; for 1. How
or what way was his authority invaded? was it, becauſe
they would not receive a maſſe book in English, obtruded
upon them by his ſole authority without the concurrence of
Church or State? 2. What lawes were troden upon? We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105606:38"/>
no lawes, but acts and ſtatutes of a lawful Parliament,
made for the glory of God, and the good of the land: and
what ſuch were trode upon? 3. What way were his procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
deſpiſed? Is it to deſpiſe a King's proclamation,
for free ſubjects to vindicate them ſelves of what is unjuſtly
laid to their charge in this proclamations, by faithful and
humble proteſtations of their innocency? 4. What were
thoſe caſtles ſeiſed upon? Some be like in <hi>Vtopia;</hi> for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this warre was begun Anno 1639. The Covenanters
ſeiſed upon none of the King's caſtles: When they ſavv the
King bore a hoſtile minde againſt them and intended no good,
they watched the caſtle of <hi>Edinbrugh</hi> that more ammunition
and proviſion should not be carryed into it: And this was
all they did, until they were neceſſitated to put themſelves,
into a poſture of defence, &amp; then they ſeiſed upon ſome houſes
here &amp; there, the lawfulneſſe of which, is demonſtrated by <hi>Lex
Rex, &amp; the Apology.</hi> 5. What illegal courts were thoſe which
were ſet up? Sure thoſe <hi>tables,</hi> as they were called, were
no courts aſſumeing to themſelves any judicial determination
in any matter of State civil or Eccleſiaſtical, nor conventions:
for diſturbance of the peace, or uſurpation againſt authority;
but meer meetings (allowed by the light and law of nature)
for conſultation and advice anent the matter and manner of
ſupplications, which they were to preſent to his Majeſty,
and his Council; and of propoſitions to be preſented to the
lawful State and Church-judicatories. 6. Who were thoſe
ſubjects walking according to the lawes, who were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
We know of none, who were troubled at that time,
except the Prelates, the Troublers of our Iſrael, and all the
perſecution they met with, was that the honeſt Covenanters
did give in complaints againſt them, and offered to make
good what they allaiged, upon the higheſt perill, and did
ſupplicate the Council (whereof ſome of them were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers)
that they might not fit there as judges, but ſtand as <hi>Rëi,</hi>
and anſwere for themſelves, and that the General aſſembly
indicted by his Majeſty, after mature deliberation, and full
examination, did excommunicate them, for high and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
crymes, to be ſeen in the regiſters of that Aſſembly.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105606:38"/>
But 2 will theſe things, to judicious perſons, lay the ground
of a lawful warre by the Magiſtrate, againſt his owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?
Are theſe who cannot yeeld obedience unto unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
commands, who humbly proteſt for their owne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
who meet together for drawing up ſupplications,
and ordering matters thereanent, and who give in complaints
againſt the Peſts &amp; Troublers of the land, and exerce Church
cenſures upon the ſcandalous, invaders of the Soveraign's
authority? And when a King upon theſe grounds invadeth
his ſubjects, with an army of armed men, can any man
of common ſenſe think that his war is not an invaſive vvarre?
Hath not Magiſtrats other lavvfull vvayes to defend their
ovvne authority and lavves and orderly ſubjects, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the diſorderly, then fire and ſvvord? Sure, for a King
to cut off his ſubjects, is to diminish and annihilate his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and lavves both: And for a King to vvage vvarre againſt
the Body of a land, to pleaſure <hi>Fourteen</hi> of a fevv of the baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt unvvorthy of all the ſubjects, vvould ſeem
to be the reſult of no grave and ſage Council; nor vvould it
appeare to be much for the Kings honour, to have his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
authority imbarqued vvith a fevv abjects, ſo as if
they did ſinke to the bottome of the ſea, It could not
ſwime.</p>
               <p>The next thing, (and that is the 2 hypotheſis) he allegeth
is. [<hi>That they repreſent him, in their virulent</hi> (he should ſay ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous)
<hi>writeings, as Nerone ipſo Neronior, a great perſecuter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
intending the total ruine and deſtrustion of the proteſtant
profeſſion, and the total ruine and deſtruction, of the whole people
of the land.</hi>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> They repreſente him no othervvayes,
then his owne publicke, owned, and avowed deeds, and
declarations did repreſente him to all the world. What
was his ſecret intentions God knoweth, but his deeds did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that he minded no good to the poor Church and State
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for, to pleaſure a few abjects, that had drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in much Popery, and Arminianiſme, and ſtirred him
up to urge upon our Church 2 Popish publick ſervice, book
of canons, and ordination, Popish ceremonies, and ſuch
Romish trash, he ſought, by fire and ſword to reduce us
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105606:39"/>
to ashes. We shal not now trouble his Urne, by ſpeaking
to what this <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſayeth afterward: This we knovv,
That he died; but vvhether as a glorious Martyr for the
true Religion of God (vvhich yet may admit ſeveral ſenſes,
ſo ambiguous is it, though vve let it paſſe in the beſt) and
lavves and liberties of the people, (as he ſayeth) many doubt.
At length he cloſeth his digreſſion thus. [<hi>If there was any
thing that could not have a favourable interpretation in that unhappy
book that gave theriſe to the troubles, how timely was it retired, and
great ſatisfaction and ſecurity given for religion? If through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
of Miniſters of State, any thing had creeped in, that could
not abide the teſt of law, how willingly was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>treformed? yet all could
not ſiſt begun courſe of violence, till through God's dreadful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
againſt a ſinfull people, his fatal end might be brought on,
not becauſe he had been a Tyrant, but becauſe he had not been ſuch]
Anſw.</hi> That book which was unholy, as well as, unhappy
in giving the riſe to ſuch troubles, had not only ſomethings
in it, that could not bear a favourable interpretation, but
the whole of it, was the extract and quint eſſence of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
maſſe book, book of ritualls, &amp;c. And how ſlowly
it was retired, and ſatisfaction and ſecurity given, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and how ſoon conditions covenanted and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon, were broken, the hiſtory of thoſe times doth
ſufficiently declare; as alſo how unwillingly any thing was
reformed that had creeped in, whether through the default
of Miniſters of State or others, But how can this baſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator
inſinuat that the Kings loyall ſubjects in <hi>Scotland</hi>
had a hand in bringing him to his fatal end, ſeing even the
late Repreſentatives, though they would willingly have raked
hell for it, could not finde a man, in all <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be
charged with that crime. That he came to his fatal end, we
know; but that it was through Gods dreadful indignation
against a ſinful people (if he mean the faithful and honeſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters)
I know none, except baſe ignorant ſycophants,
that will ſay it: That it was not becauſe he had been a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
many will doubt. And when he ſayes, that it was
<hi>becauſe he had not been a Tyrant.</hi> I am ſure, he giveth <hi>non ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

indignation againſt a ſinful people, doth take away a Prince

ſuch Tyrants ſometimes.</p>
               <p>Having thus vindicated the Antecedent from what this
<hi>Surveyer</hi> had to ſay againſt it, we shall now ſpeak a word to
the conſequence of the argument. And 1. The whole Cabal
of the Royaliſts will grant it; for, with them, both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
and People are put into one and the ſame cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,
viz. of meer ſubjects; ſo that if the Antecedent ſtand
good, (as it shall, for all which they have ſaid, or all
which this their new collegue or young raw diſciple, can ſay
to the contrary) the argument is good <hi>ad hominem.</hi> 2. Such
as grant it lawful for a Land having their Repreſentatives with
them, to defend themſelves againſt tyranny; But deny it to
privat ſubjects, in caſe of neceſſity, when they cannot have
the conduct and concurrence of their Repreſentatives, can
adduce no argument againſt this laſt, but ſuch, as will
weaken their aſſertion in the former: As for exemple <hi>Hoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
politic. diſp. 9. theſ. 55.</hi> diſproveth reſiſtence in this laſt
caſe, by theſe arguments. 1. becauſe, Subjects are obliged
to pay to their owne Magiſtrats, the duty of fidelity and
obedience, 2. Becauſe, by this meanes a gap would be
opened to ſeditions and rebellions. 3. Becauſe the ſcripture
commandeth ſubjects to pray for their Magiſtrats. 4. The
ſon may not wronge his father how wicked ſo ever he be.
5. Violence done to the head, though ſickly, tendeth to the
ruine of the whole body. 6. It is better to have a ſickly head
then none. 7. There is greater danger to Caſt off a Tyrant, then
to Tolerate him. 8. A Tyrant cannot be reſiſted but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
will follow to the reſiſters. 9. God punished the
wicked kings of the jewes by ſtrangers. 10. <hi>Jeremias</hi> did
not ſtirre up the jewes againſt <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> but allowed
them to pray. 11. Chriſt commanded to pay tribute unto
the Prince. 12. <hi>Paul</hi> will not have an evil Prince to be curſed
with words. 13. Kings are from God, and ſuch like. But
who ſeeth not, that theſe, if of any force, (as indeed they
are of none, as shall afterward be made appear, in due time)
conclude as much againſt a peoples oppoſeing and reſiſting a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105606:40"/>
Tyrant, even when they have their Repreſentatives with
them, as when they are left alone: and yet this ſame <hi>Hoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
ubi ſupra theſ. 45.</hi> granteth it lawful yea and neceſſary for
the <hi>Ephori</hi> and the Eſtates of a land to reſiſt the Tyrant. 3.
If our <hi>Surveyer</hi> will grant the caſe different now, from what
it was then, when the <hi>primores Regni</hi> were ingadged in the
oppoſition, (as he doth <hi>Pag. 21.</hi>) and grant that when the
<hi>primores Regni</hi> concurre, the oppoſition is lawful (as he muſt
grant, in caſe the Soveraigne become Tyrannnical, and be
the firſt-aggreſſor, becauſe only upon the contrary ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he condemneth the laſt reſiſtence, which was made to
the King by Scotland) He muſt of neceſſity ſeek out other
arguments then what we ſee he hath, to condemne this reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
of Private perſons, in caſe of neceſſity; or otherwayes
contradict himſelf; for, as may eaſily be ſeen, this being
granted, all his arguments shall be eaſily discuſſed. 4. If
he grant the caſe now, to be much different from what it
was then, ſo as then, it was a lawful reſiſtence, but not ſo
now (as he muſt grant, otherwiſe, we cannot ſee what
this is to the poynt, and wherein his <hi>much difference</hi> doth
slye) how can he ſave himſelf a from contradiction; for he
muſt put a diffence betwixt a reſiſtence made by the people
with their <hi>primores,</hi> and a reſiſtence made by the People with
their <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> in Parliament; or elſe ſay, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Nobles of a land do, is the ſame with what a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
doth; and that wherever they are, there is a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the peoples Repreſentatives: Now this he
darre not ſay, left he should be hiſſed at; and therefore he
muſt grant it lawful, for a people to defend themſelves,
when they want the conduct and concurrence of their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives,
acting authoritatively; or elſe retract, what he
hath ſaid,
and planely confeſſe That the caſe to be notice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
now, is not different from what it was then. 5. I hope
no man will ſay that a war carryed on, or a reſiſtence made
againſt the Soveraigne, by the Repreſentatives of a people,
Is <hi>eo ipſo</hi> lawful, unleſſe the ground of the warre, or reſiſtance,
be reall and valide: And if the ground be valid, and good
whereupon a People unjuſtly oppreſſed and tyrannized over
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105606:40"/>
are allowed to defend themſelves, haveing their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
to goe before them, why shall not the ſame ground
ſtand valid and ſufficient, to warrand them to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
when they have not the concurrence of their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives?
I would gladly heare a reaſon, making the
defence in the one caſe lawful, and not in the other, ſeing
the ground remaines the ſame, the ſame neceſſity abideth,
yea, it rather increaſeth when the Repreſentatives, who
should be a ſcreen unto the people, betray their truſt, and
either neglect to vindicate with their authority and conduct,
the innocent oppreſſed people, or turne adverſaries to them,
and oppreſſours of them, themſelves. 6. Since Parliments
are the peoples Repreſentatives, no man will ſay That <hi>de
jure</hi> their power is privative, or deſtructive; but rather cumulative
and helpful; ſo that the peoples Repreſentative
cannot, <hi>de jure,</hi> make them more liable to irremediable
tyranny and oppreſſion, then they were: they being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>exnatur a rei</hi> and <hi>ex inſtitutione, &amp; inſtituentium intentione,</hi>
ordained and appoynted, for the greater faifty, and good
of the people. And therefore, if the Repreſentatives betray
their truſt, the People, in ſo far, are as if they had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives,
and may no leſſe defend themſelves in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
neceſſity, then if the officers of their army, whom
they had choſen and appoynted to defend them, againſt an
invadeing enemy, should revolt to the enemy, they might
lawfully riſe up in their owne defence, and oppſe the
adverſary. 7. The law ſayeth that <hi>deterior conditio domini per
procuratorem fieri non debet L. ignorantis ff. de procuratoriburs.</hi> The
procurator or advocat his knavery, cannot prejudge the
Client or wronge his cauſe. And why then shall the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy
of the peoples Repreſentatives, or their betraying of
their truſt, wronge their cauſe, and prejudge them of
their juſt right? 8. All will grant, That it is as lawful, for an
oppreſſed people to defend themſelves from the injuryes of a
Parliament, as from the injuries of a Soveraigne, if not
more: and if it be lawfull for a people to defende themſelves
againſt the Tyranny of a Parliament (as is more then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proved by all ſuch arguments as have hitherto, by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105606:41"/>
any, been made uſe of, to prove it lawful, to reſiſt a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
oppreſſing and tyrannizing) no man of common
ſenſe, will deny it lawful to a people to defend themſelves
againſt oppreſſion and tyranny, when they but want the
concurrence or countenance of theſe Parliaments. 9. If
any should allaige that this is againſt the law of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Kingdom. We know no ſuch law: beſide,
that though there were any ſuch; yet neceſſity knoweth no
law: and in caſes of neceſſity, ſuch lawes are not to be obſerved,
ſayeth the law <hi>L. ut gradatim §. I. de muner: &amp; honor.</hi>
The lavves of nature are irrevocable and cannot be reſcinded
by municipal lavves: for the lavv tells us that <hi>civilis ratio jur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
natur alia corrumpere non pote ſt L. eas oblig. D. de cap. privat.</hi> Novv
the lavv of nature allovving ſelf defence againſt unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
addeth no ſuch reſtriction, viz. that it be done by the
conduct, and concurrence of the <hi>Primores</hi> or <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
10. The very conceſſions of our adverſaries fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
vvill confirme this conſequence, for in theſe caſes,
they vvill grant the ſame liberty to a People vvithout, as to
a People vvith their Repreſentatives, to defend themſelves:
for the vveight and ground is not laid upon the manner, or
vvay of conduct, or managing of the reſiſtence and defence;
but upon the cauſe, and that is alvvayes the ſame. Yea, the
neceſſity (as was ſaid) is greater (though, it may be, the
difficulty is alſo greater) when Repreſentatives deſert ſuch
as they do repreſente, and inſtead of helping them with
counſel and conduct, in their neceſſity, do either deſerte
them, or turne enemies unto them.</p>
               <p>Our 3 argument is taken from the law and light of nature
which alloweth to beaſts, power and ability to defend them
ſelves, againſt violence. An argument made uſe of, not
only by <hi>Lex Rex</hi> and the <hi>Apology,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but by Divines, Canoniſts,
Lawyers and others who write of this ſubject. The civil
law it ſelf tells us That his neceſſary defence of life, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the law of nature <hi>L. ut vim. ff. de juſt. &amp; jure.</hi> But
here cometh out a green ſtatiſt, and takes on him to cry
shame on all who ever wrote on that ſubject, and avovves
<hi>Pag. 15.</hi> That it is <hi>too groſſe divinity to bring ſuch an argument
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105606:41"/>
from beaſts.</hi> We muſt therefore ſee vvhether this Man be
rational in rejecting ſuch an argument taken from beaſts; and
not rather more irrational then a Brute, to deny that to a
Rational creature, vvhich he cannot but grant to Beaſts, and
Creatures vvithout life, as vve ſee he doth <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. 15. We
shall readily grant vvith'him, That God hath given this ſelf
defending or preſerving povver and propenſion, otherwayes
to Men, then to inanimate creatures, or unto beaſts,
which are under no law, but that of meer nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they are not to defend themſelves <hi>coeco impetu,</hi> but
rationally; and ought to ſubordinate this natural propenſion
to ſelf defence unto, and limite it, by the higher lawes of
reaſon and of God. Doth he think that ſuch as make uſe of
this argument, do ſuppoſe That in every caſe and in every
manner of way, men are to uſe and exerciſe this natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion
to ſelf defence, in vvhich and after vvhich, Beaſts
are to uſe it? Sure he is in a great miſtake, and he vvrongeth
the authors of <hi>Lex Rex</hi> and of the <hi>Apolog.</hi> &amp;c. vvhen he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Pag. 15. [That they bring arguments from beaſts, (who being under no law of reaſon nor grace, to limite their propenſions, may
alwayes, in all imaginable caſes, defend themſelves with force) to
perſwade men, that they may do the like, and that their propenſion
for their externall preſervation, is no more under any restraineing
rule, to ſtope the exerciſe of it, then that of Beaſts is;</hi>] For, they
intend no ſuch thing, nor are they, in the leaſt, neceſſitated,
to uſe that argument ſo: They only make uſe of it to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
That irrational, and more then brutish poſition and
maxime of abſolute, unlimited and indispenſible ſubjection
of ſubjects to their Soveraigne, ſo that in no caſe, they may
or can reſiſt, which all the Cabal and royal ſociety of Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
paraſites, court flatterers and cavalliers, who, becauſe
they themſelves, in hopes of ſome crumbs of allowance,
have brutishly, without regaird had to the Law of God,
or right reaſon, ſold and devouted themſelves, not only in
matters concerning their body, but in ſoul matters, unto
the meer luſt and pleaſure of a creature of clay, think all
others should play the beaſts with them, do furiouſly &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately
maintaine. And as to this, the argument hence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105606:42"/>
deduced is moſt rational and irrefragable: for it is irrational
to think That God (who taketh much more care of man;
then of beaſts 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9:9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6:30.) should allow and give
unto the inanimate creatures, and to the beaſts, a power
and propenſion to defend themſelves againſt violence, and
should deny the ſame to Man; ſo that in no caſe he should
be allowed to exerce that natural propenſion, to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felfe,
and to reſiſt unjuſt violence with violence. So then we
might let his reſtrictions paſſe, as being no thing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
purpoſe; for, it is but his groundleſſe imagination to think
that we would equalize Men with Beaſts, becauſe we will not,
with him and his party, depreſſe them into a condition belovv
beaſts; yet we shall shortly run over them. His firſt is this,
when <hi>it is ſeen to be to no purpoſe, by reaſon of a phiſical force.</hi> But alas
doth he think this reſtriction of the natural propenſion for
felfe preſervation is upon men only, &amp; not upon Beaſts alſo?
did he not ſay in the ſame <hi>Page,</hi> the <hi>Major vis</hi> and a greater
phiſical force would hinder this even in Beaſts? His next
reſtriction is this, <hi>A man juſtly condemned to death, both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a juſt law, and by a juſt proceſs according to law, may not
uſe violent ſelf defence againſt the Magiſtrate, with re-offending him.
Anſ.</hi> It is granted, what then? will it therefore follow,
that this principle of ſelfe preſervation is ſo reſtricted, as
that a whole Land, or a conſiderable part thereof, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
condemned, both by an unjuſt law, and by an unjuſt
proceſſe according to, or without that unjuſt law, may not
defend themſelves againſt the Magiſtrate's Emiſſaries, ſent
to deſtroy, without reſpect had either to law or conſcience?
Then he tells us That <hi>Lex Rex</hi> is too bold and cometh too
neare to blaſpheme God, by ſaying [<hi>That it were a mighty
defect in divine providence, that men should not have as large a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to defend themſelves violently, as Beaſts have; and that men
were in a worſe condition then beaſts, if as Beaſts have alwayes power
to defend themſelves violently, with their horns, heels, teeth &amp;c.
So men should not have as large a liberty, in every caſe to uſe violence
upon Magiſtrates, putting them to vexation, or perhaps troubling
them in life ſtates &amp;c.</hi>] But where findes he theſe words in
<hi>Lex Rex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The author of <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſayeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 334. [<hi>It were
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105606:42"/>
a mighty defect in providence to man, if dogs, by nature, may defend
themſelves againſt Wolves, Bulls againſt Lyons, doves againſt
haukes; If a man in the abſence of the lawful Magiſtrate, should
not defend himſelf againſt unjuſt violence, but one man might raiſe
armyes of papiſts ſick for blood, to deſtroy innocent men</hi>] but this
is far from [<hi>as large a liberty, in every caſe</hi>] and cometh no way
near to blaſphemy, but is a real truth. Suppoſe <hi>Lex Rex</hi> had
ſaid ſo (which I finde not) it had not been appoſite to his
poynt now, while he is ſpeaking of oppoſeing Magiſtrates
not puting to vexation, or perhaps troubling in life, ſtate, &amp;c.
but rightly executeing a juſt law, againſt a malefactor, which
the worthy author of <hi>Lex Rex</hi> would never have owned, but
would have ſaid, That the Magiſtrate was bound to execute
Gods Law againſt men-ſworne Apoſtats, ſuch as he and his
fraternity are, &amp; that they were bound to ſubmite to the ſtroke
of juſtice. <hi>Thridly</hi> he ſayes <hi>Pag, 16. may not the exerciſe of ſelfe
defence and violent reſiſtence, be reſtrained by the grace of God, and
the power of his command for ſubmiſſion, abiding upon a mans ſpirit?
as in</hi> Iſaac's <hi>caſe, who did not reſist his aged father going to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
him. Anſ.</hi> Whether <hi>Iſaac</hi> made any forceable reſiſtence
or not, we know not, ſcripture is ſilent; but it tels us his
father bound him, we acknowledge God is Lord of life,
but no man is; and he may reſtraine by his will and working
on the ſpirit, ſo as a man who lawfully might flee, and ſave
his life, shall not have power to do ſo, but abide and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
him by giving a faithful teſtimony unto his truth when
queſtioned. But thinks he that ſuch inſtances are binding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Sure, then he shall contradict his owne doctrine,
<hi>Cap.</hi> 4. Or thinks he, that a Body of a people or a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part thereof, shall not exerciſe lawfully this privilege
of ſelf defence &amp; violent reſiſtence, when neither the Law
of God, nor ſuch extraordinary force or reſtraint of God
on the Spirit, but the vaine pleadings of Court Paraſites,
would have it reſtrained? <hi>Fourthly Pag. 17.</hi> He ſayes, <hi>May
not the defence of our temporal life, in ſome caſe, ceaſe, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the eternal life of our Neighbour, when it comes to that,
that the defence of the one shall be the certane loſſe of the other?
Anſ.</hi> True, and therefore He and the reſt of the perjured
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105606:43"/>
clergy should much more ceaſe from the preſervation, or
ratheruſurpation, of their places, livings, and dignities,
when ſo long as they domineer, there is certane ruine to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to the ſouls of many thouſands. And againe, if a
man may lay downe his natural life, for the preſervation of
of the ſoul of his Neighbour, much more may he with others,
hazard the ſame in oppoſeing unjuſt violence, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the pure Religion, whereby thouſands of ſoulls
may be eternally preſerved. But doth he think that a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or a whole countrey-ſide is to give up their lives to the
ſword of the Kings mercyleſſe Emiſſaries, for to preſerve
the vaine pompe, and to fill the bellyes of a few drons,
whoſe God is their belly, though they should account
that their eternal life, and all their felicity? <hi>Fiftly,</hi>
ſayes he, <hi>doth not this obligation ceaſe, for the publick good and
preſervation of the Commonwealth. Anſwer:</hi> What then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth it
follow That Men should renunce their priviledge of ſelf
defence, when their doing of that shall be ſo far, from
promoving the publick good, and preſervation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
that upon the contrare, their doing ſo shall tend
directly to the ruine of the publick good and deſtruction of
the Commonwealth? Sure if this be true, that a man
should lay down his life for the good of the commonwealth.
It is alſo true, that moe should hazard their lives for the
good of the Commonwealth, and violently reſiſt violence.
And doct <hi>Ames</hi> caſe mentioned <hi>Caſ. Conſc. Lib.</hi> 5. c.. 31. q. 3.
would ſute the Prelates well, and their adherents: ſo that
if he and they loved the good of the Church and Kingdome
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they should give up their necks to the ſtroke of
juſtice, that the wrath of God may be turned away from
the land: for till theſe be removed, we can not expect any
thing, but judgement upon judgement from the Lord, till
we be deſtroyed. Neither doth <hi>Naphtaly</hi> croſſe <hi>D. Ames,</hi>
for <hi>Naphtaly</hi> only ſpeaks of a mans ſuffering intolerable and
inevitable injuries, under <hi>pretext</hi> of the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
which indeed for a man to do, would be, for
the deluſion of an empty name, only for the luſt of others,
really to deprive himſelf of his whole share and intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105606:43"/>
neither would he have ground of <hi>hope of getting a better
share,</hi> ſeing it vvere a great queſtion and doubt; if, in that
caſe, he vvere in the vvay of his duty. What he addeth,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 18. of a ſouldiers going to a dangerous poſt, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of his General, is utterly impertinent; Natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
vvil teach ſome dog to ſtand in the gap to keep out
the Bare. His laſt reſtriction is this <hi>That it muſt ceaſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the King, the Head of the Commonwealth, when the caſe is ſo,
that the King muſt either loſe his life or the private man his. Anſ.</hi>
I grant <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſayeth [I think that a private man should
rather ſuffer the King to kill him, then that he should kill
the King, becauſe he is not to preferre the life of a private
man, to the life of a publick man,] But I doubt that
it is ſo agreed among the learned. Sure <hi>P. Voetius</hi> de <hi>Duellis
Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Pag.</hi> 162. thinketh othervvayes, and proveth that
ſelf defence is lavvful to a private perſon againſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
for the lavv vvhich allovveth to repel violence
vvith violence, maketh no diſtinction betvvixt a publick
perſon and a privat perſon, and the law of Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
it againſt every one; for it knovveth no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
And as to that vvhich ſome vvould ſay, That his death
would be hurt full to the Commonwealth. He anſwereth,
[<hi>That he who reſiſteth the Prince doth intend no hurt to the Republick,
and it is not</hi> per ſe, <hi>but</hi> per accidens, <hi>that he ſtandeth in the way
of the good of the Commonwealth; and if he should ſuffer himſelf to
be killed, he should transgreſſe against the Law of Nature.</hi>] Yea
I much doubt if the <hi>Surveyer</hi> himſelf, would not rather kill,
in this caſe, as be killed, and with <hi>Naphtaly</hi> account <hi>Self-defence
a principal rule of righteouſneſſe,</hi> however now he would
diſprove this aſſertion if he could: And would let that paſſe
of loving himſelf more <hi>ad finem ſuum ultimum,</hi> and <hi>ſuam vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem.</hi>
Finally; what he ſayeth againſt this aſſertion of
<hi>Naphtaly</hi> is to no purpoſe; for the Author of <hi>Naphtaly</hi> will
readyly grant that in ſome caſes, not only a man, but a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
of men, may, yea ought to preferre the preſervation of
others, unto the preſervation of their owne life, becauſe
of a divine command to defend Religion, Libertyes, Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Countrey, from the unjuſt invaſion and violence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105606:44"/>
by wicked Emiſſaries. But he shall never prove,
That the Body of a land or a conſiderable part thereof, is to
hold up their throats, to be cut by the Kings cut-throats,
when he &amp; they are ſeeking to root out the Covenanted-work
of Reformation, to deſtroy the Libertyes of the land, and
to make all perfect ſlaves, both in ſoul and body.</p>

This later decree did, in poynt of law, warrand them to

better thoughts. In imitation of vvhich, It had been a
commendable practice in the King and Council, if they had
been ſo farr from condemning theſe innocent ſelf-defenders,
(ſince, as they thought, in poynt of honour and credite, they
vvould not retract or reverſe their decrees and commiſſions
once granted) that they vvould have authorized them, and
abſolved them in poynt of lavv, ſince in poynt of conſcience,
no man could condemne them, for ſtanding to the defence of
their Eſtates, Lands, Libertyes, Lives and Conſciences, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
oppreſſed by mercyleſſe Emiſſaries.</p>
               <p>2. They muſt condemne the people their reſcueing of
<hi>Ionathan</hi> from the ſentence of death, unjuſtly given out againſt
him, by King <hi>Saul</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14: 44. In anſvvere to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
our <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſayeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 65. [<hi>That the people uſed no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
againſt</hi> Saul <hi>when he went about to put to Death innocent</hi> Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
<hi>but in the heat of ſouldiery boldneſſe, do effectually interpoſe
with Saul, and mediate for the life of</hi> Jonathan, <hi>moving</hi> Saul <hi>to
Wave reſpect to his rash oath, and to regaird what was just and right.
Anſw.</hi> 1. The matter came not the length of violence; but had
the King pertinaciouſly adhered to his rash and ſinful reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and, by force, had offered to draw the innocent Man
to death, that which they did, ſpoke clearly, they would
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105606:45"/>
have reſiſted him; for, whether the King would or not,
yea contrare to his oath, they ſweare in the face of the King,
that <hi>Ionathan</hi> should not die, 2. It is but <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> that
only in the heat of a ſouldiery boldneſſe, they did mediate; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
that there ſeemeth to be a material contradiction here,
for ſouldiers mediating and interpoſing eſpecially in the heate
of ſouldiery-boldneſſe, uſeth not to be with humble ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
&amp; intreaties, but with violence or with what will usher
in violence. 3. We heare of no arguments they uſe to move
bloody <hi>Saul</hi> to change his purpoſe, but this, <hi>as the Lord liveth
there shall not one haire of his head fall to the ground.</hi> He ſayes
<hi>Pag. 66.</hi> That [<hi>the people did not oppoſe an oath to</hi> Saul's <hi>oath,
for</hi> Junius <hi>expoſition may paſſe well; that they ſpoke not by way of
ſwearing, but by way of reaſoning, abhorring the deſtruction of ſuch a
perſon,</hi> abſit, ut vivit Jehovah, an cadere debet.] <hi>Anſ.</hi>
The word which they uſe is no other way tranſlated here, by
<hi>Iunius,</hi> then elſewhere; and elſewhere it hath clearly the
import of an oath, as may be ſeen <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8. 19. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19:
16. and 20. 3, 21, 25, 26. and in many other places. 2.
The People ſpoke theſe words, as <hi>Saul</hi> ſpoke them,
<hi>ver. 45.</hi> and therefore they are directly an oath of the
people oppoſed to <hi>Saul's</hi> oath. 3. <hi>Iunius</hi> himſelf ſayeth,
that they oppoſed a juſt oath to <hi>Saul's</hi> hypocritical oath.
<hi>Sanctius in locum,</hi> ſayeth, [the people oppoſed to the Kings
oath, a publick oath, &amp; ſwore that they would not ſuffer that
any evil should be done unto him.] The <hi>dutch Annotat</hi> call
it an abrupt kinde of oath in uſe among the Hebrevvs. <q>But
(ſayes he)[It is a vvonder to ſee underſtanding men argue
from this place, for violence and forcible reſiſtence to
Kings, eſpecially vvhen acting according to lavves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to by private perſones]</q> 
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This place proveth
clearly that princes may be reſiſted, and reſiſted vvhen they
uſe violence and oppreſſion, and that by private perſones,
even vvhen the oppreſſion, or iniquity is acted according to
a pretended lavv, or ſomething equivalent to a lavv. Let us
ſee vvhere the difference lyeth. <hi>Here</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the King is not
acting according to law, but proſecuting the execution of a foolish and
rash oath] Anſw:</hi> 1. Neither did our King's bloody Emiſſaries
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105606:45"/>
act according to lavv, but were proſecuting the execution of
a develish and rash reſolution, to root out and deſtroy a vvhole
Countrey ſide, 2. If Royaliſts ſpeak truth, <hi>Sauls</hi> vvord, let
be his oath, vvas as good as a lavv: and <hi>Sanctius</hi> ſayeth it vvas
<hi>Decretum decreed.</hi> And vvhatever it vvas formally, it vvas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
a law, unto which they had all tacitely aſſented, <hi>v.</hi> 24.
&amp; which they durſt not tranſgreſſe <hi>v.</hi> 26. [<hi>Here</hi> (ſayes he)<hi>the
oppoſition made to the King is by way of interceſſion &amp; earneſt reaſoning
that he ought to regaird what was right more then his rash oath.) Anſw.</hi>
No reaſoning vve heare but a peremptour telling of the King,
to his face, that he should not get his vvill, not one haire of
<hi>Ionathan's</hi> head should fall to the ground, if he should attempt
any thing, againſt <hi>Ionathan,</hi> it should be over their bellyes:
Their vvords look like club-agruments. [<hi>Here</hi> (ſayes he)<hi>their
oppoſition was acceptable and welcome, acquieſced in and yeelded to</hi>]
<hi>Anſw.</hi> It is like it vvas condeſcention by force and conſtraint,
for vvhether he vvould or not, he ſavv he could not get his
vvill, and therefore paſſed from vvhat he intended, 2. His
acquieſcence ſayes the reſiſtence vvas more forcible then
meer interceſſion vvould be; for, he vvas another ſort of
bloody Tyrant, then to yeeld to petitions, vvhen he thought
his honour ſtood upon it [<hi>Here</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the oppoſition is made
by the Princes of the land, Captains of Thouſands &amp;c.</hi>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> The
text ſayes <hi>The people reſcued Ionathan.</hi> Who ever they vvere
&amp; vvhatever they vvere, they acted not here as the Supreame
Sanhedrin, nor as a court of judicatour haveing povver of
government, but as private perſones, according to their
povver and capacities. And ſo all this makes much for a
party of private perſones (for here vvas not all the land) their
reſiſting of the King's bloody emiſſaries executing cruelty,
not ſo much as according to an iniquous lavv, but contrare to
all lavv, right and reaſon [<hi>Let</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>Peter martyr be looked
upon this place, and he ſpeaks not ably well, his owne words will diſcover

               <p>3. They muſt condemne <hi>David,</hi> for his reſiſting of King
<hi>Saul,</hi> with armed men, which yet the ſpirit of God doth not
condemne, but rather approve, in commending ſuch as helped
him I <hi>Chron. 12: 1. 2. 8.</hi> &amp;c. and inſpireing <hi>Amazia</hi> who was
chief of the captaines to ſay <hi>Thine are we David, and on thy ſide,
peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be unto thy helpers, for thy God
helpeth thee.</hi> So did he intend to keep out the city <hi>Keila</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King, and conſulted God thereanent, and had his
anſwere, that the city would betray him. Now if it had
been unlavvful for him to have defended himſelf by ſuch
forcible reſiſtence, vve cannot think that he vvould have
goten ſuch anſvvers as he gote. <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf approveth this
deed of <hi>David's.</hi> All vvhich this <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſayeth againſt this
<hi>Pag. 67.</hi> is, <hi>That Davids unction did ſo diſtinguish him from
private perſons, as that it made it lawful for him to reſist violence
with violence:</hi> But, the law of nature reſtricteth not this law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſelf-defence to anoynted perſons. 2. If his anoynting
made him no private perſon, what did it make him? it could
not make Him King, othervviſe he might not only have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<hi>Saul,</hi> but have taken his life as a traitour; or elſe vve muſt
ſay, there were two Kings at once in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 3. David never
pleads this as the ground of his reſiſtence, nor is there any
hint of this in the text.</p>
               <p>4. They muſt condemne the city <hi>Abel 2. Sam. 20.</hi> which
reſiſted <hi>Ioab, Davids</hi> General, and his forces, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
it, till the matter came to a capitulation, <hi>Ioab</hi> should
have offered tearmes unto the city, before he had threatned to
deſtroy it; and should have communed with the Magiſtrates,
concerning the delivering up of the Taitour, before he had
reſolved to deſtroy the whole city, for one Traitours cauſe:
and therefore juſtly did they defend themſelves againſt his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
invaſion notwithſtanding he was armed with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from the King: and remarkable it is, that after the
capitulation, they were never challenged for traitours in
reſiſting, with cloſed gates, and fenſed walls, the King's
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105606:46"/>
General and army. So that here is a private city ſtanding
out for a time, againſt the King's ſouldiours, unjuſtly ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to deſtroy them, becauſe of one Traitour among
them.</p>
               <p>5. They muſt condemne the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> for reſiſting <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah's</hi>
bloody Emiſſaries ſent by him, in an angry moode, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him and to compell him, in a ſpite full manner, and
to take him priſoner, as ſay the <hi>Dutch Annot.</hi> on the place, For
ſpeaking ſuch things as he did, unto the meſſengers of the
King, who were ſent to <hi>Baal zebub</hi> the God of Ekron, to
enquire if he should recover of his deſeaſe; and to bring him
to the King by violence, if he would not come willingly, as
<hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſayeth <hi>antiq. Lib. 9. C. 2. 2 King. 1.</hi> Now he reſiſted
ſuch as were ſent, and killed two Captanes &amp; their fifties,
with fire from heaven, which inſtance doth ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that it is lavvful for private ſubjects, in ſome caſes, to
reſiſt the unjuſt violence of the King's Emiſſaries, though
armed with his commiſſion. It is true, the manner of his
reſiſtence, and of killing theſe, vvas extraordinary, by
way of a miracle; yet the reſiſtence it ſelf, was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinare,
as we have ſeen by other inſtances, and shall ſee
cleared by moe.</p>
               <p>6. They muſt condemne the prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> who reſiſted
both the King and his Emiſſaries in his ovvne defence <hi>2
Kings 6:32.</hi> ſaying to the Elders who ſate with him <hi>ſee yee how this Sone of a murderer hath ſent to take away my head? look where
the Meſſenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him faſt at the door,
is not the ſound of his Maſters feet behinde him?</hi> Here was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
violence offered to the innocent Prophet, an Emiſſary
ſent to kill him without cauſe: and the Prophet reſiſteth his
violence, cauſeth hold him at the door, and violently preſſe
him, or preſſe him betvvixt the door and the wall, vvich
ſpeaketh violent reſiſtence: keep him (ſay the <hi>Dutch Annot.</hi>)
by force at the door: yea <hi>Ioſephus</hi> thinketh that the King
follovved quickly after, left the Prophet should have
killed his ſervant. This clearly ſayes that it is lawful for
privat perſones (for the Prophet vvas no other but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ſubject) to reſiſt unjuſt violence offered them by the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105606:47"/>
King or his Emiſſaries, and with violente reſiſtence, to
defend themſelves.</p>
               <p>7. Much more will they condemne other inſtances of
greater oppoſition, made to the rage and tyranny of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which we finde recorded in ſcripture, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>As. 1. That oppoſition made by the Ten tribes to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi>
when they revolted from him, after they had a rough and
tyrannical anſwere unto their juſt and lawful demands <hi>1 King.
12: 1.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>2 Cbron. 10: &amp; 11.</hi> They deſired nothing, upon
the matter, but that He would engadge to Rule over them
according to the law of God, and He gave a moſt harsh and
tyrannical anſwere, and avowed that he would tyrannize over
them, and oppreſſe them more then any of his predeceſſours,
and that his little finger should be heavier then their loyns;
whereupon they fell away from him, and erected themſelves
into a new Commonwealth, and chooſed a nevv King: And
vve finde nothing in all the text condemning this; for, it
vvas done of the Lord, the cauſe vvas from the Lord, that
he might performe his ſaying vvhich he ſpoke by <hi>Ahijah;</hi> and
vvhen <hi>Rehoboam</hi> raiſed an army to reduce them againe under
his power and command, the vvord of God came unto <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiah</hi>
ſaying <hi>ſpeak unto Rehoboam &amp;c.</hi> and ſay <hi>thus ſayeth the
Lord, yee shall not goe up, nor fight against your brethren, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael, returne every man to his houſe, for this thing is from
me.</hi> It vvas done by the vvill of God ſayeth <hi>Ioſephus Antiq.
Lib. 8. c. 11.</hi> And there is not one word, in the text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
that this vvas condemned by the Spirit of the Lord;
for, as for that vvord <hi>1 King. 12. 19. So Iſrael rebelled against
the houſe of David.</hi> It may be as vvel rendered, as it is in the
margine, <hi>they fell away;</hi> and ſo doth the <hi>dutch</hi> render it,
and <hi>lunius defecerunt,</hi> they fell avvay, or made defection, and
the original vvord is of a larger ſignification then <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> vvhich

                  </gap> had been

defection, more then <hi>2 King. 18. 7.</hi> vvhere <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is ſaid
to have <hi>rebelled</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and this was a frute
and effect of the Lords being with him, and proſpering him,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105606:47"/>
whitherſoever he vvent forth. The <hi>Surveyer Pag. 66.</hi> can ſay
nothing but [<hi>That no ſound man will think the ſuddaine and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
rebellion of the ten Tribes from Davids houſe, upon the furious
and rash anſwer of a young King, was juſtifiable.</hi>] But vvhatever
he ſay or think, it doth not weigh much with us; had he
shewed us out of the Text, that this was condemned by the
Spirit of the Lord, as ſinful upon the matter, we should
heartily have acquieſced, but ſince we ſee more hinting at an
approbation thereof, we muſt reſt there, till we ſee ſtronger
reaſons, then his naked aſſertions. But ſayes he [<hi>It would
be conſidered that theſe who made the ſeceſſion were the major part
of the body of the people, but what is all this to juſtifie the inſurrections
of any leſſer party of private people againſt the Magiſtrate, and all
Magiſtrates ſupreme &amp; ſubordinate.</hi>] <hi>Anſ.</hi> By what right, this
Major part of the Body did make ſeceſſion, by that ſame
right, might the equal half, or the leſſer part have made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion;
for the ground of the lawfulneſſe of this ſeceſſion,
is not founded upon their being the major part, but upon
the reaſonableneſſe of their demand, and the tyrannicalneſſe
of the King's reply. 2. This ſayes much for us; for, if
it be lawful for a part of the people, to shake off the King,
refuſe ſubjection unto him, and ſet up a new King of their
owne, when he reſolveth to play the Tyrant, and not to
rule them according to the law of the Lord, but after his
owne tyrannical will; then it cannot be unlawful for a part
of the people to reſiſt his unjuſt violence, and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt his illegal tyranny, and oppreſſion. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
cannot be denyed, ſeing they who may lawfully
do the more, may do the leſſe alſo: So that ſeing this people
might lawfully refuſe ſubjection and homage unto <hi>Rehoboam</hi>
and all his ſubordinat Magiſtrates, They might alſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
have defended themſelves againſt his tyranny, and the
tyranny of all under him: and if They might lawfully have
done ſo, ſo may we.</p>
               <p>2. They should far more condemne the revolt of the city
of <hi>Libnah 2 Chron. 21. 10.</hi> This wicked King <hi>Iehoram</hi> when he
was riſen up to the Kingdom of his father, ſtrengthened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſlew all his brethren with the ſword, and diverſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105606:48"/>
alſo of the Princes of Iſrael <hi>v. 4.</hi> and walked in the wayes of
the Kings of Iſrael, like as did the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> for he had
the Daughter of <hi>Ahab</hi> to wife, &amp; he wrought that which was
evil in the eyes of the Lord <hi>v. 6.</hi> and he made him high places
in the mountaines of <hi>Iudah</hi> and cauſed the inhabitants of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
to commit fornication, and compelled <hi>Iudah</hi> there to
<hi>v. 11. 13.</hi> and becauſe he had thus forſaken the Lord God
of his fathers, did the city <hi>Libnah</hi> revolt from under his
hand. Commentators cleare this to have been the reaſon as
<hi>Cornel. a. lap. in loc. propter impietatem Regis defecit ab eo Libna. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus

in this caſe. What ſayes our <hi>Surveyer</hi> to this [<hi>This</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>imports not the impulſive cauſe of the revolt, or motive which they
had before their eyes (for, in that ſame verſe &amp; period, it
is ſaid</hi> the Edomites alſo revolted from him, becauſe he had
forſaken the Lord God of his Fathers, <hi>and the</hi> Edomites
<hi>loved not the true Religion) but the meritorious cauſe on</hi> Jehorams
<hi>part is poynted at.] Anſw.</hi> The text it ſelf and Commentators,
to vvhom vve may add <hi>Iackſon</hi> on 2 King 8. &amp; the Dutch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.
Ibid. give this as the impulſive cauſe, and only motive
vvhich they had before their eyes. 2. Any who read the text
vvill ſee his reaſon very unſound; for v. 8. it is ſaid, that
<hi>in his dayes the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Iudah,
and made themſelves a King;</hi> and no word of this, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
cauſe there of; &amp; v. 10. mention again is made of their
revolt upon occaſion of <hi>Iehorams</hi> ſeeking by force, to reduce
them under his dominion; and then in a new period, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made of <hi>Libnah's</hi> revolt, with the cauſe and only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
thereof; <hi>Becauſe he had forſaken the Lord God of his Fathers.</hi>
Then he asks if his adverſary [<hi>thinks that the laying aſide of the
presbyterian frame, is the forſaken of the Lord God of our Fathers,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105606:48"/>
and a ſufficient cauſe for any one Towne in the Kingdom, to revolt
from the King, (though he do not perſecute them, nor force them
to his way, as there is no evidence that</hi> Libnah <hi>was ſo uſed) shall
a Kings ſwerving in that one point, or if there be greater infidelity, be
ſufficient ground of defection from him?] Anſ.</hi> I nothing doubt,
but all ſuch as have imbraced this preſent courſe of apoſtaſie
are guilty of a grievous revolt, having impudently and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
departed form a ſworne Covenant, from a covenanted
&amp; ſworne Religion, reformed in Doctrine, Worshipe, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
&amp; Government; and have in a great part forſaken the
God of our Fathers, that covenanted God whom our
Fathers, and we both owned, and imbraced as our God;
and is ſufficient cauſe for any City, or Company of men, ſo
far to revolt from the King, as to refuſe to concurre with him,
in this horrible defection and courſe of perjury, and reſiſt
his unjuſt violence preſſing and compelling them to a ſinful
compliance. 2. As it is more then probable, that <hi>Libnah</hi>
was no better uſed, then were the people of <hi>Iudah,</hi> by this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous
King, and is aſſerted by the <hi>Dutch Annot.</hi> on 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
21:10. So whatever this lyer ſuggeſteth, it is notour that
the King hath perſecuted and doth perſecute and force honeſt
people, to follow his way, and apoſtatize with him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
to their conſciences and ſworne allegiance unto God,
and if he add this clauſe as an exception, then (ſeing the
truth of the thing is notour) he fully accords, that there is
ſufficient cauſe given, for any Town in the Kingdome to
revolt, which is more then we deſire. At length he tells
us. That their revolt was ſinfull. But when not only thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
revolt is recorded as done, but ſuch and impulſive cauſe and
motive is added by the Spirit of the Lord, without the leaſt
hint of any expreſſion condemning the ſame, we dar not
be ſo bold, as is this <hi>Surveyer;</hi> Nor are we ſo foolish as to
receive his word, contraire to the teſtimony of ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors.</p>
               <p>Hence we have a ſtrong argument: For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it be lawful for
a part of the people, to revolt from a tyrannous Prince,
making defection from the true and received Religion, and
forceing his ſubjects to a ſinful defection and complyance
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105606:49"/>
with him in his apoſtaſy: It muſt alſo be lawful for a part
of the people to defend themſelves by force againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries

the Religion, which He hath ſworne to owne and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,

him make haſte,</hi> ſayeth <hi>Ar. Mont. festinate expulerunt eum,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Hieron.</hi> When he went in the temple to burne incenſe,
upon the altaar of incenſe, on ſome ſolemne day (as <hi>Ioſephus</hi>
thinketh.) So that there is more then a reſiſtance of him
by words, as ſome Royaliſts ſay; even reſiſtence by force
and violence. Hence we argue; if private ſubjects may
by force reſiſt, withſtand, and with violence hinder the King
from tranſgreſſing the Law of God; Then may they much
more lawfully reſiſt him, and his bloody Emiſſaryes, when
He ſeeketh to oppreſſe unjuſtly and to draw people off from
the wayes of the Lord. If any ſay with <hi>doct Ferne,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of an expreſſe Law of God, being a leper, he was put
out of the congregation: Then we ſee, that the Prince is
ſubject to <hi>Church-cenſure,</hi> and ſo Subjects may judge him and
punish him; we ſee alſo that Princes were ſubject to ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
lawes, as well as any of the ſubjects; and why not alſo to
the moral Lawes; and if becauſe of a ceremonial Law,
the King was to be ceremonially punished, why alſo, for
the breach of moral Law, may he not be punished moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
Hence will it undoubtedly follow, That a Prince
rageing and tyrannizeing contrare to all equity and reaſon,
may be reſiſted and his violence repelled with violence, even
by private ſubjects. Worthy <hi>Mr Knox,</hi> in his debate with
<hi>Lithengtoun,</hi> doth form this inſtance gather; That ſubjects
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105606:49"/>
not only may, but alſo ought to withſtand and reſiſt their
Princes whenſoever they do any thing that expreſly repugnes
to God, his Law, or holy Ordinance. <hi>Lithingtoun</hi> objected
That [<hi>they were not private subjects, but the prieſts of the Lord
and figures of Christ, and ſuch have we none this day, to withſtand
Kings if they do any thing wrong.</hi>] He anſwered that though
the High Prieſt was a figure of Chriſt, yet he was a ſubject.
[<hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I am aſſured that he, in his Priesthood, had no
prerogative above theſe that paſsed before him; now ſo it is, that</hi> Aaron
<hi>was ſubject to</hi> Moſes, <hi>and called him</hi> Lord: Samuel <hi>being both</hi>
prophet, and Prieſt, ſubjected himſelf unto <hi>Saul,</hi> after he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurated
of the people; Sadoc <hi>bowed before</hi> David, &amp;c. And
whereas you ſay, we have no ſuch Priests this day, I might anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were,
that neither have we ſuch Kings this day, as then were anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Gods commandement, and ſate upon the ſeate of David,
and were no leſſe the figures of Christ Ieſus, in their juſt admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
then were the Prieſts, in their appointed office; and ſuch
Kings (I am aſſured) we have not now, no more then we have
ſuch Prieſts, for Christ Ieſus being anoynted in our nature, of God
his Father, both King Priest, and Prophet, hath put an end to all
external unction: and yet I think you will not ſay, that God
hath now diminished his graces from theſe whom he appoynts Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
betwixt him and his people, then he doth, from Kings
and Princes, and therefore, why the Servants of Ieſus Christ may
not alſo justly withſtand Kings and Princes who this day no leſſe offend
Gods Majeſty, then <hi>Uzziah</hi> did, I ſee not; unleſſe that ye will ſay,
That we in the bringhtneſse of the Evangel, are not ſo ſtraitly bound to
regaird Gods glory, nor his commandements, as were the Fathers who
lived under the dark shaddowes of the Law.] And when <hi>Lithing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi>
ſayd, That they only ſpoke unto him without further violence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
<hi>He anſwered,</hi> [That they with ſtood him, the text aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
me, but that they did nothing, but ſpeak, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
for the plame text afformes the contrary, viz. That they
cauſed him haſtily to depart from the ſanctuary, yea and that he
was compelled to depart; which manner of ſpeaking (I am aſsurred)
in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue importeth more then exhorting, or command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by word.] <hi>And when</hi> Lethingtoun <hi>laſtly objected that they
did that after he was eſpyed to be leprous.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>[They
withſtood him before, but yet their last fact confirmes my propoſition,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105606:50"/>
ſo evidently, that ſuch as will oppoſe themſelves unto it, muſt needs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves unto God; for my aſſertion is, That Kings have no
privilege, more then hath the people, to offend Gods Majeſty, and if
ſo they do, they are no more exempted from the punishment of the law,
then is any other ſubject; yea, and that ſubjects may not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
oppoſe themſelves to their Kings, whenſoever they do any thing
that expreſly oppugnes God's Commandement, But alſo that they
may execute judgment upon them, according to God's Law; ſo that
if the King be a murtherer, an adulterer, or an Idolater, he should
ſuffer, according to God's Law, not as a King, but as an offender:
and that the People may put God's Law in execution, this History
clearly proveth; for ſo ſoon as the leproſy appeared in his forehead,
He was not only compelled, to depart out of the Sanctuary; but alſo he
was removed from all publick ſociety, and administration of the
Kingdome, and was compelled to dwell in a houſe apart, even as the
law commanded, and gote no greater privilege in that caſe, then
any other of the people should have gote: And this was executed by
the People—&amp; therefore yet againe I ſay that People ought to execute
God's Law, even against their Princes, when their open crimes by
God's Law deſerves punishment, but eſpecially when they are ſuch as
may inſect the reſt of the multitude.</hi>] Thus that worthy
Servant of God, and hence any may ſee, how this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
doth more then confirme what we are now about to
prove.</p>
               <p>4. They muſt much more condemne ſuch as aroſe againſt
<hi>Amaziah</hi> when he turned away from following the Lord, &amp;
purſued him to <hi>Lachish</hi> and flew him there, <hi>2 Chron.</hi> 25: 21.
Concerning which I shall only ſet downe what famous and
worthy <hi>Mr Knox</hi> ſaid in that forementioned debate, which
he had with <hi>Lithington,</hi> [<q> The whole people (ſayes he) conſpired againſt <hi>Amaziah,</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he had turned away from the Lord, and followed
him to <hi>Lachish,</hi> and ſlew him, and took <hi>UzZiah</hi> and
anoynted him King inſtead of his father. The people had
not altogether forgotten the League and Covenant, which
was made betwixt their Kings and them, at the inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration
of <hi>Ioas</hi> his Father, to wit, that the King and the
People should, be the People of the Lord, and then should
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105606:50"/>
they be his Faithful ſubjects, from which Covenant, when
firſt the Father and aftervvard the Son had declined, they
vvere both punished vvith death, <hi>Ioas</hi> by his ovvne Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and <hi>Amaziah</hi> by the vvhole People, vvhen <hi>Lithing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi>
(ſaid) <hi>he doubted whether they did well or not.</hi> He anſvv.
[It shall be free for you to doubt as you pleaſe, but where
I finde execution according to God's law, and God himſelf
not to accuſe the doers, I dar not doubt of the equity of their
cauſe. And further it appeareth to me; that God gave
ſufficient approbation, and allowance of their fact, for
he bleſſed them with victory, peace and proſperity, the
ſpace of fifty two years after]</q> and when <hi>Lithingt:</hi> replyed
That <hi>proſperity doth not alwayes prove that God approveth the facts of
Men.</hi> He anſwered (<q>Yes, when the facts of Men agree
with the law of God, and are rewarded according to his
owne promiſe expreſſed in his law, I ſay that the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ſucceding the fact, is a moſt infallible aſſurance, that
God hath approved that fact: Now ſo it is, that God
hath pronounced in his law, That when the people shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
and deſtroy ſuch as decline from him, that he
will bleſſe them, and multiply them, as he hath promiſed
unto their fathers. But ſo it is, that <hi>Amaſia</hi> turned from
God, for ſo the text doth witneſſe, and plaine it is, that
the People ſlew their King, and like plaine it is, that God
bleſſed them. Therefore yet againe I conclude that God
himſelf approved their fact: and ſo far as it was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his commandement, it was bleſſed according
to his promiſe.</q>) And when <hi>Lithingtoun</hi> replyed againe
That <hi>he thought not the ground ſo ſure as he durſt build his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
thereupon.</hi> He anſwered <q>[I pray God that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
have no worſe ground then this is, when ſoever you
shall beginne the like work, which God in your owne
eyes hath already bleſſed.]</q> And if ſo (as is very probable)
and learned <hi>Althuſ. pol.</hi> C. 38. n 106. is of the ſame judgment
with <hi>Mr Knox,</hi> we need not trouble the reader with forming
an argument thence to our purpoſe, the ſame being ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

               <p>1. The hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> mentioned in that ſtory,
is a cleare example of private perſons reſiſting and defending
themſelves frm the iniquous aſſaults of the Soveraigne, or
his Emiſſaries; for when <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> was compelling
them to forſake God, and tyrannizing over them, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi>
a prieſt, and his ſones made open reſiſtence; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Mattathias</hi> &amp; thoſe with him, hearing how <hi>Matthias,</hi> out
of an overnice ſuperſtition, would not fight in their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
on the Sabbath day, reſolving upon all occaſions to
defend themſelves, their Lives, and Lawes, and to take all
advantages of the Enemy, did accordingly aſſault them,
and recovered their Cityes Lawes and Libertyes, fighting
many battels with good ſucceſſe. And <hi>Oſiander Enchirid.
controv. c. 9. de mag. pol.</hi> teſtifieth that this was done by the
encouragement and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God. And if
any should reject this inſtance as impertinent, becauſe they
ſuppoſe <hi>Antiochus</hi> was not their lawful Supream Magiſtrate,
but only a Tyrant without title, let them heare what <hi>Grotius
de jure belli &amp; pacis lib. 1. c. 4. n. 7.</hi> ſayeth to this? <q>Like
unto this appeareth that deed of the <hi>Maccabees;</hi> for whereas
ſome think to defend theſe armes, upon this gronnd, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105606:51"/>
                     <hi>Antiochus</hi> was not King but an invader, it ſeemeth foolish
to me, ſeing in all the hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and of ſuch
as took their part, they never name <hi>Antiochus</hi> any thing
elſe, but their King, and that not without ground; for long
before this, the <hi>Iewes</hi> had acknowledged the authority of the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> unto whoſe power and place <hi>Antiochus</hi> did ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
&amp; as to that that the law forbiddeth that any ſtranger
should be ſet over them, that is to be underſtood of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
election and not of what the people might through
neceſſity be forced to do. And, whereas others ſay that
the <hi>Maccabees</hi> uſed only the right of the people <hi>cui <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
deberetur.</hi> Neither is that ſolide, for the jewes being at firſt
overcome by <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> and ſubjected to him, by
the law of warre, by the ſame law they did obey the <hi>Medes</hi>
and <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ſucceeded unto the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> and all this
Impire came at length into the hands of the <hi>Macedonians:</hi>
hence it is, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> reckoneth the jewes amongſt baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of ſuch as ſerved theſe <hi>Aſſyrians, Medes and Perſians:</hi>
Nor did they require any thing by ſtipulation from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
and his ſucceſſours, but without any condition
gave themſelves up unto their power, as formerly they had
been under the command of <hi>Darius.</hi> And if at any time
the jewes were permitted to uſe their owne rites, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
that was but a begged right, which they had through
the indulgence of the Kings, but not through any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
law. So that there is nothing that can defend the
<hi>Maccabees</hi> but most imminent and certane danger] thus
he.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. The conſtant practice of the Waldenſian proteſtants in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> doth shew that this late practice is not ſo ſtrange &amp;
uncouth, as adverſaryes would give it out to be; for, they
never had a Repreſentative to be a ſcreen betwixt them, and
the tyranny of their princes, and yet how oftintimes have
they valiently with ſtood ſuch, as came to oppreſſe them,
in goods and lives, though cloathed with commiſſion from
the princes? In the yeer 1580. being perſecuted by the
<hi>Lord of Trinity,</hi> and their popish Soveraignes, they aſſembled
ſolemnely together, to conſult how to prevent the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105606:52"/>
dangers, and after prayer and calling upon God for his
grace, and ſpirit of counſel and direction, they reſolved
to enter into a ſolemne mutual Covenant, and to joyn in a
League together, for defence of Themſelves and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and ſo accordingly did aſſiſt one another, in their
defence, which they did with good ſucceſſe; And that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſince whenever they were aſſaulted by the bloody E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries
of the <hi>Duk</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as any may ſee fully in their
hiſtory. So that whoſoever will condemne the late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
muſt alſo condemne theſe poor oppreſſed proteſtants,
who have no other meane to keen them from utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but this innocent meane of felf defence, and of repell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unjuſt violence with violence; for Bonds, Promiſes &amp;
Covenants binde their Prince, as ſuch obligations uſe to
binde ſome others viz. no longer then they ſee it for their
advantage. Neither have they any Repreſentative, Prince,
or Noble man, among them, to head their matters; but
meer neceſſity puts them to uſe the beſt expendient they can,
and forcibly to reſiſt their oppreſſing Superiours, when they
ſend to ſpoile them of their goods, lives and libertyes.</p>
               <p>3. Some particular cityes in <hi>Germany</hi> did defend themſelves
againſt the Emperour unjuſtly invadeing their libertyes, and
aſſaulting them, as may be ſeen in the hiſtory of <hi>Germany,</hi>
particularly the Cities of <hi>Madenburgh</hi> and <hi>Breme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4, So in <hi>France,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Montobane</hi> and <hi>Rochel</hi> and the
Iſle of <hi>Ree</hi> with ſtood the King, when he was ſeeking to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
them. And no man will condemne theſe for acts of
rebellion and ſedition, unleſſe they will alſo condemne our
Kings, who, at leaſt undertook, and offered to help and
aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p>5. It was this oppoſition and reſiſtence of privat perſons
when tyrannized over, by Superiours, that hath brought
the Cantons of <hi>Helvetia</hi> unto that ſtate of freedome and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which they have enjoyed for many yeers, and do enjoy
this day; being now a free Republick, as <hi>Simlerus</hi> showeth
in his hiſtory of that Republick.</p>
               <p>6. But that we may come home, we finde ſome remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
inſtances of this nature, which no man in reaſon, who
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105606:52"/>
shall condemne this late defence, shall be able to defend:
and to beginne with what may be moſt recent in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
In the year 1648. There are two ſignal Inſtances.
The one was that violent reſiſtence uſed againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
forces at <hi>Mauchlin moor.</hi> Here was not only a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
in defence of the truth and cauſe of God, then
ſought to be borne downe and oppreſſed, by a prevalent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
faction in Parliament, without the concurrence of
conduct of the Repreſentatives of the land, but directly againſt
them: Here was a defence uſed by way of reſiſtence, by
meer privat perſons without the company or concurrence of
one Noble man; And yet a reſiſtence that never was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by any, to this day, expect ingrained Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants;
but was approved and commended highly, by
the Parliament anno 1649. the beſt Parliaments <hi>Scotland</hi> did
ſee for many yeers. Againe thereafter in that ſame yeer
1648, The forces of the weſt Countrey aroſe in defence of
the Cauſe and Covenant of God; and that not only without
the conduct of a Parliament, but againſt their reſolutions.
It is true, there were ſome Nobles &amp; Parliament-men among
them, and countenancers of them; but theſe acted not, nor
could act, by vertue of any Parliamentary power; but only
as privat ſubjects, having, by reason of their greater intereſt
in the land, a greater obligation to lay out themſelves, and
to improve their authority and influence in the countrey,
for the good thereof, and for the cauſe of God. They had it
is true, by their places and ſtations, greater influence upon
the Countrey, and a greater backing, and ſo being leading
men, were in a greater capacity to defend the oppreſſed truth;
but all this gave them no publick Magiſtratical power, nor
put them in the capacity of a real and formal Repreſentative:
and yet all this was afterward approved, ratified and confirmed
by Parliament, as good and neceſſary ſervice to the countrey,
and to the cauſe of God, A third notable inſtance is that
Anno 1639. There was then no publicke civil judicatory
carrying on that defence, but Nobles and others, each in
their capacity, and according to their power, concurred, for
the promoveing of that neceſſary work of defence. They
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105606:53"/>
did not acte under the notion of any ſuch judicature, nor did
they aſſume to themſelves any ſuch power and authority.
It is true, there were then a great number of Noble Patriots,
and renowned Nobles, who laid the work of reformation to
heart, and laid out themſelves to the utmoſt of their power for
the ſame, and becauſe of their concurrence, the vvork vvas the
more feazible and eaſy to be carryed on; but I think the ſtreſſe
of the lawfulneſſe of that defenſive warre, did not lye wholly
upon their shoulders; ſo that if they had with drawne, all the
reſt of the body of the land, had been bound in conſcience, to
have deſerted the ſame alſo. It is true, it was of great advantage
unto the cauſe, that God ſtirred up the ſpirit of the Nobles
to owne the ſame (and is ſo alwayes) upon many accounts,
and their concurrence had its owne auxiliary force, to juſtify
the interpriſe, for <hi>abundans cautela non nocet:</hi> But I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
not that the lavvfulneſſe of that defenſive war, was ſtated
only or mainely on that particular. It is true, They are
<hi>Primores Regni</hi> be vertue of their particular places and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and be vertue of their eminency over others, and
power by reaſon of their eminency; and ſo are engaged
beyond others, to ſee to the good of the Land, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
for the good of the ſouls of ſuch as are under them,
and on whom they have or may have influence; And, be
reaſon of this, may authoritatively even as ſuch, do many
things, when there is no other conſtitution of a Supreme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative:
But when a conſtitution of a Supreme Publick
Repreſentative is condeſcended upon and ſetled, it is certane,
they cannot ſeparatly, yea nor joyntly act in the power and
capacity of a formal Supreme Repreſentative, but when they
are, with others, conſtituent members of that Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
and out of that Repreſentative (unleſſe by power and
commiſſion from it) they cannot act judicially, or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively,
nor in any other capacity formally, then as private
perſones, though as perſons of greater intereſt, and share
in the Commonwealth, and ſo under greater obligations,
both by the Lavv of God and of nature, to beſtirre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more effectually for the good of the ſame; and as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of greater influence and conduct; yet ſtill under
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105606:53"/>
the notion of private perſons, private perſons I meane, as
oppoſite to perſons cloathed vvith publick authority and
Parliamentary povver. I grant they are borne-Heads and
Magiſtrats of the Countrey, as being in eminency above
others, and as being by birth, conforme to our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
borne-Members of Parliament, and ſo in <hi>potentiâ prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imâ,</hi>
and in a nearer capacity then others are, to vote and
acte in Parliament: but ſtill I ſay, conſidered out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
or vvhen there is no Parliament, they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erce
any Parliamentary povver, conclude or determine any
thing of that nature, more then others: It is a truth alſo,
that they have, by reaſon of our law and conſtitution, a
Magiſtratical power, limited to ſuch and ſuch cauſes over
ſuch and ſuch particular places; but that is only and inferiour,
and ſubordinat civil power, and cannot extend beyond that
limited bounds, more then the power of Magiſtrates
in Broughs, or Sheriffs in Shires, or Baylies in Baylieryes,
or the like, and is no part of that Magiſtratical power which
is commonly called the power of warre. I grant, that
they and all other inferiour Magiſtrates, are to ſeek to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the good of the vvhole land, and to concurre, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their povver, for the ſame, even becauſe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
and share of that ſubordinat povver: But they cannot
act under that notion, nor do any thing be vertue of that
particular povver, nor exerce any acts thereof, out of the
bounds of their ſeveral juriſdictions; But all they do, is by
vertue of that fundamental power belonging to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Commonvvealth, according to their ſeveral
places and relations. Hence therefore it it cleare, that our
vvorthyes then acted not, as a publick judicatory, or as
publick perſons cloathed with publick authority. So that
vvhoſoever shall condemne this late act of defence, upon the
account, that it vvas managed by meer private preſons, muſt
alſo, in reaſon, condemne that which theſe worthies did;
and ſo conſpire with the Malitious Malignants, ingrained
in wickedneſſe, and enmity to the way and work of God.
A fourth and laſt inſtance, is that of our firſt reformers in
the dayes of Mr. <hi>Knox:</hi> for, at the beginning of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105606:54"/>
there were but very few Nobles, who concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> teſtifyed in his ſermon <hi>Nov. 7.</hi> 1559. in
theſe words [when we were a few in number, in compariſon
of our Enemies, when we had neither Earle nor Lord (a
few excepted) to comfort us, we called upon God, and
took him for our protector, defence and only refuge.] And,
in the following words, he sheweth that it fared rather
better with them, then worſe, when they wanted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of Nobles: For, ſayeth he, [<hi>amongſt us was heard
no bragging of Multitude, nor of our ſtrength and policy, we did
only ſob to God, to have reſpect to the equity of our cauſe, and to the
cruel purſute of the tyrannical enemy; but ſince that our number
hath been thus multiplyed, and chiefly ſince the Duke with his
friends hath been joyned with us, there was nothing heard, but this
Lord will bring theſe many hundered ſpears, This man can perſwade

trouble us: And thus the best of us all, that before felt God's potent
hand to our defence, hath of late dayes put flesh to be our arme]</hi> And
as Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> ſaid, ſo it was, much of their buſineſſe was
carryed on without the concurrence of many Nobles. We
hear of no nobles with the gentlemen of the weſt, when
they came from the border to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and when <hi>Iames Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
of <hi>Gaitgirth</hi> ſaid to her (when they had heard. that she
had cauſed ſummon the proteſtant preachers) (<hi>Madam, we know
that this is the Malice of the jewells, and of that baſtard</hi>(meaning
the Bishop of S. Andrews) <hi>that ſtandeth by yow, but we shall make

their idle bellyes, they trouble our preachers, and would murther them
and us, Shall we ſuffer this any longer; No Madam, it shall not be.</hi>
Nor was there any of the Nobles preſent, when that abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of carrying an idol on S. Giles day, was oppoſed.
There were buy foure Nobles that ſubſcribed the firſt bond
at <hi>Edinburgh Decemb 3. 1557,</hi> Where the whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
reſolved, by the grace of God, to apply themſelves,
their whole power, ſubſtance, and lives, to maintaine, ſet
forward, and eſtablish the moſt bleſſed word of God, and
his congregation &amp;c. So foure of five only ſubſcribed the
ſecond bond at <hi>Perth may</hi> laſt 1559. We finde not many
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105606:54"/>
Nobles with them, when they petitioned the parliament. And
there proteſted [<hi>that they would worshipe God, according to the
right manner: That none of them therefore should incurre any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
That if upon this account any tumult should ariſe no crime

And when they wrote that letter <hi>May</hi> 22. 1559.
Wherein they ſaid [<hi>That except the cruelty were ſtayed, they would
be compelled to take the ſword of just defence againſt all that should
purſue them, for the matter of Religion, and that the cruel, unjuſt,

where in they ſaid [<hi>By your fainting and extracting of your
ſupport, the Enemies are encouraged, thinking that they shall finde no
reſistence: in which poynt, God willing, they shall be deceived, for
if they were Ten thouſand, and we but One thouſand, they shall not
Murther the leaſt of our brethren.</hi>] From all which, and from
the whole ſtory of theſe times, it is undenyably apparent,
that they acted for the defence of the truth, and of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
brethren, and for the carrying on of the work of
reformation, for ſome conſiderable time, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
and conduct of a Parliamentary Repreſentative.
From all which Inſtances of our predeceſſours, I would
have theſe thing obſerved.</p>
               <p>1. It is remarkeable That when God was to beginne any
word of reformation in our Land, whether from Popery or
Prelacy, the powers then in being, were ſtanding in a
ſtated oppoſition thereunto. This is notoure both in the
dayes of <hi>Mr Knox,</hi> &amp; in the yeer 1639. King, or Queen, and
Counciles were ſtated againſt it, and oppoſeing the ſame,
what they could.</p>
               <p>2. The only wiſe God, who is wonderful in counſel,
and excellent in working, thought fit, not to beginne with
the Spirits of the <hi>Powers</hi> in being, to cauſe them firſt appeare
for the work; but thought it more to his honour and glory,
to make uſe of foolish things to confound the wiſe; and of
weak things, to confound the things that are mighty; and
baſe things, and things which are deſpiſed, and things
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105606:55"/>
which are not, to bring to nought things which are. It
ſeemed good in his eyes, who doth all things after the
counſel of his owne will, to imploy the leaſt of the flock in
that buſineſſe according to that word <hi>Ier.</hi> 49. 20. <hi>and</hi> 50. 45.
and to raiſe up meane, and contemptible inſtruments, that
the work might more conſpicuouſly appeare to be his, and
the glory thereof redound to himſelf alone.</p>
               <p>3. As they would have been glade, (had it ſo ſeemed
good in the Lords eyes) if the ſtanding Repreſentatives,
would have not only concurred and countenanced that work,
but would have, according to their places, led on the
vaune, and shewed themſelves powers appoynted for God
and his glory, by exerceing the power which God had put
into their hands, for God and his intereſt; So the want of
their encouragement and conduct, did not, in the leaſt,
brangle their confidence of the lawfulneſſe of their interprize,
of ſo diſcourage them, as to give over their work, as deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and hopleſſe.</p>
               <p>4. Nor did they ever aſſume to themſelves any authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Magiſtratical power, to legitimate their actions;
as if they had thought, that without that formality, their
reſolutions and motions had been condemned as unlawful in
the Court of God, and Nature: but walked upon the
ground of that fundamental right, granted to all both
higher and lower, to maintaine the Truth of God, upon
all hazards, and to ſtand to the defence thereof, and of
themſelves, when unjuſtly perſecuted, becauſe of their
adherence thereunto, according to their power, and as
God in his providence called them thereunto.</p>
               <p>5. Nor did their adverſaries objecting, that their actions
were treaſonable and ſeditious, as being contrare to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and eſtablished lawes, ſcar them from their purpoſes,
in the leaſt, having the teſtimony of a good conſcience with
in them, that they had not the leaſt purpoſe or project, to
caſt off lawful authority, or to diminish it's juſt right and
power; and knowing that the <hi>Powers</hi> out of whatever prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and upon whatſoever motives, relinquishing their
duty, and oppoſeing that truth and way, which by their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105606:55"/>
places and callings, they were obliged, before God, to
maintaine, preſerve, and promove, did not looſe their
obligation, and exeem them form that duty, which God
and nature had laid upon them; but rather did preſſe them
to proſecute their buſineſſe more vigurouſly, as ſeeing the
neceſſity much more urgent, and the difficulty ſo much the
greater: And knowing that whatever lawes are made,
in a Chriſtian Common wealth, should be for the glory of
God, and the good of the ſouls of the ſubjects mainly,
and for their external welbeing only in ſubordination unto
theſe great Ends; and when the obſervation of the ſtrick
letter of the law, did croſſe the maine good, which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<hi>de jure</hi> they aimed at, they were <hi>eo ipſo,</hi> in ſo far, null and
voyd before God; becauſe it alwayes holdeth good. <hi>that it
is better to obey God, then Man,</hi> and mens commands or lawes,
unto which obedience cannot be yeelded, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of, and treaſon committed againſt the Higheſt of
all, who is King of Kings, are as no commands before
God, and diſobedience unto theſe, is no diſobedience unto
the lawful authority, but faithful allaigance unto the moſt
Supream.</p>
               <p>6. Theſe poor weak beginnings, how baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
ſo ever they appeared, yet God was pleaſed,
when the time to favour <hi>Zion</hi> was come, ſo to owne, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and proſpere, that the ſame work at length came
to be owned, by Publick Repreſentatives, and Parliaments,
yea and the Kings themſelves were brought to a publick
owneing and approving of the ſame. And who knoweth,
but, if God had thought good to bleſſe this late act with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
it might have been followed with the like conſequent?
But his time was not come.</p>
               <p>7. It is alſo obſervable, That whatever diſaſter, or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment
they did meet with, in proſecution of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and in the preſervation and defence of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
in the owneing of the truth of God; though it put
them to mourne for their iniquities before God, and to
acknowledge, among other ſinnes, their too much relying
upon the arme of flesh, and not reſting with a pure faith on
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105606:56"/>
his power and protection; yet it never made them queſtion
their call, or ſuſpect the lawfulneſſe of their work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as to its ſubſtance, and end: for they knew well, that
the work was the Lord's and that their call was divine,
though for his owne holy ends, that they might be more
humbled, and taught do depend with a ſingle heart, on his
word and promiſe, and to purge out ſuch evills as provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the eyes of God's jealouſy; he ſuffered them to fall.</p>
               <p>8. When the work came at length to be owned by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
and Higher Powers, what was formerly done by
perſons not in that capacity, was not condemned either as
unlawful or illegal, nor did the valient actors ſtand in need
of any indempnity, as if they had been tranſgreſſours; but
all was either virtually or expreſly approved: and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
actors praiſed and highly commended, as indeed they
did deſerve.</p>
               <p>9. None ever condemned theſe actions as treaſonable and
rebellious, but ſuch as were knowne to be real and heart-enemies
to the work it felf; no tongues were ever looſed
againſt them, except the imbittered tongues of ſworne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
ingrained Malignants, Enemies to God and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
&amp; haters of the power of it. Theſe and none but theſe
who are of their father the devil, durſt condemne the ſame.
And many hollow hearted profeſſours (among whom this
Surveyer deſerveth to be rekoned) were forced againſt their
hearts, to approve of the ſame &amp; joyne in with the favourers
&amp; maintainers of that noble cauſe, ſo forceable was the light,
and the power of that Sprit that acted the worthies in theſe
dayes, who now have turned open Apoſtates from that truth
and cauſe, &amp; have adjoyned themſelves unto that ever accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
Popish, Prelatical, and Malignant faction. Yea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
it is that God did ſo overpower the pen of that
Arch-Enemy <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> that though he would have ſaid all
which Hell it ſelf could have prompted him unto; yet durſt
ſay no more of theſe firſt courſes and practices, but that they
were <hi>Violent</hi> and <hi>diſorderly.</hi> And this <hi>Rabshaketh</hi> the <hi>Surveyer,</hi>
who, in the end of his book (having reſerved the dregs
of what he had to exſcreate againſt the work of God and his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105606:56"/>
worthyes, until then <hi>Pag. 118.</hi> &amp;c. would out-ſtripe his
predeceſſours, and ſpevv out his venome, like another adder
of the ſame ſpavvne; yet the overruleing providence of
God, hath ſo curbed him, that he gote not liberty to run the
full length he vvould, and therefore he ſayes [<hi>We cannot juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
all courſes that were uſed then for carrying on the work of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>]
and againe [<hi>if ſome inſtruments thereof were guilty of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſacrilege, or ſelf ſeeking</hi>] and againe [<hi>if ſinful courſes
were then uſed by men</hi>] and againe <hi>Pag. 119.</hi> [<hi>Let us not ſtand
ſuperſtitiouſly upon the juſtifying of all their deeds</hi>] Who ſees not
this wicked mans Mouth bridled, by the reſtraineing power
of God, ſo that he cannot, he dar not, plainely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
call theſe courſes ſeditious or rebellious; but cometh
on with his <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>if ſome inſtruments,</hi> and <hi>all their courſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be juſtified:</hi> as if, in the moſt laudable work, to which
men might have a moſt cleare call, ſome accidental or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial
actions, might not abide the teſt: and as if among
a company, ſome might not have by-ends, while a good
work was laudably and lawfully, as to the maine, carryed
on. Ay, but this good man, you will ſay, is mighly
in love with the work of reformation, and bleſſeth God for
it <hi>Pag. 118. 119.</hi> True, we finde him ſay ſo in words,
but God knoweth his heart: But is it not ſtrange, that
fince, he ſayeth, he approveth the work, he will be more
blinde then was that poor man in the goſpel whom he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth,
who had his eyes opened <hi>Ioh. 9.</hi> for that blinde man,
did ſee a divine power in the work wrought and ſaid
<hi>v. 33. If this man were not of God he could do nothing,</hi> and will
not only, not ſee the mighty hand of God in the inſtruments,
but tells us, he is not much concerned to enquire. But what
needeth him much doubt of a divine call, conſidering the
work it ſelf, it's end &amp; the direct tendency of the meanes unto
this end, &amp; the real &amp; chriſtian intentions of the inſtruments,
which he will not ſee in the inſtances he bringeth viz. of the
wicked hands crucifying Chriſt, of prophane and unfaithful
Miniſters preaching, of a leprous hand ſoweing ſeed, of
acts of fornication and adultery? Why then doth he adduce
ſuch Inſtances ſo impertinent? Wil he proclame himſelf
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105606:57"/>
a fool of the firſt magnitude in ſo doing? Ay, but he
would have us following the practices of the primitive chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
who never uſed any undutyful reſiſtence to, or
violence upon the Magiſtrats, rather then the precedents in
theſe dregs of time. But why will he not follow their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
himſelf? Was it their practice to abjure a lawful Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
ſworne for the maintainance of the Truth? Was it
their practice to renunce their former profeſſion, and turne
Apoſtates from the truth, which once they avowed? Was
it their practice to turne their back on Chriſt and his intereſt,
for the will of creatures, and for a meaſe of pottage? Was
it their practice to change their Religion with the court?
Concerning the practice of the primitive chriſtians, in this
poynt, and how imitable we shall ſpeak afterward. If theſe
were the dregs of time, wherein there was ſo much faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
Zeal, conſtancy, piety, ſingleneſſe of heart,
contempt of the world, what dregs of dregs of time
are we novv fallen in, vvherein there is ſo much infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
atheiſme, perjury, falshood, lukwarmneſſe,
incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
imbraceing of this preſent vvorld, and all ſort of
wickedneſſe and prophanity? [<hi>But</hi> (ſayes he, Pag. 119.)
let it be ſo that much of the way of theſe, who were at first inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
in the reformation in this Land, were justifiable upon the account of
purging the Church, from the horrid groſſneſſe of idolatry, corruption
of doctrine, tyranny and uſurpation over poor ſoulls wherewith
the man of ſin, had for many ages defiled and burdened the poor
Church; and upon the account of the open hostility to the truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Magiſtrats then ſtood, together with the inbringing of forraigne fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
forces upon us, even to the heart of our Land; How unlike was
the caſe then, to what it is now? and how unable is the caſe now to
beare the burthen of a concluſion for ſuch practices as then were uſed?]
<hi>Anſw.</hi> But truely wiſe judicious Men will not ſee the caſe
then, ſo far different from what it is now, as that the caſe
now shall not be ſo able to beare the burthen of a concluſion
for the ſame practices; Seing there is, this day, as much
horrid groſſneſſe of idolatry in the Land, as hath been at any
time, theſe hundereth yeers: And, as for corruption of
doctrine, alas! Who doth not heare it, and ſee it, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105606:57"/>
heareth theſe locuſt-curates preach downe all piety and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
and harden people in defection and apoſtaſy from
God? It is as great a corruption in doctrine, as needs to be,
to pervert therein the right wayes of the Lord, &amp; to lead
people into the broad way which leadeth unto deſtruction:
againe, what greater tyranny and uſurpation over poor ſouls
would he have, then is now exerciſed, ſince the perjured
Prelates the kindely brood of the Man of ſinne, have defiled
and burthened our poor Church. The <hi>Apology</hi> and <hi>Naphtaly</hi>
have abundantly manifeſted and dayly experience confirmeth
it, That the tyranny and uſurpation is inſupportable, and as
grievous, as it was them. Moreover, is not the open ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility
to the truth as manifeſt in the Magiſtrats, this day, &amp;
as legible by ſuch as run, on all their acts and actings, as it
was then? who ſeeth not this, but he who can not ſee the
wood for trees? And as for the inbringing of forraigne fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
forces, into the heart of our Land, It were needleſſe,
ſeing we had raiſed up in our owne boſome, as cruel, bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mercyleſſe, furious and mad forces, as any forraigners
could be, or theſe were: wherein lyeth the difference then?
<hi>O</hi> (ſayeth he) [<hi>We can avow it, in the preſence of God, that we
contend for that ſame Faith and Religion, that our predeceſſours ſtood
for, against the Powers of that time: and will maintaine the ſame,
againſt all Novators, who upon account of a piece of Church order
(allowed by our Reformers) now re-eſtablished, inſtigate any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſons, who have power enough, to deſtroy all Magiſtracy and
order in the Land, becauſe of the owning thereof.</hi>] It is not much
matter what ſuch men, ſay, they can avow in the preſence of God, who have openly and avowedly broken their vowes,
and renunced that Covenant, which they ſwore oftiner then
once, with hands lifted up to the Moſt High God. No
wiſe Man will think that ſuch will ſtoutely contend for
the Faith and Religion, who have renunced all faith
and Religon, and abjured theſe Covenants, which were
ſtrong bulwarks, to guaird and defend that Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Ay, but he will maintaine it againſt Novators,
as he calleth them. That is indeed a new way of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truth, to maintain it againſt ſuch as ſtand for the defence
thereof, and all the bulwarks thereof againſt him and his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105606:58"/>
fraternity, who are diſmantling the walls, undermining them
opening the gates to adverſaries &amp; intertaining them kindly in
their boſome. He ſpeaks an untruth, when he ſayes, that the
Reformers owned ſuch a Church order (rather Church-bane,
and Church-confuſion) as theſe worthyes are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
againſt, and is now re-eſtablished. So vvhen he
ſayes, that theſe <hi>Novators,</hi> and that <hi>Naphtaly</hi> do inſtigate any
private perſones, vvho have povver enough, to deſtroy all
Magiſtracy and order in the Land, and to occupy their
Roomes. We hope there shall be a Magiſtracy and good
order, in the Land, vvhen that abjured Hierarchy, the
bane of that Church and State, shall be utterly abolished,
vvith all it is adherents, I muſt not let that paſſe vvhich he
hath <hi>Pag.</hi> 119. [<hi>Some</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>have ſaid, Religion would
never have been reformed, if violence had not been uſed upon Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates:
But why should men take on them to limite God? Hath he
not shewed his power in ſeveral parts of the world in working on the
hearts of the Supreame Magiſtrates, and cauſing them to goe befor
others in reformation of abuſes?</hi>) <hi>Anſw.</hi> We know no violence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was uſed then upon Magiſtrats, only with violence the godly
withſtood the unjuſt violence of Magiſtrates, ſo as they gote
not their furious purpoſes executed: we shall be far from limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Holy Oe of Iſrael, &amp; therefore dar not ſay, but he
hath moe wayes then one, of bringing about his holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes:
And, as at the firſt ſpreading of the Goſpel, it was
not his way, to work on the hearts of the Supreame Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
and cauſe them to goe before others, in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo a way may be his way, which is different from that
way, whereunto he would limite the Lord. We do not
deny but God may, vvhen he thinks good, ſtir up Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
to goe before others in that vvork; but it hath not been
his way of recovering us from Popery, and we have not
found the Supream Magiſtrates ever ſince ſo cordial, as vve
could have vvished, for the vvork of Reformation; And
yet God hath carryed on his ovvne vvork, vvhether they
vvould or not: And he who wrought then is the ſame God

               <p>From theſe particulars mentioned, and from vvhat vve

lawful 2, Becauſe if we take away both publik and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

and ſaifty, to ſatisfy their luſts.]</q> Thus He. But it
may, be, Out Surveyer will reckon him in amongſt his Pſeudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyres,
becauſe his book was confuted by a Hangman
and a fiery fagot, at the command of King <hi>Iames:</hi> Yet,
both the book, and the Author are in great eſteem with the
reformed, and his praiſe is in all the Churches, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
come of the book his reaſons ſtand firme and valide. In
the Hiſtory of our Reformation, <hi>Pag. 397, 398.</hi> (edit. in
4 to <hi>Edinb.</hi>) we finde that <hi>Iohn Knox</hi>
had the Apology of
<hi>Magdeburgh</hi> ſubſcribed by the Miniſters there, declareing
the defence of the towne againſt the Emperour, to be moſt
juſt and lawful, and offered it to Secretary <hi>Lithingtoun,</hi> who
then was diſputeing againſt him, to read.</p>
               <p>And having now made Mention of Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> what was
his judgment in this poynt, that hiſtory doth abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.
His words to the <hi>Queen</hi> are remarkable (ſee hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of Reformation, <hi>Pag.</hi> 317.) When she asked him if he
thought, That ſubjects having power might reſiſt their
princes: He anſwered <q>If princes do exceed their bounds,
and do againſt that, wherefore they should be obeyed,
there is no doubt, but they may be reſiſted, even by power;
for there is Neither greater honour; nor greater obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be given to Kings and Princes, then God hath
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105606:59"/>
commanded to be given to Father and Mother. But ſo it
is That the father may be ſtricken with a phrenzie, in the
which he would ſtay his owne children: Now if the
children ariſe, joyne themſelves together, apprehend the
father, take the ſword or other weapon from him, and
finally, binde his hands, and keep him in priſone, till
that his phrenzie be over-paſt, think ye Madame (ſaid he)
that the children do any wrong, or vvill God be offended
vvith them that have ſtayed their father from committing
wickedneſſe? It is even ſo with princes that would murther
the people of God, that are ſubject unto them: their
blinde zeal is nothing but a very mad phrenzie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to take the ſvvord from them, to binde their hands,
and to caſt them into priſone till that they be brought to a
more ſober minde, is no diſobedience againſt princes, but
juſt obedience, becauſe it agreeth vvith the vvord of God)</q>
thus he, vvho knevv not vvhat is vvas to feare the face of any
breathing, in the defence of his Maſter's cauſe and intereſt:
and vvas an eminent divine, a holy Man of God, living in
near communion vvith God, and vvas far above the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches
and calumnies of his adverſaryes. And it is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that this vvas a particular vvhich he had frequent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to be thinking upon, and no doubt, this holy Man
vvould be often reflecting upon the matter, and upon his
ovvne judgment; and conſulting God and his vvord there
anent, that he might knovv vvhether his grounds vvere ſuch,
as he vvould not have cauſe to be ashamed of, vvhen he
vvas to appeare before his judge, being oft called to
shevv his judgment concerning that matter: And his
conſtant practice being conſonant thereunto: And yet
vve never finde that his heart reproached him, for
maintaineing any ſuch opinion, vvhile living, or vvhile
dying, nor did he ever change his judgement thereof; yea,
not when the maintaineing thereof might have been a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ground of an accuſation: and doubtleſſe he vvould
before hand examine, if he vvould lay dovvne his life upon
ſuch a ground, yet conſtant vvas he in that, coſt him vvhat
it vvould, or could; he vvas no changeling, nor had he ſo
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105606:60"/>
drunken in truth. Yea in the end of that conference vvith
<hi>Lithingtoun</hi> he told them that he vvas not only fully reſolved
inn conſcience, but alſo had heard the judgements of the moſt
godly and learned that he knevv in <hi>Europe</hi> in that particular,
and in all other things that he had affirmed [<hi>I came not</hi>(ſayes

have the hand-writeing of many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>] Neither was this his judgement
alone, but alſo of <hi>Mr Georg Hay</hi> vvhom the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Mortoun</hi>
vvould have had diſputing againſt <hi>Mr Knox. But</hi> (ſayd he)
<hi>I will not oppoſe my ſelf unto you, as one willing to impugne or confute
that head of Doctrine, which not only yee, but many others; yea
and my ſelf have affirmed; farre be it from me, for ſo should I be
found contrarious to my ſelf.</hi>] And of <hi>Mr Craig, Mr Knox's</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue,
vvho told vvhat a concluſion he heard defended at
<hi>Bonnonia, Anno 1554.</hi> by <hi>Thomas de Finola</hi> Rector of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
and approved by <hi>Vincentius de Placentia,</hi> as agreeable
both to the lavv of God and man viz. [<hi>That all Rulers be
they Supreame or inferiour, may &amp; ought to be reformed, or bridled,
by them, by whom they are choſen or admitted to their office, ſo oft
as they break that promiſe made by oath to their ſubjects; becauſe
that the prince is no leſſe bound by oath to the Subjects, then the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to the Princes, &amp; therefore ought it to be keeped &amp; reformed equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
according to law, and condition of the oath that is made of either
party</hi>] and when ſome ſaid that <hi>Bonnonia</hi> was a Republick.
He anſwered [<hi>My judgement is that every Kingdome is, or at
least should be a Commonwealth, albeit that Every Commonwealth
be not a Kingdome: and therefore I think that in a Kingdome, no
leſſe diligence ought to be taken, that lawes be not violated, then in
a Commonwealth; becauſe that the tyranny of Princes who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in a Kingdome is more hurtful to the ſubjects, then is the
miſgovernment of thoſe that from yeer to yeer are changed, in free
Commonwealths; but to aſſure yow and all others, that head was
diſputed to the utter-most; and then in the end, was concluded,
That they ſpoke not of ſuch things as were done in diverſe Kingdomes
and Nations, by Tyranny and negligence of people, but what ought
to be done in all Kingdomes and Commonwealths, according to the law
of God, and unto the juſt lawes of Man: and if by the negligence of
the People, by the Tyranny of Princes, contrary lawes have been
made, yet may that Same people, or their poſterity justly crave all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105606:60"/>
things to be reformed according to the original inſtitution of Kings and
Commonwealths; and ſuch as will not do ſo, deſerve to eate the frute
of their owne foolisneſſe,</hi> thus he: ſee, <hi>Hiſt. of Reform. Pag.</hi> 399. 400. (Edit. in 4. Yea this was the judgement of all the reformed
preachers at that time, as we ſee witneſſed by the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
vindicating the doctrine of their preachers, concerning
obedience to be given to Magiſtrats, in theſe words (ſee
<hi>Hiſt of reform</hi> Pag. 184.) [<hi>In open audience they declare the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Princes and Magiſtrates to be of God, and therefore they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that they ought to be honoured feared and obeyed, even for
conſcience ſake, provided that they command, nor require nothing
expreſly repugning to God's commandement, and plaine will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in his word. Moreover they affirme. That if wicked perſones
abuſeing the authority eſtablished by God, move Princes to command
things manifeſtly wicked, That ſuch as can &amp; do bridle the inordinate
appetites of miſled Princes, cannot be accuſed as reſiſters of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which is God's good ordinance. To bridle the rage and fury of
miſled Princes, in free Kingdomes and Realmes, they affirme it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth
to the Nobility ſworne and borne Councellors of the ſame;
And alſo (NB) to the Barons and People: whoſe votes and conſents
are to be required in all great and weighty matters of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
which if they do not, they declare themſelves criminal with
their miſled Princes, and ſo ſubject to the ſame vengeance of God
which they deſerve, for that they pollute the ſeate of juſtice, and do, as
it were, make God author of iniquity.</hi>]</p>

               <p>WE shall willingly grant, vvith the <hi>Surveyer Pag. 1.</hi> That
God hath made man a Rational creature, and fit for
ſociety: And that God hath appoynted, beſides oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
ſocietyes, the coalition of people into greater bodyes,
conſiſting of many familyes under one kinde of government,
and political head, for their mutual good in their neceſſities,
and for protection of the whole body, and every Member
thereof: That Magiſtracy is God's ordinance, he having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
Superiour Heads and Governours, to rule theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
that they might be preſerved from ruine and deſtruction:
And that the hath put this inſtinct and dictate of reaſon into
all; ſo that even barbarous people are led together into ſuch
politick aſſociations, under their Governours, for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
in general, for the mutual help one of another, and
for the protection of the weaker againſt the injuries of the
ſtronger: And therefore we willingly ſay with worthy <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin
Lib 4. Inſt, c. 20, §. 4.</hi> That [<hi>Nulli jam dubium eſſe debet,
quin civilis potestas, vocatio ſit non modo coram Deo ſancta &amp; le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitima,
ſed ſacerrima etiam, &amp; in tota mortalium vita, longe om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
honeſtiſſima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet as to the right underſtanding of the peoples intereſt in
the conſtitution and erection of civil Government, and of
civil Governours, unto whom they ſubject themſelves, we
would have thoſe Particulars conſidered.</p>
               <p>1. It will be readily granted, that there was a time when
ſuch people, as are now imbodyed in a politick ſtate, were
not ſo imbodyed; but were either living ſeparatly in a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
condition, or by providence caſt together in one
place, and cohabiteing together, and throw proceſſe of
time, increaſeing in number, and filling that place of ground
with their poſterity and iſſue; in which condition living with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105606:61"/>
any eſtablished civil order common to all, every one
ſaw to his owne matters the beſt he could, and governed
theſe, according to his beſt advantage having no other
law to ſquare his actions by, then the moral law, or law of
nature.</p>
               <p>2, Among this multitude or company, while in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
there was none, who by birth, or any other lawful
clame, could challenge to himſelf any civill dominion,
power or authority over the reſt, or could exerciſe any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical
power, whether by makeing civil lawes, or by
executing the ſame. I ſpeake here of a civile power for I
deny not, but in that condition, parents had power over
their children, husbands over their wives, maſters over their
ſervants; and, in ſome reſpect, the Elder might have had
ſome power over the younger, the more ſtrong and power
full over the more weak, the wiſer over the more foolish
and ignorant, and upon that account, a ſort of natural prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence:
but this neither did, nor could intit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e them unto a
civil ſuperiority, an civil Magiſtracy over theſe, farr leſſe
over all the reſt. I grant that even in that ſtate of affaires.
Some being endued of God with gifts and qualifications
beyond others, and ſo more fitted for Government, then
others who wanted thoſe advantages, might look liker
the perſons whom they ought to pitch upon and call for that
work; but notwithſtanding of theſe enduements and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilityes,
They could not upon that ſole ground, lay
clame unto Soveraignity, and aſſume unto themſelves a
civil power and juriſdiction over the reſt: ſo that as to any
actual, and formal right unto Magiſtracy, and ſupream go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
all are by nature alike, though not alike quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
thereunto, and ſo, not in alike neare capacity for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
thereof. This, I ſuppoſe, will not need proof,
ſince I am here ſpeaking of the firſt, and moſt undoubtedly
lawful, and ordinary conſtitutions of Commonwealthes,
and abſtracting from that queſtion, What Magiſtratical
power he may have, and aſſume to himſelf, who tranſporteth
and erecteth colonies; as alſo, from that queſtion, what
title or right to government, pure conqueſt by armes, or a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105606:62"/>
lawful conqueſt upon a lawful warre, may give, as being
of no affinity with our caſe, though this <hi>Surveyor</hi> be pleaſed
now to account us little better then a conqueſt, of which
afterward.</p>
               <p>3. When a multitude in this condition, do aſſociat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and conſidering, through the inſtinct of nature,
how neceſſary it is, that ſome way be condeſcended upon,
for the common ſaifty and preſervation of the whole body
from forraigne adverſaries, and inteſtine diviſions, and for
the ſaifty and preſervation of every one in particular, from
mutual injuries, and acts of injuſtice, do think of eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome civil government and governours, we cannot ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ſuppoſe, that they goe about ſuch a buſineſſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
rashly, brutishly, inconſiderately and irrationally; If
reaſon teach them that a government muſt be erected, for
their wel being, and move them to think of falling about it,
we cannot rationally ſuppoſe them to acte in this matter irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
They being rational creatures, &amp; not a company
of brutes, and through the inſtinct of reaſon taught
that this was a buſineſſe both neceſſary and of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
cannot but be ſuppoſed to act rationally in this
matter.</p>
               <p>4. It will not need much diſput to prove, that by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of a Policy, and of Politick Governours, they
should not be redacted unto a worſe condition, then that was,
into which they were, before the conſtitution was conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
upon; farr leſſe can it be ſuppoſed, that by this
change they enjoy no more the common privilege of rational
creatures, but degenerate into beaſts, or are depreſſed into
a condition, equal unto, if not worſe then that of beaſts.
Sure it muſt be granted that they remaine Rational creatures,
and that Rational Creatures would never rationally yeeld
unto ſuch a change as should deteriorate their condition, let
be brutify them, or make them rather chooſe to be beaſts.
And that ſuch a change into a civil ſtate, if accompanyed
with ſuch conſequents, could never be the inſtinct of pure
nature; nor can we ſuppoſe, that ſuch a thing can be the
ordinance of God, appoynted for the good of mankinde.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105606:62"/>
Therefore this muſt ſtand, as a firme truth, that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a people modelled into a civil ſtate, is not worſe then
it was before, but rather better.</p>
               <p>5. It will be no leſſe readyly yeelded, That ſuch, one or
more, as are choſen by the Community, to act the part of
Magiſtrates, notwithſtanding of that change made in their
condition, abide men of the like paſſions and infirmities with
the reſt (yea and ſubject to moe temptations and ſo in greater
hazard to miſcarry, then formerly) This change doth not
Tranſforme them into Angels, or put them beyond the
reach of injuries (as all will grant) nor beyond a capacity
of doing injury, even to theſe over whom they are ſet. No
humane power can ſet any above God's Law, or looſe him
from the binding power thereof: and till this be; or They
out of a capacity or tranſgreſſing God's Law (which no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
act can do) He Or They are ſtill obnoxious to the ſin
of injuring their neighbour, and tranſgreſſing the law of
righteouſneſſe, no leſſe then others;</p>
               <p>6. It is Left to the People, in this caſe, to condeſcend
upon what forme of government they think moſt expedient,
and moſt ſuteable to their temper, and to the condition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath caſt them into, whether it be Monarchy or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſticracy
or Democracy, or a mixed kinde: for though God
and Nature hath inſtituted Government, yet not having
determined any one <hi>forme,</hi> to be the only lawful forme;
People are it liberty to walke here upon rational grounds,
and to conſult their owne advantage, next the glory of God;
and to make choiſe of that, which, all things conſidered,
promiſeth moſt probable felicity unto them, and of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>formes</hi> or Kindes of government, (all lawful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
to pitch upon what Kinde they think moſt expedient
and conduceing to their ends. This is aſſented unto by all
Politians: and ſo it followeth, That it is meerly from
the People, that this forme and not another is made choiſe
of.</p>
               <p>7. As neither God nor Nature hath determined the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
forme of government under which Men muſt live,
but hath left it, as was ſaid, to their free choiſe; ſo it is not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105606:63"/>
determined how large or how little, every politick ſociety
should be; nor whether a people living at ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
diſtance from other, or more contiguouſly, should
joyne together in one, and make up one body politick; or
whether they should erect moe, diſtinct, and independent
Commonwealthes though poſſibly of the ſame extract,
and language. Nature ſayeth not that all in one Iland, of
one extract, or of one language, should become one Politick
Body under one politick head. We have heard of the time
when there have been many Kings, diſtinct and independent,
in one <hi>England:</hi> And how many Kings there was at one and
the ſame time, in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> no vaſt territory, ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tells us. Nor hath Nature determined that diſtinct
bodyes of people, living in diſtinct and far ſeparated places,
yea having diſtinct cuſtomes, and languages, may not when
they ſee it for their advantage, aſſociate for ſetting up one
Supreame Soveraigne over all. So that this alſo is left to
the free choiſe and determination of the People.</p>
               <p>8. When a free People have rationally and deliberatly
condeſcended upon the forme, it is in their power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend
upon the time, how long that forme shall endure,
and either prefix a certaine time, at vvhich it shall evanish,
if they ſee it not expedient to continue it: or reſerve to
themſelves a liberty to alter it when they vvill. Each of
the ſormes being in themſelves lavvful, People may chooſe
vvhich they think beſt; and though one Kinde of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vvill agree to ſome People, better then another, yet
Bodyes of people, being lyable to cauſal changes, and
theſe requireing formes ſuteable, A people at the beginning
guyded with reaſon, may rationally foreſee ſuch changes,
and accordingly determine the firſt forme condeſcended on
to continue, longer or shorter time, definite, or indefinite.
It is not to my preſent purpoſe to determine, vvhat a people
may do as to this, after their predeceſſours have once imbrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a forme, and engaged themſelves by oath never to change
it. Or vvhether it be lavvful to ſvveare unto any one
forme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:105606:63"/>
9. It is from the People, that ſuch perſones, and no
other perſones, are made choiſe of to Governe according to
that forme, which they have condeſcended upon: before
this deed of the People, no man can pretend to it, all being
equal, and none over another by nature, in any political ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
no man coming out of the womb into this world,
with a crowne on his head, and a ſcepter in his hand: and
God (as we here ſuppoſe) immediatly and particularly
deſigneing none, nor without the leaſt concurrence of the
People inſtaleing any into that place of juriſdiction: and
therefore the People muſt do ſomething in order to this, and
upon their deed it followeth, that ſuch as before were no
lawful Magiſtrates, nor had any formal political power, are
now Magiſtrates and Governours, having lawful power
and authority to exerce the function of a Magiſtrate: for
though the People do not inſtitute the office of Magiſtracy,
and though the proper eſſential Magiſtratical power, be
from God and not from the People; and though the parts
and qualifications wherewith the Magiſtrate ought to be,
and the perſon which the people do pitch upon, is actually
endued, be from God; yet till the People do ſome thing, all
theſe do not formally cloath a man with Magiſtratical power,
nor make him a lawful Magiſtrate, nor authorize him, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
that place &amp; charge: for, the preſent condition and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of a people may call for a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as moſt fit, and
there may be among the Community, now aſſociated &amp;
combined into one body, moe perſones then one, alike well
qualifyed for the charge; yet no man will ſay, that theſe,
becauſe of their qualifications, become <hi>eo ipſo</hi> Monarchs,
nor can one create himſelfe; for what right and power hath
he more than his neighbour as wel qualified as he? Therefore
it muſt be granted that the People create the Magiſtrate, and
make this man King and not that man: Hence vve often read
in ſcriptures of the Peoples making Kings <hi>Iudg. 9: 6, I Sam.

               </p>
               <p>10. It is from the People that this way of election, and
not another is pitched upon: There being ſeveral wayes,
how in conſtituted Republiks, or Kingdomes, the Suprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Magiſtrates doe ſucceed to other: Some, at the death of
the former, ſucceed by way of free election, and he is choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
who poſſibly hath no relation to his predeceſſour; Some
are choſen, who are of the ſame family, but not as neareſt
in line, but at moſt fit to exerce the office of the Soveraigne,
as it was for a conſiderable time in <hi>Scotland;</hi> In ſome places
the neareſt in line, are choſen, if they be Males, as in
<hi>France,</hi> where, by the old Salicque Law, a Woman muſt not
command in chiefe; in other places the neareſt in line ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
whether Male of Female, as in <hi>

Now whence floweth this diverſity of wayes of inſtaling the
ſucceeding Magiſtrate, or of filling the place when vacant?
Doth it not flow alone from the People? Might they not
have pitched upon a way of conveyance of the Kingdome,
by lineal ſucceſſion, when they made choiſe of continual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection;
or when they pitched on that, might they not have
made choiſe of this? And who will ſay that a Supreame
Magiſtrate of Magiſtrates, choſen by election are not as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
Soveraigens, as theſe who came to the place by
lineal ſucceſſion ſeing by all politicians, Election is made
one of the ordinarie wayes of conſtituteing of Magiſtrates,
and by many, preferred to Succeſſion? And ſeing the firſt
of that Race had it by free election, he muſt be as eſſentially
and lawfully the Supreame Magiſtrate, as any of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours.</p>
               <p>11. Even where the way of lineal ſucceſſion is condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
upon and eſtablished, the new Soveraigne, though
he ſeem to be full and compleat heire, <hi>haeres ex aſſe,</hi> unto his
Father or Predeceſſour; Yet originally, and radically he is
conſtitute, and choſen by the People. For, whence
cometh it but from the Peoples free choiſe that ſuch a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
or line is choſen, and not another; and that the Eldeſt,
or neareſt in the line is made choiſe of as Succeſſour, and not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105606:64"/>
he, of that line, who is moſtly qualified for that place and
function? So that in this caſe the Son hath not his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from his Father; for he doth not ſucceed <hi>Iure haeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,

               </p>
               <p>12. In all this, the People muſt be ſuppoſed to have ſome
certane good End before their eyes: for a Rational People
muſt act rationally, and rationally they cannot act, unleſſe
they have before their eyes ſome certain good End; Now
this end which they Intend as men, muſt be their outward
Peace &amp; Tranquillity, freedome from oppreſſion from ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
or one from another, and the like; and as Chriſtians,
the glory of God, the good of Religion, and of their ſouls.
Therefore the People ſetteth Magiſtrates over themſelves, to
promove the glory of God, the good of Religion, and their
temporal felicity: And if they ſaw that this meane had not
a tendency unto theſe Ends, they would never have condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
upon it; far leſſe if they had ſeen that it had a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to deſtroy theſe Ends: and therefore, in ſo far as that meane
is preverted, and actually abuſed to the deſtruction of thoſe
high and noble Ends, they muſt be interpreted as Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
and <hi>eatenus de Iure,</hi> in no worſe condition, then they
would have been into if they had not erected ſuch a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſet ſuch over themſelves.</p>
               <p>It is like the <hi>Surveyer,</hi> will from ſome or all of theſe,
draw ſcuh Concluſions as he hath done from ſome innocent
expreſſions of <hi>Naphtaly</hi> ill underſtood by him, and as ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed;

or if able, a faithful maintainer of the Union and integrity of

contrary to the intent of the Author and ſtarteth queſtions <hi>in

<hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> falleth foule upon the <hi>Theſis</hi> which he ſuppoſeth
(without ground) vvas the intent and deſigne of the Author
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105606:65"/>
of <hi>Naphtali,</hi> and vvhich will be granted by all Politicians
and Lavvyers. Sure, as in this he hath shewed himſelf vveak
in his Politiks, ſo he hath bewrayed himſelf as weak in
his prudentials: and wiſe Stateſmen will think, that (to
uſe his owne expreſſions elſe where, or the like,) ſince he
raiſed the Devil, he should have laid him better then he
hath done, both in his firſt and in his third Chapter: and
ſome will think, that ſince he had no cleare cal to meddle
with thoſe queſtions, policy should have taught him either
to have forborne, or to have confuted them better; And
that for his very cauſe, he should be punished as an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Traitor, and his pamphlet condemned to a fire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is much more worthy, then ſeverals that have gote that
meaſure. But of his foolish and unfaire dealing in thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
we shall ſpeak more afterward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shall now
goe on &amp; draw ſome arguments for our purpoſe, from what
hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p>And 1. If People at the firſt erection of Government and
Governours, acted rationally, it can never be ſuppoſed that
they reſigned and gave their birth-privilege, and power of
ſelf-defence away, ſo as they might not lavvfully ſtand to
their ovvne defence, in caſes of neceſſity, vvhen that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of theſe Governours, should either come short of
giving the aſſiſtence expected in ſuch caſes, or prove lets
and impediments in their vvay, far leſſe in caſe they should
prove their avovved and open enemies: for is it imaginable
that national men would erect ſuch a Government, of ſet up
ſuch Governours, if it were told them that ſuch Would prove
their bane, and that by appointing of them, and proceeding
in that buſineſſe, they should denude themſelves of that power
of ſelf defence, vvhich novv they vvere in poſſeſſion of, See
<hi>Althuſ. Polit. Cap. 38. num. 32.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If by this conſtitution, they were not brutified, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
after the conſtitution, be ſuppoſed to be in a caſe worſe
then Brutes. Therefore Since Brutes may defend themſelves
againſt injuries, this liberty &amp; privilege of ſelf defence,
againſt manifeſt injuries, cannot be taken away from Ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Creatures, by the erection of a Government. Againe, if
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105606:65"/>
by the erection, and new conſtitution, the caſe of the people
cannot be ſuppoſed to be made worſe, if it was, lawfull unto
them before, to defend themſelves againſt injuries, and to
repel violence with violence, it cannot become unlawful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward:
it is true, it is the part of the Magiſtrate to defend
them from injuries, and for this end, was he ſet up by them,
that they might be the more ſecure and ſaife, but it he neglect
his duty, they are not to forget themſelves, or to thinke
that their hands are bound up; much leſſe, if he himſelf turne
an enemie unto them.</p>
               <p>3. If the Erected Magiſtrates remaine men, and ſinful
men, and men that can do wrong and violence and injuſtice,
can oppreſſe innocents, deſtroy, pillage, plunder, kill and
perſecute unjuſtly: Then the innocents may no leſſe defend
themſelves againſt their violence, injuries, oppreſſions,
murthers, &amp;c. then againſt the violence, oppreſſions, and
injuries of others: for the wrongs and injuries they do, are
as reall wrongs &amp; injuries (and in ſome reſpect greater) as the
wrongs and injuries committed by others. Therefore the
People are ſtill allowed to uſe their privilege of ſelf defence
even againſt them, and their unjuſt violence, in caſes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
as wel as againſt others</p>
               <p>4. If it was of the People that this forme of Government,
and not another was pitched upon and made choiſe of, no
man in reaſon can thinke, that their condition should be worſe
under that forme, then under any other, ſince they acting
rationally, made choiſe of that, as the beſt and moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
and conduceable to their ends; But that that forme
should be every was as much for their peace, ſaifty, welfare,
and ſecurity, as any other, ought no more to binde up
their hands from neceſſary ſelf defence, when urged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by inevitable neceſſity, then if they were free from under
that forme.</p>
               <p>5. If it was of the Peoples owne accord, that they aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
with ſuch of ſuch, without any previous determination
of Nature, neceſſitating them thereunto. Then it is rational
to inferre that their aſſociation with ſuch, should not be to
their detriment and manifeſt hurt, nor should it incapacitate
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105606:66"/>
them for doing that in their owne defence, which, before
that aſſociation and combination, they were allowed to do.
So that if the equal half, major or minor part, should lye by,
and refuſe to concurre with the reſt in their neceſſary defence,
Thoſe who deſire to ſtand to their owne defence, and repel
violence with violence, are not, in poynt of conſcience, juſtly
reſtrained or bound up. If the equal half, or major or minor
part of an army, betray the cauſe, or revolt to the Enemy,
the honeſt party will be allowed in poynt of Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and Valour, to ſtand to the cauſe, and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Countrey to the laſt man, yea even though
the General himſelf should become a Head unto that revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
party.</p>
               <p>6. If it was in the Peoples power to limite the time defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
or indefinitly, how long ſuch a forme should continue,
and therefore had power (as Politicians will readily grant)
to change that forme, when the neceſſity of their condition
did require it: Sure it cannot be repugnant to Reaſon to ſay,
That the People have ſtill a power to defend themſelves from
the manifeſt injuries, and intolerable oppreſſion of that
forme, or of theſe who are exerceing in that forme. If a
people may lawfully change a forme of Government, when
it becometh intolerably grievous, and not only not conduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the good of the Commonwealth, but clearly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
tending to its deſtruction, they may be leſſe (if not
more) lawfully defend themſelves againſt the manifeſt and
intolerable injuries thereof. Yea even in caſe they had by
vowes or engagements ſo bound up their hands that they
could not alter the forme; it were not rational to thinke that
their caſe should therefore be irremediably the worſe, but
that rather God and Nature would allow them in that caſe,
ſo much the more to make uſe of their primaeve privilege of
ſelf defence, becauſe they could not uſe their power of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the forme, for their ſecurity and ſaifty, as otherwiſe they
might have done.</p>
               <p>7. If the People make Magiſtrates, and ſet them over
themſelves, then, though it were yeelded (which yet lawyers
and politicians not a few will not grant, ſee <hi>Althuſ. pol. cap. 38.)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105606:66"/>
n. 35.</hi> where he proveth it by <hi>l. nemo qui 37. de reg. jur. l 6. ſolent
de offic. proconſ. l. 3. de re. jud. novel 15. de. ef. civ. c. 1 §. 1.</hi>) that
they had no power to depoſe them againe in caſe of male-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
and abuſeing the power to the deſtruction of
the Commonwealth; yet) it will undenyably follow, that
the people may defend themſelves againſt their manifeſt iy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and oppreſſion: for, it wil be granted that a People
have more power, in creating a Magiſtate then in making a
Miniſter; and it will be granted likwayes, that if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter;
turne heretical, and preach atheiſme, Mahumeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,
or the like, the People, though they could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
depoſe him, or, through the corruption of the
times, could not get him depoſed by theſe who had power,
yet they might lawfully guard themſelves from his unſound
doctirne, and defend their ſouls from his haereſie by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing:
and if he should uſe violence to force them to heare
him, &amp; acknowledg him as an orthodox teacher, they might
repel violence with violence, and peremptorily maintaine
the Truth.</p>
               <p>8. If it was from the People, That ſuch a way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of the Magiſtratical power, was condeſcended on,
ſo that when they pitched on this, they might have choſen
any other; Then (as Lawyers will grant) they have ſtill
power to alter the ſame as neceſſity requireth, much more
then have they power to defend themſelves, againſt the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
thereof: and if either at the firſt conſtitution or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
ſomething interveened which laid ſuch a reſtraint
upon them, that they could not change that manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance,
then ſo much the more are they allowed to defend
themſelves from the tyranny thereof, by recurring, in caſes
of neceſſity, unto their primaeve privilege, and this inward
wall and bulwark ought to be the more fortified, that they
want their outter fortifications.</p>
               <p>9. If even where the conveyance runeth in a line, the
Succeſſour cannot pretend to more dominion over the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
then his Predeceſſours had, and the People cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
be ſuppoſed to be in a worſe condition under the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour,
then they were under his Predeceſſour, ſeing he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105606:67"/>
holdeth the place, not <hi>jure haereditario;</hi> but <hi>jure legali</hi> or <hi>jure
conſtitutionis:</hi> and therefore if they might lawfully reſiſt the
unjuſt violence of his Predeceſſour, or of the Firſt in the
Line; no man, in reaſon can deny it lawful for them to reſiſt
his tyranny, who cometh to that place by vertue of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
conſtitution: and no otherwayes.</p>
               <p>10. If upon pregnant conſiderations, and for good, lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
and neceſſary ends, the People erected a civil ſtate, and
ſuch a forme of Government, and ſuch Governours to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to other in ſuch a manner of way, as the apparent and
probable meane, for the ſure, ſaife, ſpeedy and moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
way of attaineing theſe ends. It were irrational to
think that being diſappoynted of their expectations and
fruſtrated of their hopes, of attaineing the deſired ends by
ſuch meanes, They were in an irremediable caſe, and had
no meane left them of attaineing theſe neceſſary ends, no
not ſo much, as that pure product of Nature, ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and power to repel force with force. No man
will ſay, but that a People are looſed from their obligation
to uſe ſuch meanes which they formerly pitched upon for
theſe neceſſary and important Ends, when i they not only
prove not uſeful, as meanes for attaineing of theſe ends, but
prove deſtructive, and ſtand in contra-oppoſition there unto;
and in this caſe, muſt be ſuppoſed, to have the ſame liberty
to uſe ſuch meanes as they were allowed to uſe in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meve
ſtate, that is, to joyne together and aſſociate, the
beſt way they can, for repelling of what deſtroyeth theſe
noble and important Ends, and defend their Religion, Lives
and Libertyes.</p>
               <p>But it may be the <hi>Surveyer,</hi> or ſome for him will ſay. That
all this is nothing to the purpoſe; becauſe, The ſtate of our
government and conſtitution is of a diſtinct and far different
nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to this, (reſerving what is further to be ſpoken
on that ſubject unto the next chapter, where we shall ſpeak
of the obligation of the Soveraigne unto the People) theſe
things ſeeme cleare and undenyable. 1. That before <hi>Fergus</hi>
the firſt, was choſen by the People, to be their King and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105606:67"/>
Chiftane, there were a people living in <hi>Scotland,</hi> manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their owne matters, the beſt way they could. 2. While
they were in this condition, we heare on none among them,
however poſſibly excelling others in wealth, power, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and ſuch like enduements, that took upon them the
Soveraignity, otherwayes <hi>Fergus</hi> had not been the firſt King.
3. When they thought of ſending for <hi>Fergus,</hi> and of making
him King, they were not acted as beaſts, but went rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to work, conſidering their preſent hazard from their
adverſaries, and the advantage they would have by ſetting
ſuch over themſelves, and erecting a ſtablished policy.
4. After the conſtitution and erection of the Kingdome,
they remained rational creatures, ſenſible of injuries done
unto them, whether by their Kings or others, as after expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
manifeſted. 5. Nor did their Kings, after their
election, become Angels, or Creatures above their reach,
but for male-adminiſtration, oppreſſion or tyranny, were
made to know they were Men, as ſubject to erring and
doing wrong, ſo to examination, tryal, and condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for their injuries done to the Commonwealth.
6. When they condeſcended upon <hi>Monarchy,</hi> though, as
matters then ſtood, they ſaw it moſt for their advantage to
have a King; yet none vvill ſay, but they might, notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of that exigent, have choſen an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> for a
ſtanding forme of government. 7. When they compacted
themſelves into a diſtinct body, and ſeparated both from
the <hi>Picts</hi> and from the <hi>Britones,</hi> they might, had they ſeen it
for their advantage, either joyned vvith the <hi>Picts</hi> or <hi>Britones,</hi>
and made one firme Commonvvealth vvith them; or have
divided themſelves into tvvo or moe diſtinct Bodyes, and
diſtinct Republiks, as they had ſeen it convenient: No
previous neceſſity, ſave that they ſavv if for their only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to do as they did, conſtraining them to the one
more then to the other. 8. When they made choiſe of a
King, they might, if they had ſeen it good, preſcribed
the time how long that Government should have endured,
whether until the death of <hi>Fergus,</hi> or hovv long there after.
9. When they made choiſe of <hi>Fergus,</hi> vvho then vvas in <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:105606:68"/>
and ſent for him, they might (without any injury
done to any man) have choſen any other, they had thought
moſt for their advantage; and before they made choiſe of
him, He could challenge no power or authority, over
them, nor could He be accounted their King; and when
they made choiſe of him and made him their King, then,
and not till then, was he their King. 10. It was in their
power to have named<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>ergus</hi> without his ſucceſſours by line,
and ſo have reſerved power to themſelves, to chooſe of new
another after his death: and though they did include his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours
by line; yet their after practiſe declared, that they
had liberty to chooſe the fitteſt of the family, when the
neareſt in the line, was not judged fit for government, which
cuſtome continued above a Thowſand yeers, till the dayes
of <hi>Kenneth</hi> the third: 11. And, when it afterward came
to a lineal conſtant ſucceſſion, The ſone had no right but
by the conſtitution condeſcended on, in the dayes of this
<hi>Kenneth.</hi> 12. That in all theſe reſolutions and conſtitutions
they levelled at nothing, but their owne good and ſaifty is
body and ſoul, is beyond contradiction. And finally,
their after practices did declare that they looked not upon
themſelves, as rendered incapable by all thoſe foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
reſolutions, to defend themſelves againſt manifeſt and
unjuſt violence, even of the King and his followers; though
this <hi>Surveyer Pag.</hi> 78. accounts theſe <hi>nothing but the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

inſtances of the peoples reſerving power to themſelves,

               <head type="sub">Of the Covenant betwixt King and

               <p>IT is no great wonder to ſee this <hi>Surveyer</hi> labouring, to free
the King from any covenant-obligation unto his Subjects;
when he and his party have proclaimed him exempted from
his Covenant-obligation unto God: and ſince the have
put both conſciences and wit upon the rack, to finde out
ſome plauſible grounds of evaſion, that the King may be
free from the Covenant, which he ſwore with hands lifted up
to the Moſt High God oftener then once; with which,
however they may ſatisfy ſuch as love licentiouſneſſe,
and to live above God's Law, as well as man's; yet God
will not be ſo deceived, let men dream what they will; it
should be no matter of aſtonishment to us, to ſee them uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shifts whereby to bring the King from under any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
tye unto his Subjects: But it might ſeem ſtrange to
us (if we knew not the Men) that when lawyers and
polititians tell us, that the King, is abſolutely bound unto
his Subjects, and the People, obliged unto the King condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally,
ſee <hi>Hoenonius, diſp. polit. 2.</hi> and <hi>Iunius Brutus vindiciae
contra Tyrannos quaeſt. 3.</hi> and <hi>Althuſ. pol. c. 20. n. 3. 21. &amp;
cap. 38. n. 30.</hi> They on the contrary should averre, that
the people were abſolutly bound unto the King, &amp; the King
not only not tyed conditionally, but not at all, unto the
People.</p>
               <p>But, from what was ſaid in the preceeding chapter, it wil
clearly follow, That when a people do inſtitute a Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and do commit the Supreame Managment of affaires
unto one or more, They do it upon certane tearmes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
which conditions, polititians ordinarily call <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
lawes,</hi> others think that name not proper enough,
but whether we call them ſo, or call them tearmes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the conſtitution of compact, it is all one thing.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105606:69"/>
That there are certane tearmes and conditions on which the
Soveraigne is choſen, is cleare from theſe grounds. 1. The
man who is made Soveraigne by the People, can pretend no
right to the Soveraignity, (as was shewed before) until he
be named and choſen by the People. And this conſtituting
of him Soveraigne, muſt be by compact and contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and them; for ſuch mutual relations, as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Prince and People, can ariſe from no other act then
a compact, unleſſe they ſay, it ariſeth from a free dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but then they muſt grant that the whole power cometh
from the People, and was theirs before and might be given
out by them, or not, as they thought fit; for no law can
conſtraine a man to give a gift: &amp; further, if it was from them
by free gift, the very nature and end of that Donation puts
it beyond debate that it was upon ſome valueable conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of which when fruſtrated, they might recal their
donation; and ſo ſtill it will be, a virtual compact. But
now it being by a real comapct and formal, either ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plicite
or implicite, that this man and not that man is
made Soveraigne, There muſt be ſome conditions on
which this mutual compact ſtandeth: for a compact cannot
be vvithout conditions. 2. We shevv that in this Act of
conſtituting a Government ad Governours, the People acted
rationally; and carryed themſelves in this buſineſſe, not as
irrational brutes, but as rational men; and if ſo, hovv is it
imaginable that they vvould ſet any over them vvith an illi
mited povver, vvithout any tearmes and conditions to be
condeſcended unto by him? Would rational men, acting
deliberatly about a matter of ſuch moment and conſequence,
not to themſelves alone, but to their poſterity in after ages,
ſet a Soveraigne over them, vvithout any limitations, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or reſtrictions, ſo as they might rob, ſpoile, plund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
murther, deflore, do acts of injuſtice and oppreſſion,
and act tyranny as they pleaſed? 3. We shew that in this
matter; the People had certane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> real, good and neceſſary
Ends before them: now, can it enter into the heart of any
man to think, that Rational men acting rationally, &amp; laying
downe wayes for attaineing good aud neceſſary Ends, would
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105606:69"/>
ſet a Prince over themſelves, without any conditions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions;
ſince otherwiſe they could not rationally expect,
that the meane which they had condeſcended upon, could
ever attaine the End? For every one of them might ſaifly
have judged of the Prince by themſelves, and ſeing they
might have found in themſelves, an inclination to domineer,
to oppreſſe and tyrannize over others, they might rationally
have concluded that the Prince was, and would be but a
Man of the ſame pasſions and infirmities with themſelves,
and ſo as ready, if not more, to deborde and to do wrong:
&amp; therefore unleſse they had made him Soveraigne upon
tearmes and conditions, they could not have expected that
their chooſeing of him, could have been a meane fitted and
accommodated for attaining the Ends propoſed: A Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
left at liberty to tyrannyze, to oppreſse and to deſtroy
the Subject, is no fit meane to procure their welfare, either
in ſoul or body, or to ſet forward the glory of God. 4. We
shew that their condition after the conſtitution, was not to
be worſe then it was before the conſtitution. But if they had
ſet up a Soveraigne without any conditions, their condition
could not but be worſe; and rational men could not but for
ſee that their condition would, of necesſity, be worſe; for,
to ſet up a Soveraigne without conditions, is to ſet up a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
ſince if they do not limite him to termes and conditions,
they give him leave to Rule as he liſteth, and his will muſt
be to them for a law; and what is that but to ſet up a Tyrant;
and if a Tyrant be ſet up over a People, shall not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in that caſe, be worſe then when they were at liberty
to manage, their owne matters, as they could beſt?</p>
               <p>Moreover this may be cleared from other reaſons, as
1. In all other relations, which ariſe from mutual conſent,
and compact, there are alwayes, tearmes &amp; conditions on
which the contract or compact is concluded: as in the contract
betwixt Man and Wife, Maſter and Servant, Tutor &amp; Pupil,
Maſter &amp; Scholer, &amp; the like, Here alwayes are preſuppoſed
tearms &amp; conditions, on which the compact, the only fundation
of theſe relations, is founded: for, no Man marryeth a
wife, but upon condition, she carry as a dutyfull wife,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105606:70"/>
and no woman maryeth a Husband but upon the like tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
So a Maſter indenteth with his Servant, and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
bindeth himſelf to him, upon tearmes. The Tutor,
is under obligations to his Pupil, and if he break ſuch or
ſuch conditions, he loſeth his benefite, and moreover is
anſwerable as law wil. So is the Maſter obliged to performe
ſuch and ſuch conditions unto his Scholer, So are there
conditions betwixt the <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Vaſſals,</hi> and betwixt <hi>Paſtor
and People.</hi> 2. This will be cleare from the Nature of that
power and authority, which the Soveraigne hath over the
Subjects, of which afterward. 3. It is againſt Nature, to
ſet up any Tyrant, or one who is free from all conditions;
for, that were, upon the matter, to ſet up a Waſter, an
Enemy to the Commonwealth, a bloody Tyger or Lyon,
to deſtroy all: ſee <hi>Althuſ. Pol c. 19. n, 33. 35. 36. 37. 4.</hi> To ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
a King free of conditions unto his Subjects is to put
them in among <hi>bona fortunae:</hi> and to ſay, they are as the King's
gold, his sheep, his oxen, his lands and revenues, unto
which, he ſtandeth no way obliged. 5. If a People should
ſet a Soveraigne over them, without conditions, they
should ſin againſt the Law of God, which vvill have ſuch
and ſuch dutyes performed by them, vvho are Soveraignes;
and they, by ſetting up Soveraignes vvithout theſe limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
should ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch and ſuch shall be our Soveraignes,
contrare to the limitations of God's Law. 6. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the practice of all Nations, where a free People
ſet up Soveraignes: It is alwayes upon tearmes and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
They <hi>Perſians</hi> (as <hi>Xenophon lib. 8. Cyri Paed.</hi> tell us)
did thus Covenante with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that he should ſend aide to
them, out of his owne Countrey, if any should warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, or violate their lawes; and they againe did
promiſe, that they should helpe him, if any would not
obey him, defending his Countrey; and therefore <hi>Xenophon</hi>
calleth this contract or compact <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So the <hi>Spartan King</hi>
(as the ſame <hi>Xenophon</hi> tells us, <hi>de Rep. Laced:</hi>) did every Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Renew their oath unto the <hi>Ephori,</hi> &amp; promiſed to governe
them according to the lawes of the land, &amp; the <hi>Ephori</hi> upon the
other hand, promiſed to Eſtablish the Kingdom in their hands.
We reade of a compact betwixt <hi>Romulus,</hi> and the people

are made betwixt King and People, at the coronation
of <hi>Kings</hi> in <hi>England, France, Boheme, Spaine, Portugal, Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

doth ſufficiently confirme this, of which more,
when we conſider what this <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſayeth to the contrary.
8. Lawyers, Polititians &amp; Divines tell us, that there are ſuch
conditions condeſcended on in all free Republicks. <hi>Hoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Diſp. Pol. 2. Theſ. 4.</hi> tells us that the Subjects do ſtipulate
from the Magiſtrates, whether they will rule ſo as they may
lead a peacable and quyet life under them, and <hi>Theſ. 5.</hi> that
the Magiſtrates do abſolutely promiſe; and the Subjects
upon condition promiſe what is their duty. So <hi>Althuſius
cap. 38. Polit. n. 31.</hi> and <hi>cap. 19. n. 15. 23. 29.</hi> and <hi>Timplerus
Polit. Lib. 2. Cap. 1. Quest. 5.</hi> proveth that there is a mutual
obligation betwixt Magiſtrates and Subjects. See likewiſe
<hi>Gerhard de Magiſtratu, Theſ. 94. Pag. 726.</hi> Where he proveth
that it is no new thing, That Magiſtrates and Subjects do
Covenante with each other.</p>
               <p>Finally, This is cleared, from ſome Scripture inſtances, as
firſt The Covenant, which <hi>David</hi> made with the Tribes of
<hi>Iſrael, 2 Sam. 5. 3. 1 Chron. 11. 3. So all the elders of Iſrael
came to the King to Hebron, and King David made a league with
them in Hebron before the Lord, and they anoynted David King
over Iſrael. Sanches</hi> on the place thinketh, He promiſed to
rule them according to the law <hi>Deut. 17 15.</hi> and that ſome
other things were contained in that Covenant, which did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the preſent ſtate of a affaires, as concerning the war with
their near and inſolent enemies, concerning an act of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion,
and other things, which they could think upon, in
that troubleſome ſtate of affaires: and upon the other hand
the People promiſed fidelity and obedience, and what
elſe is required in well conſtituted Commonwealths; and
that this Covenant was ſealed by oath of both parties] <hi>Cornel
a Lap:</hi> calleth it a mutual promiſe, wherein David Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105606:71"/>
to governe the Kingdome faithfully, according to
the law of God <hi>Leut. 17. 16. &amp;c.</hi> &amp;. <hi>Iſrael,</hi> on the other hand,
promiſed to be obedient and faithful to him: The <hi>Surveyer</hi>
tryeth many shifts to make this, no mutual Covenant, or
conditional Covenant <hi>Pag. 94. 95.</hi> He cannot deny but
there was a Covenant here agreed upon, betwixt <hi>David</hi> and
theſe Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But he ſayes [the Quaeſtion is, what
was the nature, the matter and import of that Covenant,
The Scripture ſayes not it was ſuch a Covenant (as theſe
men would have it) I shall rule you rightly, if you obey me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifully,
otherwiſe not (upon the King's part) and (upon
the peoples part) we shall obey you and be ſubject to you,
if ye rule us rightly, otherwiſe we will not, but uſe our
coactive power upon you, to dethrone, and deſtroy you,
and punish you.] <hi>Anſ.</hi> If it be granted that here was a
mutual contract, wherein the King accepted of conditions
and obliged himſelf thereunto, it is enough for our preſent
purpoſe, (&amp; the Dutch Annotators on 2 <hi>Sam. 5. 3.</hi> ſay hereby
they were bound on both ſides by oath, to performe their
dutyes to other) for we are not yet ſpeaking of the nature
and import of ſuch Covenants, and what right or power the
party keeping, hath over the party failing. 2. The Text
doth not tell us what was the particular matter of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
but from the Text, we may clearly ſee, that this
was a conditional Covenant, a Covenant wherein the King
promiſed ſuch and ſuch things, as ſatiſfied them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
them to accept of him as King, and anoynt him: ſo
that if the tearmes had not pleaſed them, they would not
have accepted of him as King, If the King had ſaid, I will
be an Abſolute Prince to account you ſtill mine Enemies,
and kill ſuch of you, as I will, and keep a live ſuch of you
as I will, and ſo play the Tyrant, be like he had gote the
anſwere that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> gote <hi>To your tents <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Iſrael: What portion
have we in David?</hi> 3. How can he prove, That they did
not minde to offer themſelves to <hi>David</hi> upon ſuch tearmes,
[<hi>They</hi> (ſayes he <hi>Pag. 95</hi>) <hi>recognoſe, his right of reigning over
them is of the Lord, and that he was not ſubjecte to be removed by
them, for they ſay</hi> The Lord ſayd to thee, thou shalt feed my
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105606:71"/>
people Iſrael, and thou shalt be Ruler over them, <hi>and it is
added Therefore they came, &amp;c.</hi>] <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. All this will not
prove that this Covenant was not conditional, or that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
did not oblige himſelf to ſuch and ſuch conditions; for
if theſe reaſons have any force, they will as well ſay, that
they should not have made a Covenant with him it all, but
ſubmitted without Covenant: and they knew his right by
promiſe to the throne, before this, and yet for all that, they
refuſed to come till now, and now when they come, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
muſt make a Covenant with them. 2. The ſame Tribes
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did recognoſce <hi>Rehoboam's</hi> right to reigne; for they
came to <hi>Shechem</hi> to make him King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>1 King. 12. 1. 2. Chron. 10.

                     </gap>boam</hi> would not agree unto the tearmes
propoſed, They refuſed to acknowledg him King. 3. That
<hi>1 Chron. 11. 3. Therefore came</hi> is but the ſame with <hi>So came,
2 Sam. 5. 3.</hi> and it may be as well rendered, <hi>alſo</hi> or <hi>and came,</hi>
for in the Original it is in both places <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and it is there
told, that <hi>alſo</hi> the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came, who were not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before. 4. Gods promiſe to <hi>David,</hi> gave him no
power to play the Tyrant, nor was it to be fulfilled but ſuch
a way, God's purpoſes concerning the End includeth the
Meanes with the End, and his purpoſe or promiſe was not
that <hi>David</hi> should obtaine the throne without the Peoples
conſent, or that the People was obliged to ſubmit unto him
notwithſtanding he should refuſe to Covenant with them,
or promiſe to Rule them in righteouſneſſe, and not to play
the Tyrant over them: and hence it appeareth that it is not
falſe that the People gave the Kingdome to <hi>David</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
(as he ſayeth <hi>Pag. 101.</hi>) for, if He ſay theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
or purpoſes of God, did lay obligations of the People
to accept Such upon any tearmes, he cannot condemne the
Ten Trybes for accepting of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> as he doth elſwhere!
5. As for their coactive ſuperiority over him, we ſpeake
not of it now, it not being our preſent buſineſſe, but ſure
his reaſons will not validely conclude the contrair: for if ſuch
a promiſe or purpoſe of God, gave <hi>David</hi> ſuch a right, as
that in no caſe, ſuppoſe he had turned the greateſt Tyrant
imaginable, &amp; had ſold the Land of Canaan unto the Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105606:72"/>
or done ſome ſuch thing; the Elders of Iſrael had
had no coercive power to have with-ſtood him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned
him, then they might not now have refuſed to
have ſubmitted unto him: And by the ſame reaſon,
The elders of Iſrael might not have refuſed to have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>Iero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oam</hi> who alſo had a promiſe, which I know
he will not grant. But it is enough to our preſent purpoſe,
if it be granted that <hi>David</hi> agreed with them upon tearmes.
This he cannot get well denyed, but ſayeth. [<q>All the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
that can be ſuppoſed here, is upon the peoples part,
an engagement to humble ſubjection and homage; &amp; upon
the Kings part, a Covenant of indempnity for former oppoſitions
to him, wherein they had need to be comfortably ſecured.</q>]
<hi>Anſ.</hi> If it was ſuch a Covenant, then it ſecured all
the People of Iſrael, and their Elders with them, and
<hi>David</hi> was bound to have keeped it, and did keep it.
He did not then execute thereafter ſome of them upon ſcafſolds,
and ſet up their heads upon poles, as Traitours. 2.
We finde nothing in the Text, of their acknowledging a
crime done, ſo as they needed an act of indempnity: it is
like <hi>David</hi> in a piece of holy policy, meet for that time,
to gather together the ſcattered people of God, (to uſe the
<hi>Surveyer's</hi> words, <hi>Pag. 94.</hi>) Would have been content to
have paſſed an act of oblivion, as leſſe irritateing, then an
act of indempnity. 3. If they were now coming to be his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
who were not ſo before, but were under another King (as
he ſayes himſelf <hi>Pag. 94.</hi>) what neceſſity was there, either for an
act of indempnity or yet an act of oblivion? Ay [<q>but it was fit
<hi>(ſayes he ibid</hi> to give them ſecurity, touching his good minde
toward them, they having ſo long ſtood it out, in armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him.</q>] <hi>Anſ.</hi> But was there no more requiſite to ſecure
them touching his good minde towards them, and his will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſſe
to accept of them as ſubjects, who before were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies,
except this act of indempnity? Since they were in
open hoſtility one againſt another, and if upon this ground,
the Covenant on <hi>David's</hi> part was of indempnity, why should
it not be alſo a Covenant of indempnity on their part; ſeing,
as he confeſſed, they were not his ſubjects before, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105606:72"/>
another King? But now, when they come to bee ſubjects
who were not ſo before, and engage to humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and homage, muſt not David in this Covenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadge
to ſomething correſponding to this? <q>we shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
(<hi>ſayeth he</hi>) if it be called a Covenant both of protection
&amp; right ruleing them.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is all I am ſeeking, to
have <hi>David</hi> here obliged by Covenant, unto his Subjects, to
ſuch and ſuch tearmes, as to Protect and Rule them a right.
Ay but he adds [<q>Yet ſo, as not ſubjecting himſelf to their
cenſures, or co-action, or that they should be his ſubjects
only upon that condition, being otherwiſe free to fall upon
him.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not to our preſent buſineſſe. But yet
how can he prove this? Is it enough to ſay ſo? Will his
adverſary take that for an anſwere? Is there not here a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Convenant, wherein each party is bound to other? Are
not the tearmes condeſcended upon? And is it not granted
by all, that in mutual Covenants the obſerver hath <hi>a jus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the breakers? But ſayes he [<q>a Covenant may be to
mutual dutyes, &amp; yet on neither ſide conditional, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
eath party obligeing themſelves to their owne duty
abſolutely, but not on condition that the other party do their
duty.</q>] <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then it ſeemes <hi>Iſrael</hi> was bound to <hi>David,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would be a King to them or not; Yea even though
he would ſell them to morrow to the Philiſtines for ſlaves
and bond men for ever, and <hi>David</hi> was bound to Protect and
Rule them a right, whether they would be Subjects or not.
2. How can he prove that this was ſuch a Covenant?
3. Yea, how can he prove that there is any ſuch Covenant
among men; or how can he explaine ſuch a Covenant? [As if
<q>(<hi>ſayes he)</hi> a man bind himſelf by oath, to give me one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
pounds, &amp; I bind my ſelf againe by oath to him, to
give him one hundereth pounds, without conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
that he pay me the money he promiſed me; albeit he
should fail in his oath, &amp; not pay me; yet muſt not I fail
in mine but muſt pay him: becauſe my oath is ſeparate from
his &amp; independent upon it, and hath a ſeparate obligation
abſolute, which no faileing of the other party to me, can
looſe]</q> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true <hi>manus manum fricat,</hi> and if this <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:105606:73"/>
give to one a hundereth pounds. He will know it is
for an hundereth pounds againe, or ſomething better: and I
wish he should think himſelf as wel bound by his oath, to
pay the thing, he promiſed to God abſolutely, as he thinks
he is bound to pay to man what he had promiſed abſolutely.
But to our buſineſſe, what ſort of mutual Covenants can thoſe
be, which he here ſpeaketh of? We hear to Pactions or
Covenants where there are promiſes without a ſtipulation,
but of a Covenant or Paction betwixt two, concerning mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
duties to be performed by each to other, wherein there
is no ſtipulation, or which is no conditional Covenant, I
have not yet heard. 2. Where heare we that ſuch a transaction
(if it can have that name) wherein one perſon promiſeth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
to another to give him ſuch or ſuch a ſumme of
money; and that other perſon againe promiſeth abſolutely
to give to the firſt another ſumme, is called a Covenant?
3. Lawyers tell us that even <hi>Promiſſiones,</hi> promiſes, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and not mere Policitations, wil give <hi>a jus</hi> a right unto
the perſon, to whom they are made to call for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and ſue the promiſer at Law: And if this be
granted (as it cannot be denyed) he will loſe his cauſe:
For when the queſtion cometh betwixt the Magiſtrate and
the Subjects, it is the ſame caſe, as when the queſtion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
betwixt two diſtinct Nations: For as there is not a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Judge over both Nations to determine the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy;
ſo nor is there a Superiour ordinary Judge to decide
the queſtion that falleth out betwixt King and Subjects: And
therefore, as the ſword muſt determine it, in the one caſe, ſo
in the other. 4. But how shall he evince that the Covenant,
betwixt King &amp; People is not a reciprocal contract of things
to be done by each to other upon conditions? It is true,
he tells us that ſubjection is not promiſed to Kings conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
but abſolutely; but in ſo ſaying, he doth onely beg
the queſtion. A better Polititian then he, <hi>Althuſius Polit. c. 19.
num. 6, 7.</hi> calleth it a mutual compact betwixt Prince and
People upon certaine conditions, and calleth it <hi>Contractum
mandati,</hi> and he tells us, that in this contract the Prince is a
<hi>Mandataruis,</hi> and his obligation preceedeth as the obligation
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105606:73"/>
of the <hi>Mandatarius</hi> and promiſer, uſeth to do, and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the obligation of the People <hi>ſecundum naturam man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dati,</hi>
whereby they promiſe obedience and fidelity to him
governing the Commonwealth according to the conditions
preſcribed.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture inſtance is <hi>2 King. 11: v. 17. 2 Chron. 23: v. 3. 16.</hi>
where <hi>Iehojadah</hi> made a Covenant betwixt the King
and the People, which (as the English Annotators and the
Dutch alſo on the place ſay) was a civil Covenant betwixt
them, viz. That the King should governe then well, They
should obey him in the Lord. <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> alſo ſayeth that
[not only King and People covenanted with God; but the
King alſo with the People; and the People with the King]
and thereafter that [the King was bound to rule the People
according to the Lawes, &amp; equity, <hi>Secundum Iura &amp; Leges,</hi>
and the People promiſed to obey him.] [<hi>Zanches</hi> more fully
tells us, there was a Covenant betwixt the King and the
People, as uſes to be betwixt the Prince and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths:
The Prince undertaketh to defend the Kingdome,
Lawes, Equity, and to be a keeper and defender of the
Countrey, and of Religion: And upon the other hand,
People promiſe obedience, and fidelity and ſuch expenſes, as
are neceſſary for keeping up the Majeſty of the Prince, &amp;c.]
Now what ſayes our <hi>Surveyer</hi> to this? He tells us <hi>Pag. 96.</hi> That
it was alſo made upon an extraordinary occaſion; &amp; extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaryes
cannot ſound ordinary rules] <hi>Anſw.</hi> How doth he
prove that it was meerly upon the extraordinaryneſſe of the
occaſion that this Covenant was made? he might as well ſay
that the crowning of him, &amp; giving him the teſtimony, &amp;
making him King, and making a Covenant betwixt the Lord
and the King, were extraordinary, and ſo could not found ordinary rules: yea and that it was extraordinary for the
People to ſweare allegiance unto him. But he hath two
things remarkable to his purpoſe as [<q>1. That he is crowned
&amp; made King before the Covenant is made, which croſſeth
the antimonarchiſts, who aſſert, the King cannot be made
King, until he make the Covenant with the People, &amp; that
he gets the crowne and royal authority covenant wiſe, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105606:74"/>
conditionally]</q> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Antimonarchiſts properly ſo called,
are againſt all Monarchs limited or abſolute, or doth he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
them all antimonarchiſts who ſay that the King is a
limited Magiſtrate? then we know what to think of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchiſts
and Royaliſts, of him and his party. 2. He
knoweth himſelf that the ſeries or order of the relation of a
complex buſineſſe, is not alwayes juſt according to the ſeries
of the things done; but be it ſo, this maketh for us in the
former inſtance of <hi>David's</hi> Covenanting with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Which
is mentioned, before their making of him King. 3. But
ſuppoſe the King had refuſed to enter into Covenant with
the Lord, or with the People (for mention is made of both
Covenants after his Coronation) might they not for all their
ſolemnities in crowning of him, have refuſed to have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him, as King? 4. But to put the matter beyond all
debate, we finde, compareing the two places together,
That beſide the Covenant betwixt <hi>Iehojadah,</hi> and the Rulers
of Hundereds &amp;c. mentioned 2. <hi>King. 11. 4,</hi> and 2 <hi>Chron. 23. 1.</hi>
which was rather a Covenant betwixt themſelves, to depoſe

their condition had been better under his reigne then under
<hi>Athaliah,</hi> be like they had never reſolved to have ventured
their lives, and eſtates for him: and if the Covenant had not
been conditional, they could have had no rational expectation
of the bettering of their condition from the young King,
Againe, if it was not a conditional Covenant. The King could
with no more certainty have expected their dutyful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
then They his faithful government. 3. It is true, the
matter and tenor of the Covenant is not expreſſed; but the
nature of the act, doth abundantly cleare what it was, and
that it was ſuch as the English annotators have expreſſed. 4.
If <hi>Diodat</hi> ſay it was nothing elſe, but the Peoples ſwearing
allegiance, he ſpeaketh without ground, for it was a mutual
Covenant, a Covenant betwixt King and People, But ſayes

not more in this, then in crowning and making of Kings

and fish out from thence the oath of allegaince,
we muſt then ſay that they will alſo, clearly ſuppoſe on oath of
the King unto the People, by which he is bound to them
as wel as they are bound to him. He granteth that ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

obedience given to their Kings, and where ever we finde
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105606:76"/>
that the people ſwore an oath or Covenant to the King, there
we finde that the king ſwore and Covenanted to them: and ſo
the Covenant being mutual, he was bound unto conditions
as well as they were, and They no more then He. And if
Their chooſeing and ſetting up of a King, did virtually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
their engagement to him; ſo did His accepting of the
place virtually lay bonds on him, to acquieſce unto the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare

               </p>
               <p>Thus we have cleared. 1. That lawful Magiſtrates are
admitted to their Thrones conditionally, upon ſuch and ſuch
tearmes. And from what we have ſaid, it is alſo clear, 2.
That the Prince accepting of the Crowne doth either explici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
or implicitely promiſe to fulfil theſe conditions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the People have made choiſe of him as a fit meane to
procure thoſe Ends which they did deſigne: But if he should
not be engaged to proſecute, ſo far as lyes in his power, thoſe
Ends, why did they make choiſe of him? Or how could
they expect that he should prove a fit meane for theſe Ends?
Or how can we think that People acting rationally, would
be ſo far dementat as to choiſe a meane, which they had no
more rational ground to expect, would prove a meane for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
theſe neceſſary Ends: then the very bane of theſe good
&amp; neceſſary Ends which they propoſed unto themſelves. The
Covenants, which we have now ſpoken of do cleare this alſo.
3. It is cleare likewiſe from what hath been ſaid, That the
Soveraigne, in theſe Compacts and Covenants with his
People, is not only bound unto God, to performe what
he hath promiſed, but alſo unto his Subjects: For 1. As
was ſaid, He ſtill remaineth a ſociable creature, and under
the Lawes of God and Nature, and therefore is not above
what transactions or compacts he maketh with any, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
equalls or inferiours. 2. If by vertue of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105606:76"/>
he were not obliged unto his Subjects, neither should
they be obliged unto him by theſe compacts, ſeing in erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the conſtitution, and condeſcending upon theſe tearmes,
He and They are equal, according to that, <hi>Contractus non <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>netur
nisi inter aequales.</hi> 3. The People in ſetting up a King should
not act rationally, if the King as King were not bound to
ſtand to his conditions, and really obliged unto them.
Could we imagine that Men in their wits, would Covenant
with a Man, to make him King, on ſuch and ſuch tearmes,
it after he were made King, he were no more obliged unto
them, then if there had been no compact with him?
4. How could they think of attaineing thoſe Ends, which
they propoſed, if he were not bound unto them, to performe
theſe conditions, which they though neceſſary to limite him
unto for the better &amp; more ſure, attaineing theſe Ends? 5. This
compact or Covenant being mutual, concerning conditions
to be mutually performed, ſure, each party muſt be formally
obliged to other. 6. If this be denyed, it muſt be aſſerted,
that a Soveraigne can do no wrong or injurie unto his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
can borrow no money from them, can not be engaged
by Covenant, Promiſe, of Bond unto them, which were
moſt ridiculous, and a doctrine as much tending to the real
deſtruction of Monarchs and Soveraignes, as any elſe: for if
this hold good, Subjects might never think themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure:
And moreover that ordinance, could never be
an ordinance of God, ſeing thereby People could never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the leaſt rational ground of ſecurity for their lives, and
what they have.</p>
               <p>But we need not ſtand on this, ſeing our <hi>Surveyer</hi> perceiving
wel enough, what a groundleſſe and irrational aſſertion this
of the Royaliſts is, thinketh beſt to ſtrick in with <hi>Lex Rex</hi>
and grant <hi>Pag. 100.</hi> [That where a Covenant is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a King and a People, the Covenant on the Kings
part, binds him, not only to God, in relation to the
People, as the object of this duty, but doth bind him to
the People formally.] 4. It is alſo cleare and undenyable,
that in Kingdomes which are commonly called haeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the Son is obliged to performe the ſame conditions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105606:77"/>
which his father was obliged to perfome) for as the law
ſayeth. <hi>Conditionalis obligatio tranſit ad haeredes L. ſi quis D. de
Verborum obligatione.</hi> Rational People, condeſcending ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
upon the conſtitution, did certanely pitch upon that
way of conveyance of the Soveraignity, that might beſt
ſecure them, as to their Ends, and if none had been obliged
unto the conditions agreed upon, but the firſt in the line,
they had not rationally ſecured theſe Ends. 5. It is no leſſe
cleare, That when the Soveraigne doth not performe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
maine, and moſt Neceſſary Conditions condeſcended
and agreed upon, <hi>de jure</hi> he falleth from his Soveraignity.
This all will grant, as flowing natively from the nature of a
compact: for, <hi>qui non praeſtat officium promiſſum, cadit bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio
hâc lege dato. He who doth not preforme the conditions agreed
upon, hath no right to the benefite granted upon condition of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of theſe conditions.</hi> I do not here ſay that every breach,
or violation doth degrade him <hi>de jure;</hi> but that a violation
of all, or of the maine, moſt neceſſary, and principally intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conditions, doth. 6. Lawyers grant that every condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
promiſe giveth a right to the party to whom the promiſe is
made, to purſue for the performance: and this is the nature
of all Mutual compacts. And therefore by vertue of this
mutual compact, the Subjects, have <hi>jus</hi> againſt the King,
a Right in law to purſue him for performance. The worthy
author of <hi>Lex Rex</hi> told us <hi>Pag. 97.</hi> [<hi>That even the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

[It had been better ſaid, That upon this ground they might humbly
plead with him, ſupplicate and reaſon with him, as God's deputy
bearing the impreſſe of his Soveraignity and Majeſty on earth: But

shewed. 1. That Migiſtrates could not miſcarry. 2.
That Subjects had no hand in making theſe conditions in the
Covenant betwixt Them and the King. 3. Nor any hand
in ſetting up the King and conferring that benefite upon him,
on ſuch and ſuch conditions, then his inference had had
ſome colour: but now hath it none. 2. Inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
are God's deputyes as wel as the Superiour, and yet
vve finde no impreſſe of Majeſty or Soveraignity on them,
but they may be oppoſed vvhen doing injury. 3. This is

he then ſave his Majeſty inviolable? [<hi>But</hi> (ſayes he <hi>Pag: 102.)
who will judge it more reaſon, that theſe who are plaintifes,
shall be judges of the party they compleane of, more then the party or
Prince, judge to them? Is not this a perverſion of all judgment, that in
one and the ſame body politick, the accuſer and judge shall be co inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
in the ſame perſon or perſons.] Anſ.</hi> This makes as much
againſt the king, as againſt us; for by this reaſon the King
hath no <hi>jus</hi> over the People, more then they over him, and
can no more plead his cauſe, then they can: for himſelf
cannot be judge and plaintife both: and if this be the perverſion
of all judgment, vve have ſeen enough of it, vvhere the

But let him anſvver this himſelf, and he vvill help

<hi>[Though it be true, that all Covenants and contracts amongst men,

a coactive povver, and may uſe <hi>Major vis</hi> and thruſt him out

moderator in that great buſineſſe, and in the uſe of war, is appealed
to as judge, there being no common judge on earth to ſit on the cauſes
of theſe independent Nations. But God having ſet and eſtablished in
one Particular Nation and Political ſociety, his owne ordinance of
Magiſtracy, to which every ſoul muſt be ſubject, and all ſubject to
the Supreme. &amp;c.] Anſ.</hi> This ſayes wel when the difference or
diſput is between two ſubjects, both under one Magiſtrate;
but is ſayes nothing to our caſe, where the difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Magiſtrate and the Subjects: for in the other caſe
there is a judge over both eſtablished, unto whom both are
ſubjects, but in our caſe there is no judge on earth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both, or who can ſit and judge in ſuch cauſes: for
the King muſt here be no more both judge and party then the
People, and ſo the caſe is irremediable unleſſe there be an
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105606:78"/>
allowance of repelling force with force: for in our caſe
there are no rational meanes which can be uſed to bring the
Prince to do right unto the injured Subjects: and therefore it
God allow war, in the uſe of which, he is appealed to as
judge, betwixt two Nations, he wil allow alſo a neceſſary
defenſive warre in Subjects againſt their Soveraigne when
there is no other remedy, or rationall meanes of redreſſe.
This Man dictats but what proveth he? <hi>[The Magiſtrates
are by their official power, above the whole Nation, and as abſurd it is
to ſay they are above the powers, which God hath ſet over them (as L.
R. pag. 460. ſayeth thraſonically he hath proved unanſwereably)
as to ſay that every parish is above the Miniſter, in an eccleſiaſlical
way, though he hath official power over them all, or that every Lord
in Scotland hath their Tennants and vaſſals above them, a thing
which the nobles of Scotland had need to look to; for certainely the
principles which lead to subject Kings to People, lead clearly and by
undoubted conſequence, to Subject them to their vaſſalls, and to all
under them, yea and all Maſters to ſervants, and parents to children,
and to confound and invert the order of all humane ſocieties.] Anſ.</hi>
1. The law will tell us That in mutual compacts the party
obſerver is <hi>Eatenus</hi> in ſo far, ſuperiour unto the party who
faileth. 2. The author of <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſayeth truly and not
Thraſonically (as this Thraſo, and windy man, allaigeth,

they may ſave their owne ſoulls, thruſt him out, and chooſe
another more Orthodox. 2. All know that the Lord is

yea in ſome caſes be free to renunce him as their Supream,

not in this Man's doctrine: for if they arrogate to themſelves

their vaſſals, (as this man pleads for ſuch power to the
King, without control) I fear their vaſſals let them know
they are not ſlaves. 3. What a poor Politician is this?
He ſpeaks this, to move them ſo much the more to owne
the King's cauſe, but who ſeeth not, that he is either a
falſe or a foolish advocate for the King in this matter, for if
the King get no moe on his ſide but the Superior Lords, &amp;
if all the Vaſſalls and Tennants be againſt him, he will have
the weaker party by farre, on his ſide. 4. I would deſire
Nobles &amp; all to take notice of this, that he would here ſeem
to give to the king, as much power over them and all the
lands, as Maſters have over their Tennants, who have their
lands only from them upon certaine conditions, and may
be removed when theſe conditions are broken. 5. What
a fool is he to put Tennants and Vaſſals together? doth he not
know that Lords have more power over their Proper Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
then over their Vaſſals? 6. Doth he think that
Servants may not in ſome caſes be above their Maſters; a
noble man's ſon may be an apprentice to a very meane man;
But thinks he that Servants will get no action of law againſt
their Maſters, or if there be no law or judge, over him and
his Maſter, he may not defend himſelf, againſt his Maſter's
unjuſt violence? 7. As for the ſubjection of parents to
Children it is impertinent in this caſe, as shall be shewed in
due time, and yet we know that the father hath been a ſubject,
and the ſon a King over him, and we know alſo
that, in caſe of neceſſity, the children may defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt their father taken with a mad phrenzy. Then
he adds [<q>This truth we muſt cleave to, that in one and the
ſame civil ſociety, where God hath appoynted Rulers and
Ruled, Subjects cannot without ſacrilegious intruſion
and contempt of God, ſnatch the ſword out of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
hands to punish him with it (though in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
he abuſe it) neither can a war intended for this end by
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105606:79"/>
meer, private perſones, be lawfull againſt their head or
heads.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> We may let him cleave to this truth, and
this truth cleave to him, and be no loſers: for we ſpeak not of
Subjects taking the ſword of juſtice to punish the King;
we ſpeak of no warre raiſed by the ſubjects for this end: we
plead only for a power in private Subjects to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
in caſes of neceſſity, againſt their head or heads,
(and he, nor none of his party, have the forehead to deny
this to be lawful in ſome caſes) eſpecially if the Magiſtrate
abuſe his power, not in ſome particulars only, but in many,
and in many maine particulars, if not in all.</p>
               <p>Having thus cleared and vindicated the 6. thing. The
7. And laſt is this, which followeth alſo from the former: viz.
That when the Prince doth violate his compact, as to all its
conditions, or as to it's cheef, maine, and moſt neceſſary
condition, the Subjects are <hi>de Iure</hi> free from ſubjection to
him, and at liberty to make choiſe of another. The very
nature of a compact doth clear this: For it is abſurd to ſay,
that in a mutual conditional compact, one party shall ſtill
be bound to performe his conditions, though the other
performeth none of his conditions, or performeth not the
maine and principal one. It is abſurd to ſay, that when one
hath given a benefite upon a certaine condition, that he is ſtill
bound to beſtow that benefite, though the condition on
which he promiſed it, be no way performed. Were it the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
act of rational creatures to ſet up Soveraignes upon theſe
tearmes? or to ſay, wee chooſe thee, to be our Soveraigne
upon condition thou rule us according to juſtice and equity,
and not tyrannize over us, and yet we shall always hold thee
for our Prince and lawful Soveraigne, Though thou should
tranſgreſſe all lawes of equity, humanity, and reaſon; and
deal with us as ſo many sheep, kill whom thou will, for
thy ſport and luſt, &amp;c. will any body think that rational
men would do ſo? The law tells us <hi>L. ſi fund. c. de pactis, &amp;c.</hi>
That <hi>ceſſante cauſâ, propter quam res est data, pignus debet
reddi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we come to draw our arguments from what is
ſaid, we shall firſt roll out of our way what this <hi>Surveyer</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:105606:80"/>
ſpeaks further againſt theſe Covenants, <hi>Pag. 88, 89, 90,
91, 92, &amp; 93.</hi> He hath five particulars which he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, [<hi>It is eaſily conceded</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that there
is a mutual obligation betwixt Magistrats and Subjects, to mutual
dutyes, which is indeed eſſential to the conſtitution of the politike bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but his obligation ariſeth not from any tacite or expreſſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
betwixt them, but from the ordinance and will of God, enjoyning
them theſe dutyes in theſe relations, in that ſociety, wherein they are
combined.] Anſw. 1. Subordinata non pugnant.</hi> This mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
obligation may ariſe both from the Law of God, and
from the Covenant, without any repugnancy. 2. If this
obligation ariſe only from the Law of God, neither partyes
shall be formally obliged unto other, but both obliged only
unto God; and yet we heard himſelf ſay <hi>Pag. 100.</hi> that
<q>[Where a Covenant is made betwixt a King and a People,
that the Covenant on the King's part, binds him not only
unto God, in relation to the People as the object of the
duty, but doth bind him to the People formally.</q>] Now,
whence ariſeth this formal obligation, if not from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
3. By this meanes the obligations of fidelity in the
ſubjects unto their Princes, have no riſe from their oath of
allegiance, which he elſewhere calleth <hi>Foedus unilaterum.</hi>
4. To what purpoſe then are Covenants and compacts made,
If by vertue of theſe, each party be not formally obliged
unto other? For if <hi>David's</hi> Covenant with the People of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> laid no obligation upon him, he could not be ſaid to have
made a Covenant with them, more then with the <hi>Phaliſtimes,</hi>
and yet the Scripture tells us, he made a Covenant with <hi>Iſrael:</hi>
And King <hi>Ioash</hi> made a Covenant with the People. 5. I do
not well underſtand, how an obligation to future dutyes
can be called eſſential to a conſtitution, which neither flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the conſtitution, nor giveth a being to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
6. Againe, if there be no obligation unto theſe
mutual dutyes, until there be a conſtitution by compact,
and if then the obligation be eſſential, how is it imaginable
that the obligation shall have no ſubordinat riſe from the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105606:80"/>
conſtitution; or compact whereupon the conſtitution is
founded?</p>
               <p>The 2. thing he ſayeth, is, That though this obligation
be mutual, yet is it not conditional, and how proves he
this? <hi>[There is</hi> (ſayes he <hi>a mutual obligation to mutual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
betwixt Parents and Children, but it is not conditional, that if
Parents be undutiful, Children shall be looſed from their duty, or
on the contrary.]</hi> So is it <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> betwixt King and
People, and the citeth <hi>Calvin. Inst. Lib. 4. Cap. 20. §. 29.</hi>
But it is eaſily anſwered. That there is a vaſt diſparity betwixt
the riſe of that relation, which is betwixt King and People,
and that which is betwixt Father and Son: And this being
once diſcovered the parity diſappeareth: And 1. Subjects
come not out of the loyns of their King, as Children do out of
the loines of their Fathers. 2. The Son createth not the
Father as the Subjects create the King. 3. Yea Children
do not ſo much as give their conſent that ſuch an one shall
be their Father, before the relation have being, yet Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts
will grant this much, unto the People, in relation to
their King. 4. The relation betwixt Father and Son hath
no dependence leſſ or more upon any act of will in the Son,
or upon any Covenants, Agriements or Compact, expreſſe
or tacite, betwixt the Father &amp; the Son, it is not ſo as to
the relation betwixt King and People; for before this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
relation ariſe, there muſt be a conſtitution, and this
conſtitution includeth, at leaſt, ſome act of the will in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
ſome previous conſent. 5. This relation can never
ceaſe, ſo long as both are in life, but the other may, by a
Subject's chooſeing to live under another Soveraigne. 6. Let
the Father do what he wil, the relation betwixt him and his
Son shall never be looſed or weakened. But the greateſt
Royaliſts will grant, that in ſome caſes, the King may be
made no King, and his relation either wholly taken away, or
much diminished. So then the conſequence is null, that
becauſe Children are not bound to their Parents conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
therefore Subjects are bound conditionally to there
Prince: For Children have no hand in making up that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
betwixt Parents and them; their conſent is not ſo
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105606:81"/>
much as required; but in making up the relation betwixt
King and Subjects, there is a previous compact, required,
in which compact, the People have their great share:
Children give not paternity unto their Parents; but Subjects
give the Kingship, at leaſt inſtrumentally, under God;
and they ſet up Kings, when they might ſet up Nobles, and
ſet up his Man, when they might have ſet up Another, can
Children do ſo? How then shall the caſe be alike, And
the one be no more conditional then the other? Next, as
for <hi>Calvin</hi> we willingly with him grant, that Subjects are
to obey evill Magiſtrates, and to do their duty to them,
though the Magiſtrates should come short of theirs, as Wiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
&amp; Children are bound to love and be Subject unto unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Husbands and Fathers. But <hi>Calvin</hi> will not ſay, that
in no caſe a Wife is looſed from Subjection to her Husband:
adultery and wilful deſertion will give ground for a divorce,
and that ſayes that the Wives ſubjection is not abſolute, but
conditional; though we ſay not, that every breach of ſome
of the conditions, looſeth the obligation. Neither will
<hi>Calvin.</hi> ſay' That in no caſe, the Soveraigne may be oppoſed
or reſiſted: or, that in no caſe the obligation can be looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for <hi>ibid.</hi> §. 31. He granteth liberty to the Eſtates of a
Land (whom yet our <hi>Surveyer</hi> putteth in one category with
private Subjects,) to ſtand for the libertyes of the People
againſt the rage and Tyranny of Princes, Yea he ſayeth they
are bound to do ſo, as they would not preſidiouſly, betray
their truſt.</p>
               <p>The 3. thing is, that <hi>[the fancy of a tacite virtual natural
Covenant betwixt King and People, overthrows the diſtinction that
all ſound proteſtant Divines and Politicians make, betwixt a</hi> limited
or pactional Prince <hi>and</hi> an abſolute Prince, <hi>or one who is</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grae
Majeſtatis.] And then he citeth <hi>Rivet. in Pſal</hi> 68. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard
de Magistratu, Pag.</hi> 13 11. <hi>mihi</hi> (or 935.) And therein,
he ſayes, they agree with <hi>Calvin</hi> in the place cited. <hi>Anſw.</hi>
That there are abſolute Princes <hi>de facto,</hi> who come to the
Soveraignity by falſe and corrupt meanes, or by conqueſt,
we deny not, but we are ſpeaking of Princes, <hi>de Iure,</hi> and
of Princes ſet up by the People, which is only to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105606:81"/>
It is true, <hi>Rivet</hi> (a very short ſum of all the ſound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Divines, though he joyne <hi>Gerhard</hi> with him too, who is
but <hi>Lutherian</hi> Proteſtant, and for his Politicians we ſee none)
make uſe of ſuch a diſtinction, but aſſert not poſitively that
ſuch an abſolute Prince is lawful. <hi>Calvin</hi> maketh uſe of no ſuch
diſtinction, and if they agree with him, they ſay no more
then he ſayeth, and what he ſayd, we have heard. But ſayes
our <hi>Surveyer</hi> it is [<hi>Falſe to ſay that an abſolute Prince is contrary to
the Word of God: for as our Lawes allowes our Kings to be ahſolute,
in expreſſe tearmes</hi> Jam. 1. (<hi>he should ſay</hi> Jam. 6.) <hi>Parl.</hi> 18.
<hi>Anno</hi> 1606.] <hi>Anſw</hi> Our Lawes and eſpecially of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the like, are evil proofs of what is <hi>Iure Divino,</hi>
or not contrary thereunto. But of that Supermacy granted
to the King, by that act and others, the <hi>Apology</hi> hath ſpoken
enough. Furder he addeth, [<hi>So the Scripture is not against an
abſolute Prince, as our Lawes and we underſtand him?</hi>] But how
is that? May he Rule as he lifts? No, for [<hi>He is ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
(sayes he) <hi>unto God and his Lawes, and he ought alſo to
walke according to the particular good Lawes he hath made with conſent
of his People.]</hi> This is more then other Royaliſts would grant
to us, for he acknowledgeth him not only not above the
Law of God, but alſo not above the municipal Lawes, and
conſequently not above the fundamental conditions of the
conſtitution: And we are ſure in this, This King hath fowlely
broken, whatever he doubt of. But how is he abſolute?
[<hi>He is abſolute</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that if he deviate he is not under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
power of Subjects, that they should have Law-claime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and in their courts of nature and neceſſity, pronounce
judgement upon him, to deſtroy him, far leſſe that by vertue of
this ſuppoſed tacite Convenant, any minor private party of the
People, may pull King and all Magistrats out of their ſeate,
punish them, and poſſeſſe themſelves in their roomes, as Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly
ſayes] Anſw.</hi> What he layeth to <hi>Naphtali's</hi> charge shall
be conſidered afterward. 2. To ſay that Subjects have no
law claime againſt a King, who breaketh the maine and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
condition, or all the conditions of the Covenant made
betwixt Him and the People, is to deſtroy the nature of the
mutual compact, made between Him and the People as we
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105606:82"/>
have shewed. 3. By this it ſeemeth all the abſoluteneſſe
that he ſayes is due to the King, is, that he is from under the
co-active power of Subjects, but though this were granted
to him, (which yet we cannot, becauſe of what we have
ſaid already) we should ſuffer no loſſe, as to our intendment:
for if this be all his abſoluteneſſe, then he may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
and reſiſted (though not brought to the barr) even
by private ſubjects, when he contraveeneth his principal
conditions, and breaketh Covenant unto his people: and
this is all we contend for.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of what he ſayes in the 4 place, is this <hi>[Where there is freedome of Election (as in Germany and Poland, where
there is but perſonated and painted Kings) there may poſſibly be expreſſe
limiteing conditions allowing ſome to coerce deviating ſoveraignity.
But in all proper Monarchies, there is neither tacite nor expreſſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
impowering any to be judges over the King. Some Kingdomes
are attained by a conqueſt in a juſt warre (which is a ſufficient title) &amp;
this power being hereditarily tranſmitted, the ſucceſſours receive
power from the Parents and not from the People, nor is there any
shaddow of tacite or expreſse Covenant in this matter.] Anſw.</hi> 1.
If he be not well pleaſed with what <hi>Lex Rex</hi> hath ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
conqueſt giving a ſufficient title to crownes, he should
have conſidered and anſwered the arguments there made uſe
of, and not jejunely have told us he is of another judgment;
for they are either fooles, or mad who will beleeve his bare
word, better then the worthy author of <hi>Lex Rex</hi> his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
baked &amp; confirmed with many ſolid &amp; unanſwereable
arguments, 2. This though true, ſpeaks nothing to our
purpoſe: for we ſuppoſed always that our Kingdome was
not founded upon a conqueſt, and we never heard any ſay it
was, till this unnatural abject aroſe to ſpeak non ſenſe, of
which more preſently: We never heard a King challenge it
upon that account, nay, nor ſay that our Kingdome was ever
conquered by any of their predeceſſours, except King <hi>Iames,</hi> who in his <hi>baſilicon doron,</hi> allaiged that <hi>Fergus</hi> the firſt, was a
conquerour, contrare to the teſtimony, of all approven
hiſtorio-graphers: what meaneth the large long roll of the
King's predeceſſours, that is read over at the coronation;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105606:82"/>
doth any of our lawes ſpeak ſuch a thing? or do they found
his abſolute power upon ſuch a dreame? It would ſeem the
cauſe is deſperate and gone, when he can get no other bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
to his abſoluteneſſe, but a fiction of his diſtempered
braine, which may deſervedly make him odious to all true
ſcottish men, and may (and poſſibly will) make his cauſe
odious alſo, to all who are acquanted with the true, genuine
and ancient conſtitution of the Kingdome. 3. This ravv.
Statiſt exſcreats his raw notions, as he pleaſeth, but they
muſt be rude and unskilful in this matter, that will think to
digeſt them. He tell's us that the <hi>Emperour of Germany and
the King of Poland</hi> are but painted Kings, and Monarchs, and
to confirme this, tels us that, there are no Monarches, or
proper princes, but ſuch as are abſolute: What will then
become of the Diſtinction, of all ſound proteſtant divines
and polititians, which he mentioned in the preceeding page?
Do they think that all the limited and pactional princes, are
but cyphers, or as painted men are men, ſo are they but
painted princes? Sure none of the divines he named take
ſuch princes for no true princes. 4. If in proper Monarchies,
there be ſuch Covenants and compacts tacite or expreſſe,
which will gave a law claime unto the Subjects againſt
the King, and a <hi>Ius</hi> againſt him, as a formal tranſgreſſour
of his Covenant made with them, and liberate them from
ſubjection to him, we could have enough for our buſineſſe,
though it should be granted, that there is no Covenant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering
others to be his judges. Though it should be
granted (which ſome politicians Doubt of) that in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
purchaſed by conqueſt, the power haereditarily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
should be received from the parent, and not from
the people; yet in kingdoms founded upon a lawful and
free conſtitution, the ſucceſſour, (as we shewed above)
hath his power not from his predeceſſour, but from the
conſtitution, or the people condeſcending upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</p>
               <p>But he thinks to obviate all this by what he ſayes in the
5. place viz. That our Kingdome is not founded on any
ſuch Covenant, but rather on a conqueſt, of which he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105606:83"/>
giveth five remarkable inſtances. The firſt is, That <hi>Fergus
the first, was not admitted upon conditions, but the Subjects, by their
oath confirmed the Kingdome to him, and his poſterity: and that the
black book of paſley ſayes,</hi> Fergus <hi>made himſelf King. Anſw.</hi> 1.
What that black book of <hi>paſley</hi> (which neither he nor I ever
ſaw) ſayeth, is not worth the inquiry to ſearch, Seing
all other hiſtorians, ſuch as <hi>Iohn Fordon, Iohn Major, Boëthius,
Hollanshade,</hi> beſide <hi>Buchanan,</hi> ſay, that he was freely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
by the People. And the ſtory tells us, that he was then
in <hi>Irland,</hi> when the <hi>Scots</hi> ſent for him, how could he then
make him ſelf King? 2. If he had been a conquerour, he
might have tranſmitted the Kingdom unto his ſone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the conſent of the People, and yet we ſee this was not
done; yea we finde that the People would ſuffer none
of his ſones to enjoy the place after him, becauſe unfit for
government, but made choiſe of a third perſon: and when
his eldeſt ſon did afterward challenge the Kingdome as his
owne, he was made to underſtand himſelf better. 3. It is
true <hi>Buchanan</hi> mentioneth no oath of the King, but that will
not ſay, that there was no compact betwixt Him and the
People, There might be conditions communed and condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
upon, though the King was not put to ſweare them.
But however, that there was an implicite and tacite Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
at leaſt, betwixt them, Is cleare from the oath of
the People confirming the Kingdome unto him; for it ſayes
that all the right he had unto the Kingdome, was from the
People, and that he could not be ſecured in it but by them,
and ſeing they gave him the Kingdome, and did ſecure him
in it, Nature and Reaſon will ſay, that it was upon good
tearmes, particularly, that he and his should not tyrannize
over them, but should rule them aright: and though there
be no written contract concerning this, extant, yet their
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant after-practice doth abundantly cleare it; for, though
they confirmed the Kingdome by oath to him, and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
yet their chooſeing of <hi>Feritharis</hi> his brother, paſſing
by both his ſones, <hi>ſayes,</hi> that this condition was tacitely
underſtood, viz. provideing that they, should be able for government and to diſcharge the place, and accordingly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105606:83"/>
they did then eſtablish it, in a ſtanding law for time to come:
and after this manner, and according to theſe tearmes did
chooſe their Kings until <hi>Kennethus</hi> the third, by force or
fraud, obtained a change. So their taking courſe with ſuch
of their Kings, as did tyrannize, ſayeth, that this was an
other condition of the compact, viz. That they should
not tyrannize, but governe righteouſly: Thus we ſee theſe
after practices are cleare ſtanding commentaryes, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explaineing the nature and maine conditions of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact.</p>
               <p>His 2 inſtances: is of <hi>Fergus</hi> the ſecond, the 40 King. [<hi>Who
by his valour, under the conduct of divine providence, &amp; by the help
of Danes and others, with ſome ſmall remainder of Scots, recovered
the Kingdome and was not beholden to the People for it, nor had it
by paction with them.] Anſw. Buchanan</hi> tells us, that he was
called home <hi>ad regnum avitum ſuſcipiendum,</hi> to take upon
him the Kingdome which belonged to him, according to
the ancient conſtitution, as being of the family of <hi>Fergus,</hi>
and then giving proof of his provveſſe, and ability for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and accordingly being then in <hi>Scandia</hi> or <hi>Norway</hi>
took the offer, and came home, accompanyed with the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<hi>Scots,</hi> and ſome <hi>Danes:</hi> and after he came home, after
the wonted cuſtome, <hi>more patrio,</hi> he was created King by a
Parliament; for, <hi>comitiis peractis,</hi> the Parliament being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he falleth about his work, and at length freeth the
Kingdome of its adverſaryes: Now, how can he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a conquerour, obtaineing his right to the crowne by
conqueſt, who had it by a faire, free, and full call of the
People, who might have choſen any other of that race,
that had been remaineing, and qualified for their purpoſe?
This is ſtrange doctrine, to ſay, that every Prince who cometh
to his Kingdome, by the free conſent of his People, in a
troubleſome time, becauſe that through their help and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence,
he freeth the land of Enemies, and reſtoreth
peace to the inhabitants, is a conquerour, and hath no right
to the Crowne, but by his ſword. He will not ſay that
every conqueſt will give a juſt title, but a lawfull conqueſt,
now what right had <hi>Fergus</hi> to conquere theſe adverſaries?
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105606:84"/>
What title or claime could he lay to that crowne from
whence he and his forebears were banished or conſtrained
to flee, if not by the ancient grant made by the People unto
<hi>Fergus</hi> the firſt and to his race? So then, his right was not
obtained by the ſword, but only the peaceable poſſeſſion
thereof, and the practice of the people afterward when his
ſon <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> came to reigne, and turned vitious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
whether they looked upon this <hi>Fergus</hi> the ſecond, as a
Conquerour, and upon what tearmes he and his ſucceſſours
had the crowne: for becauſe of his vitiousneſſe, and refuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to amend his manners, when admonished by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
they were almoſt at waging war againſt him and of
revolting from him, had not <hi>Dougall</hi> of <hi>Galloway</hi> diſſwaded
them.</p>
               <p>His 3 inſtance is <hi>Kenneth</hi> the firſt the 50 King (He should have ſaid <hi>Kenneth</hi> the 2 the 69 King, for <hi>Kenneth</hi> the firſt
died within a yeer after he was made King.) [<hi>Who deſtroyed the</hi>
picts, <hi>and enlairged his Kingdom by the acceſſion of theirs, purchaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more and better lands, then he had before, which he diſtributed
to his Subjects, he held not his purchaſed Kingdome of them by
contract or paction] Anſ.</hi> What right a Prince hath unto lands,
which he purchaſeth by conqueſt or war, is not the matter
of our diſput, but what right <hi>Kenneth</hi> had to the crowne.
Now, ſure it is that before this conqueſt made, he was
crowned, upon the ſame ground, that his predeceſſours
were: his future conqueſt, then uncertaine, could not alter
the ground of his receiving of the crowne, when his father
<hi>Alpin</hi> died 2. What ever ſuperiority, he might
challenge
over theſe Subjects unto whom he gave theſe new conqueſt
lands, it had no influence upon his holding of the crowne:
and that his very next ſucceſſour and brother <hi>Donald</hi> knew,
who being given to his pleaſures, loſt a noble victory which
they had obtained over the Englishes, and after he returned
from captivity, following his old life, was caſt in priſon
by his owne Subjects. And his Son knew it alſo, for he
was put by the crowne conforme to the old law, until this
<hi>Donald</hi> died. So that notwithſtanding of all this new
purchaſe, the people knew that the conveyance of the crowne
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105606:84"/>
did ſtill run in the old channel, and was held of them after
the old tenor.</p>
               <p>His 4. Inſtance is of <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> whom our Lawes of
<hi>Regiam Majestatem</hi> call <hi>Conqueſtor Magnus, [He re-conquered the
Kingdom after the Nobility of</hi> Scotland <hi>had first at</hi> Berwick, <hi>then
at</hi> S, Andrewes, <hi>in plaine Parliament, ſworne homage to the King
of</hi> England, <hi>who will aſſert there were pactions betwixt him and the
People?] Anſw.</hi> We know out of Hiſtory, what a miſerable
condition the Land was brought unto, through occaſion of
that diviſion and ſad diſput that was in it, concerning the
neareſt in the line: and this was the bitter frute, that <hi>Scotland</hi>
reaped of the change of that laudable cuſtome eſtablished
near the beginning of he conſtitution; whereas had not
that been changed in the dayes of <hi>Kenneth</hi> the third, the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
perſon to governe might have been choſen, and that had
prevented all this confuſion and miſery, which the Land
was brought unto. 2. Though <hi>Bruce</hi> at length recovered
the Kingdome, yet he received not his crowne upon that
account, but before he attempted it's recovery, out of the
hands of the Englishes, he was crowned King at <hi>Scone,</hi> in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prile
1036. and there received the Kingdom from the Scots,
upon the old account, and according to the old tenor.
3. Though he be tearmed a <hi>great conquerour,</hi> as
having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Land, out of the hands of the Englishes, as if it
had been a conqueſt, when as it was really, but a recovering
of what, he was bound by his place and power, to recover;
yet we never finde that he claimed a right to the Land, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
that ground of conqueſt, but ſtood upon the old
baſis.</p>
               <p>His fift &amp; laſt inſtance is of this King, <q>[It is known (ſayes
he) our Nation was totally ſubdued by the English, and
continued ſo, for the ſpace of then yeers, The Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of Shires, and Cities, and Townes combined into a
Commonwealth government, and ſent their commiſſioners
to the meeting thereof at <hi>London,</hi> where the King's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
was diſclaimed; yet in a wonderful way God brought
him in againe, and finding us at his coming, a fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
and ſubdued nation, reſtored us to our freedome,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105606:85"/>
from the bondage of forraigners.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Through
too great haſte, he hath forgotten a maine particular of this
Inſtance. Before we were totally ſubdued by the Englishes,
the <hi>King</hi> was crowned at <hi>Scone</hi> in as ſolemne a manner, as
ever any of his Predeceſſours, except that he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
with holy Oyle, nor gote the Pop's benediction;
and while crowned, was ſolemnely engaged to the People
by Covenants, vowes and oathes, to defend Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the National Covenant, and Solemne League and
Covenant, and to proſecute the ends of theſe Covenants,
and upon theſe conditions took his Crowne and Scepter:
Were we a conqueſt then? 2. Ay but we were conquered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
and our Repreſentatives diſclaimed the King's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
But how many were there of theſe Repreſentatives?
And had theſe Repreſentatives power &amp; commiſſion from the
Land, to renunce his Intereſt? Or were theſe all accounted
Enemies to the King? How is it then, that ſo many of
them are now accounted his moſt loyal Subjects, and more
loyal then ſuch as ſuffered much, becauſe they would not
take that <hi>Tender,</hi> diſclaming his intereſt? how comes it,
that that Arch-knave <hi>Sharp</hi> (ſufficiently now knowne by that
name and notion both to King, Court and Countrey) who
was the only Miniſter (ſo far as I know) in all Scotland,
that took that tender, is advanced unto (in ſtead of a gallowes)
an arch-prelacy, and primacy? But 3 when the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
did he make a re-conqueſt of us? what meaned
then that compact betwixt <hi>Monck</hi> and the Nobles and others
of Scotland, whom he ſent for, unto the borders, and to
the end he might more cloſely carry his buſineſſe, made them
all to abjure <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> and his intereſt (a ſad preſage of
what would be our Epidemick diſtemper, when our change
or turne begane with manifeſt perjury) did he not a acquante
them with his deſigne? and had he not their concurrence?
and if he had wanted this, and had thought that <hi>Scotland</hi>
would have been an adverſary unto his deſigne, would he or
durſl he have attempted it? 4. What way did the King
reſtore us ſeing (if he would ſpeak the matter as it was, it
was <hi>Monck</hi> that reſtored him and us both, as to any reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105606:85"/>
we gote: vvere not vve and he reſtored together?
What did he for our reſtauration? vvas He not as paſſive as
we were and ſome what more? 5. Hence then it is falſe
that he found us at his coming a fully conquered and ſubdued
nation. He rather left us ſo, as found us ſo, for we were
reſtored, to what we gote <hi>pari paſsu,</hi> vvith himſelf. 6. It
is true at his coming (though not by him) vve vvere freed
from the bondage of forraigners, but as for the freedome we
vvere reſtored unto, vve are yet ignorant of it, and ſee and
feel heavier bondage both as to Church and State, then vve
did under ſtrangers of forraigners. But he addeth. [<hi>If
any will ſay, That it was upon his account the Nation was brought to
the ſuffering of that bondage; and that there did lye bands upon him,
as our ſworne King to free ws, when he should be in capacity to do it. It
may be anſwered. 1. It is knowne that when the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al ſtroke that
ſunk us into bondage was given, there was an expreſſe diſowneing of
his right, by publick judicatories of the land, in the quarrel with
the English Sectaryes, before Dumbar.] Anſw.</hi> He should firſt have
removed this objection. It was upon the Kings account that
the English army did invade us: had we forborne to have
ſent commiſſioners to have called Him home, The <hi>Englishes</hi>
would never have invaded us: for that was their only quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;
Becauſe we had taken the Head of the Malignant
faction Into our beſome: and ſo, had we for-borne to
have owned his quarrel, we had neither been invaded, nor
ſubdued by them, and there had not been ſo much of our
blood shed, as there was. And is this all the thanks that now
we get for our vaſt expence of blood, oppreſſion, and
Ten years bondage, that we muſt be declared a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
and a ſubdued Nation? 2. It is a manifeſt lye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſay
that his intereſt vvas expreſly diſowned by the publick
judicatories of the land, before <hi>Dumbar</hi> fight: for that
act of the <hi>Weſt Kirk</hi> (to vvhich I knovv he looketh)
vvas not an expreſſe diſovvning of his intereſt, as
may be ſeen by the act it ſelf, which was as followeth,
[<q>
                     <hi>Westkirk</hi> the 13 day of <hi>August.</hi> 1650. The commiſſion of
the Generall Aſſembly conſidering, that there may be juſt
ground of ſtumbling from the King's Majeſties refuſeing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105606:86"/>
to ſubſcribe and emit the declaration offered unto him by
the commmitee of Eſtates, and commiſſioners of the
General Aſſembly, concerning his former carriage, and
reſolution for the future, in reference to the cauſe of God,
&amp; Enemies &amp; Friends thereof; doth therefore declare that
this Kirk and Kingdome, do not owne nor eſpouſe any
Malignant party or quarrel, or intereſt; but that they
fight meerly upon their former grounds and principles,
and in defence of the cauſe of God, and of the Kingdome,
as they have done theſe twelue yeers paſt, and therefore
as they do diſclame all the ſinne and guilt of the King, and
of his houſe; ſo they will not owne Him, nor his intereſt,
otherwiſe then with a ſubordination to God, and ſo far
as he ownes and proſecutes the cauſe of God; and diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
his and his father's oppoſition to the work of God,
and to the Covenant, and likewiſe all the Enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and that they will with convenient ſpeed take in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
the papers lately ſent unto them from <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
and vindicate themſelves from all the falshoods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein, eſpecially in theſe things, wherein the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
betwixt us &amp; that party is miſ-ſtated, as if we owned the
late King's proceeding's and were reſolved to proſecute
and maintaine his preſent Majeſties intereſt, before
and
without acknowledgment of the ſinnes of his houſe, and
former wayes, and ſatiſfaction to God's People in both
Kingdomes]</q> Which when the committee of Eſtates had
ſeen and conſidered, they did approve the ſame, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
concurred therein: and what could this honeſt and moſt
ſeaſonable declaration import, but only that if the King
would not by a declaration, acknowledge his ſorrow, for his,
&amp; his father's carrying on a courſe deſtructive of the work of
God, and his renunceing of the Malignant intereſt, and all
who would owne the ſame, and his purpoſe to adhere unto
the Covenants, they would not eſpouſe a Milignant quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
but fight upon the ſame grounds and principles, that
they had done for twelue yeers before, aud only owne him
with a ſubordination to God, and in ſo far as he did owne
the cauſe of God, and renunce Malignancy and Milignants,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105606:86"/>
and that they vvould take into conſideration <hi>Oliver Cromwel's</hi>
papers, for their ovvne vindication, and clearing of the true
ſtate of the quarrel, Which vvas neceſſary, before they did
engage in fight? And vvould this Malignant <hi>Gnatho</hi> have had
the Land and the publick judicatories thereof, contrare
to their Covenants, &amp; many Purpoſes, Reſolutions, Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
&amp;
Engagements, poſtponing Chriſt's intereſts unto man's
and hazard Religion, Libertyes &amp; all, for one, who would
not declare himſelf a friend to Chriſt, and his intereſt; but
would perſiſt in a ſtated oppoſition to Chriſt and his cauſe?
3. But let him make of this, what he will, ſure his intereſt
was owned, when he, upon ſecond thoughts emited that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
at Dumfermline upon his refuſal of which, this act
made at the <hi>Westkirk</hi> paſſed, and this was before <hi>Dumbar</hi> fight.
So was his intereſt ſufficiently owned, with the ſubordination
requiſite, when he was crowned, which was not very long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that ſtroke a <hi>Dumbar,</hi> and after vvhich vve gote blowes
enew, and vvere redacted at length to bondage. What ſayes he
next to this? [2. <hi>What ever engagements were upon him for the
good of the Nation; yet if theſe mens principles were to be followed
they could have had no force on him, to move him to labour our vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into liberty, for do not they teach that in the mutual contract and
Covenant betwixt King and People, the People are looſed from their
duty, if the King fail in his, frangenti fidem fides frangatur
eidem; and why then in not the King looſed, if the people fail on
their part? It is known that (although the Nobles and body of the
people were well enough affected to the King, and cordially loved him,
when they were over powered and could do nothing) yet by their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives,
he was diſowned (which in law would be rekoned their
owne deed: and if a ſworne people deſerte and diſclaime their King
by their Repreſentatives, may not the King alſo have the benefite of
the conditional Covenant, and leave them as he found them in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to forraigners. But ſuch was his Majeſties graciouſneſs and
wiſdom as well as conſcience of duty, that although the Nation
had failed much to him, he would not walk after the counſel of theſe
men? And we may (all things conſidered) aſſert that the people of
Scotland do rather owe their liberty to him, then he doth owe his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to them, or by virtue of any Covenant with them.] Anſw.</hi> 1.
By vvhat he hath been formerly ſaying, and by the inſtances
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105606:87"/>
vvhich he hath brought, vve ſee vvhat is the ſcope he driveth
at, viz. To have us novv a formal conqueſt, that ſo the
King may tyrannize over us, and deal vvith us, as he ſeeth
good, <hi>jure conqueſtus,</hi> as being novv free from all bonds and
obligations, vvhich ever paſſed betvvixt Him and the People.
For the fift particular which he undertooke to cleare by theſe
five inſtances, was, that the conſtitution of this Kingdome
neither was, not is, founded on a Covenant betwixt King
and People: and yet we ſee the poor man ſo ſtraitned that he
knoweth not what to ſay: He would ſaine looſe the King
from all Bonds and Covenants, and former obligations, and
yet he dar not poſitively and clearly aſſert it, but only ſayes
if the King would follow our principles, he would account
himſelf looſed from all: but unleſſe, he aſſert it, clearly and
poſitively, that the King, is really looſed from all his form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
obligations, he ſpeakes nothing to he poynt, but muſt
grant, that at leaſt as to this King, the conſtitution is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a conditional Covenant; and though we should
yeeld all thereſt, if he grant this to us, we need deſire no
more, for all our Ends. But 2. in good earneſt, let him
tell us, Whether the former engagements which were upon
the King at his coronation, be looſed or not? If they be
looſed and made null, becauſe of what theſe ſuppoſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
did: Then 1. we have a new ground of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
the ſacred obligations of the Oaths and Covenants,
which the King made with God, and with his People,
which was not thought upon till this needle-headed man did
invent it. The King himſelf at his returne, gave no ſuch
ground. 2. If he think that theſe Repreſentatives (having
no expreſſe commiſſion to renunce <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> and his
intereſt, from the land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did break their allaigance, why
did not the King execute the law againſt them as traitours (as
he did againſt ſome under that pretext, but really for their
faithfulneſſe to the Covenant, as is made out by the Apologiſt)
why did he ſeem to approve what they did, by Countenance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them ſo much, as he hath done ſince his returne? 3.
Doth not himſelf ſay that the Nobles and Body of the Land
were well enough affected to the King, and cordially loved
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105606:87"/>
him, when they were overpowered and could do nothing?
Sure then the land did not break, vvhatſoever ſome men
did. Ay but, ſayes he, in lavv this vvould be reckoned
their deed. Very hardly, ſince they gave no commiſſion for
ſuch a deed. If he ſay that they virtually gave ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
in that they ſent their commiſſioners unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monvvealths
Parliament. It may be anſwered, that not only
that was a conſtrained and extorted act, but, that as matters
then ſtood, no lavvyer, no politician, nor divine vvould
condemne ſuch a deed as ſinful or unlavvful, or as prejudicial
to the Kings intereſt, to ſend commiſſioners to a meeting, at
command of the Conquerour, to labour for a mitigation of
their bondage, and for propoſeing ſome things for the good
of the land, vvhen their ovvne King vvas banished from
them, vvithout all hope of a returne, and they, for his
ſake, vvithout any treachery or perfidy in them, reduced
to a ſtate of bondage. 3. But ſince the King at his returne
laide claime to no nevv right, but ſtood upon the old
ground, and upon this account vvas crovvned in <hi>England</hi>
vvhere he had not been crovvned before, and vvas not
crovvned in <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe he had been crovvned there
formerly, all theſe quircks are to no prupoſe: for the King
returning upon the old claime, acknowledged the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and re-aſſumed his auncient Kingdome upon the
ſame tearmes he did before, which is alſo furder confirmed
by the act of indempnity, which he paſſed; and other acts
and deeds, which weer needleſſe now to mention. 4. We
shall eaſily grant, that when a ſworne People deſert and
diſclaime their King by their Repreſentatives: The King
alſo may take the benefite of the conditional Covenant and
leave them. and ſo might King <hi>Charles</hi> have done, and
never owned us more: and if he had done ſo, and gone
to ſome other part of the world, to have ſpent his dayes,
as ſome would not have been grieved, ſo, I think both
lawyers and divines would have thought him looſed from
his obligation to the people, though not wholly from his
obligation to God: But now ſince he did not ſo, but took
the firſt occaſion that was feiſible, and returned to his old
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105606:88"/>
ſtation and relation, all the old bonds and engagements,
which he took in theſe relations, recurred with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
force and vigour, and he became no leſſe bound then
ever, yea, before the Lord, rather more: becauſe the
goodneſſe of God in reſtoreing him without blood, should
have engaged his heart ſo much the more unto God, &amp; to his
former vowes and Covenants. 5. What way he laboured
our vindication into liberty, I know not; and if it be his
Majeſties graciouſneſſe and wiſdome, as well as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of duty, that would not let him walk after the counſel
of theſe men, (as he ſayeth) many think that we are yet to
ſee theſe commendable diſpoſitions; for the effect mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is not viſible: for after the counſell of whomſoever he
hath walked, ſure we are, he hath broken the Bonds and
Engagements which he took on him, both before, and on
the day of his coronation: He hath rejected the Covenant,
which he made with God upon his knees, with his hands
lifted up unto the Moſt High, and overturned that which
was the Chief of our fundamental lawes, or tearmes of our
conſtitution, as we ſee this day: and this is knowne, that of
theſe who are moſt injured by him now, and preſecuted,
there were feweſt that failed to him in that day; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his graciouſneſſe and wiſdome and conſcience of duty,
should have cauſed him remember theſe, who could not,
out of conſcience of their obligation to him, by vertue of
their Covenant, take that <hi>Tender,</hi> which, others, to ſave
themſelves from a little ſuffering, ſwallovved dovvne vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much difficulty; and not have made them the objects of
his ire and indignation, as he hath done, and is doing to
this day. 6. He tells us, that He may aſſert, that the People of
<hi>Scotland</hi> do rather ovve their liberty to him, then he his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to them. But vvhat this bold aſſertor ſayeth, is
not much to be valued; vvho theſe People of <hi>Scotland</hi> are,
vvho ovve their liberty to him, I knovv not, unleſſe he meane
the abjured Prelates, and their baſe naughty, ſcandalous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings,
the ſcumme of the earth, the shame of the Church,
and the diſgrace of the Miniſtry, who novv have freedome
from Church-Diſcipline, and civil cenſures, and licenſe to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105606:88"/>
corrupt the vvord of God, to deſtroy soulls, to tyrannize
over conſciences, to oppreſſe the People, to inſlave the
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and to lead back the People into <hi>Egypt:</hi> And the
dyvour <hi>Lords</hi> and others, vvho becauſe of their licentious,
luxurious, ſenſual and brutish lives, vvhich they lead like ſo
many Epicures, having devoured their ovvne Eſtates, and
are novv ſo drouned in debt, that if the poor could have
but
liberty to ſeek their ovvne, and if juſtice vvere running like a
ſtreame, durſt not be ſeen, muſt novv have acts made in their
favours liberating them from the ſentence of the lavv, and
allovving them to preſſe upon their creditours, the moſt
barren, fruteleſſe, and uſeleſſe of their lands, and that at
tvventy years purchaſe, after they have by manifeſt iniquity,
vvithheld aught yeers annualrent, vvhich is near the equal
half of the principal ſumme; and ſuch others acts of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Is this the liberty he talkes of, That a fevv shall
have liberty to drink avvay and vvith debauchery, deſtroy
the ſubſtance of the land, and vvaſte it upon vvhores and
cups? If theſe ovve that liberty, unto him, I am ſure
he vvill have little reaſon, ere all be done, to ovve his ſtanding
unto them, When the anger of God shall beginner to kindle,
and his vvrath shall be revealed from heaven againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe
and unrighteouſneſſe of men. But laſtly, vvhat if
vve should grant him, vvhat he dar not in plaine tearmes
require: viz. That the King ruleth over us novv <hi>jure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtus?</hi>
Sure he muſt then be <hi>Tyrannus sine titulo,</hi> a Tyrant
vvithout a title: for his old title, being gone and expired, he
had no nevv title vvhereupon to ground the lavvfulneſſe of
his conqueſt, and therefore by his ſcope and drift here, he
proclaimeth a liberty to all the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> to carry
tovvards him, as an uſurper; to ſeek to dethrone him, and
to cut him off: for Polititians vvill grant that a Tyrant vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a title may be ſo dealt with: And thus vve fee that if he
looſe the old fundations, he shakes the throne more then he is
a vvarre of; And as in many other things through this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
ſo in this, he doth his Maſter no good ſervice, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithſtanding
of the great fee he hath gote for his paines.</p>

                  <hi>The ſumme of what followeth,</hi> Pag. 92, 93. <hi>is this</hi> [That
none before King <hi>James 6.</hi> did at their installing enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the People, (except what one ſayeth of <hi>Gregory</hi> the
great, who ſwore to defend the libertyes of the Chriſtian Religion, &amp;c.
which then was Popery) and neither did King <hi>James</hi> himſelf do it,
but only <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Hume</hi> in his name promiſed ſomehing like
it; nay it is doubted, if King <hi>Charles the firſt</hi> did ſweare that

thought his taking of that oath, should have ſubjected him to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
and punitive power of the Subjects, in every caſe, wherein
they or any party of them) being meer private perſons) might think

be avowed, that he did never shrink from the obſervation of that Godly
oath, neither hath his Majeſty who now reigneth ſwerved from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We cannot expect that <hi>Buchanan,</hi> ſtudying
much brevity, would ſet downe all the formalityes that
were uſed at the coronation of the Kings, he only ſatisfying
himſelf with a ſeries of the ſucceeding Kings, and with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of ſome of the moſt remarkable paſſages: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it is no good argument to conclude that no ſuch thing
was; becauſe he doth not make mention thereof. 2. other
hiſtorians name ſome other Kings beſide that <hi>Gregory,</hi> who
tooke an oath at their coronation, as <hi>Corbred</hi> the 21. King,

ſweare an oath at their coronation or not, it is not much to
the matter; for a virtual and implicite Covenant will ground
all which we deſire, and that there was this much, cannot
be denyed, ſeing Kings, who could not reigne, was layd
aſide; others who corrupted government, were purſued,
ſentenced, punished, impriſoned, and killed in battle, or
otherwiſe made to promiſe amendment; And ſeing we

concernment, without the authority of their publick Councel, and should
not rule the Kingdome according to the Counſel of his Domesticks;
That he should manage no publick buſineſſe which belonged to the King,
without the advice and conduct of the Fathers, and should neither make
peace or war, enter into Leagues, or break Leagues by himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the concurrence and command of the Fathers &amp; Heads of tribes.]</hi>
This was a fundamental Law of the Kingdome, and all who
accepted of the crowne thereafter muſt have accepted it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe tearmes, though they had not been in plaine tearm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
expreſſed, So <hi>Durſtus</hi> his Succeſſour did ſweare the ſame,
and therefore in <hi>Mogaldus</hi> the 23. King his dayes, this is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>the ancient cuſtome,</hi> for he <hi>ad conſilia Seniorum omnia ex priſco
more revocavit,</hi> did all by a Parliament according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and received cuſtome: And becauſe <hi>Conarus</hi> the 24.
King neglected, or refuſed to follow this received custome,
he was caſt into priſone; So that the not obſerving of theſe
conditions made them obnoxius unto the coactive power of
the People. So was <hi>Romachus</hi> cenſured by the Parliament
for the ſame crime. So we read of many others cenſured for
their miſdemanurs as <hi>Constantine</hi> the 43. King, <hi>Ferchardus</hi> the
firſt the 52. King, <hi>Ferchardus</hi> the 2. the 54. King, <hi>Eugenius</hi>
the 62. King, <hi>Donaldus</hi> the 70. King, all which inſtances &amp;
many ſuch like, do abundantly cleare that the Kings of old
were under bonds and obligations, if not explicite, yet tacite
unto the People. 4. Whatever can be ſaid concerning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Kings; yet now it is paſt doubt that all our Kings are
bound to ſweare an oath at their coronation, and ſo are under
conditions and Covenant-tyes and obligations, and this is
enough for our preſent purpoſe. 5. It was thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in point of formality &amp; legality that the Earle of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi>
and <hi>Hume</hi> should ſweare in name of the King, at this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation.
[<hi>That he should obſerve the Lawes, and according to
his power should preſerve the doctrine, and rites of Religion, which
were then taught, and publickly received, and oppoſe himſelf to all
which was repugnant thereunto.</hi>] And this was the very ſumme
of that oath, which was afterward concluded in Parliament,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105606:90"/>
to be received by all Kings at their coronation. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why they did not put King <hi>Iames</hi> to that oath thereafter,
was becauſe, he was but once crowned, and the oath was
to be ſworne at the coronation: and when <hi>King Iames</hi> was
crowned, It was done by others for him, as is ſaid.
6. Though this man make a queſtion, whether King <hi>Charles</hi>
did ſwear this oath or not at his coronation, yet it is notoure
that he did, and though he beleevet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that if the King had
thought, that his taking of that oath, should have been ſo
far miſtaken by his Subjects, as that he should have been
thought thereby, to have ſubmitted himſelf to their coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
and punitive power, in every caſe, wherein they or any part
of them might think him deficient, he would rather have
endured any death, then ſo to have caſt himſelf away, at the
pleaſure of malcontented partyes, amongſt the People, taking
advantage againſt him by that oath: (all which we may give
him good leave, to beleeve, for we aſſert no ſuch thing)
yet he muſt ſuffer us to beleeve alſo, upon as good ground,
That if King <hi>Charles</hi> had abſolutely or peremptoriely refuſed
to have taken that oath, or had ſaid, That he would rule as
he liſted, and have no regaird to the eſtablished lawes; and
whould bring in what Religion he pleaſed, though it were
Machometaniſme or Poperie; or that he did not account
himſelf obliged to the Subjects by any oath he could take,
The Nobles and others would have ſcrupled to have given
him the Crowne, and acknowledged him King. And their
after practices declared that they looked upon him, as a King
obliged by tearmes and conditions unto them: which when
he broke, they maintained their right againſt him, with
their ſword, when no other meane could prevaile. 7. Though
it be true, that King <hi>Charles the first</hi> was acknowledged King
ſometime before he was crowned, yet that was with reſpect to
the ſame conditions, unto which he was, by his taking the
place, virtually obliged; and therefore afterward, when
he came to be crovvned, and formally inſtalled, he did alſo
formally and expreſly take on the obligation. And vvhether
he did ever shrink from the obſervance of that godly oath,
let this perfidious man avovv vvhat he vvill, many vvill aſſert
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105606:90"/>
it as certane, in ſome poynts, and too too probable in other.
9. But though he should doubt vvhether any King, before
King <hi>Charles the ſecond,</hi> did ſvveare any oath or Covenant
vvith the People; yet he cannot doubt of vvhat this King
<hi>Charles the ſecond</hi> did: It being being beyond all denyall and
contradiction, That he ſwore both that Oath which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
in King <hi>Iames the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi> his dayes; and alſo the National
Covenant, and the Solemne League and Covenant: and
that according to theſe, the Subjects did ſweare obedience
unto Him: Here was then a mutual conditional Covenant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly,
and in plaine tearmes, with all the ſolemnities ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
entered into: and what needs more to cleare all
which we have ſaid, and to ground all which we would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
to juſtify the late action: For as for his vaine infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
they concerne not us, and more shall be ſpoken of
them afterward. 10. Though this <hi>Surveyer</hi> be ready to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow
that this King hath never ſwerved from the obſervation
of that oath enjoyed <hi>Anno</hi> 1567. yet all the World ſeeth,
that he hath not, as he ought to have done, maintained the true
Religion, nor right preaching, and adminiſtration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
Neither hath he, according to his power, abolished
and withſtood all falſe Religions contrary to the ſame, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the great indulgence, and toleration, if not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
granted to Popery and Papiſts. Neither hath he
ruled us, according to the will of God, but rather perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
us for adhereing to the Word of God: nor hath he
ruled us, by the laudable Lawes and conſtitutions of the
realme, but hath with a packt Parliament, principled to his
minde, overturned our lawes &amp; libertyes, &amp; hath framed &amp;
eſtablished iniquity by a law. 11. But what ſayes he to the
Nat. Cov. &amp; League &amp; Cov.? Dar he avow that he hath not
broken theſe? If he had not, we had not been troubled this day,
with a Popish Prelatical and Malignant faction, nor had we
ſeen theſe abjured and foreſworne Prelates, nor had we ſeen
the work of reformation of religion, in worship, Doctrine.
Diſcipline and Government, ſo overthrowne, overturned and
trode upon, as it is this day. 12. So then, ſeing he cannot
deny, but the King took and ſolemnely ſwore theſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105606:91"/>
and that now he hath openly, and avowedly broken
them, it is undenyable that he hath broken the conditions
on which he was made King: yea, ſeing theſe were the maine
conditions, and the only conditions conſiderable, and were
become the fundamental law of our conſtitution, he hath
violated the principal and only conditions covenanted, and
what we shall hence inferre, we shall now show.</p>
               <p>Having thus vindicated and cleared the premiſes, we shall
draw out our arguments and concluſions thence, and,</p>
               <p>1. If People propoſe conditions and tearmes unto Princes,
to be by them acquieſced in, and ſubmitted unto, and upon
which they are to accept their Crowne and Scepter; Then,
if the Prince of King violate theſe conditions which he once
accepted, and contrare of his promiſe and engagement,
deſtroy what he promiſed to build up; The People may very
lawfully defend themſelves, and theſe good ends, which
they endeavoured to have ſecured, by propoſeing theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
unto the Prince, when he is ſeeking to deſtroy all, even
by force vvhen there is no other remedy. But ſuch is our caſe.
The King vvas formally and expreſly engaged by Compacts
and Covenants to ſecure the Reformed Religion in Doctrine,
Worshipe, Diſcipline, and Government; to ſecure all theſe
vvho owned the ſame, and adhered to the Covenants; and
to ratify and approve all lavves made for theſe Covenants,
and for the ſecurity of ſuch as entered into theſe Covenants:
and novv notvvithſtanding of theſe conditions agreed unto
by him, the Covenant and vvork and all is overturned, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
perſecuted meerly upon the account of their adhereing to
theſe Covenants, all conditions are violated, all Covenants,
Vowes, Compacts, Engagements and vvhat could be deviſed
for ſecurity of the reformation and of the ovvners thereof,
are broken. Who then can condemne even privat perſons if
they ſtand to their defence in this caſe? See <hi>Althuſius polit.
cap.</hi> 38. <hi>n.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>2. If People may lavvfully and laudably defend the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
lavves of the Kingdom, on vvhich the conſtitution
of the Kingdome ſtandeth, and on vvhich the ſecurity of vvhat
is dear to them as men, and as Chriſtians, relveth. Then
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105606:91"/>
the late act cannot be condemned; becauſe, in defending
themſelves, they ſtood for that vvhich vvas the maine and
principal tearme of our conſtitution. But the former is true:
becauſe the Prince violating theſe, deſtroyeth the conſtitution,
and becauſe He cannot do this as a Prince, having already
engaged as a Prince to maintaine the conſtitution, he muſt
do it as a private perſon, or an enemy to the conſtitution and
whole body of the land. Therefore he may wel be reſiſted,
even by private perſones, ſee this fully made out by <hi>Althuſ.
Pol. cap. 38. n. 37.</hi> both out of Lawyers and Divines.</p>
               <p>3. If a People, even by reſiſtence, may defend their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
libertyes and rights, ſecured unto them by Compacts
with the Prince, or by the fundamental lawes of the land,
which the Prince as Prince is bound to maintaine. Then the
late act cannot be condemned: becauſe by it they were but
defending that, which the King had ſecured unto them, by
his compact, and which was ſecured unto them by the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
law of the land. But the former is true: becauſe
a privat perſon is allowed by law to maintaine his Lands and
Rights, even though ſome, in the Kings name, should come,
under whatſoever pretext, to robe and diſpoſſeſſe him, and
shut him to the door. Therefore, this late act, though of
private perſones, cannot be condemned.</p>
               <p>4. If a Prince violating all, or he maine conditions,
upon which he was made Prince, becometh <hi>ſtricto jure</hi> no
Prince, but falleth from his benefice, not having done the
offices, in conſideration of which, he gote that benefice
conferred upon him [<hi>non enim</hi> (ſayeth Althuſ. ubi ſupra)
<hi>commodum debet ſentire ex contractu quem vel omittendo vel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittendo
quis impugnat.</hi>] Then lawfully enough ſuch an one
may be reſiſted, even by Private perſones; as is cleare. But
the former is made clear above: and ſuch is our caſe now;
for the King hath broken, palpably and avowedly, the
maine and principal conditions, on which he was made King,
having overturned the work of reformation, which, if he
had not promiſed, vowed and covenanted to maintaine,
he had never been crowned or admitted to the exerciſe of
that Government. Who then can blaime a People ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105606:92"/>
to their owne defence, when oppresſed and tyrannized
over by his emiſſaries, who hath thus violated the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
and only conditions of the compact, and is force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to the ſame exceſſe of wickedneſſe and perjury?

               <p>5. If when a Prince violateth the maine and principal
conditions, on which he was inſtalled, a People be <hi>ſiricto
jure</hi> liberated from ſubjection unto him. Then much more
may they reſiſt him, when he by his emiſſaries oppreſſeth,
and unjuſtly violenteth them. But we have cleared the former
to be ture. Therefore, ſo is the later. The conſequence
cannot be denyed: for if <hi>ſtricto jure</hi> a people may diſowne a
prince, then much more may they repell his unjuſt violence.
If law admit the more, it will admit the leſſe alſo. The
application of this is cleare from the former.</p>
               <p>6. If the Covenant or Compact, which is betwixt Prince
and People give law-clame to the People to purſue the
Prince., in caſe of failing in the maine and principal thing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted:
Then, ſure the People may reſiſt unjuſt violence;
for they who purſue, for a broken Compact, according to
their clame, may farr more defend their clame when invaded
by force, contrare to the compact. The application of this is
alſo cleare.</p>
               <p>7. Since by this compact, it is clear as <hi>Althuſius</hi> tells us <hi>Pol.
Cap. 19. n. 12.</hi> that the People or Kingdome are the full
Lords proprietors of all the power, and have free liberty to
diſpoſe of it, the frute and emolument thereof redounding to
themſelves, having full power no leſe then any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to manage diſpoſe, and diſpenſe in their owne matters
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105606:92"/>
as they pleaſe. Then when they finde the perſon to whom
the Government is committed by compacts, adminiſtrating
the ſame to their hurt and deſtruction, they may ſee to their
owne good, and not ſuffer themſelves to be deſtroyed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
him who inſtead of a mandatarius and ſervant, turneth a
Tyrant and Enemy.</p>
               <p>8. Since, as the ſame <hi>Althuſius</hi> ſayeth <hi>Ibid. n. 13.</hi> by this
compact it is apparent, that the <hi>Ius</hi> the power or authority,
which is given to the Supream Magiſtrate is not his owne, &amp; is
leſſe then the <hi>Ius</hi> of the People &amp; inferiour to theirs; becauſe it
dependeth upon the free will &amp; preſcription of the People, &amp;
endeth with the death of the prince, who is <hi>Mandatarius;</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>contractus Mandati</hi> uſe to do, and recurreth to its owne
proper Maſter and Lord. Then it cannot be unlawful for the
People the commander here, to ſee to their owne ſaiftie,
and provide that their owne free gift deſtroy them not, and
ſo to reſiſt the Prince abuſeing that power to their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>9. If it be certane (as it is to <hi>Althuſ. Pol. c. 19. n. 47.</hi>) that
the Prince hath no more power given to him by the People,
then what is contained in the conditions upon which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh
the government, and what more he aſſumes, he
uſurpeth by tyranny from the People. Then when he uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
more power then was given to him, he may be reſiſted:
and the People are allowed to preſerve their owne: and
when he ruleth contrare to the conditions, and deſtroyeth
theſe, it is certane He arrogateth to himſelf a power which
was never given to him, yea which was virtually prohibited
and diſcharged to him: and in that caſe may lawfully be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
as is undenyable. The antecedent <hi>Althuſius</hi> proveth in

               <head type="sub">Of the Nature of the Kings Power
over his Subjects. Our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
hence.</head>
               <p>FRom what hath been ſaid in the two former chapters,
vve may ſaifly gather theſe concluſions concerning the
nature of the povver of a Soveraigne over his Subjects, vvhich
vvill yeeld us ſo many arguments, confirming the poynt in
hand.</p>
               <p>1. The Soveraigne's povver over his Subjects, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a <hi>parental</hi> povver, that is, not ſuch a povver as parents
have over their children: for 1. The Soveraigne's power
over the Subjects ariſeth from a voluntary compact, and
conſent of the Subjects, as was shewed; but the Father's
power requireth no ſuch previous conſent or compact.
2. The Soveraigne's power may be reſtricted to ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
by the Subjects; ſo cannot the Father's by the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
3. The Subjects obedience and ſubjections to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
may be conditional; as we have proved, and our
adverſaries will grante it, in limited Princes: but ſo cannot
the ſubjection of Children be. 4. Whetherſoever Children
goe, they keep always the ſame relation to the ſame Parents:
but Subjects may change their Soveraignes, by changing
the places of their habitation. 5. Children can in no caſe
break that relation, which is betwixt their Fathers and them;
but in many caſes, <hi>Royaliſts</hi> themſelves will grant, Subjects
may shake off the King. 6. Children cannot change their Fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
but Subjects may change their Soveraignes; for <hi>Royalists</hi>
wil grant that such as are under an Ariſtocracy may make choiſe
of a Monarch. 7, Children hold their natural being of their
Parents, but Soveraignes are deſigned only for the political or
civil welbeing of the Subjects. 8. Subjects may chooſe what
Soveraignes they will, whether Monarchical or Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and what perſones in this, or that forme: Children can not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105606:93"/>
chooſe what Parents they shall have. 9. Subjects can
condeſcend upon the time how long ſuch an one shall be
their Soveraigne, <hi>ad vitam</hi> or <hi>culpam:</hi> but Children can
not ſet bounds unto their Parents power. 10. Soveraignes
have not begotten all their Subjects, nor doth their relation
or power flow form ſuch an act: but Paternal power doth. 11.
If the Soveraigne's power were paternal only, then he should
not have power of life and death, becauſe parents as ſuch
have not that power over their Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. The <hi>Surveyer</hi>
himſelf granteth this <hi>Pag. 29.</hi> in theſe words. [<hi>Kings are not
fathers of our flesh, or by generation, nor can they be truely called ſo,
political and parental power are different things.</hi>] So then the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne's
power is paternal only in a metaphorical ſence:
becauſe They should have a Fatherly care and inſpection over
their Kingdomes, and should nourish, cherish, love and
governe them tenderly and carefully; and as Parents in ſome
reſpects, love their children better then themſelves, ſo should
they preferre the good of the commonwealth unto their
owne: and upon this account are ſtiled Fathers <hi>Gen.
20. 2. Iudg. 5. 7. 1 Sum. 24. 12. Iſa. 49. 23.</hi> as also <hi>Paſtors</hi>
are.</p>
               <p>2. The Soveraigne's power is not properly <hi>Marital,</hi> or
ſuch as Husbands have over their Wives, for. 1. Wives
cannot limite their Husband's power, as Subjects may limite
their Soveraigne's. 2. Wives cannot preſcribe the time how
long ſuch an one shall be their Husband, as Subjects may do
vvith their Soveraignes. 3. Wives cannot change their
Husbands, as Subjects may change an Ariſtocracy into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.
4. Wives are appoynted for an helpe to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
but the Soveraigne is rather for the Commonvvealth,
then the Commonvvealth for him. 5. If the Soveraigne's
povver vvere ſuch, then he could not have povver of life
and death; for a Husband as ſuch hath not that povver over
his Wife. 6. Though the Husband and the Wife be in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
Kingdomes, the relation ſtandeth, and is not broken
upon that account, but if a ſubject goe out of one Kingdome,
to live into another, he changeth his Soveraigne, and hath a
relation to a nevv Soveraigne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:105606:94"/>
3. So he is but metaphorically, and not properly called
the <hi>Head</hi> of the Commonwealth: for 1. the head is not
made Head by the free choiſe of the Members: but the
Soveraigne is choſen by the People. 2. The Members have
not ſo much as a conſent in ſetting up the Head: but Subjects,
at leaſt, have this much, in ſetting up of Princes 3. the
Members can never change the Head, but Subjects may
change their Soveraignes. 4. The Members can make
no compact with the Head, as Subjects may do with their
Princes. 5. The Members cannot limite the power of the
Head, as Subjects can limite the power of their Princes. 6.
The Members cannot deſtroy the Head and live themſelves,
but Subjects can deſtroy the Monarch and chooſe another.
7. The Head communicateth life, ſenſe &amp; motion to the reſt
of the members; ſo doth not the Prince unto his Subjects. 8.
The ſame individual life is in Head and Members; but not in
King and Subjects. 9. Head and Body die and live together,
but there is no ſuch connexion betwixt King and Subjects.
So then he is but a metaphorical Head, ſo called, becauſe of
his ſupereminency, He is over the civil body to rule and guide
it aright.</p>
               <p>4. The Soveraigne hath no <hi>Lordly, dominative, or maſterly</hi>
power over the Bodyes of his Subjects. For 1. this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is founded upon the law and light of pure nature, but
this maſterly dominion is a frute of ſin. 2. Slavery being
againſt nature, &amp; a bondage, which all would willingly shun,
we cannot ſuppoſe that rational people would chooſe that life,
if they could help it: but they willingly, &amp; not out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
chooſe government &amp; governours 3. The people in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a Soveratigne propoſe their owne good &amp; have their
owne ends, but if the Soveraigne's power were properly a
maſterly power, they should propose rather his good then
their owne in ſetting him up. 4. If his power were a maſterly
power, their condition after the government were eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
should be worſe, then it was before: for their ſtate of
liberty was preferable to their ſtate of bondage. 5. They
had not acted rationally, if to be free of oppreſſion of
others, they had willingly given up themſelves unto an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour,

<hi>Surveyer Pag.</hi> 30. 31. granteth that there is a great difference
betwixt Magiſtratical power and Maſterly, and giveth three
maine differences. 1. That the Maſter of ſlaves had his
owne profite mainly before his eyes, and the profite of the
Slaves only ſecondarily: But the Magiſtrates power is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
ordinated to the Publick good of the Community it
ſelf, and only ſecondarily and conſequentially to the good of
Himſelf. 2. That Maſters had a greater power over the
bodyes and goods of theſe, who were their Slaves, then a
Magiſtrate can clame over Subjects. 3. The Maſter had
the ſlaves in ſubjection to him, more out of feare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
then love or delight: But a King hath his Subjects
under him, in a civil, free, liberal, voluntary, and loving
ſubjection. Thus we see this point is cleare and undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by him, though other <hi>Royaliſts</hi> will not grant ſo much:
but ſure if they were his ſlaves, they behoved to be taken in
war or bought with money.</p>
               <p>5. Neither hath he a <hi>deſpotick &amp; maſterly power</hi> over the <hi>go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his Subjects, what ever uſe may be allowed to make
of them, in caſe of neceſſity (when, in ſome reſpect, all
things are common) for the Common good, and good not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105606:95"/>
only of the owners, but alſo of all the Community. Yet the
Subjects are righteous proprietors of their owne goods.
For 1. the People make choiſe of him, for this very end
to preſerve them in their rights, to keep their rights invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
to keep them from oppreſſion and injuries of others;
ſo that it cannot be imagined that rational People would make
choiſe of one great robber, to preſerve them from leſſer rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
2. Their caſe should be rather worſe as better, by the
erecting of a civil government, if the Soveraigne were the
only proprietor of all their goods for before the erection they
had a juſt right and title unto their owne goods. 3. Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes
should not be a bleſſing unto a People, but a curſe:
Which is falſe. 4. Then they could wrong no man take what
they would from him, contrare to <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3: 3. <hi>Eſai</hi> 3: 14, 15.

5. The law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. contradicteth this maſterly power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Subjects goods. 6. <hi>Ahab</hi> was blaimed for taking
<hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyaird. 7. This is the very character of a Tyrant,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 8. The Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> had not his propriety,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 9. No man might then defend his owne right by
law againſt the Soveraigne, but he might take what he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
from whom he pleaſed, and give to whom he pleaſed.
10. Then the King could not properly buy or ſell with his
Subjects. 11. Nor could Subjects make any barganes amongſt
themſelves without his conſent. 12. Nor could they exerce
any acts of charity; becauſe charity muſt be of Mens owne, <hi>Eſa</hi>
58: 7. <hi>Ecc.</hi> 11: 1. 13. Yea, Subjects could neither perform a duty,
nor fail in a duty, in the matter of goods, if all were his. 14.
Subjects could not be enjoyned to pay tribute unto the Prince,
contrare to <hi>Rom.</hi> 13: 6. 15. It is contrare both to the Law of
God and nature: ſee <hi>Timpl. ubi ſupra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Hence Soveraignes are not proper <hi>proprietors</hi> of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
Becauſe 1. there are other qualifications required of
them, then is required of ordinary proprietors. 2. The People
then could never change their Soveraignes. 3. The Soveraigne
might ſell and diſpone his Kingdomes, as he pleaſed, which
<hi>Royaliſts</hi> themſelves wil not grant. 4. Kingdomes then should
come in amongſt <hi>bona fortuna.</hi> 5. His place should not be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105606:95"/>
properly a function or office, but a proper poſſeſſion. 6. Sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Kings both in <hi>Scotland</hi> &amp; elſewhere, have been hindered from
dilapidating the revenues of the crovvne, or by gifts and other
contracts deteriorating the Kingdome, and punished for ſo
doing. 7. Would rational men give themſelves up for a prey
to one, that they might be ſaife from becoming a prey to
others? 8. How should then a Soveraigne be choſen for the
good of the Kingdom, if he might do with it what he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſell it, or diſpone it to the <hi>Turk:</hi> or ſuch like. 9. <hi>Paul,</hi> by
commanding that tribute &amp; cuſtome be given to him, ſuppon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſome other thing: ſee <hi>Althuſ. poli. cap.</hi> 24. <hi>n.</hi> 35, 37.</p>
               <p>7. Nor ſo much as <hi>uſufructuaryes:</hi> For 1. they may not lay
their Kingdomes in pledge, as an uſufructuary may do. 2. Nor
can they give them freely away. Nor 3. may they do with them
what they pleaſe, as uſufructuaryes may do with what they
have by that right: See <hi>Iun. Brut. vind. cont. Tyr. q.</hi> 3. <hi>p. (mihi)</hi> 205.</p>
               <p>8. The Soveraigne's power is properly a <hi>fiduciary</hi> power,
ſuch as the power of a Tutor of Patron, for to this end &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
was He created of the People that he might defend them
from injuries and oppreſſions. He is appoynted over them by
God for their good, and is to ſeek that mainly. 2. though he
hath his power by way of compact, yet it is not a compact <hi>ex
condigno,</hi> ſuch as betwixt buyer and ſeller, upon valuable
prices and conſiderations 3. His power is limited &amp; reſtricted
and he is bound to conditions, as we shewed. 4. He may not
(as was ſaid) diſpose of his Subjects, and of their lives as he
pleaſeth. 5 if he ſell his Kingdomes, <hi>Royaliſts</hi> grant he may be
dethroned; therefore he hath no other power then of a Tutor,
Publick Servant, or Watchman, 6. His power is over his
Subjects, as it is over the law of <hi>God</hi> and religion, but over
thoſe he hath no other power, but a miniſterial Tutory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power:
He is to take care for them <hi>ex officio,</hi> as a ſpecial

                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:105606:96"/>
1. If it be lawful for Children to reſiſt their Father, when
enraged againſt them, and ſeeking in his fury, to deſtroy and
cut them off, whithout any violation of the Law of God
enjoyning Children to obey, and be ſubject to, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in the Lord; Then it is lawful for Subjects though
private perſons, to reſiſt the fury of their enraged Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
when he is ſeeking, in his cruelty and rage, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to compact, oathes and vowes, to deſtroy Them and
their Religion. But the former is true. Therefore &amp;c.
The Aſſumption cannot be denyed by any rational perſon.
It being moſt juſt and rational, that when the Father is taken
with a diſtemper in his braine, and in his madneſſe ſeeketh to
deſtroy or cut the throates of his Children, They may joyne
together, binde his hands, pull the weapon out of his hand and
defend themſelves the beſt way they can. The connexion
of the propoſition is certane; for, the moſt the adverſaries
can make of the Soveraignes power is that it is <hi>paternal,</hi> and
that he is <hi>parens patriae</hi> the Father of the Commonwealth: &amp;
yet ſeing natural Fathers may be reſiſted by their natural
Children, in caſe of neceſſity, without the help or conduct of
Magiſtrates: Why may not alſo private Subjects, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the conduct of a Parliament, defend of themſelves, in caſe
of neceſſity, againſt the fury and rage of their civil father,
when he by his bloody emiſtaries, is ſeeking to undoe them?
But next we may draw the argument from the leſſe to the
more. If it be lawful for Children, in caſes of neceſſity,
to defend themſelves againſt, and to reſiſt the unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of their enraged Father: Then much more is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
for private ſubjects, in caſes of neceſſity, without the
conduct of Parliament, to defend themſelves againſt and
to repel the unjuſt violence of their Soveraigne. For there
is not ſuch a connection betwixt the Soveraigne and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
as betwixt Parents and their Children, as we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
cleared: And againe, if ſome of the Children may
reſiſt the unjuſt violence of their Parent and of others of their
Brethren, joyning with their enraged Father to cut them off,
that they alone may enjoy the whole inheritance or for ſome
ſuch ends: Then far more may a part of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105606:96"/>
reſiſt the Prince's unjuſt Tyranny, though he hath the
other parts of the Commonwealth concurring with him, to
their deſtruction: For the argument followeth, as I ſaid,
<hi>à; minori ad majus,</hi> from the leſſe to the more: And the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
tye &amp; relation betwixt Brethren, Sones of the ſame
Father, is as great, yea greater, then the tye, union and
relation betwixt one part of the Commonwealth &amp; another;
this relation being but political and in itſelf no wayes indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble,
but the other natural and indiſſoluble.</p>
               <p>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If Wives may lawfully defend themſelves againſt the
manifeſt and unjuſt violence of unnatural and enraged Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and repel, in caſe of neceſſity, violence with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
without the conduct or concurrence of other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.
Then it is no leſſe, yea much more, lawful for meere
Private Subjects, in caſes of neceſſity, to reſiſt without the
help and conduct of a Parliament, the furious and unjuſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
of their enraged Soveraigne. But the former is true,
as all will grant. Therefore, &amp;c. The propoſition is
cleare from this. That there is not ſo great a tye betwixt Prince
and Subjects, as betwixt Husband and Wife: And ſay
that he had an equal power over his Subjects, with that which
the Husband hath over his Wife (which is falſe,) yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
will be firme, as to a lawfulneſſe in this caſe, as wel as
in the other.</p>
               <p>3. If there be not ſuch a connexion betwixt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
and his Subjects, as is betwixt the natural Head,
and the Body. Then it can no more yea, far leſſe, be an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
thing for Subjects to defend themſelves againſt the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of diſtempered Princes, Who ſeek directly to deſtroy
the Commonwealth, when neceſſity doth urge; Then it is
for the members of the Body, to defend and fortify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt danger, paine or ſickneſſe, occaſioned by a
diſtemper of the braine, yea and with violence ſeek to cure &amp;
remove that diſtemper in the head, that is like to deſtroy the
whole body.</p>
               <p>4. If the Soveraigne hath not a Lordly domination, &amp;
maſterly power over his Subjects, but they be is Brethren &amp;
not his Slaves; and, if the very Law will allow Servants to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105606:97"/>
defend themſelves againſt their Lords and Maſters, <hi>L. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime</hi>
35. <hi>de Rel. &amp; ſumpt. funer.</hi> and no man with us will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it unlawful for ſervants to defend themſelves againſt
the unjuſt and violent aſſaults of their Lords and Maſters.
Then farr leſſe can it be accounted unlawful for private Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to defend themſelves, when conſtrained with neceſſity,
againſt the unjuſt aſſaults of the Soveraigne or his emiſlaries.
But the Antecedent is cleared, and confeſſed. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. If the Soveraigne have no deſpotick or Maſterly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over the goods and heritages of his Subjects, as we have
proved. Them very lawfully may they defend their lands
goods and heritages, from the violent and unjuſt oppreſſions;
of the Prince or his emiſſaries, ſent out to plunder, rob, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
their corns, cattel, goods, land ſummes of money, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6. If the Kingdome be not his proper heritage, nor he
proprietor thereof, as was shewed; Then when He or his
Emiſſaries come to deſtroy a conſiderable part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and to alienate the profites and emoluments thereof
unto others, then the proper owners and proprietors, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly.
Then may that part of the Kingdome lawfully reſiſt
theſe unjuſt oppreſſours and invaders, &amp; defend their owne.</p>
               <p>7. If He be not ſo much as an uſufructuary of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
then when He laboureth by his Emiſſaries to waſte
and deſtroy the Kingdome or any part thereof, by unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
private Subjects may reſiſt that unjuſt violence, and
oppoſe his oppreſſing Emiſſaryes. If a Maſter may hinder
his uſufructuary tennants who would deteriorate the land,
which they poſſeſſe by compact; Then much more may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
reſiſt the Princes Emiſſaries when labouring utterly to
ſpoile, and lay waſte theſe lands, whereof he is not ſo much
as an uſufructuary:</p>
               <p>8. If the King's power be only <hi>fiduciary</hi> as is shewed. Then
when that power is manifeſtly abuſed, and the pawne which
he hath gote to keep, in imminent and manifeſt danger, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
enough may he be reſiſted; When the Lives, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the People, or their Religion is committed unto
him, as to a publick Tutor, Watchman, or Servant; &amp; He
what through negligence, what through wilful wickedneſſe,
laboureth to deſtroy, and undoe, and overturne all, very
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105606:97"/>
lawfully may Subjects, in that caſe of extreame neceſſity,
ſeek to ſecure the Neceſſary and deſireable things, and reſiſt
his fury and unjuſt violence, who contrare to his oath and

nothing againſt it, that I have obſerved.</p>
               <p>That it is a truth, That the peoples ſaifty is the cardinal law,
hence appareth, 1. That the attaineing of this end, was the
maine ground and motive of the peoples condeſcending upon
the conſtitution. 2. They levelled at his end, in makeing
choyſe of ſuch a forme, and not of another; for had they
thought another fitter for their temper, and more conduceing
for their good, they had not pitched on this, but on that.
3. with an eye to the ſaife and ſure attaineing of this end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and deſigned, they made choiſe of ſuch perſones, and
of none elſe. 4. upon this account, did they condeſcend upon
that manner of conveyance of the ſupream authority, which
they thought beſt, 5. For no other end, was it, that
the Prince was limited and bound unto conditions. 6.
The end being alwayes preferable to the meanes as ſuch,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105606:98"/>
The Peoples ſaifty, which is the end, muſt be preferred to
all ſuch things as are made uſe of as meanes conduceing to this
end. 7. By the very Law and inſtitution of God, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate

1. <hi>e [I have told that this axiome is come to our hands from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and now I adde, that in the 3 book of Cicero de legibus that
ſentence is friſt found, for any thing I know; yet, as he teſtifieth
himſelf, taken out of the ancient lawes of that nation, and copied
out of the very letter of the law. Now this Cicero after he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
and explained, in the preceding book, the lawes pertaining
to Religion and the worshiping of the Gods, at length? in the third
book, he comes to rehearſe theſe lawes which concearne the Republick and
the Magiſtrates, where theſe words are to be found.</hi> Regio Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio
duo ſunto, iique praeeundo, judicando, conſulendo,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105606:99"/>
praetores judices conſules appellantor, militiae ſummum jus
habento, nemini parento, ollis (i.e. illis) ſalus populi ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
lex eſto <hi>he ſayes, to theſe the chief law should be the peoples
ſaifty: Now who are theſe? thoſe, viz. Who were endued with
King'ly power, and had the chief diſpoſall of the militia, &amp;c.</hi>]
It vvill then be as cleare as can be, that the oppoſite which
is added or annexed, doth ſufficiently show that the vvord
<hi>People</hi> in this axiome, is to be taken for the People, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguished
from the Magiſtrates, and not for People
and Magiſtrate conjunctly; far leſſe for the <hi>Prince</hi> as diſtinct
from the <hi>People.</hi> And doth not this ſame ſentence of <hi>Cicero's</hi>
fully confirme our Gloſſe, and ſay that Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
as ſuch, ought mainly to deſigne the good of the
People, over whom they are ſet, &amp; to have that for their
end in all their publick actings, whether in making, or in
executing lawes? How then can he ſay that this axiome is
rather to be underſtood of the Prince alone, then of the
People alone? But for this he tells us, That the ancient
Fathers did eſteem of them as next unto God ad inferiour to
him only, and that the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18: 3. Did
preferre the ſaifty of the King unto the ſaifty of all the reſt,
and in the <hi>Lament.</hi> 4: 20. He is called <hi>the breath of our nostrils.</hi>
To all which it is eaſily anſwered, 1. That all this will not
prove, that Princes are bound by reaſon of their office,
only to ſeek their owne good, greatneſſe and power; or to
preferre that unto the good of the People; and not rather
deſigne, as their proper and principal end, the promoving
of the good and ſaifty of the People committed to their
charge. 2. The Fathers might have ſpoken ſo of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
as they were then <hi>de facto</hi> and in regaird of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminency,
but notwithſtanding of that, they and their
ſupereminency both, was ſubordinate unto the good of the
People, and was <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> but a meane for that maine
and great good. 3. It is true in ſome caſes, and at ſuch a nick
of time, as that was 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. The loſſe of a good King, when
he is the maine perſon hunted for by the adverſaries, would
prove more deſtructive to the Commonwealth, then the loſſe
of ten thouſand, and this rather confirmeth the axiome then
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105606:99"/>
weakeneth it, for it was upon the account of the publick good
of the Commonwealth, that the life of King <hi>David</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to the lives of many. 4. It is not ſaid, that His life was
better then, and preferable to, the lives of the whole body of
the Commonwealth. 5. That metaphorical expreſſion <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
4. she weth only how uſeful &amp; ſteadable the King would
be unto them; even a neceſſary mean to keep them in a politick
life as to a Commonwealth; and ſo it ſayeth that, his whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
as a Magiſtrate should be to procure their good. 6. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
a good Prince did preferre the Peoples life unto his owne:
and <hi>David did</hi> the ſame 1. <hi>Chron</hi> 12: 17. and theſe do abundantly
confirme our ſenſe. He replyeth further; That it was no
wonder that among the <hi>Romans</hi> from whom we have this axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome,
the Peoples ſaifty was the principal law, ſeing in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical
government, the People were the Supreame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
<hi>Anſ.</hi> This is but a meer shift; for even in a democrat. go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernm.
the Peoples ſaifty is diſtinguished from the Supreame
power which is to level all to this maine end, the ſaifty of the
People. 2. <hi>Cicero</hi> told us that the Conſuls and Praetors were
bound to propose this end unto themſelves; &amp; ſo we finde that
the People, whoſe ſaifty is the Supream law, are diſtinguished
from theſe who, whether in a Popular or Ariſtocratical govern.
excerced the ſupreame povver. 3. This ſame is inſert in the
law of the XII tables, &amp; ſo it was in force whatever forme of
government was exerced. But ſyes he <hi>Prael.</hi> 9. §. 19. Hence
it will not follow, That People may, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
or cry out that they perceive their libertyes hurt in
ſome things; take armes without the Princes leave, and
violate all lawes and dutyes, and ſo raiſe tumults and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>Anſ.</hi> Neither do we ſay ſo, nor reſolve to draw any ſuch
concluſions therefrom; but this is cleare, that when the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted
work of reformation is overturned, laudable lawes
eſtablishing the ſame, contrary to oath, and ſolemne Enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement,
reſcinded, libertyes palpably violated, People in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
perſecuted for adhereing to their Covenants, &amp;c. and
unjuſtly oppreſſed by the Kings emiſſaries, people may then take
armes in their own defence, though the King should refuſe
to conſent, or should countenance the oppreſſours, &amp; carry
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105606:100"/>
on that inſlaving courſe. Againe, he ſayes let any read,
and read over againe that ſentence of <hi>Cicero</hi> and ſearch every
pairt of it, where vvill he finde any vvarrand for Subjects to
riſe up againſt princes, to injure them or dethrone them. <hi>Anſ</hi>
We do not intend to ſearch the ſentence for that end, it vvill
ſuffice us, if hence vve finde ground to conclude the lavvful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Peoples defending themſelves againſt tyrannizeing
Princes, in caſes of neceſſity: and let him, or any for him,
read, and better read that vvhole period, and narrovvly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
and examine every ſentence and vvord in it, and ſee if he
can finde this condemned.</p>
               <p>Ere I come to ſpeak to the other particular, I shall
from this draw ſome few things uſeful for our purpoſe,
and,</p>
               <p>1. It is irrational, and meer flattery to cry up and exalt
the Soveraignes prerogative, in prejudice, and to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of that, for which both He and His Prerogatives
are, and were appoynted, as ſubſervient meanes, <hi>the ſaifty
of the People.</hi> That being <hi>de jure</hi> his maine end, and it being
for this cauſe end, that he is endued with ſuch power,
and hath ſuch privileges and prerogatives conferred upon
him, and allowed unto him, He and his Prerogatives both,
should vaile unto this Supreame Law <hi>the ſaifty of the People:</hi>
ſo that when they come in competition, The Peoples ſaifty
<hi>of right,</hi> is to have the preheminence.</p>
               <p>2. Since all other lawes municipal, made and eſtablished in
a free Realme, muſt be ſubordinate unto this Principal,
and Cardinal law, and have tendency to promove, corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
and eſtablish it: Then, when any of theſe Lawes,
in their letter, ſtrick directly at the root of the ſaifty of the
People, and thoward and croſſe that maine and higheſt law,
That law is <hi>Eaienus</hi> null, and really no law. So that it is
but childish ſcrupuloſity, to ſtart at the letter of a law,
when the Commonwealth is in hazard: and it is but brutish
ignorance to object the letter of a low againſt ſuch as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
the ſaifty of the people, which is the maine bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
and to preſerve the Commonwealth from ruine;
and deſtruction, againſt which no law is, or can be, of any
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105606:100"/>
force or value, but null and of no effect, for here it holdeth
true, that <hi>ſummum jus</hi> is <hi>ſumma injuria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Since Lawes themſelves, when in their letter they
croſſe this maine law, muſt be accounted as no lowes really,
and <hi>de jure;</hi> and may ſaifly be neglected and paſſed over,
when the Peoples ſaifty is in no ſmall hazard by the ſtrick
adhereing to the letter thereof? Then, much more may
punctilioes, and law formalities be laid aſide, when the
Commonwealth is in danger. When there is a fire in a
City, all the formalities of order are not ſtrickly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>4. Since The privileges, and lawful prerogatives of the
Soveraigne muſt vaile, in caſes of neceſſity, unto this High
and Supreame Law, <hi>the ſaifty of the People.</hi> Then no leſſe
muſt the privileges of a Parliament yield unto this: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
privilege they enjoy, it is in order to this end, and
the meanes muſt alwayes have a ſubſerviency unto the end,
and when they tend to the deſtruction of the end, they are
then as no meanes unto that end, nor to be made uſe of for
that end.</p>
               <p>5. Though King and Parliament both should conſpire
together againſt the good of the Land, yet <hi>di jure</hi> they have
no power or authority to deſtroy that End, and whatever
they enact or doe, tending to the ruine of this maine and
principal good, which they should have before their eyes,
as their end, is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> null.</p>
               <p>6. When acts and actings of King and Parliament tend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
and are made and done of purpoſe, to deſtroy and
overthrow the work of reformation in doctrine, worshipe,
diſcipline and government; which was owned, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by lawes, with all formalities of law, and was
avowed by ſolemne vowes, Covenants, atteſtations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
declarations, and engagements of all ranks of
People, from the higheſt to the loweſt: and courſes are
laid doune, to force and conſtraine People to renunce their
Covenant with God, to turne perjured apoſtates; and when
by acts and actings, the fundamental tearmes &amp; conditions of
our reformed conſtitution, confirmed by unrepelable lawes,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105606:101"/>
by the King's accepting of his Crowne and Scepter, and
all other Magiſtrates accepting their places, upon theſe
tearmes, are overturned; and when by an arbitrary and illegal
tyranny, no man hath ſecurity for his life, his lands, his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertyes,
nor his religion, is not the ſaifty of the People in
danger? No man needs to ſay who shall be judge, The
Magiſtrates or the people? For all who have eyes to ſee
may judge, whether the Sun be shineing or not, and all
who have common ſenſe may judge in this caſe. When theſe
things are done and avowed, they cannot be denyed, and no
man of reaſon or religion will deny the inference.</p>
               <p>Hence then it is cleare, that no man in reaſon can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the late act of defence, which was the only meane
left for preſerving of that which all government and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
should level at, viz. <hi>The ſaifty of the People, both in ſoull
and body,</hi> their Religion, Lives, Liberties, Privileges,
Poſſeſſions, Goods, and what was deare to them as men,
and as Chriſtians, howbeit it vvanted the formality of the
authority of Soveraine, Parliament or Councel. No man
vvho vvill not deny this axiome, can condemne them as Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ſeing they vvere noble Patriots and loyall to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
lavv, <hi>The ſaifty of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the other particular, concerning the abſolute power
of the Soveragne, We ſay.</p>
               <p>1. That the Soveraigne is under obligations to his
People, and bound &amp; limited by conditions, we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above: which conditions he is bound to obſerve, ſee
<hi>Hoen Diſp. Pol.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>2. That the Soveraigne is not exempted from the lawes
of God, none but profane graceleſſe, vvreatches vvill deny;
ſince he is a creature of God's and a ſubject to him, and his
ſervant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and therefore muſt not tranſgreſſe his
lawes, under the paine of high treaſon and laeſe Majeſty.

and elſwhere.</p>
               <p>3. Neither is he exempted from the Lawes of Nature and
Nations; for the law of nature is the very Law of God, and
God hath no where Subjected his Law unto the vvill of
Princes.</p>
               <p>4. Neither is the exempted from all the civil Lavves, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Hoenon. ubi ſupra.</hi> For, ſayes he, many civil Lavves are
but declarative of the Lavv of nature, and conſectaryes
thereof, and vvhat povver he hath, he hath from the People,
and the People are certanely bound by theſe Lavves: Yea as
<hi>Boxhornius</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Inſtit. Polit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 33. <hi>Principi tantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo
licet quantum populus ei voluit licere:</hi> No more is lawful
for him then the People will. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> in the forecited
place ſayeth, [<hi>It is a Royal thing for a King to live by the ſame
good Lawes, which are given by him to the People, and it is of effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
influence upon them; to move them to walk in their dutyes order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
Rex tenetur ſervare Leges, ſi non ut Leges tamen ut ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones.
But he might know that our King is bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Lawes, even as Lawes, and muſt pay his debt, and
ſubmit to the deciſion of Judges as well as others.</p>
               <p>5. Our <hi>Surveyer</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 75. That the King is
bound before God to rule his People according to the Law
of God, of reaſon and nature; yea and to take his directions
in government, from the rational Lawes of the Kingdome
(which are deductions from, or determinations of, the
Law of God, reaſon and nature, to particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances)
agreed to by the conſent and good likeing of his
People. Hence it followeth, 1. That he cannot diſpenſe,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105606:102"/>
by his prerogative Royal, with a juſt Law, according to
his ſole pleaſure, and ſo pardon ſuch as deſerve death? 2.
He cannot kill and ſlay whom he will, but according to
law. 3. Nor can he alone make lawes. 4. Nor can his
will ſtand for a law. 5. Nor is he the ſole interpreter of
the law. 6. Nor in interpreting of the law, hath he a
dominion over it to expone it as he wil: for if theſe be not
granted, it cannot be granted that he is bound to rule us by
the Law of God, of reaſon, and of nature, or by the
Lawes of the Kingdome, but according to his meer will
and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>6. It muſt be a moſt unreaſonable thing to ſay, That the
Soveraignes power is abſolute, which Royaliſts contend ſo
much for, and ſay that he is above all law of man; for then
he might do what he pleaſed without controle. But 1. did
ever the People ſet a Soveraigne over themſelves, upon theſe
tearmes? Did ever People ſet him over themſelves to rage at
randon, to kill, murther, maſſacre, and do what ſeemed
good in his eyes? 2. Their condition should neceſſarily,
be worſe after the conſtitution then it was before. 3. The
ſaifty of the People should not be the ſupreame Law. 4.
He might then break all bonds and oathes, and keep no
conditions which he had made. 5. If ſo, a Prince as a
Prince, should be a great plague and judgment to a People.
6. All his Subjects should be formal Slaves unto him,
their lives &amp; all they have should be at his devotion. 7. He
should not then be the Servant of God for the good of the
People, contrare to <hi>Rom.</hi> 13: 4. 8. If this power agree to him
as King, then it is from God, and ſo God should give him a
power to ſin and tyrannize, which is moſt falſe. 9. Then
there could be no Tyrants. 10. Yea a King as a King, should
be a Tyrant <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> and a Tyrant should be nothing
but a King <hi>in actu exercito.</hi> 11. Yea if ſo, they might not ſo
much as be rebuked by the meſſengers of the Lord, for their
enormities, contrare to the many inſtances in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
of Prophets rebuking Princes 12 if his power were
abſolute, lawes would become no lawes, neither were
there need of lawes, nor should the making of lawes be a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105606:102"/>
meane to promove the good of the Realme: all which are
moſt abſurd.</p>
               <p>And as for for our King That he hath no ſuch prerogative
Royal, as puts him above all limitations is already ſufficiently
evidenced by <hi>Lex Rex</hi> and by the <hi>Apology</hi> though this <hi>Surveyer</hi>
is pleaſed to ſay <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. That <hi>his prerogative Royal is diſputed
downe most weakly and foolishly in the Apology:</hi> Yet he will not
ſee ſo much weakneſſe and folly there, as he imagineth,
when ever he cometh to handle that diſput. But I grant it is
eaſier to him to ſay, that all is weak and foolish, which
pleaſeth nor him, then to undertake the confutation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
It is enough to him, that he shew his teeth once, and
then run away. But if he will afterward undertake that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
let him conſider the particulars there mentioned, and

               <p>If this <hi>Surveyer</hi> hath a minde to defend the King's civil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
royal, or his abſolute power, Let him take all
theſe particulars to his conſideration: but we goe on to our
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid concerning this limited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Kings we draw theſe particulars for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>1. If the King be a limited Prince, Then he may in ſome
caſes be lawfully reſiſted. <hi>Gerhard</hi> himſelf <hi>de Magiſtrat. Pol.</hi>
§. 484. <hi>pag.</hi> 1303. in anſwering of that quaeſtion what shall
Subjects do, if a Magiſtrate, who is an infidel or an haeretick,
doth force them unto a falſe religion, ſayeth That <hi>ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
who hath abſolute and unlimited power, and is under no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts
may not be reſiſted, by ſuch as are meer Subjects:</hi> So that he
would grant in this caſe That it is lawful, for meer private
Subjects to reſiſt a limited Prince, who is bound by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts
and contracts. It is true when he cometh afterward
to ſpeak of reſiſting a Tyrant, and proponeth the quaeſtion
§. 486. whether ſuch who have abſolute power and turne
Tyrants may be reſiſted, after he hath cited ſome ſayings
of Papiſts, he tells us §. 487. That all the arguments of <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Brutus, Roſſaeus, Buckerius</hi> are ſolidly anſwered by <hi>Barclaius
Albericus Gentilis, Cunerus</hi> and <hi>Arniſaeus,</hi> and this paſſage our
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105606:104"/>
                  <hi>Surveyer</hi> bringeth in <hi>Pag. 89.</hi> But who ſeeth not, that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not at all home to our purpoſe, ſeing our King is not a King
of abſolute power, though he hath his Kingdom by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but is limited by conditions, and ſtipulations. And
further every one may ſee the weakneſſe of <hi>Gerhard's</hi> reaſons,
and how inconſiſtent he is with himſelf: For. 1. Sayeth
he, ſuch is only under Gods juriſdicton. But alas 1. May
not I reſiſt, a perſon, vvho is not under my juriſdiction? 2.
Royaliſts will ſay the ſame of all Princes, even <hi>Barclaus</hi> and
<hi>Arniſaeus.</hi> Againe he ſayes The People have tranſlated their
whole power unto ſuch a Prince &amp; cannot recall it. But 1.
They have never tranſlated over unto him a power to inſlave
themſelves, for that was not in their power to do. Nor
2. Could they ever give away the power of ſelf defence,
which is their birth right. 3. Sayes he, Subjects, in this
caſe, want God's command and a Superiour power. But
1. They have God's command in nature, no leſſe then theſe
who are under limited Princes. 2. They have a ſuperior
virtual power in caſes of neceſſity. 4. Sayes he, He is a
Father of the Republict and not a Tutor only, and therefore
as Children have no power over their Parents, no more have
Subjects over their Princes. But, 1. Are not even limited
Princes, as well Fathers to the Commonwealth? So that
by this argument, it shall be as unlawfull to reſiſt theſe,
which he will not ſay. 2. Yea ſuch abſolute Princes Look
rather to be Tygers, and ſtated enemies unto the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
then Fathers. 3. They have no proper Parental
power, as we shewed, but Metaphorical. 4. Even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
parents may be reſiſted <hi>Ergo</hi> much more they. 5. We
are not ſpeaking of giving judgment againſt Tyrants but of
reſiſting of them: and if he grant this, vve have our deſire.
And his queſtion vvas touching reſiſtence §. 485. <hi>Quest.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>2. A Limited and pactional Prince may be legally reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Ergo alſo with force when a legal reſiſtence cannot be
had. The antecedent is true and no <hi>Scottish</hi> man vvill deny it,
as to our king: For if he or any for him should pretend a
right to their inheritance and intend an action of lavv againſt
them, they may defend themſelves by lavv; or if he should
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105606:104"/>
take poſſeſſion vvithout a ſentence of lavv, They might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
him and his tennants, or vvho ever came in his name,
to take violent poſſeſſion, and procure letters of ejection, and
the like: Yea by force they might vvithſtand any that
should come to take violent and illegal poſſeſſion. The
conſequence is hence clear, That vvhatever ground a
man hath to defend his rights and poſſeſſion by lavv, the
ſame ground he hath to defend his right by force, vvhen
he cannot uſe the legal meane; for if the King had real right,
and not he, unto vvhat he poſſeſſeth, it vvere as unlavvful
to vvithhold the King from poſſeſſion of his ovvne, by
quircks of lavv, as by force. Againe, This legal reſiſtence is
no reſiſting of the Ordinance of God, but of the man, vvho
ſeeketh no enjure. No more is this violent reſiſtance a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ordinance of God, but only of the man, vvho
abuſeth his povver. Hence,</p>
               <p>3. If the King have not abſolute power to do and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what he will: Then, when he croſſeth the rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by God's law and Man's law, without any injury
offered to the ordinance of God, he may be reſiſted by his
Subjects, over whom he thinketh to exerce an abſolute, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
and tyrannical power. The reaſon is becauſe. That
power, which is not the ordinance of God, may be reſiſted,
without the leſt injury done unto the true ordinance of God.
But this abſolute power is no ordinance of God, it is not
appoynted of him, nor allowed of him. Therefore, &amp;c.
But ſay Royaliſts, Though that abſolute and Tyrannical
power be not ſimply from God; yet it is ſo from God, that
no man can lawfully reſiſt it <hi>Anſw,</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it be ſo from God,
as that it may not be reſiſted, then it is from God, and is
the ordinance of God: for it is the ordinance of God that
cannot, muſt not, be reſiſted. But ſayes the <hi>Surveyer Pag. 37.
[It may be eaſily ſeen that ſubjection to the power (oppoſite to reſiſtence)
is all alongs enjoyned (viz. Rom. 13.) whether the power be rightly
uſed or otherwiſe: If it be rightly uſed, ſubjection without refuſeing
active obedience is required: if it be not rightly uſed, ſubjection
without reſiſtence, violent or forcible repelling of the power, is required
upon this formal reaſon and ground; Becauſe even when the power
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105606:105"/>
is abuſed, it remaines a power ordained of God; (although the abuſe
of it be not ordained) even as a man's eye remaines his eye, although
ſometimes it is not rightly uſed. The formal reaſon of the ſubjection,
and non-reſiſtence preſſed, is not the right uſe of the power, but becauſe
it is a power ordained of God (however perverted in the uſe by man)
Anſw.</hi>] 1. By this mans doctrine, The King might not be
reſiſted if he should turne another <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Caligula,</hi> or should
deal with us all, as the <hi>Turk</hi> doth with his ſubjects, or the
King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> with his ſlaves in <hi>America.</hi> If he should fill
ditches with his living ſubjects, and to ſatisfy his luſt and
pleaſure should tumble them be thouſands downe a precipice
into the midſt of the ſea: yea though he should bring in an
army of <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Tartars</hi> to deſtroy all his ſubjects young and
old; Though he should ſell and give away the whole land
unto the <hi>Turk</hi> or any forraigne Tyrant, and become the moſt
habited not our and compleat Tyrant: and should againſt all
appearance of law, manifeſtly ſeek the deſtruction of the
whole land, man, wife and childe, and of the very being
of religion, according to law, and of all known libertyes,
and should force and compel, with armed heathens, all his
ſubjects great and ſmall, to offer ſacrifice to the Heathen
Gods; and the like: For in all this and the like, there is
but an abuſe of the power, and the power is ſtill of God how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be abuſed, and becauſe it is a power ordained of
God, this abuſe muſt be ſubmitted unto, without the leaſt
reſiſtence, is not this ſufficient to make all men abhore this
man's principles? 2. He muſt ſay that it is not poſſible to
reſiſt the abuſe of the power, but the power it ſelf muſt be
reſiſted, and ſo, ſuch as do reſiſt the moſt dreadful tyranny
imaginable, do reſiſt the ordinance of God, which is moſt
falſe and abſurd. 3. If the abuſe of the power be not from
God, then ſuch as reſiſt this abuſe, do not reſiſt that which
is ordained of God, but that which is not ordained of God.
And therefore reſiſting of the abuſe of the power, is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of the ordinance of God. 4. Subjection is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to that which is the ordinance of God, becauſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is required when and where, and ſo far as reſiſtence is
prohibited: Now reſiſtence to the ordinance of God, is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105606:105"/>
only prohibited, and not reſiſtence to the carnal and bloody
luſts of men, which is rather the ordinance of the devil then
the ordinance of God. 5. The vvrong uſe or abuſe of the eye
may be reſiſted, hindered, and obſtructed, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
done to the eye it ſelf. So may the wrong uſe or abuſe of
Magiſtratical power be reſiſted, without any vvrong done
unto the povver vvhich is of God. 5. It is falſe to ſay that
all reſiſtence of the abuſed power, is forbidden upon this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
reaſon and ground, becauſe even when the power is
abuſed it remaines a povver ordained of God: Becauſe the
abuſed power is not at all ordained of God, nor never vvas,
it is no part of that povver vvhich God ordained: a povver
to murther the innocent, to kill the vvidow and fatherleſſe,
and to oppreſſe the people of God, is not of God: God never
appoynted that povver of <hi>David's</hi> to murther <hi>Vriah</hi> and to
commit adultery vvith <hi>Bathshebah.</hi> Theſe vvere no acts of
the Magiſtratical povver ordained of God, but acts of luſt
the vvickedneſſe. 7. If this reaſon hold good, we muſt
never reſiſt by refuſeing active obedience, let him command
what he will: for his ſinful and unjuſt commands are but the
abuſe of that power which is ordained of God, and the
power even when abuſed by giving out edicts, and mandats,
(according to this man) remaineth a power ordained of God,
as a man's eye remaines his eye, though ſometimes it is not
rightly uſed. Now how will he looſe his owne argument?
what ever anſwer he give here, it will helps us out. Sure,
if a man many refuſe obedience to an unjuſt command, of an
abuſed power, without doing injury unto the power which
is ordained of God, it will be no leſſe cleare, that a man may
refuſe ſubjection to and reſiſt abuſed power, without doing
hurt unto the power which is ordained of God. And I De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that the Reader vvould ſeriouſly notice this, and ſee how
all he objecteth is anſwered by it, &amp; the wicked inſnared in the
vvork of his owne hands.</p>
               <p>4. If the King have not abſolute power, but be limited
both by the lawes of God, and by the lawes of Man: Then
when he tranſgreſſeth the bounds preſcribed to him, he
may be reſiſted. The reaſon is becauſe. He who is no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105606:106"/>
many be reſiſted. But the King going beyond his
bounds is no Magiſtrate. Therefore he may be reſiſted, The
propoſition cannot be denyed: for he vvho is not a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
is not that ordinance of God, which we are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to reſiſt. The aſſumption is granted by <hi>Arniſeus de auth:
princi. c. 2. n. 10.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Dum contra officium facit Magiſtratus,
non est Magiſtratus, quippe a quo non injuria ſed jus naſci debeat.</hi>
while the Magiſtrate doth againſt his office, he is no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;
becauſe a Magiſtrate should do no wrong but right,
<hi>l. miminerint 6 c. unde vi. c. quod quis 24.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. If the King's power be not abſolute, and if he cannot
do whatſoever he pleaſeth: Then when he makes his luſt a
law, and followeth the dictate of his tyrannical corrupted
will, he may be reſiſted: becauſe, what power he never
gote from the People to exerce, if he exerce it, he may be,
by them reſiſted. But the People never gave him a power
to rule as he liſteth, and to do what his miſſed underſtanding
and enraged will did prompt him to do. <hi>Ergo</hi> they may
reſiſt him when he exerceth no power given him, but a power
aſſumed to himſelf, through the corruption of his heart and
wicked will.</p>
               <p>6. If the King's power be not abſolute, then the People
are not denuded of the power of ſelf defence. Royaliſts,
and ſuch as trade their ſteps think, that an abſolute prince,
or a prince <hi>integrae Majeſtatis,</hi> as they call him, hath gotten all
Power from the People, even that power of ſelf defence
(which yet is falſe) but though this were granted, it will
not follow, that a limited Prince hath gote away that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of ſelf defence from the People, and left them naked to
his tyrannical will, to be diſpoſed of, as he thinketh good.</p>
               <p>7. The King's power being limited, and not abſolute,
ſayes that, by the conſtitution and limitation, more regaird
was had to the ſecurity of the People, then to the King's
meer will and pleaſure; and that the Kings meer will and
pleaſure should not be followed, but reſiſted, when thereby
the good of the People and their ſaifty vvas in hazard: all
men are bound to look more to the end then to the meanes,
and to hinder ſuch things as are deſtructive of the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:105606:106"/>
8. If the King's povver be no abſolute; then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
povver is not abſolute: And if the King may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in caſes of neceſſity, becauſe his povver is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute:
Then the Parliament alſo may be reſiſted, upon the
ſame ground, vvhen they do violence and oppreſſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent:
And if the Parliament may be reſiſted by Subjects,
then it cannot be unlavvful for, Subjects, in the caſes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
to defend themſelves againſt the unjuſt violence of
their limited Prince, albeit they vvant the concurrence,
countenance and conduct of a Parliament or Publick Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives.</p>
               <p>9. If King and Parliament both be limited, they cannot
make what lawes they wil. Nay, themſelves declare that they
cannot make any particular act or ratification in prejudice of
the lavvful rights of a third party, and therefore in the end
of their Parliaments or Seſſions of Parliaments they uſually
paſſe an act <hi>ſalvo jure cujuſlibet.</hi> And if their particular acts
are no force, in ſo far as they prejudge the rights of a third
perſon, nor to be ſubmitted unto nor obeyed, Then their other
acts made in prejudice of the glory of God, of the good of
his Church, and of the intereſt of Chriſt in the land, are of
no force, nor to be obeyed and ſubmitted unto: and, if in
the former caſe particular perſons are allovved to defend their
rights, notvvithſtanding of theſe acts: Then much more
may private Perſones be allovved to defend Chriſt's rights,
and their ovvne rights, as to their ſoull &amp; conſciences, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithſtanding
of any act or lavv general or particular made to
the contrary, the beſt vvay they can, vvhen all formal legal
vvayes are taken from them.</p>
               <p>10. If the King be not abſolute. He cannot execute the
Lawes made, according to his owne luſt and pleaſure: nor
may any inferiour judictory do ſo: For that is a piece of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:
and when he or they, following their owne tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
wills, tranſgreſſe the Lawes and Bounds preſcribed, and
take an arbitrary way of executeing their cruelty, They may
in that caſe be reſiſted: Becauſe that power is no proper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical
power, but tyranny, and an arbitrary ebullition of
rage, no power ordained of God, but the lawleſſe will of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:105606:107"/>
11. Since He hath not abſolute power to execute the
Lawes after an arbitrary manner according to his owne luſt &amp;
pleaſure, if when he is doing ſo, he may be reſiſted; then
much leſſe can be Impower his Emiſſaries with an arbitrary,
tyrannical, lawleſe cruelty, under pretence of executing
the Lawes; or if he do, the reſiſting of ſuch in that caſe, can
be no reſiſtance of the Ordinance of God. Neither God nor
Man ever gave him power to conferre on others a Lawleſſe
licenſe to oppreſſe, rob, ſpoile, plunder &amp; tyrannize over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents.
And therefore the reſiſting of ſuch bloody executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
without any lawful power, tyrannyzing over the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
can be no ſin or rebellion, condemned by God or his
Law.</p>
               <p>12. Since the King may not by an abſolute power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what he will. His Subjects are not bound to an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
obedience, but alwayes in the Lord: It being better
to obey God then Man; and when his Subjects are not bound
to obey, he cannot Lawfully inflict punishment on ſuch, as
contraveeing his Lawes, obey the Lawes of God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
juſt punishments are for tranſgreſſions of juſt Laws:
And when he inflicts punishment where God alloweth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
he goeth directly againſt his commiſſion, which is to
be a terrour to evil works, and not to good <hi>Rom. 13: ver. 3.</hi>
And when a Servant, or publick Meſſenger goeth contrare
to his commiſſion, it is no diſloyalty to the King, to refuſe
ſubjection unto ſuch. So nor is it diſtloyalty to the King of
Kings, to refuſe Subjection unto his Miniſter, when he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
croſſe to his ovvne expreſſe commiſſion. And therefore
the Late Act of defence, being the defence of innocents
in the caſe of extreame and inevitable neceſſity, againſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal
commiſſions, contrary to the Lavv of God, cannot

Reformation. Our Argument hence.</head>
               <p>THe Author of <hi>Naphtaly, Pag.</hi> 18. 19. had theſe words,
[<hi>As we have already cleared, that in caſe either the People, or
any part of them be violented to a complyance, or be wickedly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for adhereing to God, in the profeſſion and practice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
dutyes, they may lawfully defend themſelves, and are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
bound to aſsist and deliver one another: So it now comes to be
conſidered that, ſeing the maintainance of truth, and the true
Worshipe of God, were and are the principal ends and motives of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
of Societyes, and erecting of Governments, whereunto both
the People and Rulers, are not only ſeparatly every one for himſelf,
but joyntly obliged for the publick advancement and establishment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
And that God doth therefore equally exact, and avenge the ſin of
the Rulers only, or of the People only, or of any part of the People
only, upon the whole body of Rulers and People, for their ſimple Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and connivance, without their active complyance with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours;
of neceſſity, both from the principles deduced, and from the
most viſible judgments of God agreeable thereto, there must be a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
and antecedent obligation to that of ſubmiſſion, incumbent upon
all both joyntly and ſeparatly, for the maintainance, vindication,
and reformation of Religion, in order to the promoving of theſe great
ends of the publick profeſſion of truth, and true Worshipe, which the
Lord doth indiſpenſibly require.</hi>] By vvhich any, vvho
read vvith judgment and attention, and conſider vvhat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth,
and vvhat follovveth, may ſee vvhat vvas that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
ſcope and intention, <hi>viz.</hi> to shevv in few vvords, the
lavvfulneſſe of Peoples ſtanding to the maintainance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of truth, and the true Worship of God, vvhen vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and enjured by theſe, vvho, by their places and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
should endeavour the eſtablishing and perfect ſecurity
thereof, both from adverſaries vvithin and vvithout; as vvel
as to the defence of their perſones and libertyes, vvhen wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
perſecuted for adhereing to God: And that, as it vvas
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105606:108"/>
not his ſcope and intention; ſo nor will the words give
ground to any (vvho is not utterly blinded vvith preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and reſolved to pervert the faireſt and ſmootheſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
that can be uſed, to the end they may pervert truth, &amp;
deceive the ſimple who readily beleeve every thing) to think
that he pleadeth for any magiſtratical authority, and povver
to give out mandats, and enjoyn execution upon tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
in poynt of reformation of Religion, unto privat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones:
Far leſſe, that he pleadeth for a povver due unto them,
to riſe againſt, and throvv dovvne King and all Magiſtrates,
ſupreame and ſubordinate, and to uſe the vindicative punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; reforming povver of the ſword, even in caſe of defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in matter of Religion. If any vvill but look to the
end of that Paragraph, they shall ſee this fully confirmed,
vvhere he is applying vvhat he ſaid, to the purpoſe he
vvas upon, <hi>viz.</hi> in vindication of vvhat vvas done by our
firſt Reformers, in the dayes of <hi>Mr Knox</hi> (of whom only he
is ſpeaking in that part of his book) for thus he ſpeaketh
[<hi>and had not our Reformers great reaſon to feare and tremble, least
the manifeſt toleration of proud cruel and flattering Prelates, who had
perverted the lawful powers into bloody perſecutors; and of idolatrous
Prieſts, whoſe wickedneſſe and idolatry had corrupted the whole Land,
might involve not only themſelves, but</hi> the whole Nation <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
and overflowing indignation.</hi>] Was there any ſuch thing
pretended, or aſſumed by theſe Reformers, but a power to
defend, and maintaine the true reformed Religion, and
their reformed Preachers, againſt the malice of powers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and enraged againſt them, by the bloody and peſtilent
counſel of the theſe idolatrous locuſts, and to hinder open and
avowed idolatry, which provoked God againſt the whole
Land? Did they ever arrogate to themſelves the magiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
vindicative, punishing and reforming power of the
ſword againſt all Magiſtrates Supreame and Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?
Or doth <hi>Naphtaly</hi> ſay any ſuch thing? And yet
this <hi>Surveyer</hi> becauſe he cannot confute what is there
nervouſly vindicated, aſſerted and demonſtrated; That
he may not be ſeen to do nothing for his hire, he will
thraw <hi>Naphtaly's</hi> words as he thinketh beſt, and falſly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105606:108"/>
and moſt impudently aſſert <hi>Pag.</hi> 83. That <hi>Naphtali</hi> ſayeth [<hi>Any
party of meer private perſones may riſe againſt, reſiſt, throw downe
King and all Magiſtrates, Supreame and Subordinate; and in their
Phinehas-like motions, uſe the vindicative, punishing, reforming
power of the ſword, eſpecially in caſe of defection in matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
and that there is a joynt obligation laying upon the people, and
every party thereof, to vindicate and reforme Religion, in a publick
punitive way, even againſt all Magiſtrates and Nobles, and againſt
the plurality of the people. So that if any part of the people do think
the Magiſtrates, all of them, or the plurality of the people, patrons of
abhominations, any private party that think they have power enough,
may flee to the vindicative, punishing and reforming ſword, and falt
upon all Rulers and other, whom they think to be in a defection, and
will boldly ſay that in truth they are ſo.</hi>] Who ſeeth not what
perverting of truth is here? When <hi>Naphtali</hi> only aſſerts, that
in caſe the Magiſtrate, to whom the vindicative, and (in
caſe of backſlideing) the reforming power is committed,
and who should make this his maine work, shall turne the
principal perverter, and chief patron of theſe abhominations,
ſome other thing is required of the people then ſubmiſſion,
&amp; there lyeth upon them ſome obligation antecedent to that,
even an obligation to the maintainance, vindication, and
reformation of Religion: Which may be, and is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
diſtinct from that vindication and reformation, which
is incumbent on Magiſtrates, even a vindication and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
by way of maintainance of the received truth,
and hindering of idolatry and blaſphemy, or what is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
to God, pernicious to the commonwealth, &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to the true reformed Religion: which may be done
without arrogateing in the leaſt, that power which God
hath committed to the Magiſtrates: And this is far from
uſeing the ſword againſt the Magiſtrate, and from throwing
him down. It is incumbent to the Magiſtrate, to defend
private ſubjects from Robbers; and if they ſpoyl and robe a
man's houſe, to recover what is by robbery taken away: but
if he neglect this, and rather patronize ſuch Robbers; It
is a duty on the ſubject, to defend his owne, and vindicate
and recover his goods, the beſt way he can: and who will
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105606:109"/>
ſay that it is an uſurping of the Magiſtrates ſword, whereby
he should punish Robbers, defend the innocent, and recover
the goods of the ſpoyled; or a riſeing up aginſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
to dethrone him. There is a private maintaining, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicateing
and recovering of goods ſtollen, which yet is active,
and may be effectual: and there is a publick, authoritative and
magiſtratical defending, vindicating and recovering. The
other may be incumbent to private perſones in ſome caſes,
when yet they do not uſurpe this. So in the Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
there is a private, yet active and real maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
vindicating and reforming of Religion when corrupted,
and there is a publick, authoritative and Magiſtratical main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
vindicating and reforming. The former may be
aſſumed by private perſons, in ſome caſes, without the
leaſt hazzard of incroaching upon this, far more without the
hazard of calling Magiſtrats to account, judging, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and dethroning them, and the like.</p>
               <p>Having thus cleared how little ground he hath, to cry
out ſo againſt <hi>Naphtaly</hi> and his party, as the ſanguinary faction
(as he doth <hi>Pag.</hi> 83.) and to proſecute that diſpute as he
doth in the following <hi>Pages,</hi> we will not have much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in anſwering what he hath ſaid: but firſt let us proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
our owne buſineſſe, and shew what real power People
have, without their Magiſtrats, in the maintaining and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Religion: And,</p>
               <p>1. It is lawful, yea neceſſary, for every private perſon,
whether the Magiſtrates Superiour and Inferiour give their
countenance, concurrence, or conſent thereunto, or not,
to purge their hearts, and reforme thier lives, and to walk
in all the wayes of God's Commandements. Our <hi>Surveyer</hi>
himſelf granteth this, <hi>Pag.</hi> 84. for ſayes he, <hi>every one is bound
to amend one, and ſo all will be more eaſily amended.</hi> Very ture:
And if this were done, our work were at an end, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
would be a Hangman to his owne pamphlet, unleſſe
he think himſelf exeemed from that duty of reformation,
and that he hath a diſpenſation to lie, ſlander, calumniate,
and blaſpheme the work, wayes, and People of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:105606:109"/>
2. It is the duty of all private perſones, notwithſtanding
that idolatry, ſuperſtition, or any other corruption in the
worshipe of God be eſtablished by authority, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
and encouraged; or conformity there to preſſed, to
keep themſelves pure from ſuch courſes as provoke the eyes
of God, who is a jealous God, and will not give his glory
to another; This is undenyable by all who are not profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Atheiſts, and who know another God, then a clay creature,
and who know that it is better to obey God, then a Man. Our
<hi>Surveyer</hi> granteth in the forecited place [<hi>that every one of the
people ought to reforme themſelves from all real corruptions in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe
of God.</hi>] But, it may be, he maketh this <hi>real,</hi> an open
door for him and his fraternity, to eſcape by; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that he and they are arived at the hight of perfection,
(becauſe forſooth they are fallen backward, and have a
minde to goe backward, and never to advance) and ſo fall
not under the compaſſe of this duty. But corruptions will
be real corruptions, though they account them perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>3. It is the duty of private perſons to rebuke, admonish,
exhort, reprove, obſerve, edify and provoke one another
to love and good works <hi>Lev. 19. 17. Mat. 18. 15, 16. Rom.
15. 13. Col. 3. 16. 1 Theſ. 5. 11. Heb. 3. 13. and 10. 24. 25.</hi>
And thus inſtruct one another in the right wayes of the Lord,
perſwade move and induce them by motives and arguments,
and all meanes poſſible, to imbrace the truth, and to forſake
errour, or any falſe way, Even though the Magiſtrates
should prohibite and diſcharge this, and by their command
and authority should eſtablish errour and corruption, and
banish truth with their edicts and proclamations. Our <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer</hi>
granteth <hi>Pag.</hi> 84. [<hi>that no man should ſay, am I am brothers
keeper, but by faithful instruction, warning, reproof, strive to
ſave others from the evil of the time and places wherein they live</hi>] And
yet he knowes who are perſecuted upon this account, of
meeting together for theſe and ſuch like ends, to ſtrengthen
the hands one of another, that they faint not in this evil day,
and to ſave one another from the evils of theſe times, as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105606:110"/>
keepers of conventicles, and ſeditious diſturbers of the
peace.</p>
               <p>4. When there is any corruption in the reformed Religion,
whether in doctrine, worship, diſcipline, or government
creept in; or any corrupt ſinful practice come in uſe, and
abounding in a land, and theſe corruptions not only connived
at by the Magiſtrates, but alſo countenanced, approved and
authorized; it is the duty of all the faithful Miniſters of
Chriſt, to be laying out themſelves to the utmoſt, in their
paſtoral functions, for the ſuppreſſing of theſe corruptions and
enormities, notwithſtanding of any prohibiton of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
whoſe power is not privative in this caſe, to the
contrary. Though this be abundantly cleared and confirmed
by the practice of all the faithful Prophets and Apoſtles of
the Lord, both under the Old, and under the N. Teſtament;
yet we all know how impiouſly and tyrannically this is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the honeſt Miniſters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who, left they
should ſpeak any thing againſt the rageing evills and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
corruptions, both in matters of opinion and practice,
which haſten the curſe and wrath of God upon the land, and
make us ripe for deſtruction, are not permitted to preach
uncontroverted truthes, and the undenyable grounds of
Chriſtianity. But however this piece of tyranny and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
be eſtablished by law, yet the law of God ſtands
unrepealed &amp; in full force and vigour, &amp; by this law, all who
have a trumpet and a mouth should ſet the trumpet to their
mouth, and cry aloud and not ſpare, and both privately and
publicky labour thus to reforme the grievous abuſes, that
abound in the land.</p>
               <p>5. Private perſones may, let Magiſtrates command or
diſcharge what they will, yea are bound to, obey the whole
ſome exhortations and admonitions of Miniſters and others,
who faithfully declare the minde of God, and diſcover ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
corruptions, &amp; crying abhominations: &amp; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of any law to the contrary, Imbrace, and practiſe
the true Religion, and reject the corruptions. This is certane,
for it is God's minde and will that his commands be obeyed
rather then mans; and if Miniſters, and private perſons be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105606:110"/>
bound to exhorte, rebuke, warne, reprove, admonish,
move and perſwade, it is Peoples duty to hearken to, and
obey theſe good and neceſſary exhortations, rebukes, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
reproofs, admonitions and perſuaſions. God's
minde should be followed, hold it forth who will, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when it is declared by his Ambaſſadours, who in a
ſpecial manner are authorized by him for that effect. We
know what a dreadful plague and judgment came upon <hi>Iudah</hi>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36:16. 17. becauſe they mocked the meſſengers of
God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets,
the wrath of God aroſe againſt his People, till there was no
remedie. And it was this, which occaſioned the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching
of the Church of the <hi>Jewes Act.</hi> 13:46. Sure when
Peoples eare is ſo uncircumciſed that they wil not heare,
and the Word of the Lord is a reproach unto them, and
they have no delight in it, then is there ground to fear the
verification of that ſad threatning <hi>Ier.</hi> 6:11, 12. that <hi>wrath
shall be poured out upon the children abroad, and upon the aſſembly
of young men together, ſo that even the husband with the wife shall be
taken, the aged with him that is full of dayes, and their houſes shall
be turned unto others, with their fieldes, and wives together; for I will
ſtreach out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, ſayeth the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. From what is ſaid, it is apparent, that all who vvould
have peace vvith God, and peace in their ovvne conſciences,
and joy in the day of their accounts, should imbrace, profeſſe,
and practiſe the truth of God, and the true Religion reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in doctrine, vvorshipe, diſcipline and government,
Though King, Parliament, and Council should reject and
condemne the ſame, and countenance, or command and
authorize the practice of idolatry, ſuperſtition, or any falſe
way in the vvorshipe of God, or in the doctrine and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
For, no lavv of man can vvarrand iniquity, no act or
conſtitution of any Magiſtrat under Heaven, can reſcinde
or invalidate the mandats of the King of Kings, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
People from obedience due thereunto. No true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
(whatever court flatterers &amp; atheiſts may do) can deny this.</p>
               <p>7. Nor can it be denyed, That in Kingdomes or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monvvealths
vvhere once the True Religion, reformed in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105606:111"/>
doctrine, vvorshipe, diſcipline and government, hath been
received, publickly imbraced, approved and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
by authority, ratified by lavves, ſtatutes, acts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
proclamations, oathes, vovves and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Though the Magiſtrates Superiour and inferiour
should turne Apoſtates from that Reformed and received
Religion, and by their lavves condemne the ſame, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
corruptions, and enforce corrupt practices by penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes;
yet it vvere the duty of all Subjects, vvho had any
regaird to the matters of their ovvne ſalvation, to adhere to
the truth once received and eſtablished, and vvorshipe and
Serve God, after the right manner, and refuſe to obey theſe
iniquous lavves. Will any deny ſuch a truth as this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ſuch as have ſold ſoull, conſciences and all, unto the
luſt of Men; or think there is no Religion, but vvhat King
and Parliament vvill have, and conſequently if they should
enjoyne the imbraceing of Mahomet's Religion, or the
vvorshiping of Sun, Moon, and Starrs, or of Satan himſelf,
obedience muſt be yeelded.</p>
               <p>8. If in the forementioned caſe, The Magiſtrates Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
and inferiour should combine together, and conſpire
againſt Chriſt and his intereſt, and should not only, by their
acts and ſtatutes, banish him, and his glorious intereſts
out of the Kingdome; but alſo, by their cruel executions,
labour to force, conſtraine and compel all their ſubjects or
a part of them, to the renunceing of the formerly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and avowed truthes, and to the imbraceing of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
corruptions, and ſo to run with themſelves unto
the ſame exceſſe of iniquity, perjury and abhomination:
Then it is lawful for theſe Subjects ſo oppreſſed, perſecuted
and abuſed for their conſtancy in adhereing to the truths
once received, contrare to all engagements, vowes
and Covenants, to defend themſelves againſt that unjuſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and rage, and maintaine the reformed truth, which
is unjuſtly &amp; violently taken from them, by force, when
there is no other probable meane left for them to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay;
nay when liberty to ſupplicate or petition is inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
and ſeverely, under the very paine of Treaſon,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105606:111"/>
diſcharged. The reaſons are 1. becauſe, we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above, that it is moſt lawful for Subjects to maintaine
their lives, perſons, and Eſtates, againſt the unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and tyrannical oppreſſion of their enraged Magiſtrates:
And if that be lawful, this muſt alſo be much more lawful;
for as the ſoul is much more precious then the body, ſo
matters that concerne the ſoul, should be preferred to ſuch
things as concerne the body. And therefore Religion,
which is neceſſary for the life of the ſoull, should be with no
leſſe Zeale, care and induſtry, maintained and preſerved
pure and uncorrupted, then what concerneth the lives of our
bodyes. 2. It is lawful for Subjects to maintaine their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and civil libertyes, by force, when no other way can
be uſed, leſt they, and their poſterity after them, should be
redacted unto a ſtate of perfect ſlavery and bondage, worſe
then that of the <hi>Iſrailites</hi> in <hi>Egypt:</hi> And shall it be unlawfull
to fight for the defence of Religion, wherein is compriſed
all true and deſireable liberty, and to ſave poſterity from ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and bondage in their ſouls and conſciences, much
more dreadfull and terrible, then the moſt inſupportable and
bitter bondage of the body imaginable? Shall men be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to fight to preſerve their owne bodyes, and the bodyes of
their poſterity from the ſlavery of men, and shall they not
be allowed to fight that they may preſerve their owne ſoulls
and the ſouls of their poſterity, from the tyranny of Satan?
Who but ſuch, as either think they have no ſoulls, more
then beaſts, or know not the worth of their ſouls, will deny
this conſequence? 3. It is lawful for Subjects to defend
their lives and libertyes, in order to the defence of the true
Religion, and the intereſts of Jeſus Chriſts, when their
loſſeing of theſe should certanely tend to the loſſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<hi>Ergo</hi> It cannot be unlawful to defend Religion, which
is the maine and principal thing. 4. If it be lawful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the intereſts of a King againſt an uſurper, whether a
ſtranger, or an inferiour Magiſtrate, who is under the King,
and is ſeeking to eject him and his intereſt, contrare to his
faith and truſt: Then much more muſt it be lawful, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> and his intereſt, when King and Parliament,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105606:112"/>
contrare to their ſworne allaigance unto him, have rebelled;
and are ſeeking to dethrone him, by their wicked Lawes and
Ordinances, and to banish him and his intereſts out of the
Kingdome, by their tyrannical cruelty &amp; inhumane and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe
executions. Will any deny this but ingrained Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Malignants, whoſe chief character hitherto hath been,
to preferre man's intereſt unto Chriſts? Or ſuch as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
all faith and loyalty unto the King of Kings, and
have ſet up a creature as their only God, whom they minde
to Worshipe and adore, and for whom they minde to fight
againſt all breathing, and againſt the God of heaven alſo: But
their weapons shall fall out of their hands when They shall
<hi>feel the lighting downe of his arme, with the indignation of his anger,
and with the flame of a devouring fire, and with ſcattering and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts
and hailstones, and when he shall cauſe his glorious voyce to be
heard.</hi> If any should <hi>Object,</hi> That becauſe Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is not of this World, therefore his Servants should not
fight for him. It is eaſily anſwered. That, as hence it will
follow, that Religion cannot be forced by the ſword upon
any; So it will not follow that Religion should not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
for then Magiſtrates should not defend Religion,
nor Chriſtians should not defend their Religion againſt the
<hi>Turks.</hi> Which is falſe. And hence, 5. If it be lawful for
People to defend their Religion againſt an army of infidells,
Mahometans, or Papiſts, invadeing the Land of purpoſe to
ſpoile us of our Religion, and to force us to imbrace heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eniſme;
Turciſme, or Popery: Then it muſt be lawfull
to defend the ſame true Religion againſt King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when they ſeek to rob the People thereof, and force
corruptious upon them: becauſe King and Parliament have
no more authority from God, to oppreſſe the conſciences of
their Subjects, to corrupt Religion, and force corruptions
upon them; then the <hi>Turk</hi> or the <hi>Pope</hi> hath: and therefore, no
leſſe lawfully may they be reſiſted. 6. If privat perſons may
reſiſt and withſtand the Prince and Parliaments, when they
ſell them, and their land and heritages, unto a forraigner,
to the <hi>Turk</hi> or ſuch an adverſary: Then much more may
they withſtand them, and defend their Religion, when
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105606:112"/>
they are ſelling it by their apoſtatical acts, and thereby ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them and their Souls unto Satan the God of this
World.</p>
               <p>9. When Religion, by the conſtitution of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
is become a fundamental law, and a maine article
and cardinal condition of the eſtablished Politie, and upon
which, all the Magiſtrates Supreme and Inferiour, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled
in their offices: Then may that Religion be defended
by private ſubjects, when their Magiſtrates have conſpired
together to deſtroy the ſame; &amp; to enforce the corruptions of
their owne braine. The reaſons are 1. becauſe, it is lawful to
defend the juſt and laudable conſtitution of the Realme, &amp; in
ſo far, as Religion, which is a principal fundation-ſtone of
this conſtitution, is ſubverted, the conſtitution is wronged,
and the fundations thereof are shaken. 2. In ſo far, the
Magiſtrates are no Magiſtrates: And therefore they may
be reſiſted. Magiſtrates, I ſay, in ſo far as they overturne
the conſtitution, are not Magiſtrates; for that is a maine
pairt of their work, to maintaine it: For upon the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
hang all the libertyes and all the good and neceſſary
Ends, which People have ſet before their eyes, in the ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of governement, and His owne being as ſuch; &amp; the
ſubverſion of that, ſubverts all, and declareth the ſubverter
to be an enemy to the Commonwealth, and an overturner
of the polity: and this is inconſiſtent with being a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.
3. In ſo far as they overturne or shake the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they cannot be ſeeking the good of the Community,
but their owne, with the deſtruction of the Common good,
and this is the mark and true character of a Tyrant: And
when they ſeek not the good of the Community, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be looked upon as Magiſtrates doing their duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
ſeeking themſelves, with the deſtruction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
Therefore, in ſo far they may be reſiſted. 4.
In ſo farr, The compact, the ground of the conſtitution,
is violated, and as Magiſtrates, in this caſe, in ſo far,
fall from their right, in ſo farr alſo, are People liberated
from their obligation, ſo that if They become no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
the Subjects become no Subjects; for the relation is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:105606:113"/>
Mutual, and ſo is the obligation, as was shewed above.
Therefore, in this caſe Subjects, may lawfully reſiſt, and
defend their Religion, which is become the principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of their conſtitution, and of the compact betwixt
King and Subjects.</p>
               <p>10. Where Religion is univerſally received, publickly
owned, and countenanced by perſones in authority, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
approved and eſtablished by the lawes, and authority
of the land; There, every perſon is bound and obliged before
God, to maintaine and defend that Religion, according to
their power, with the hazard of their lives and fortunes
againſt all, who under whatſoever colour and pretence,
ſeek to ſubvert and overturne the ſame; and to hinder any
corruption that King or Parliament at home, or adverſaries
abroad, would, whether by ſubtilty, or power and force,
bring in; and lay hold on the firſt opportunity offered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the eſtablishment of Truth, and the overturning of
theſe corrupt courſes, which tend to the perverting thereof:
And the reaſons are, becauſe. 1. When the True Religion
is once embraced, and publickly received, That land or
Commonwealth is really dedicated and devouted unto God,
and ſo in a happy condition; which happy condition, all
loyal ſubjects and true Chriſtians, should maintaine and
promove, &amp; recover, when nearby or altogether loſt. And
therefore, should do what they can, to hinder any courſe
that may tend to recal this dedication, to deteriorate the
happy condition of the Realme, and to give up the land, as
an offering unto Satan. 2. By this meanes, they endeavour
to avert the wrath and anger of God, which muſt certanely
be expected to goe out againſt the land, if defection be not
prevented and remedyed: For if but a few should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairt,
wrath might come upon the whole, much more if the
Leaders turne patrones of this defection. But of this more
in the next chapter.</p>
               <p>11. Much more, muſt this be allowed in a Land where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion in doctrine, worshipe, diſcipline
and governement, is not only univerſally owned, publickly
received, and imbraced: nor yet only approved, authorized,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105606:113"/>
ratified and confirmed, by publick authority, and the lawes
of the Land. But alſo corroborated by ſolemne vows and
Covenants, made and ſworne unto God, by all ranks and
conditions of People, from the King to the meaneſt of the
ſubjects, in a moſt ſolemne manner, and that ſeveral times
re-iterated: in which Covenants, all ſweare to <hi>Maintaine and
defend this Riligion, with their lives and fortunes, and to labour,
by all meanes lawfull, to recover the purity and liberty of the goſpel;
and to continow in the profeſſion and obedience of the foreſaid Religion,
defend the ſame, and reſiſt all contrary errours and corruptions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their vocation, and to the uttermost of that power that God
puts in their hands, all the dayes of their life: as alſo mutually to
defend and aſſist one another, in the ſame cauſe of maintaining the
true Religion, with their beſt Counſel, bodyes, meanes and whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
against all ſorts of perſons whatſoever.</hi> And [<hi>Sincerely, really
and conſtantly, endeavour, in their ſeveral places and callings, the
preſervation of thereformed Religion in doctrine, worshipe, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and government. The extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
Hereſy, Schiſme, Prophanneſſe, and whatſoever shall
be found to be contray to ſound doctrine and the power of godlineſſe.
And to aſſist and defend all thoſe that enter into the ſame bond, in
the maintaining &amp; purſueing thereof. And shall not ſuffer themſelves
directly or indirectly, by whatſoever combination, perſuaſion or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
to make defection to the contrary party, or to give themſelves to
a deteſtable indifferency, or neutrality in this cauſe, which ſo
much concerneth the glory of God, the good of the Kingdomes,
and the honour of the King; but shall, all the Dayes of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
Zealouſly and conſtantly, continue therein, against all
oppoſition, and promote the ſame, according to their power, againſt
all lets and impediments whatſoever.]</hi> Now I ſay, in ſuch a caſe
as this, when after all theſe engadgments and covenants, a
courte of defection is carryed on, by a ſtrong and violente
hand, by King and Parliaments, and there is no meane left
unto Private Perſones, when violented and conſtrained to
a complyance, by acts, and tyrannical and arbitrary execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of either preventing their owne deſtruction in ſoull
and body, or preſerving the reformation ſworn unto, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the ſame when corrupted, and of purging the land
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105606:114"/>
of that dreadful ſin of perjury and defection. They may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
take the ſword of juſt and neceſſary defence, for the
maintainance of themſelves and of their Religion. This is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undantly
cleare from what is ſaid, and shall be furder cleared
and confirmed, when we examine what this <hi>Surveyer</hi> allaigeth
againſt it.</p>
               <p>12. Scripture giveth us ground to beleeve, that in ſuch a
caſe as this, when a defection in a covenanted land, and a
land devoted to God, is carryed on, more is required of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſones, then to mourne and ſigh in ſecret: as,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. Deut. 13:12, 13, 14, &amp;c. If thou shall heare ſay in one of thy
cities, which the Lord thy God hath given thee to dwell there, ſaying,
certane men the children of Belial are gone out from among you, and
have with drawne the inhabitants of their city, ſaying, let us goe and
ſerve other Gods, which yee have not known. Then shall thou enquire
and make ſearch, and ask diligently, and behold, if it be truth, and
the thing certane, that ſuch abhomination is wrought among you, thou
shall ſurely ſmite the inhabitants of that city, with the edge of the
ſword, deſtroying it utterly and all that is therein, and the cattel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
with all that is therein, &amp;c.</hi> Which words were undenyably
ſpoken to the People, to whom the reſt of that chapter was
ſpoken and particularly directed: So the dutch annot. in the
contents of that chapt. ſay, that the way is shewed how the
People of God were to demeane themſelves to wards a city
that was fallen off: and though, we readyly grant, that theſe
words do not impower private perſones to act the part of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
and <hi>brevi manu</hi> judge and condemne, or put to death
ſuch as are guilty of the crime mentioned; nor to fall upon the
execution without previous judging and tryal of the cauſe;
yet it will be no wire drawing of Scriptures, whatever this
<hi>Surveyer</hi> allaige, to ſay, That this place will warrand private
perſones to defend their Reformation, when by oppreſſion
and violence, it is taken from them, and when defection is
carryed on in a land devoted to God, and Magiſtrates either
neglect to take courſe therewith, or countenance the ſame.
The Zeal of the Lord should ſtirr up people to do more for
vindicating the glory of God, and ſaving the land from an
univerſal apoſtaſie, then privately mourne in ſecret. Sure
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105606:114"/>
this being ſpoken to the people, ſayes, they should manifeſt
and declare their Zeal otherwayes; ſeing by this, they might
have ſufficiently knowne how deteſtable ſuch a defection was
unto the Lord, and that no leſſe would pacifie his wrath
againſt that part corrupted, then utter exterminion and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of young and old in it, with their cattel and goods:
Will not any readyly yeeld, that they had been bound, to
have concurred with the Magiſtrate in this execution; and
that if the Magiſtrate had been negligent, to have remonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the matter unto him; and if either that had not prevailed,
or Magiſtrates being chief actors and patrons thereof, they
durſt not have remonſtrated the matter, they might lawfully
have joyned together, and with their ſwords in their hands,
have moved the Magiſtrate to purge out that abhomination,
and to have granted them ſecurity, that the contagion should
not have ſpread, nor they be infected therewith, left the fierce-anger
of God had not been turned away from them? And if
this be granted (which cannot eaſily be denyed) we have our
purpoſe, and <hi>Naphthali</hi> hath all which he deſired, And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanely,
to ſay, That this courſe was only to be taken, when
one city was infected, and not when moe, when ten or
twenty, or poſſibly the major part, were but to elude Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as <hi>Naphtali</hi> ſaid: ſeing the ſame reaſon will hold in theſe
caſes, which holdeth in the caſes inſtanced: and whatever
the <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſay <hi>pag.</hi> 56. ſuch a cleaving to the literal meaning
of Scripture, as will not admit conſequential arguments to
be drawne therefrom, to the like caſes, nor an argument
drawne a <hi>minori ad majus,</hi> from the caſe inſtanced, is neither
the Doctrine of Chriſt, nor of found Divines: nor is the
following of Chriſts example and of the Apoſtles, who made
uſe of ſuch conſequences, a making a noſe of wax of the holy
Scriptures, nor a wringing or wreſting them, to bring in our
owne fancyes, nor a covering of our crooked courſes with ſuch
a cloak: (however we be branded by him, for this, and as
being men of blood and violence, but his falſly rubbing that
aſperſion on the innocent, will never wipe that right name off
him and his party, whoſe violence and thirſting after blood,
is more then ſufficiently knowne) yea himſelf in his 3 An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105606:115"/>
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 57, 58. will allow ſomething to be done by vertue
of this text, where the major part is corrupt, and the minor
part found, ſaying [<q>Though the leſſer part is not to acquieſce
in the way of the greater, runing into rebellion againſt God,
but by all meanes competent to them, bear witneſſe againſt
that way, and ſtudy to keep themſelves pure, when they
cannot prevaile to have matters rectified, as to the whole
body</q>] And yet the carnal luckwarmneſſe and indifferency
of this latitudinarian Politician in the matters of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.
That after he had ſaid that [<q>there is no coming to
an accomodation in this matter whether the True God, or
other Gods should be ſerved.</q>] he preſently addeth, in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis
[<q>and yet this man would be very ſevere, if no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the world, might (having before been embodyed in
a Kingdome or State) continue and abide in their peaceable
communion in civil intereſts, upon ſuppoſition of ſuch an
equal diviſion ariſeing amongſt them.</q>] It ſeemeth this meek
peaceable man, would ſuffer Satan to be worshiped in the ſame
State with the true and living God: and that (if he apply this
to the purpoſe) if the equal half of the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had
worshiped, the devil, he would not have been ſevere, but
adviſed the other half to abide united with them in civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
But, leaving theſe and the like, which are not much
to our purpoſe, let us ſee what he ſayes, to the thing. He
tells us <hi>Pag.</hi> 57. [<q>That no expoſition of a text can ſubſiſt,
that is either contrary to other texts of Scripture, or to
ſound reaſon.</q>] This is granted: But how showeth he that
the expoſition given, is contrary to either? [<q>It is contrary
to Scripture; becauſe (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) the Scripture committeth the
vindicative and punishing ſword only to the Magiſtrate,
who only is the ſword bearer. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</q>] But this is not
againſt us or our expoſition: <hi>Naphthali</hi> ſpeaks only of private
perſons taking the defenſive ſword, and thereby keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the land pure, and labouring (ſtill in their private way,
not in a judicial authoritative and Magiſtraticall way) to
purge out corruption, and maintaine Reformation; can he
shew us Scripture againſt this? Againe ſayes he [<q>this is
poynt-blank contrary to reaſon, remedyleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y tending to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105606:115"/>
humane Societies, and all Kingdomes and Comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.</q>]
Then it ſeemeth though Magiſtrates should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre,
with the minor and ſounder part, to purge out the
corruption of the greater; or concurre with the equal half,
to purge the other, or with a greater part to purge the leſſer,
if a conſiderable part, it might not be; becauſe, that were
a way to diſſolve humane Societies, and all Kingdomes and
Commonwealths. Ay, but he meaneth that it is ſo [<hi>To teach
that any meer privat perſones, or any part of a People, who think
themſelves ſtrong enough, should take on them to ſit and act as punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
judges, over all Magiſtrates Supreme and Subordinate, yea and
upon the Major part of the People themſelves, and upon their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes,
led with their own lusts, draw the Magiſtratical ſword.]
Anſw.</hi> But then againſt whom doth he fight? <hi>Naphtaly</hi>
ſpoke not ſo: Nor doth our cauſe require that we should
ſay ſo. We ſay not, that private perſones should take up
the Magiſtrat's ſword, and with Magiſtratical power and
authority judge and execute the whole body of the People,
and the Magiſtrates Supreme and Subordinate; far leſſe
do we ſay, That they should do this upon their fanſies, or
when led with their owne luſts. This is nothing elſe but to
fanſy an adverſary to himſelf, when he cannot anſwere or
ſtand againſt his proper adverſary: and after he hath busked
him up in as ugly a shape, as he can, then he may well cry
out <hi>[Oh horrid confuſion, to be detaſted of all rational and Chriſtian
hearts!]</hi> But this is not faire dealing, yet ſuteable enough
to him and his cauſe, which he can get defended no other
way? But then he tells us <hi>Pag.</hi> 59. <hi>[That though the words be
ſpoken to the People; yet it is alwayes to be underſtood, that the
Peoples concurrence in the punishing of an Apoſtate city, was to be
within the bounds of their calling, and under the conduct of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical
power ſet over them: As when inticers to idolatry are, in
the former part of the chapter, enjoyned to be taken order with,
(however nearly they were related to People) and to be ſtoned, it is
not to be ſuppoſed that the charge is given to every private perſon</hi> brevi
manu <hi>to do this, but judgment was to be execute on them after ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
conviction, and ſentence given by the Magiſtrate, as ſayeth</hi>
Diodat. <hi>on v.</hi> 8. <hi>and</hi> Pelargus <hi>on v.</hi> 14.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:105606:116"/>
the Peoples concurrence was to be within the bounds of their
calling, we grant: But the queſtion is how far the bounds
of their calling did extend: Did it extend no further then
to goe out when called thereto of the Magiſtrate, to punish
that Apoſtate city? Then if the Magiſtrate neglected to call
them out, they were not ſo much as to mourne for that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy,
by this text; Nor to uſe any other meanes to
have the Matter rectified, nay nor to beare witneſſe againſt
that way: For if the Magiſtrate was to preceed, and they
only to goe under his conduct, if he called them not forth,
they were exonered, all that was required of them, being
only to be willing and ready at a call. But ſure this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
is not conſonant to other texts of ſcripture, as we
shall shew. 2. If we look to the other particulars ſpoken
to in that chapter, we will finde that there was more requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then that, or a ſimple mourning in ſecret; for no man
wil think they were exonered, if they had been only willing to
execute the ſentence of the Magiſtrate upon the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
and dreamer, that ſought to draw them after other Gods.
Seing they were not to hear him. So as to the enticer, they were
not only not to hearken unto him, but they were not to pity
him, nor to conceale him <hi>v.</hi> 8. but now, what in caſe the
Magiſtrate should have refuſed to have done his duty, to
have examined the Matter; or, what in caſe the Magiſtrate
should have countenanced and encouraged ſuch an one, was
there no more required of them, but to have made offer of
ther Son, Daughter, Wife, or Brother unto juſtice, and
when juſtice could not have been gotten executed upon them
take them home again to their houſe and into their boſome, &amp;
live as formerly good friends together? I feare ſuch cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the letter of the ſcripture shall be found a meer elude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſcripture, and a mocking of the holy ghoſt by whom
it was given. 3. Yea that wich <hi>Diodat</hi> ſayes, is more, for
he ſayes, <hi>[They were to procure vengeance on him, in way of juſtice
accuſing him to the Magiſtrate by information or ſufficient proof.]</hi>
And if the Magiſtrate refuſed to do juſtice, I ſuppoſe,
they might have provided for their owne ſecurity, and shot
him or her out of doores with violence, that was ſeeking to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:105606:116"/>
draw them a way from the true God. So that granting what
the <hi>Surveyer</hi> would be at, the place will make for us: For
though the Magiſtrate was bound to examine, judge and
ſentence the Apoſtate city, in a judicial authoritative
manner; yet in caſe the Magiſtrate should have connived
at, or countenanced ſuch apoſtacy, they were to uſe other
meanes to have the land purged of that crying obhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then ſimple mourning in ſecret, even to have taken
the ſword in their hand, in caſe the defection was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to themſelves, and Magiſtrates were forceing them to
a complyance with that evil, or apoſtaſy; and never to have
laid it downe, till not only themſelves were ſecured as to
theirpart, but the land were purged of that idolatry &amp; the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
executed according to the law, Their Zeal in this caſe
should have carryed them without doors, though not to an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeing
of the Magiſtrates juridicall authoritative and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
ſword.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Eſai.</hi> 59: <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for
truth.</hi> Where the Prophet among the reſt of the evils wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
that People was guilty, and for which heavy calamities
did preſſe them, reckoneth this, that there was none who call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for juſtice, or did plead for truth; that is, there was
none who endeavoured to relieve, and right the wronged,
or to redreſſe what was amiſſe, ſee the <hi>English Annotat.</hi> no
man owned the right cauſe, or took God's part againſt fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and wickedneſſe, <hi>[No man</hi> (ſay the Duth Annotat.)
<hi>to dehort them that deal unjustly, or to maintaine a juſt cauſe,
and the truth to the utmoſt of his power.]</hi> So that by this we ſee
what was required of People, in a day of defection, even to
call and cry aloude, that juſtice might be executed, and deal
with ſuch as were Magiſtrats to do their duty, and not to
bring and keep on the wrath of God upon the Land; And
this is more then the <hi>Surveyer</hi> will have to be the only duty of
private perſones in a day of general defection, <hi>Pag.</hi> 52. viz.
<hi>To keep themſelves pure without any degree of acting theſe ſinnes, to
mourne and ſigh for the evils that are done, to be earnest in prayer that
God may convert others, to admonish faithfully, and ſtudy to reclame
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105606:117"/>
theſe who are out of the way.</hi> But this will be more cleare by the
following paſſages.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 59: 15, 16. [<hi>Yea truth faileth and he that departeth
from evill maketh himſelf a prey, and the Lord ſaw it, and it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
him that there was no judgment, and he ſaw that there was no
man, and wondered that there was no interceſſour.]</hi> Truth and the
cauſe of God was ſo at under, that a man could not get leave
to live, if he depairted from evil, he was a prey unto the
perſecuters, ſo general and univerſal was this defection; and
at this time, he ſaw that there was no man, and wondered
that there was no interceſſour to interpoſe, none that would
ſtand up and lay out themſelves to the utmoſt, to ſet things
in order, none that would beſtirre himſelf for truth and the
right, which was then oppreſſed: ſee the English Annot. on
the place: the word is uſed 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 17. where it is ſaid the
ſervants of Saul <hi>would not fall upon the Prieſts of the Lord.</hi> So
<hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>lest he fall upon us &amp;c.</hi> So that we ſee, there was
ſome poſitive thing required of them, ſome effectual medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating,
and interpoſeing, and hindering of theſe iniquities;
ſome publick owneing and avowing of the truth, and by
publick teſtimonies, or other wayes of interpoſeing, &amp;
falling-into impede, and ſtand in the way of that courſe of
wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>4. So <hi>Ier.</hi> 8: <hi>6. [I hearkened and heard but they ſpake not a right no
man repented him of his wickedneſs ſaying what have I done]</hi> It is not
probable that there was none penitent among them, where
then was <hi>Baruch</hi> and <hi>Ebedmelech Cap.</hi> 38. <hi>7,</hi> 9. and others that
ſtood for the Prophet <hi>Cap.</hi> 26, <hi>8,</hi> 16, 17, 24. But there muſt
be ſome other thing imported, viz. That there was few
or none repenting of national evils, and labouring to remove
theſe, no man was ſtanding up and oppoſeing theſe publick
land defections, &amp; labouring by this meanes to <hi>raiſe up the virgin
of Iſrael who was fallen Amoſ.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Ierm. 9:</hi> 3. <hi>[And they bend their tongues like their bowes for
lies, but they are not valient for the truth upon the earth.]</hi> that is,
they were ready enough, all of them, to imploy their power
to the utmoſt, for the evil cauſe, to eſtablish errour
and a falſe way; but they uſed no valour for the oppreſſed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:105606:117"/>
cauſe and truth of God, they did not their utmoſt to have
Truth eſtablished, and the true Religion: They did not put
out themſelves, or make uſe of their ſtrength, for the
maintainance of truth, and equity in the land, ſay the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Annot.</hi> and they make it parallel with <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59:4. This
was their guilt, and hereby we ſee what was the duty even
of privat perſons (for of ſuch this is to be meaned, as the
context cleareth.) in ſuch a general day of defection, <hi>viz.</hi> to be
valient owners and maintainers of Truth againſt all oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6. Ier. 5: v. 1. [Run yee to and fro throw the ſtreets of Ieruſalem,
and ſee now and know, and ſeek in the broad places thereof, if ye
can finde a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that
ſeeketh the truth, and I will pardon it.]</hi> We can hardly think,
that there were no mourners in ſecret in all <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> though
it is like they were very few: but there was none to owne
the good cauſe, that was now troden under foot, none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirring
themſelves, to oppoſe and hinder the carryed on
courſe of defection. If that had been, the Lord ſayes, he
would have ſpared the place; which shewes, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
a thing this was, and how acceptable it would have
been in the Lords eyes, that for that cauſe he would
have forborne to have deſtroyed them or to have cut them
off.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 22: 30. <hi>[And I ſought for a man among them, that
should make up the hedge, and ſtand in the gap before me, that I
should not deſtroy it, but I found none.]</hi> There were ſome even
at this time ſighing and mourning in ſecret, for theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations,
who were marked <hi>Cap. 9.</hi> but there were none
to make up the hedge, which their provocations had made,
none to redreſſe the publick defection and Apoſtaſy, and
ſtand for the truth and the ſuppreſſing of errour and iniquity.
So is it laid to the charge of their Prophets <hi>Cap.</hi> 13: 5. that
they <hi>did not goe up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge, for the
houſe of Iſrael to ſtand in the battel in the day of the Lord,</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we ſee, that by this ſtanding in the gape and making up
the hedge, more is meaned then a ſecret mourning, even a
faithful and publick owneing of the truth and oppoſeing of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105606:118"/>
defection, and putting a ſtope unto it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did when he
ſtood in the breach, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. (though with authority, as a
Magiſtrate, which private perſones have not) he not only
prayed and wreſtled with the Lord <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. but in great
zeal took the calfe, which they had made, and brunt it in
the fire, and ground it to powder, and ſtrawed it upon the
watter, and made them to drink of it <hi>v.</hi> 20. If there had
been any who thus effectually would have ſtood in the
breach, the Lord ſayes, he would have ſpared them: ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
would ſuch a work have been to him.</p>
               <p>8. So that word <hi>Ier.</hi> 13:18. <hi>[Say unto the King and to the
Queen, humble your ſelves ſit downe, for your principalities shall come
downe, even the crowne of your glory.]</hi> Will import ſomething
more; it being ſpoken to all indefinitely, giveth a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
to all, to deal with King and Queen, to prevent the ſad
dayes which were coming by reaſon of the defection and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
ſinnes.</p>
               <p>9. So that word <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2: 2. <hi>[Plead with your mother, plead, for
she is not my wife,]</hi> which is ſpoken to private perſones, and
ſo is a warrand to them, to contend in judgment (as the
word doth import) againſt the Church, which was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and had forſaken the Lord, and his wayes; and ſo
to ſtand to the defence of truth, and to plead for the cauſe
of God, againſt their very Mother the Church, The body
of the Nation, that not only they might exoner their owne
conſciences, but alſo get things reformed, ſo far as lay in
their power; and keep the memory of the cauſe of God afreſh
that it should not be buryed.</p>
               <p>Theſe places and the like, though we bring them not to
prove immediatly our maine Queſtion (as it may be the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer,</hi>
who uſeth to take but half a look of matters, will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
yet when duely conſidered, in their juſt latitude
and extent, they will clearely evince; That more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of private perſons, in a general day of defection,
then to keep themſelves free of the ſame, or to mourne in
ſecret, or the like. And if we lay them together,
they will clearly prove it the duty of privat perſones, in
ſuch a day of defection, to be publickly declareing their
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:105606:118"/>
abhorrence of the wicked courſes which are carryed on: to
be actually and effectually interpoſeing with King and Great
ones, that a ſtope may be put unto the courſe of wickedneſſe,
and God's wrath averted: that they would plead Zions
cauſe againſt all oppoſers, and thus ſtand up in the gape,
and make up the hedge by publick and avowed owneing of
the oppreſſed truth and cauſe of God: and valiently ſeek and
plead for the truth, and with their Mother the Church,
when all is corrupted, left a bill of divorce be given her:
And this is ſomething more then our <hi>Surveyer</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
And vvhat way this shall help us, vve shall ſee
aftervvard. Novv vve muſt examine What the <hi>Surveyer</hi>
ſayeth.</p>
               <p>He <hi>Pag.</hi> 46. after ſome rambling after his wonted manner,
&amp;miſrepreſenting of the thing wich vvas ſaid in <hi>Naphtaly,</hi> (as
any judicious reader will perceive, ſo that we need not trouble
ourſelves to diſcover the ſame unfaire dealing ſo oft as vve
meet with it, leſt vve should waiſte paper and paines, as
he hath done, in repeating the ſame things over and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,)
He tells us That <hi>[It is not to be doubted that Religion
is the chief intereſt, that men and Chriſtians should look after, and
where it becomes a legall right, and the Magiſtrate who beares the
ſword leads the way, no doubt privat perſones may follow in the violent
defence of it, againſt all oppoſeing the Magiſtrate, the law, and
themſelves in owneing of it.] Anſwer.</hi> This cold laodicean
will give Religion the beſt word, but no more: He grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that it is the chief intereſt that men and Chriſtians should
look after; and yet ſo cautious is he in showing the manner
how they should look after it, that in effect he doth poſtpone
it unto many other lower concernments: For 1. it muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a legal right, ere they defend it. 2. And when it is
become a legal right, they cannot defend it unleſſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
lead the way. But what if a virgine hath not a legal
right unto her chaſtity, by ſuch a law as that leacherous
King <hi>Ewen</hi> the 3. made, shall she not be allowed to defend
the ſame? And if she shall, shall not men be allowed to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their Religion, though ſome iniquous act of Parliament
take the legal right of it away? Yes doubtleſſe if it be the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:105606:119"/>
chief intereſt. Againe, what if an unjuſt act take away
a man's right to his heritage, shall he not be in caſe to defend
it againſt robbers? 2. By his ſecond caution it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that if an army of <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Tartars</hi> were landing in
<hi>Scotland</hi> to robus of our Religion, we might not reſiſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the Magiſtrate did lead the way. But might we not in
that caſe defend our lives and lands? If he should deny it,
I know few that will be of his opinion, and if he grant it,
he muſt not account Religion the chief intereſt. Againe,
what if the Magiſtrate shall permit Subjects to defend their
Lives and Libertyes againſt invaders, though he should not
lead the way? Will he allow it in that caſe? Then he muſt
preferre theſe unto Religion; for Religion, he ſayes, muſt
muſt not be defended, but when the Magiſtrate leads the
way: <hi>[Neither</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>can it enter into a Chriſtian heart, that
it is to be ſurrendred unto the arbitrement or pleaſure of any power in
the world, nor of any Magistrate over us, as this man wickedly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
is done] Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> is this wicked perſon, who
not only ſuggeſts, but upon the matter affirmes it, and avowes
it; for what is it elſe, then to ſurrender our Religion to the
arbitrement of Magiſtrates, to ſay, that we may not ſtand
to the defence thereof, unleſſe they will both authorize it
with their law, and alſo lead the way when any oppoſe it?
That which we will not maintaine without the approbation
and conduct of another, we wholly give up to the diſpoſeing
and pleaſure of that other. What he ſayes concerning our
preſent caſe, shall be conſidered in end, once for all. Then
<hi>Pag.</hi> 47. <hi>[Whatever may be ſaid concerning private mens reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the powers that urge them to idolatry, or falſe Worshipe, or inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their lives, if they will not ſo do, comes not home to the preſent
caſe.] Anſw.</hi> He would do well to ſpeak plaine, and not look
with a double face; Either he thinks it lawful, in this caſe to
reſiſt, or he thinks it unlawful; if he think it unlawful to what
purpoſe doth he make mention of it, as a different caſe from
what is preſently under debate; And will not any ſee that if
he deny this to be lawful, our Religion is wholly given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the arbitrement of the Magiſtrate? If he think it lawful,
he muſt then grant that Religion may be defended, even when
the Magiſtrate who bears the ſword, doth not lead the way,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:105606:119"/>
and why then it should not come home to our preſent caſe, I
do not ſee; for he doth not lay the ſtreſſe of his anſwers on the
inconſiderableneſſe of the ground of the reſiſtence, (though
here and there He hint at that) but upon the unlawfulneſſe of
reſiſting the Magiſtrate, who beares the ſword: Now this
ground faileth him here. But he ads <hi>[Yet Lactantius word, Lib.</hi>
5. c. 20. <hi>is to be well remembered by all private perſones, Defendenda
eſt Religio a privatis omnibus, non occidendo, ſed moriendo] Anſw.</hi>
Then according to <hi>Lactantius</hi> it muſt be unlawful to defend
Religion, even when the Magiſtrat urgeth to idolatry, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
lives if they will not do it: yea if this be generally
received as a truth, The People of Scotland might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Religion againſt an army of <hi>Pagans Turks</hi> or <hi>Tartars,</hi>
if the Soveraigne should not concurre: Which I know not
who would aſſent unto.</p>
               <p>But he will come off with a few notes <hi>Pag.</hi> 47. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That
whereas <hi>Naphtali</hi> ſaid <hi>That to be violented in Religion (which cannot
be without an unjuſt force, either on mens perſons, or on their goods)
is the moſt wicked and inſupportable of all injuries</hi> He thinks <hi>ſuch a
word should have been better guarded, leſt all coactive power of the
magiſtrate in matters of Religion, might ſeem to be diſowned, which
would favoure ſuch, as are for abſolute toleration.</hi> But what
needed this? Could he think that the author of <hi>Naphtaly</hi> did
imagine, That to be violented in any Religion whether true
or falſe, was ſuch an inſupportable injury? Or that it was
his minde to plead for an univerſal toleration? What ground
had he for ſo thinking? Sure that had been prejudical to his
hypotheſis, which this <hi>Surveyer</hi> himſelf will not call a falſe
Religion: will it not ſuffice to ſay, he meaned a violenting in
the true Religion? <hi>[No</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>for what Sectary will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that he is violented for the true Religion, which he will avow
is ſo, according to his conſcience,—and it is this man's principle, that
every man in his diſcretive judgment, is judge of the juſtice or in
juſtice of his owne ſufferings, and accordingly muſt determine a
nent his reſiſtence to the violence] Anſw.</hi> 1. Then it ſeemeth his
guairding of it, in his owne words, ſaying <hi>[It is true, to uſe
violence upon any in their perſons or goods, to bring them to an external
falſe Religion, or to drive them from the true (otherwiſe Religion
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:105606:120"/>
cannot be violented) is the greateſt of injuries]</hi> Is not ſufficient to
ſalve the Magiſtrates co-active power in matters of Religion;
for notwithſtanding of what he ſayes, the pleaders for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
toleration have the ſame door open they had. 2. If
he will deny this diſcretive judgment in matters of ſufferings,
he muſt deny it alſo in matters of acting; for if no man muſt
judge, whether the violence offered him be juſt or unjuſt,
why should a man judge, whether the commands enjoyned
him be lawful or unlawful? And ſo, as he may not ſo judge
of the violence offered him in the matters of Religion, as
to repel unjuſt violence with violence, neither muſt he judge
of the lawfulneſſe of the commands concerning Religion, ſo
as to refuſe obedience to unjuſt commands: And then it
will follow, that ſubjects muſt yeeld blinde obedience to all
the commands of the Magiſtrate in matters of Religion, and
never queſtion any of them: This, I grant, is not to plead
for abſolute toleration, but it is clearly to plead for abſolute
tyranny over conſciences, fit to be heard and received by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,
but by none elſe. 3. We know the moſt lawful
thing may be abuſed, and he dar not ſay that every one who
pleads for a lawful thing, pleads alſo for the abuſe of it. He
who ſayes a man muſt not change his true Religion, at the
command of the Magiſtrate, doth not ſay that a man muſt
not change that Religion, which he thinketh in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is the true Religion, and is not, at the command of
the Magiſtrate: So he vvho fayeth a people may defend
their true Religion, when the Magiſtrate is violenting them
in it, Sayeth not that every Sectarian company may defend
that Religion, which they take to be true, and is not,
when the Magiſtrate is violenting them in it. We ſay not
that an erring conſcience obligeth, or that a man's thinking
that he is injured in the true Religion, is ſufficient ground to
engage him in violent reſiſtance. And he himſelf dar not ſay,
the Religion as reformed in doctrine, worshipe, diſcipline,
and government (which the late defenders owned) is a falſe
Religion: Nor dar he ſay, that the corruptions which they
oppoſed, were the only true and neceſſary Religion. He
ſeems to chant ſome other thing here and there, in this part
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:105606:120"/>
of his pamphlet; but we look for more in the following parts,
where we shall have his minde more fully. Sure the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
they owned, and we ſtand for, was the Religion he
himſelf once owned, and all the Magiſtrates, Supreme and
inferiour ſealed and approved, with their oathes and ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
And the corruptions they and we oppoſe, were once
by himſelf, and all ranks of people of the land, abjured
oftner then once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that all this is but to raiſe duſt in peoples
eyes, to the end they may miſtake the way <hi>[Againe (ſayes he)
does not this man plainely profeſse to ſtir up all, with whom he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
to violente others, Magiſtrates, Church-men, people and
all, in the matter of their profeſſion?] Anſw.</hi> Their profeſſion is
manifeſt and profeſſed perjury; for they have renunced the
reformed Religion which they once owned, and avowed
with hands lifted up to the Moſt High, and their extant ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
beare witneſſe againſt them; and all the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and publick meetings, in which this Religion was
owned, are witneſſes above all exception. And they have
with the dog licked up their vomite, which once they
ſpewed out with an oath of abjuration. 2. But wherein
are they violented? Do they that ſtand to the defence of
their Religion, and labour or endeavour to have corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
formerly abjured, purged out, incurre the crime of
violenting others? Yes <hi>for</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>even private men are
ſtirred by bloody exhortations, to be revenged on, and punish all
Magiſtrates and others, whoſe blood they thirſt for, becauſe of their
not being of their way, which they call Religion.) Anſwer.</hi> This
is but one of many of his bloody aſſertions, ſavouring neither
of Chriſtianity, nor prudence, but much of cruelty and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:
and we ſee his teeth, and his tongue both; But the
judge of the innocent heareth and ſeeth. 2, Did not this
perjured wretch and his fraternity call this way, Religion,
and the true Reformed Religion, when they ſwore thoſe
Covenants, &amp; will he now come &amp; ſpeak thus? O but he muſt
have a brazen face &amp; an abdured conſcience! Ay but he tells
us afterward, <hi>Pag.</hi> 48. that <hi>[Whether truth lye on our ſide or
his, as to the poynts of Church government is the question, and if we
will not admit publick powers and authorities to be judges in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:105606:121"/>
far leſſe have they reaſon to admit of privat perſones.] Anſw.</hi>
1. It ſeemeth it is paſt queſtion with him, that the vomite
which he hath licked up, is the moſt fatning morſel, that
ever he gote; but the moſt fatning food is not alwayes the
moſt wholeſome: And I fear this shall prove ſo to him, if
he repent not, when for it, the wrath of God and the long &amp;
broad curſe shall enter into his dwelling place, and into his
very ſoul. 2. We are content the ſtreſſe of the buſineſſe
lie upon that queſtion, and shall be glade to hear what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
his new food hath put into him, to maintaine that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and abjured cauſe. 3. We look not upon our publick
powers and authorities as Judges competent in that matter,
nor did they judge, as Judges should have done, when they
ſet up that abhomination; but as men mad on their idols, ſo
did they run, to pleaſe, he knoweth, whom. 4. This is the
very thing which Papiſts ſay anent the judge of controverſies,
ſave that he puts the civil Magiſtrate, in place of the <hi>Pope.</hi>
5. This controverſy is not to be judged till now, and privat
perſones may be ſufficient judges of what was ſworne and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by King, and all rankes of People, and muſt have
more ſolide grounds and motives to induce then to renunce
what they have been fully perſwaded was truth, and have
owned as ſuch, under the paine of damnation, by their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Oathes and vowes; then the meer vvill and command
of a Creature, as obnoxious to errour &amp; miſtakes as another.
And as for vvhat he hath a minde to ſay upon that head, it is
novv a little too too late, unleſſe he be able to do, vvhat
never one before hath done, <hi>viz.</hi> prove that forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
the only neceſſary government, <hi>Iure Divino,</hi>
perpetually binding all, in all ages: but the vulgar vvill have a
ſufficient antidote againſt all, vvhich he can ſay, by ſeeing &amp;
hearing, vvhat they have ſeen and heard theſe yeers bygone,
both vvhen this abhomination vvas but about to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and ſince it hath gote up to its pinacle, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should be ſaid, of the abhominable &amp; ſcandalous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of ſuch as have imbraced that Antichriſtian courſe, a true
hiſtorical relation of vvhich vvould make the eares of all true
Chriſtians to tingle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:105606:121"/>
His 2. note is upon the <hi>probable capacity</hi> which <hi>Naphtaly</hi> ſpoke
of: this brings to his <hi>minde Bellarmin's excuſe why the ancient
Chriſtians took not armes againſt Nero, becauſe they wanted temporal
ſtrength.</hi> But might not that excuſe be good in itſelf though
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> made uſe of it? I ſuppoſe upon ſecond ſearch, it
will be found, that they had not ſuch a capacity, as he, it
may be, ſuppoſeth: But of this afterward. It brings to his
minde alſo what <hi>Creſwel</hi> the Jeſuite ſaid againſt the Edict of
<hi>Q. Elizabeth.</hi> But all this is nothing to the purpoſe, for
neither we, nor <hi>Naphtaly</hi> joyne with the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> (whatever
he ſay) as to the depoſeing and throwing downe of Princes,
and all Magiſtrates, and punishing them by private hands.
But if he think this condition, in private perſons reſiſting of
violence, <hi>Ieſuitical,</hi> viz. <hi>if they be in a probable capacity to do it.</hi>
He muſt give us leave to ſay, It is very rational, and he is
more then brutish to think otherwiſe: For will he ſay, that
it is an indiſpenſable duty, for Ten private perſones, though
they had their Magiſtrates with them, to go and reſiſt an
army of Ten Thouſand, unleſſe they have an extraordinary
particular &amp; peremptory cal of God? Sure then he but shewes
his folly to carpe at ſuch things as theſe, let him read,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 14: 31.</p>
               <p>Next let us ſee what he hath <hi>Pag.</hi> 84. 85. 86. Where he
ſayeth 1. (<q>That albeit it be God's holy will, that in
erections of civil government, his Truth, ſincere worshipe
and glory in theſe, should be mainly minded and intended
by men, and it is mens duty ſo to do; yet it is clear that in
many places <hi>de facto</hi> it is not ſo; although men in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
profeſſe aiming at Truth, and right worshipe, yet
there are aberrations in the particular.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is very
true, and not only do we ſee that it is ſo <hi>de facto;</hi> but alſo that
where conſcience hath been made of mindeing Gods truth,
ſincere vvorshipe, and glory, and theſe ſo twiſted in, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
with the conſtitution of the civil government, that
they became to the ſubject, a piece of their National patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
ſecured by all meanes imaginable, not only theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
things are not minded, but they are ſought to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
and deſtroyed. 2. Since he grants that it is men's
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:105606:122"/>
duty ſo to do, how can he condemne what the honeſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
of <hi>Scotland</hi> did, and what the king conſented to,
and owned? Was that any thing elſe but to establish and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the reformed Religion in Doctrine, worshipe, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and government, for the glory of God, and the good of
the nations?</p>
               <p>Next he ſayes, [<q>Albeit there be in the poynt of truth,
and the worshipe of God, anotable perverſion and ſwerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that doth not at all invalidate the authority, nor
break the obligation thereunto, although it be injurious,
to favourers of Truth and right Worshipe: for although Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
be not minded, as it ought to be, God will not
have the Commonwealths, where juſtice between Man
and Man is maintained, for his glory, caſten looſe; nor
have men think themſelves looſed from obligation to the
government—for neither muſt they be heard, who hold
that civil dominion is founded on grace, nor they who ſay,
That infidel, heretical, or excommunicate Magiſtrates
fall from their power, or that the ſubjects obligation to
them ceaſeth.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Yet vvhere the maintainance of
Truth, and of the right vvorshipe is a fundamental pillar of
the conſtitution, and a maine article of the compact betwixt
Magiſtrates and ſubjects, a failing here is a looſing of the
government, and of the Subjects obligation, if not in
vvhole, yet in ſo far; 2. A pleading for the obſervation of
the compact and maintainance of the Truth and Worshipe of
God, conforme to ſworne compacts, is no breaking of the
obligation, but rather a way to have it ſtrengthened and made
more firme: Much leſſe can they be charged with this,
who plead only for a liberty of defence of the ſame Truth
and Worshipe, againſt manifeſt injuries, contrary to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
vowes and compacts. 3. Such as reſiſt the unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Magiſtrates, do not therby looſe themſelves from
the obligation to government, otherwiſe every woman
who in defence of her chaſtity reſiſted the prince, should
die as a Traitor, 4. We abhore both that opinion, that
dominion is founded on grace, and that other of the Papiſts:
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:105606:122"/>
we ſtand upon other grounds, as hath been, and may yet be,
furder shewed.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of what he ſays in the 4 place (for what he
hath ſaid in the 3 place is but ſome conceſſions, which are
touched already) is this [<q>That to reforme in a publick
coactive way, by the uſe of the vindicative and punitive
ſword, belongeth alone to the Magiſtrate, ſo that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones
of meer private capacity, cannot uſe that ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Magiſtrates, and their fellow ſubjects, to violent
them in matters of Religion, or which they account Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and punish them for not being, of their Religion.</q>]
<hi>Anſw.</hi> It is but his groundleſſe calumny, to ſay that <hi>Naphtaly</hi>
ſayes all this, and ſo it is nothing to the queſtion in hand,
which is concerning privat perſons maintaineing their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and endeavouring to have corruptions removed, which
may wel be, without the leaſt incroachment upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates;
and ſince he ſpeakes not to this, he either declares
himſelf unable to confute what we ſay; or he fowle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevaricates, to the palpable betraying of his owne
cauſe; or both.</p>
               <p>Then he tells us further. [<q>That the great mistake in all
this matter is, That we think the Magiſtrate &amp; People,
are, as to their Covenant with God, debtors bound in a band
conjunctly and ſeverally, for one ſum, ſo that in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of the one. the other muſt pay all, and hath power
to diſtreſſe the deficient—whereas they binde, but
for their ſeveral moieties of a ſum—ſo that if the People
reforme themſelves, and keep themſelves pure from ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations,
the Magiſtrates deficiency (which they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerat
with grief) shall not be imputed to them: Becauſe
God giveth them not a calling to intrude into the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
office—there lyes no obligation on them to
force the King, or their fellow ſubjects to external meanes
of Worship and Religion.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the ſumme of
what he ſpendeth many words about, but it may be eaſily
anſwered. For 1. By this <hi>ſimile</hi> he will wronge the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate:
for as the People may not preſſe the Magiſtrate to
pay his moyety, how may He preſſe the Subjects to pay

their moyety? 2. If the Magiſtrate break to God, and
will not pay his moyety of the ſumme, he cannot preſſe the
Subjects to break alſo, and not to pay their part; but whether
he will or not, they are bound to keep Covenant: and if he
force them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his violence is unjuſt and illegall (for no law
can warrand People to break their Covenant with God)
and may lawfully be reſiſted; and this is enough for us.
3. A better lawyer then he <hi>Althuſius pol. cap.</hi> 28. <hi>n.</hi> 18. tels us
that in thoſe Religious Covenants, Magiſtrates and People
are bound conjunctly and ſeverally, ſo that the whole ſumme
may be required of either of the corrëi: <hi>Ita ſunt corrëi</hi> (ſayes he)

4. But now the queſtion is what is the Peoples duty, in a
day of defection? He ſayes it is only to keep themſelves
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:105606:123"/>
pure from the abhominations, and reforme themselves. But
we have shewed above that the ſcripture requireth more,
even ſome active endeavour, to have the National Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
removed, though not to uſurpe the Magiſtrates place.
But ſayes he [<q>The late Covenant it ſelf, doth bind <hi>private
perſons in their places and callings</hi> (which certanely are private,
and to be managed by private means) to endeavour refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
&amp; doth not bind any number of private perſons to
pull the ſword out of the Magiſtrate's hand, when they
think he uſeth it otherwiſe then he should, and then they
would have him uſe it—if the Covenant be paſſive of ſuch
commentaryes, as this man puts upon it, That whatever
any private party accounts Reformation, they may uſe the
vindictive punishing ſword againſt all, of all degrees,
that ſtand in their way to advance the ſame, we have
little reaſon to be in love with it; and juſt cauſe to caſt it
by, till it be cleared of ſuch corrupt gloſſes.</q> [<hi>Anſwer.</hi>
I feare the <hi>Surveyer</hi> be ſo out of love with it, and have ſo caſt
it by, that were it never ſo cleared (as it is cleare enough)
he hath no minde to take it up againe, and he beſt knoweth
what it vvas that moved him to caſt it off. But 2. as <hi>Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
ſaid vvel, That clauſe annexed can not be ſo reſtrictive,
as this <hi>Surveyer</hi> would have it; for certanely it cannot bind
up privat men's hands, from doing of theſe things, which
otherwiſe were commanded them to do. Now whether this
Covenant had been or not, more would have been required of
private perſons, in a time of great and univerſal or a national
defection, then at other times. Every man is bound accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his place and ſtation to preſerve he Kings perſon and
authority. Now put the caſe that ſome party or faction
should captivate him, This man will grant that private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones,
without the conduct of inferiour Magiſtrates, may
joyn together, if they be in a capacity to break thorow impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
&amp; through the interprize, and labour his vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and delivery, and reſtauration: Would he in this caſe
condemne theſe men, as acting without their sphere, or as
uſurpers: I ſuppoſe not: Let him then apply this to our
caſe. and he will eaſily ſee the parallel. So it is the duty of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:105606:124"/>
burgeſſes in their places and ſtations, to promove the good
of the ſociety: Now ſuppoſe a fire kindle, and ſuch as are
appointed to overſee the quenching of fires either are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or careleſſe, or half willing the Town should be burnt,
shall private perſones hands be bound up from doing what
they can, in what order they may, to ſave the Towne?
shall they be accounted tranſgreſſours, or Uſurpers of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat's
place, though they should materially occupy his
roome for that exigent? No certanely, they should rather be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
faithful citizens, mindeful of their oath and promiſe.
So when an army is engaged with the Enemy, if the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
should perfidiouſly betray their truſt, and leave their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſeek the deſtruction of the army, in their ſtation, It
would be accounted no uſurpation, in any private perſons,
who could beſt fill theſe roomes and places, for theſe exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
to do what they could, for the ſaifty of the army:
Nor would this be thought contrare to their oath. When
a Maſter of a Shipe either through ſotishneſſe, or vvicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
vvould run the ship againſt the rock, any private Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in that caſe of neceſſity, may, to ſave his ovvne
life and the lives of all vvho are in the shipe, do the
beſt he can, to prevent deſtruction, without any ſinful
tranſgreſſing the bounds of his calling. Whence we may
underſtand, that in caſes of extreame neceſſity, private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones
may do more, then in ordinary caſes; and yet not
ſinfully goe beyond their places and callings: and though
materially, they, for that exigent, occupy the places of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
who ſinfully, unfaithfully, and baſely, either neglect
or betray their truſt; yet they cannot be accounted Uſurpers:
nor is it rational to ſay, that ſuch as plead for the lawfulneſſe
of this, do plead for the lawfulneſſe of private perſons pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſword out of the Magiſtrate's hands, whenſoever
they think he uſeth it otherwiſe then he should, or when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he uſeth it otherwiſe then they would have him uſe it;
and uſeing the vindictive punishing ſword againſt all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and others, that ſtand in their way. By this alſo,
vve may ſee what injury he doth to <hi>Naphtaly,</hi> when he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſuch conſequences from vvhat he ſaid <hi>Pag, 151.</hi> and there
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:105606:124"/>
did shevv by the <hi>ſimile</hi> adduced, that ſuch a thing vvas to be
done only in extreame inevitable and urgent neceſſity. And
what the <hi>Surveyer</hi> hath ſaid <hi>Pag. 116. and 117.</hi> needeth no
other anſvvere.</p>
               <p>This is not all, he muſt harpe on this ſtring againe <hi>Pag. 103.</hi>
where he ſayes [<q>That it is to ruine all order, to teach that
the advancing Religion, not only <hi>actibus elicitis</hi> but <hi>actibus
imperatis,</hi> which belong to the Magiſtrate, may be medled
with by the people-extraordinary neceſſities are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
pleaded then juſtified, as ground ſufficient for ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereto there is no extraordinary call]</q> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though
this be ſufficiently anſwered before, yet we ſay, 1. That
order is already ruined, when the Magiſtrat deſtroyeth what
he should preſerve, and ſo croſſeth his commiſſion: and who
teach that in ſuch an extraordinary caſe, when God's order
is violated and broken, and all in hazard to be overturned,
ſuch things might be done, which needed not to be done,
if God's order and appoyntment were obſerved, do not take
a way to ruine all order, but rather to preſerve that, vvhich
order it ſelf is appoynted, as a meane, to preſerve. 2. We
plead not for ſuch formal imperate acts, in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as due to privat perſones (as we have ſaid.) But for a
povver, according to the ability God puteth into their
hands to hinder him from being dishonoured, to defend
their ovvne profeſſion and Religion, to hinder an univerſal
apoſtaſy, and to endeavour in their capacities, to have things
righted, vvhich are out of order. And vvhen private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones
are carrying themſelves thus, vve deny that they are
runing out of their rank and calling; nor can he prove it.
3. Will he ſay that no actions can be ſufficiently juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
done in extraordinary neceſſities and vvithout an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
call? Then he shall condemne the Covenants
which <hi>David</hi> made vvith the men of <hi>Iſrael, 2 Sam. 5.</hi> and
vvhich <hi>Iehojadah</hi> made betwixt the King &amp; the People: For he
told us that both theſe vvere in extraordinary occaſions, and
he cannot shovv us any extraordinary call. He addeth [<q>If
Magiſtrates be deficient—privat perſons are ſufficiently
diſcharged, if they keep themſelves pure, and do vvhat
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:105606:125"/>
poſſibly they can, for advanceing Religion in their privat ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
and by their <hi>Elicite</hi> acts—if a mans eyes be put out
his eares, or other ſenſes will goe as far to ſupply that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as may be; yet, cannot help the body by elicite acts
of ſeeing. So whatever length private perſons may goe,
for the good of the body, they muſt not goe to exerciſe
and exert formally, acts magiſtratical.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> All alongs
we heare nothing but dictatings: This and this he ſayes, and
there is an end, a noble patron of a deſperat cauſe, and worthy
of a great hire. But. 1. The queſtion ſtill abideth undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed
how far privat perſons capacity doth reach; for that
they muſt do more then keep themſelves pure we have shevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
2. If they may do what poſſibly they can, for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing
Religion in their capacities, they may do more then he
will have them doing; for then they may defend Religion with
the ſword, and with violence hinder idolatry and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and what of that nature provocketh God to wrath.
All this and more is within their capacity and poſſibility, as
he would eaſily grant, if the Magiſtrate vvould but counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
it, yea and though he should oppoſe, ſay vve. But he
will ſay, theſe are not elicite acts. And vvill he grant noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
elſe to privat ſubjects but elicit acts? Then he vvill not
grant them liberty to diſput for Religion, to exhort, rebuke
and admonish &amp;c. for theſe are not elicite acts, more then
diſputing vvith the ſvvord, and ſo vvith his Philoſophick
diſtinctions, he vvould charme us into a perfect acquieſcence
vvith vvhat Religion the King vvill enjoyne. 3. Eares and
other ſenſes never ſet up the eyes, and gave them povver to
ſee for their good: But the People ſet up the Magiſtrates,
and may do, when the Magiſtrate layeth downe his ſword,
or avowedly betrayeth his truſt, what they might have done
before they made choice of him. 4. By this <hi>Simile</hi> it would
follow that the People cannot only not do the Magiſtrate's
<hi>Imperat</hi> acts, but not ſo much as the <hi>Elicite</hi> acts which he may
do, vvhich is falſe. 5. Though they cannot exert or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<hi>Formally</hi> acts Magiſtratical, if they may do it <hi>Materially,</hi>
we ſeek no more. In end he tell us. <q>That it is a dangerous
and deſtructive tenent to be held forth to be beleeved by
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:105606:125"/>
People</q> 
                  <q>That in all caſes whether concerning Religion or
Liberty, when they account the Magiſtrate to pervert the
government, that they are <hi>Eatenus</hi> in ſo far, even as if they
had no King, and that the royalty hath recurred to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and they may act and exerciſe it formally as if they
had no King at all] and this he tels us is the expreſſe doctrine
of <hi>Lex Rex Pag. 99. 100.</hi>
                  </q> Novv that all may ſee vvhat a
shameleſſe and impudent man this is, and how little reaſon any
have to give him credite, I shall recite the authors very
words. [<q>But becauſe (<hi>ſayeth he</hi>) the Eſtates never gave the
King power to corrupt Religion, and preſſe a falſe and I
dolatrous worshipe upon them; Therefore when the
King defendeth not true Religion, but preſſeth upon the
People a falſe and Idolatrous Religion (<hi>this is ſome other thing
then when they</hi> account <hi>the Magiſtrate to pervert &amp;c.</hi>) in that they
are not under the King, but are preſumed to have no King <hi>eate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
ſo farre, &amp; are preſumed to have power in themſelves, as
if they had not appoynted any King at all—If an incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
accuſed of Treaſon &amp; in danger of the ſentence of death,
shall appoynt a lawyer to advocate their cauſe,—if he
be ſtricken with dumbneſſe, becauſe they have loſed their
legal and repreſentative tongue, none can ſay, that this
incorporation hath loſed the tongues that nature hath
given them, ſo as by natures law they may not plead in their
owne juſt and lawful defence, as if they had never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
the foreſaid lawyer to plead for them. The
King—is made by God and the People King, for the
Church and People of God's ſake, that he may defend true
Religion, for the behove and ſalvation of all: If then
he defend not Religion—(NB) in his publick and
Royal way, It is preſumed as undenyable, That the
People of God who by the law of nature, are to care for
their owne ſoull, are to defend (NB) in their way, true
Religion, which ſo nearly concerneth them and their
eternall happineſſe.</q>] Now let any judge if this be ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and deſtructive a tenent, As he would make his reader
beleeve. But it is eaſy for him who hath no shame, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
ſentences which he cannot confute, and then call them
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:105606:126"/>
dangerous and deſtructive: and thus he will make the rabble of
the degenerate clergy and other ſimple ones beleeve, that he
hath confuted <hi>Lex Rex.</hi> And thus dealeth he with <hi>Naphtaly</hi>
as we have shewed already.</p>
               <p>Having thus conſidered all which the <hi>Surveyer</hi> hath here
and there ſpoken againſt that which we have ſaid, let us now
come to apply what hath been ſaid, unto our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
of vindicating the late act of defence; which, by what
we have ſaid, we finde cannot be juſtly condemned as trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
or rebellious, but rather approved and commended
as loyall ſervice to God and the Countrey.</p>
               <p>For 1. Thereby they were profeſſing their conſtancy, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereing
to the reformation of Religion in doctrine, worshipe
Diſcipline and Government, which was conſonant to the
word of God, and publickly received with all ſolemnities
imaginable, notwithſtanding of acts and lawes made to the
contrary: and no true Chriſtian will ſay, That ſubjects should
imbrace any Religion which Magiſtrates will countenance
and preſcribe, be what it will, or upon that account.</p>
               <p>2. As they were thereby declareing their ſoul abhorrence
of theſe corruptions, which were countenanced and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
by ſinful acts and ſtatutes; ſo they were defending, to
the utmoſt of their power, the reformed Religion, according
to their Covenant, and vow to God. And that ſuch a defence
as this, is lawful, we have shewed.</p>
               <p>3. They were defending themſelves againſt intolerable and
manifeſtly unjuſt violence, offered becauſe of their adhereing
to the cauſe of God, and to the reformed Religion, which
King, Parliament, and all rankes of People in the land, were
ſolemnely ſworne to owne, and avow, all the dayes of their
lives, really, ſincerely and conſtantly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
to God, in the great day; no leſſe then they.</p>
               <p>4. They were mindeing their Oath and Covenant made
with God, with hands lifted up, with ſolemne atteſtations,
and proteſtations; the Covenants which they did make and
renew in the preſence of Almighty God, the Searcher of all
hearts, with a true intention to performe the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:105606:126"/>
5. They were endeavouring in their places and ſtations
(according to the latitude allowed in times of ſuch neceſſitie,
and in matters of ſuch weight and moment) to have the
Church and Kingdome purged of theſe abhominable and
crying corruptions, and grievous abhominations, which
provoke the Lord to wrath, againſt the whole Church and
Kingdome.</p>
               <p>6. They were defending the maine fundamental law and
conſtitution of the Kingdome, and that maine article of
Agreement and Compact betwixt Soveraigne and Subject,
which all the members of the Nation, were no Leſſe bound
unto, then they.</p>
               <p>7. They were joyning together, as detaſteing that dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
indifferency and neutrality abjured, to defend and aſſiſt
one another in the ſame cauſe of maintaining their reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion, with their beſt counſel, bodyes, meanes,
and whole power, againſt the old, inveterate and Common
enemie, that malignant ſpirit and rage; according to their
Covenants.</p>
               <p>8. They were repenting of their National ſin, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
(by their ſinful ſilence, &amp; not giving open, faithful,
and faire teſtimony, when the Truth of God was openly and
violently trode under foot) with that dreadful courſe of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlideing,
which was violently carryed on. They were calling
for juſtice, and valiently pleading for truth, ſinfully and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically
borne downe and oppreſſed. They were with zeal
and courage valiently interpoſeing, &amp; labouring to put a ſtop
to the begun and far-carryed-on defection, when truth was
failing, and he who depairted from evil made himſelf a prey,
that God might pardon, and look in mercy on the land.
They were endeavouring to ſtand in the gape and make up
the hedge; and pleading with their Mother Church, or a
malignant faction in her, shamefully departing from God,
when there was no other way or meane to be followed, or
eſſaved.</p>
               <p>When all theſe things are duely conſidered and laid to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether,
It will appeare to impartial and unbyaſſed perſones,
That the late act which is ſo much condemned and cryed our
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:105606:127"/>
againſt, is not ſo hainous and unpardonable a crime, as this
<hi>Surveyer</hi> and his wicked party vvould give it out to be: but
vvas a noble and laudable interprize, for the glory of God,
the good of Religion, Church and Kingdome; beſide that
it vvas a moſt neceſſary and unavoydable act of ſelf defence.
Since the Scriptures formerly cited vvill allovv more unto
private perſons, then vvhat this <hi>Surveyer</hi> reſtricketh them
unto, (as vve have shevved) in a time of defection: Then
vvhen there vvas no other vvay left to do theſe dutyes there
required, and vvhen vvith all ſeveral other things did call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud
to a mutual conjunction in armes for defence of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and repelling of unjuſt violence, and proſecuteing the
holy and neceſſary ends of the Covenants vvhich they ſvvore,
no man in reaſon can ſuppoſe that ſuch a vvork is repugnant
to Scripture or right reaſon, but rather moſt conſonant to
both.</p>
               <p>And though many do and will condemne the ſame, even as
to this interprize of Reformation, upon what grounds and
motives themſelves beſt know, yet Our worthy and Noble
Reformer famous <hi>Mr Knox</hi> if he were living this day,
would be far from ſpeaking after the language of ſuch. For
he in his appellation <hi>Pag. 22. &amp;c.</hi> hath theſe words [The
<q>ſecond is, that the punishing of ſuch crimes, as are idolatry
blaſphemy, &amp; others that touch the Majeſty of God, doth
not Appertaine to the Kings and chief rulers only; but alſo
to the whole body of the People, and to every member of
the ſame, according to the vocation of every man, and
according to that poſſibility and occaſion which God doth
miniſter, to revenge the injury done againſt his glory,
when that impiety is manifeſtly knowne: And that doth
<hi>Moſes</hi> plainly ſpeak <hi>Deut. 13: v. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</hi> in theſe
words, if in any of the cities &amp;c.—plaine it is that
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh not, nor giveth charge to Kings, Rulers,
and judges only; but he commandeth the whole body of
the People, yea and every member of the ſame, according
to their poſſibility: And who dar be ſo impudent, as to
deny this to be moſt reaſonable and juſt; for, ſeing that
God had delivered, the whole body from bondage; and to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:105606:127"/>
the whole multitude had given his law; and to the twelve
Tribes had he ſo diſtributed the inheritance of the land of
<hi>Canaan!</hi> that no family could complaine that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected;
was not the People and every member addebted,
to acknowledge, and confeſſe the benefites of God? Yea,
had it not been the part of every man, to have ſtudyed to
have keeped the poſſeſſion which he had received? Which
thing God did plainly pronounce they should not do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that in their hearts they did ſanctify the Lord God;
that they embraced, and inviolably keeped his Religion
eſtablished; and finally except, they did put away ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
from amongſt them, declareing themſelves earneſt
Enemies to theſe abhominations, which God declared
himſelf ſo vehemently to hate, that firſt he commanded
the whole inhabitants of that Countrey to be deſtroyed,
and all monuments of their idolatry to be broken downe.
—But in ſuch caſes Gods will is, that all creatures
ſtoup, cover their faces, and deſiſt from reaſoning, when
commandement is given to execute his judgement. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I could adduce diverſe cauſes of ſuch ſeverity; yet will
I ſearch none other then the holy ghoſt hath aſſigned; firſt,
that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> hearing of the judgement, should feare to
commit the like abhomination; and ſecondly, That the
Lord might turne from the fury of his anger, might be
moved towards the People with inward affection, be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyful
unto them, &amp; multiply them, according to his oath
made unto their Fathers: Which reaſons as they are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in God's children to correct the murmuring of grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flesh; ſo ought they to provoke every man, as before I
have ſaid, to declare himſelf an enemy to that which ſo
highly provoketh the wrath of God againſt the whole
People: For where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayeth <hi>Let the city be burned, &amp;c.</hi>
he plainly doth ſignify that by the defection and idolatry of
a few, Gods wrath is kindled againſt the whole, which is
never quenched till ſuch punishment be taken upon the
offenders, that whatſoever ſerved them in their idolatry be
brought to deſtruction, becauſe that it is execrable and
curſed before God; and therefore he will not that it be
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:105606:128"/>
reſerved to any uſe of his People. I am not ignorant That
this law was not put into execution, as God commanded;
but what did thereof enſue and follow? Hiſtories declare,
viz. plague after plague till <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> were led into
captivity, as the Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> do witneſſe. The
conſideration whereof maketh me more bold, To affirme
that it is the duty of every man, who deſireth to eſcape the
plague and punishment of God, to declare himſelf Enemy
to idolatry, not only in heart hateing the ſame, but alſo in
external geſture declareing, that he lamenteth, if he can
do no more, for ſuch abhominations—of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
I ſuppoſe, it be evident. That the punishment of
idolatry, doth not appertaine to Kings only, but alſo to
the whole People, yea to every member of the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his poſſibility: For, that is a thing moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
that no man can mourne lament and bewail for theſe
things, which he will not remove to the uttermoſt of his
power.] And a little thereafter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not to affirme that the Gentiles (I meane every City, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme,

Chriſt Jeſus and his true Religion) be bound to the

them, in theſe words <hi>Exod.</hi> 34: 12, 13, 14.—to this ſame
law and Covenant are the Gentiles no leſſe bound, then ſome

eyes of any multitude, Province, People, or City, and
puteth the ſword in their ovvn hand, to remove ſuch enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
from amongſt them, as before they knevv to be
abhominable. Then, I ſay, are they no leſſe bound, to
purge their Dominions, Cities, and Countreyes, from
idolatry, then vvere the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> vvhat time they received

               <p>That God doth punish ſome, and that moſt juſtly, for
the ſinnes of others, the Scripture doth abundantly verifie:
Not to inſiſt on the inſtances of his punishing of whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
for the ſinnes of the Head of the family: as the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Pharaoh, Gen. 12: v.</hi> 17. of <hi>Abimelech, Gen. 20: v. 17, 18.</hi>
of <hi>Corah</hi> and his companions, <hi>Num. 16: v.</hi> 27, 32, 33. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,
Ioſ. 7: v.</hi> 24, 25. of Ieroboam, 1 King. 14: v. 10, 11. &amp;
<hi>Cap.</hi> 15: 29. of <hi>Ahab, 1 King. 21: v. 21, 22, 24. 2 King. 9: v.</hi> 8.
of <hi>Baasha, 1 King.</hi> 16: 3, 4. of <hi>Iehoram, 2 Chron. 21: 14.</hi> Nor
on the inſtances of his punishing of Servants for the ſinnes of
their Maſters, or the Children and Poſterity for the ſinnes
of their Parents, as in the 2 Command, where he threatneth
to viſite the iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children,
unto the 3 and 4 generation. So alſo <hi>Levit. 26: ver. 38, 39.
Deut. 28: v. 18, 32, 45, 46.</hi> So the Children of ſuch as were
drowned in the flood, <hi>Gen. 6, &amp; 7.</hi> The poſterity of <hi>Canaan,
Gen. 9: v. 24, 25, 26, 27.</hi> The children of the <hi>Egyptians, Exod. 11:

acknowledge &amp; are humbled for not only their owne ſinnes, but
the ſinnes of their Fathers, <hi>Ezra 9. Dan. 9. Job</hi> ſayes <hi>Cap. 21:
v. 19. God layeth up his iniquity</hi> (or the punishment of his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:105606:129"/>
as it is in the margine) <hi>for his children.</hi> But to paſſe theſe
we finde moreover.</p>
               <p>1. That People have been punished for the ſinnes of their
Paſtors, or in hazard to be punished therefore. When <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi>
and <hi>Abihu</hi> had provoked the Lord with their ſtrange fire,
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſpoke unto <hi>Aaron</hi> and to his other two Sones, and
ſayd, <hi>Levit. 10: v. 6. Vncover not your heads, neither rend your
cloathes, leſt you die,</hi> (N. B.) <hi>and left wrath come upon all the
People.</hi> So that their ſin would not only have brought
wrath upon themſelves, but alſo upon all the People. So
the wickedneſſe of <hi>Hophny</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> was part of the cauſe
of that ſad diſcomfiture, that the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did meet
with, <hi>1 Sam. 2: ver. 12.</hi> comp: with <hi>Cap. 3: ver. 11.</hi> and
with <hi>Cap. 4: ver. 10, 11.</hi> So <hi>Eſai. 43: ver. 27, 28.</hi> becauſe the
Teachers had tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord. <hi>Therefore was Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
given to the curſe and Iſrael to reproaches.</hi> So <hi>Lam. 4: v. 13.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other provocations, the ſinnes of her Prophets are
mentioned, and the iniquities of her Prieſts. So <hi>Micah.</hi> 3:
v. 11, 12. <hi>Becauſe the Heads did judge for reward, and the Prieſts
did teach for hire, and the Prophets did divine for money, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Zion was to be plowed as a field and Ieruſalem to become
heaps, and the mountaine of the houſe, as the high places of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That the ſinnes of a few have procured judgments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the whole multitude, or put them in hazard thereof. So
<hi>Deut. 13: v. 12, 17.</hi> the Apoſtate city would kindle the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God's anger againſt the whole People: For it is
ſaid, <hi>The Lord would not turne from the fierceneſſe of his anger, and
shew them mercy and compaſſion, and multiply them, until it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and all that was within it.</hi> So <hi>Num. 25.</hi> for the ſinne
of theſe who joyned with <hi>Baal peor</hi> the anger of the Lord was
kindled againſt the whole congregation. So when <hi>Moſes</hi>
was ſpeaking unto the two Tribes and halfe, <hi>Num. 32: 14, 15.</hi>
he ſayeth, <hi>And behold yee are riſen up in your Fathers ſtead—to
augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Iſrael, for if yee turne
away from after him, he will yet againe leave them in the wilderneſse,
and yee shall destroy all this People.</hi> So <hi>Ioſ. 7: ver. 5.</hi> for one
<hi>Ahan's</hi> ſin, all Iſrael was troubled, and <hi>Ios. 22: v. 17. 18.</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:105606:130"/>
ſay the commiſſioners of the whole congregation, unto the
two Tribes and half, <hi>And it will be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeing, ye-rebel to day againſt
the Lord, that to morrow, he will be wroth, with the whole congregation
of Iſrael.</hi> And it was this which moved all the Tribes to goe
againſt <hi>Benjamin, Iudg. 20</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That the Subjects have ſuffered ſad and dreadful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the ſinnes of their Rulers: As <hi>Micah 3: 9, 10, 11, 12.</hi>
formerly cited: <hi>Abimelech's</hi> ſin, <hi>Gen. 20.</hi> was like to hazard
himſelf, and all his Kingdome, <hi>ver. 7, 9.</hi> For <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> goe, not only he and his Princes, but
his Subjects through all his coaſts, did ſmarte, <hi>Exod. 6, and
7: &amp; 8, and</hi> 9. and 10 <hi>Cap. Neh. 9: v. 10.</hi> So <hi>Saul's</hi> ſin in
ſeeking to deſtroy the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> brought on three yeers famine
on the land in the dayes of <hi>David, 2 Sam. 21: v. 1.</hi> So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi>
ſin of numbering the people coſt the lives of three ſcore
and Ten thouſand, <hi>2 Sam. 24: v. 1, 2, 15. 1 Chron. 21: 1, 2, 14.</hi>
So the Lord threatned by the Prophet, <hi>1 King, 14: ver. 16.</hi>
that for the ſins of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who did ſin, and who made
<hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, he would give up <hi>Iſrael,</hi> And for <hi>Ahab's</hi> ſin of
letting <hi>Benhadad</hi> goe, the Man of God told <hi>Ahab, 1 King. 20:
ver. 42. Becauſe thou hast let goe out of thy hand a man whom I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall goe for his life,
and thy People for his People.</hi> So for <hi>Manaſſeh's</hi> ſin, <hi>Ier. 15:
ver. 4.</hi> The Lord ſayes <hi>I will cauſe them to be removed into all King
domes of the Earth, becauſe of Manaſſeh the ſon of Hezekiah King of
Iudah for that which he did in Ieruſaelem.</hi> So it is alſo ſpoken,
<hi>2 King. 21: ver. 11, 12, 13. Becauſe Manaſſeh King of Iudah hath
done theſe abhominations—therefore thus ſayeth the Lord God of
Iſrael, behold I am bringing ſuch evil upon Ieruſalem and Iudah
that whoſoever heareth of it, both his eares shall tingle, &amp;c.</hi> And
notwithſtanding of the reformation that was in the dayes of
<hi>Ioſiah.</hi> Yet this judgement came to be accomplished, and
the Lord ſent the bands of the <hi>Caldees</hi> and of the <hi>Syrians: ſurely,</hi>
(ſo it is ſaid, <hi>2 King. 24: v. 3, 4.</hi>) <hi>at the commandement of the
Lord came this upon Iudah to remove them out of his ſight, for the
ſinnes of Manaſſeh, according to all that he did, and alſo for the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood that he shed, which the Lord would not pardon.</hi> And
<hi>2 King. 23, 26.</hi> Though there was a great work of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:105606:130"/>
done in the dayes of that non-ſuch King (<hi>v. 25,</hi>)
<hi>Ioſiah,</hi> yet it is ſayd <hi>notwithstanding the Lord turned not from the
fierceneſſe of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against
Iudah, becauſe of all the provocations that Manaſſeh had provoked
him with all.</hi> Yea, ſo did this ſin of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> provoke the
Lord againſt the land, that how beit <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> himſelf repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and found mercy, <hi>2 Chron. 33: v. 12.</hi> and queſtionleſſe
many of the People turned with him, yet theſe ſame ſinnes of
<hi>Manaſſeh</hi> are mainly taken notice of as the procureing cauſe of
that final ſtroke.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe particulars, theſe few things are very obvious
to any.</p>
               <p>1. That People combined into a ſociety have great cauſe,
not only to look to their owne carriage, but alſo unto the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of others; Since the carriage of others will bring them
in hazard of God's judgments, and haſten downe venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
&amp; wrath from God on all, ſure they have need to look
about them.</p>
               <p>2. Eſpecially, they have reaſon to take notice of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
carriage and deportment of Princes and Paſtors: ſeing
in a ſpecial manner thoſe highten the wrath &amp; haſten the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, as hath been shewed.</p>
               <p>3. If theſe ſinnes in Princes, Paſtors and others were not
committed, thoſe plagues and judgments which are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and at length executed upon that account, would have
been prevented.</p>
               <p>4. If People, conſidering their hazard by reaſon of theſe
publick tranſgreſſions, had actively beſtirred themſelves, &amp;
interpoſed, as that theſe iniquities had not been committed,
they had not ſmarted ſo for as they did, not had they felt
the weight of the hand of Gods anger, as they were made
to do.</p>
               <p>5. It was not enough for them, to have keeped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
free of theſe actual tranſgreſſions, whereof others were
really guilty: for we finde ſome punished, for that iniquity
of others, which could not be laid to their charge, as
actors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:105606:131"/>
6. How ever ſuch as were ſo punished, were not free of
inherent tranſgreſſions, and other ſinnes, which deſerved
judgment at the hands of the Lord; yet when the Spirit of
the Lord is pleaſed to make no mention of theſe, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureing
cauſe of theſe plagues, but ſeemeth to lay the whole
or maine ſtreſſe of the buſineſſe, upon that ſin committed by
others, we muſt thinke that that hath had no ſmall influence,
but rather a mine cauſality in the procureing of theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
and it becometh us to be ſober in inquireing after other
cauſes hid from us, and reſt ſatisfied with what the Spirit
of the Lord is pleaſed particularly and evidently to poynt
forth unto us, and pitch upon, as the peccant and procureing
cauſe</p>
               <p>7. Though we could not ſatisfy wrangling wits, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the equity of this, (which yet the common and ordinary
practice of men, forfaulting a whole poſterity, for one
mans tranſgreſſion, will not ſuffer us to account inſolent)
yet we ought to reſt ſatisfyed with what is clearly and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyably
held forth in the word, and beleeve that for theſe cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
ſuch and ſuch plagues were inflicted upon diſtinct and
different perſones, becauſe the ſpirit of truth ſayeth ſo.</p>
               <p>8. As all Scripture was given by the inſpiration of God,
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
for inſtruction in righteouſneſſe, that the Man of God, may
be perfect, thorowly furnished, unto all good works,
<hi>2 Tim, 3: v. 16, 17.</hi> So theſe particular paſſages, ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
deſcribed are written for our learning, <hi>Rom. 15: ver. 4.</hi>
and are out examples, that we should not do as they did,
<hi>1 Cor. 10: v. 6.</hi> and are written for our admonition, <hi>1 Cor. 10:
ver. 11.</hi> And therefore we muſt not look ſlightly upon them,
but ponder then narrowly, as ſo many documents given us
for our uſe and inſtruction, and particularly, that we may
take warning to prevent ſuch evils.</p>
               <p>Now let us hear what the <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſayeth <hi>Pag. 51.</hi> He layes
downe two aſſertions [<hi>1. That no man is involved in divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and punishments, for the ſinnes of others, (as the deſerving
cauſe of his punishment) if he be no way acceſſory to theſe ſinnes of
others 2. That no private Subject is acceſſory to the ſins of Rulers,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105606:131"/>
nor involved in the punishments of the ſame, meerly upon the accouut
of his tolerating the ſinnes, or not violent reſisting the Magiſtrate in his
ſinful courſes.</hi>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not to enlairge on theſe now, becauſe
of what he is to ſay in explication of theſe, &amp; we are then to
ſpeak, I would only at preſent enquire. 1. What acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
had the army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which was defate by the Men of
Ai (a ſtroke, which made <hi>Ioſua</hi> rent his cloaths, and fall
upon his face to the Earth, until the even tyde, he and the
elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and put duſt upon their heads) unto the ſin
of <hi>Achan?</hi> And why doth the Spirit of the Lord ſay, <hi>Ios. 7:
v. 1.</hi> That <hi>the Children of Iſrael had committed a treſpaſſe in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſedthing.</hi>
And againe <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12. [<hi>And the Lord ſaid
unto Ioſua, Get thee up, wherefore lyest thou thus upon thy face? Iſrael
hath ſinned, and they have alſo tranſgreſſed my Covenant-for they
have taken of the accurſed thing-and they have put it even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
their owne ſtuff. Therefore the Children of Iſrael could not ſtand
becauſe they were accurſed, neither will I be with you any more, except
yee destroy the accurſed from amongſt you.</hi>] Though we can learne
of no acceſſion which they had, unto this particular fact,
yet we ſee the whole body is punished as guilty, and muſt
be legally purified, and ſanctified, and purged from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.
2. What acceſſion had all theſe who ſuffered in
these three yeers famine, which was in <hi>David's</hi> dayes, unto
that bloody act of <hi>Saul</hi> and his houſe, which was committed
many yeers before thouſands of theſe who ſuffered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
knew the right hand from the left, or were borne poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly?
3. What acceſſion had the children unborne to the
third and fourth generation, unto the ſinnes of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers?
and yet the holy Lord thinks good to viſite their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
on them. 4. What acceſſion had the People unto
<hi>David's</hi> ſin of numbering, the people doth not <hi>David</hi> himſelf
ſay, <hi>2. Sam, 24: ver. 17. But theſe sheep, what have they done?</hi>
But let us heare how he explaineth this, [<hi>A certane thing
it is</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that God doth not properly punish any man but in
reference to his owne perſonal ſins (as the deſerving cauſe of the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment)
albeit he may and often taketh occaſion, in his wiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to punish men for their owne ſinnes, from the ſinnes of others,
(and in that only ſenſe, they may be ſaid to be punished for the ſins of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:105606:132"/>
others.) But every ſoul ſuffers for his owne ſin. Divine juſtice finding
cauſes of punishment, in every one that is punished, either their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
acceſſion to the ſinnes of others (which is their owne ſin) or elſe ſome
other ſinnes, for which he may in juſtice inflict the punishment upon them, albeit the impulſive cauſe, or occaſion rather, for punishing in ſuch a manner and time &amp;c, be from the ſinnes of others.] Anſ.</hi>
1. Though vve deſire to be vviſe unto ſobriety in this matter,
and not to meddle vvith matters beyond our reach, yet vve
think it ſaifer to ſpeak in the language of the Holy Ghoſt, then
in the vvords of this <hi>Surveyer,</hi> vvho giveth us no Scripture
for vvhat he ſayes. The expreſſions of Scripture hold forth
ſome thing more then a meer occaſion: It ſemeth ſtrange to ſay
that <hi>Ahan's</hi> ſin should have been only an occaſion of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture:
when the Spirit of the Lord ſayes, that <hi>Iſrael had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and therefore could not ſtand before their Enemies, becauſe they
were accurſed, and that till this accurſed were taken from amongst
them he would not be with them any more.</hi> 2. He vvould do vvell to
explaine to us, vvhat he meaneth by a <hi>proper punishment,</hi> and
vvhat is the oppoſite tearme thereunto? 3. We grant divine
juſtice findeth deſerving cauſes of punishment in all, in whom
is original ſin, but vve ſuppoſe that vvhen that is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as the procureing cauſe of ſuch a ſtroke, but the ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by another, vve ought to look on that mainly, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a procureing cauſality in that affliction. 4. How ever,
we ſee he granteth one may be punished for the ſin of another
(or upon occaſion of the ſin of another, as he loveth to ſpeak.)
to which he hath no perſonal acceſſion. 5. If theſe ſinnes of
others, were only the occaſion of punishing in ſuch a manner
or time, how cometh it that the very punishment it ſelf is
removed, upon the taking away of that ſin, according to
God's appoyntment, and God is pacified toward the whole, as he was
vvith <hi>Iſrael</hi> vvhen <hi>Ahan</hi> vvas killed, and Seven of <hi>Saul's</hi>
ſones hanged up? 6. But whether vve take theſe ſinnes
of others, as impulſive cauſes, or occaſions of ſuch punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This is cleare. That, if theſe ſinnes had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
theſe punishments had been prevented alſo: ſo that
if <hi>Saul</hi> had not gotten liberty to have ſtaine the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> in
his bloody rage, contrare to oath and Covenant, theſe three
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:105606:132"/>
yeers famine had not come: And if <hi>David</hi> had been hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
from numbering of the people, and had not gotten his
vvill, theſe Seventy thouſand had not died then as they did:
And ſeing no other cauſe or occaſion is rendered of this, it
vvould clearly warne all in a Community and Society, to
labour, by all meanes, according to their power and places,
to hinder the Committing (or removing when committed)
of theſe ſinnes, which bring heavy plagues on the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
The <hi>Dutch. Aunot.</hi> on 2 <hi>Sam. 21: 1. ſay that ſo for this offence,
all the land was punished becauſe at leaſt</hi> (as it oft hapneth) <hi>the people
had not hindered it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Pag.</hi> 52. he cometh to explaine his other aſſertion
(<q>It is no leſſe certane (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) to us that if the Magiſtrate
do not connive at the ſinnes of Subjects, nor neglect to
curb and punish them, the ſins of the people shall no way
be imputed to him (<hi>he not being thereunto acceſſory in any way</hi>)
nor shall be punished for their ſinnes, which in his place
and calling he is wreſtling againſt]</q> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet we know,
that for the tranſgreſſion of a land, many are the princes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Prov. 8. v. 2.</hi> And that for a punishment to people, God
may even cut the dayes of a good prince, and though we
should grant, that it were no proper punishment unto the
good Prince, yet materially and in it ſelf it is a ſtroke. But
he addeth. [<q>Also it is alike certane. That private perſons
shall not have the ſinnes of Magiſtrates, or of the body of
the people imputed unto them, nor be punished for the
ſame, if ſo be they honeſtly endeavour to do all things
againſt theſe ſins, which in their privat calling they are
bound to do.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> Be this granted, The main queſtion
will be if people can be ſaid to have honeſtly endeavoured to
do all things againſt theſe ſinnes, which in their privat callings
they are bound to do, if having power to withſtand the
committing of theſe evills, or to remove them after they
are committed, yet they forbeare, and ſuffer theſe things
to be done, and labour not to remove them. He addeth
[<q>If they keep themſelves without any degree of acting theſe
ſins, or any way of acceſſion to them. if they mourne and
ſigh for evils that are done; if they be earneſt in prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:105606:133"/>
that God may convert others from their evil way, if they
(<hi>as they can have opportunity</hi>) faithfully admonish and ſtudy to
reclaime thoſe who are out of the way, and do ſuch like
Chriſtian dutyes. God will never enter in judgment vvith
them for not doing violence to the authorityes that are above
them.</q>] <hi>Anſw,</hi> If the <hi>Surveyer</hi> would do no more then this,
he ought neither to be accounted a good Chriſtian, nor a
loyal ſubject: For, if he ſaw the King about to cut his
owne throat with a knife, or about to do as <hi>Saul</hi> did, fall upon
his owne ſword, or runing doun a precipice to break his neck,
would any think he had had done his duty, and exonered
his conſcience; if he should not lead his hand unto that
miſchief, nor thruſt him doune the principice, but should
roare and cry <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> and admonish and ſtudy, with
faire words, to reclaime the King from that cruel deed? would
any think but he might have done more, even if he had
had ſtrength enough have holden his hands, and keeped him
back from breaking his neck, and yet never have been in any
hazard or ſinfully touching the Lord's anoynted, or doing
violence to the authority that God had ſet over him. 2. And
if Kings may be-reſiſted, and with violence hindered from
putting hands in themſelves, or from drinking a cup of
poyſon, or doing ſome ſuch deed, which will or may prove
deſtructive to their life and poſterity, without doing violence
to the authority appoynted of God; vvhy may they not alſo
be hindered from doing that which will ruine their ſouls, and
prove deſtructive to their Kingdomes, and bring on the curſe
and vengeance of God upon young and old, without doing any
ſinful violence unto the authority? And as in the former
caſe, a man could not but be guilty of the King's death,
who knew that it was a cup of poyſon which he was to drink,
and did not, having power to do it, hinder him from drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: So in this caſe, they that have power to hinder the
Magiſtrate from drinking poyſon, or doing what may be
deadly to thouſands of his innocent ſubjects, and bring
downe the curſe of God upon him and his poſterity, and do
it not, cannot but be guilty of that ſin before God, and ſo
cannot expect to be free of the punishment which God will
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:105606:133"/>
inflict becauſe of that ſin, as not having done, even in their
private callings, what they were bound to do, viz. not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uſed their power for the glory of God, the good of the
Soveraigne and his poſterity, nor for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
which they were bound to do.</p>
               <p>He tells us moreover concerning that inſtance of <hi>Manaſſeh,
Ier. 15: v. 4. [That the people were punished, becauſe they were
shares of the guiltineſſe (not by not violent reſisting, which they
were never exhorted to) but by direct or indirect acceſſion otherwayes,
Hoſ. 5: ver. 11. Ier. 5: v. 31.] Anſ.</hi> 1. How could young
children be acceſſory, either by conſent or any otherwayes
to theſe courſes of <hi>Manaſseh?</hi> 2. It were hard to ſay that even
all who were come to the uſe of reaſon, were guilty of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
unto theſe wickedneſſes, who yet were carryed away
captive, ſuch as <hi>Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael,</hi> and <hi>Azaria,</hi>
and others. 3. That there were many, yea the far greateſt
part of the People who were guilty, of hainous ſinnes,
when the final ſtroke came, cannot be denyed; but, that
they were at that ſame hight of wickedneſſe, which they
were at, in <hi>Manaſseh's</hi> dayes is doubted, 4. We shalll grant
with <hi>Calvin</hi> on the place. That <hi>Manaſseh</hi> alone was not in
that tranſgreſſion, but had many of the People conſenting;
Yet, as <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> himſelf was dead, long ere the ſtroke came,
ſo were they; and yet for that ſin of theirs, the poſterity
ſuffered: Yea even notwitſtanding that there interveened a
National repentance and mourning for that National ſin, and
National Reformation of theſe idolatrous courſes, in the dayes
of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> 5. Though it be true that the People after <hi>Ioſiah's</hi>
dayes, returned to their vomite, and had wickedneſſe enough
of their owne, for which God might have punished them;
yet it is very remarkable, how that ſin of <hi>Manaſseh</hi> is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
mentioned, as if there had not been another, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that ſtroke: and certanely all who read the places cited
before, will eaſily obſerve that there is ſomething more in
them, then an occaſion taken to remember that dreadful time
of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> when the wickedneſſe began, as the <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the following words. 6. It was their ſin, I grant,
that they did conſent; and that ſayeth that they should not
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:105606:134"/>
have conſented, but have refuſed obedience unto the King
idolatrous mandats, and have hindered in their places, an
according to their power, the ſetting up of theſe abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and should have adhered to the truth and worship of
God, as it was practiſed in the dayes of good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his
Father. 7. He needs not ſay, they were not exhorted to
this violent reſiſting; for it was but folly to ſpeak of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to theſe, who ſo willingly walked after the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
and would not do ſo much as diſobey. 8. That
place of <hi>Hoſeah</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Ephraim's</hi> willingly walking after
the commandment, proves not what the people of <hi>Iudah's</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was in the dayes of <hi>Manaſſeh;</hi> albeit we grant the thing
was too true of the greateſt part, even of them, then: Neither
doth the place, <hi>Ier, 5: v. 31.</hi> ſpeak of the dayes of <hi>Manaſſeh:</hi>
for <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was not then a Prophet; for he began to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the 13 year of <hi>Ioſiah, Ier. 1: 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the cometh, <hi>Pag. 53.</hi> and giveth ſome reaſons: But
firſt we muſt take notice how he wordeth the principle which
he accounteth ſo dangerous <hi>If it be once admitted</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>that the ſins of Rulers &amp; Governours involve the People in ſin, &amp; make
them obnoxious to judgment, (albeit they be not acceſſory thereto directly
only they toler at what they cannot amend abiding within the bounds of
their calling) neither can the conſciences of people, nor the ſtate of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
have any true peace or quyetneſſe.] Anſ.</hi> We might grant
him what he deſireth, &amp; acknowledge, that this principle is
not ſound: we do not ſay ſo, for we shall grant that (excepting
the Lord's Soveraignity of doing as he did in the caſe of <hi>Ahan</hi>
&amp; such like,) that the People who are come to age muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
or indirectly guilty of the ſin of Rulers, in which they
are involved. But ſo they are guilty, when they tolerate
what they might amend, abideing within the bounds of
their calling. But here the difference betwixt him &amp; us lyeth.
That he thinketh it is beyond the bounds of the calling of
private perſones, to hinder Princes from committing ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
which would ruine them &amp; their ſubjects both,
which we deny, and we have not yet ſeen him prove it: yea
we have shewed the contrary above. But now we proceed
to his two reaſones. [<hi>For</hi> 1. (ſayes he) <hi>Once grant this then what
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:105606:134"/>
a continual puzle should tender hearted Chriſtians be in, anent the
actions of their Rulers and Magiſtrates, and they behoved to meddle
with and examine all their proceedings—matters of government
not probably or morally poſſible for them to know.] Anſw.</hi> We do not,
neither need we extend that principle to all the private or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
ſinnes of Magiſtrates, or to ſuch acts which are beyond
the reach of the capacity of the vulgar, wherein their invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
ignorance, whether as to the <hi>jus</hi> or <hi>factum,</hi> may excuſe
them from any acceſſion direct or indirect. If he will grant
it to us, in ſinnes publick, hainous, and which People can
well diſcerne both as to <hi>jus</hi> and <hi>factum,</hi> we deſire no more: and
if it be limited to theſe, we will gaine our poynt (for our
caſe is as clear as the Sun) and tender conſciences will be free
of all puzle or perplexity. What is his 2. [<hi>Would not this</hi>
(ſayes he) <hi>be a perpetual Seminary of unavoydable ſedition of the
Commonwealth, and of expoſeing the Magiſtrate to violence, no leſſe
when he is acting juſtly, then when unjuſtly.] Anſw.</hi> Then this
loyal Subject, if he ſaw an houſe or a great milſtone falling
upon the King's head, he would not pull him from under it,
leſt others under pretence of that, should uſe violence to the
Magiſtrate, when he is in no hazard. Or if he ſaw the King
putting a cup of poiſon to his head, or a Knife to his throate,
he would not hinder him, leſt others under that pretence
should hinder him from taking wholſome food, &amp; ſo ſtarve
him; or should under pretence of ſaving the King, put
hands in his Majeſty, and ſtob him under the fiftrib. But
2. doth he not know, that the beſt things may be abuſed,
and will any, that is wiſe, ſay, that he pleadeth for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
of a thing, who pleadeth only for its uſe? 4. By this
ſame reaſon, he might plead againſt refuſeing to give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto the King in all his moſt ſinful commands; for
may not ſeditious and unquyet ſpirits eaſily pretend that his
commands are unjuſt, and that if they obey theſe they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in ſin and judgment, and ſo diſobey him, even when
he commandeth moſt juſt and neceſſary things. If he be not
for univerſal obedience, let him anſwere this inconvenience
in that caſe, and we shall make uſe of his anſwere in this
caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:105606:135"/>
In the next place he cometh to ſpeak of theſe ſcriptures,
which he allaigeth <hi>Naphtaly</hi> doth abuſe. The firſt is <hi>Ier.</hi> 26:
<hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>If yee put me to death shall ſurely bring innocent blood
upon yourſelves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi>
concerning which two things (<hi>he ſayes</hi>) are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked.
[<hi>1. That</hi> Jeremiah <hi>is ſpeaking to the Princes and all the
People, warning them not to meddle with his blood; The Princes that
they should not unjustly condemne him, The People that they should
not conſent to, nor co-operate with an unjust ſentence, as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
thereof (as the manner of execution was amongſt that People,
ſtoning &amp;c.) And 2. He certifieth both that if they conſented and
co-operated to his death, they should bring innocent blood upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and upon the City, and inhabitants thereof. He doth not
at all incite the People to riſe up and reſcue him by violence out of the
hands of Rulers, if they should give ſentence of death against him,
(neither did ever any of the holy Prophets inſtigate People to uſe violent
reſiſtance agàinſt their perverſe Magiſtrates, nor did they ever reprove
directly or indirectly that ſin of non-violent reſiſtence to Magiſtrats,
as ſome exceſſively bold do averr) but only warns Princes and
People both, that they be not by conſent and concurrence acceſſory to
his death] Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is enough for us: For 1. He
granteth the People were not to conſent to, nor co-operate
with an unjuſt ſentence; but if they should have refuſed to
have co-operated, the ſentence had not been executed; and
ſo <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had been really reſcued from the ſentence, and
decree of the Magiſtrates; ſo that there needed no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
to have been uſed, innocent blood would not have
been shed, and this was ſufficient. 2. He needed not to
have incited them furder unto a violent reſcueing of him,
for though they should have given ſentence of death againſt
him, yet if none would have executed it, he had been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
reſcued. But what needed more incitation, then to
tell that by shedding of his blood they should bring innocent
blood upon the whole city, and upon the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
3. It was little wonder that the Prophets did not inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
People to uſe violent reſiſtence unto perverſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
ſeing it was uſually ſuch Prince ſuch People, and
the People as forward unto wickedneſſe as the Princes, and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:105606:135"/>
yet we finde the duty of delivering the oppreſſed urged upon
People conjunct with their Rulers: Becauſe both, in their
places, should have concurred hereunto; which ſayes, that
people, though they were not formally to execute Magiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
power, yet they were to concurre to have Juſtice, executed,
and to have the oppreſſed delivered, out of the hands of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours.
And theſe were judges as well as others, but
more of this afterward. 4. This place doth abundantly
cleare, That the shedding of innocent blood by Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
bringeth judgement on the Subjects: for <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
ſayes, that if they should have killed him, they should have
brought innocent blood not only to themſelves, who gave
out the ſentence, and did execute it; but on the whole city,
and on the inhabitants thereof. To this he hath many words
<hi>Pag. 55.</hi> but little anſwere. The ſumme is this (for it were
weariſome to tranſcribe all his needleſſe tautologies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions,
which if taken away, his pamphlet of a 120 pages,
might be reduced to 20) [<hi>All who were defiled behoved to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory
either by doing, or not hindering what they were called and
capacitated to hinder, which was not by violent reſiſtence: nor doth
the Prophet meane, that all the abſents should be guilty and properly
deſerve Gods wrath upon that account, but only that the actors, and
ſuch as were acceſſory, should be guilty, and others should, upon this
occaſion, fall under wrath, though for other ſinnes: and yet the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the People might be a punishment to the Rulers, for that ſame
particular ſin; for God may punish Princes or Fathers, in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of Subjects and Children; and yet theſe ſame Subjects and
Children have no reaſon to quarrel with God, or to ſay as it is, Exech. 18.
v. 2.] Anſw.</hi> We grant God may and doth punish Princes
and Parents, in their Subjects and Children; and That theſe
ſame Subjects and Children ſo punished, have no juſt cauſe to
ſay that <hi>their Fathers have eaten ſowre grapes and that their teeth are
ſet on edge,</hi> as if there were no ſin in themſelves. But that
God may not viſite the iniquities of the Fathers upon the
Children, who have not formally acted theſe evills, nor
conſented thereto, we dar not peremptorily aſſert, againſt ſo
many clear ſcriptures. 2. Sure this place ſeemeth to hint
ſomething elſe, then that this ſin of shedding <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> blood
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:105606:136"/>
should be an occaſion of God's viſiting the City, for their
other ſinnes: For he ſayes <hi>you shall bring innocent blood upon
this city:</hi> ſo that by this Murther, they should have brought
innocent blood as well on the other inhabitants, as on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who were to be actors: the text maketh no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
3. If the People here had done all which in their
calling and ſtation, they were capacitated to have done, for
hindering of this sheding of blood, they would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it effectually; and further violent reſiſtence was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.
If a wicked Magiſtrat should condemne an innocent
perſon, and make this his ſentence, that he should not have
the benefite of a lodging within the land, The People need
do no more to reſiſt the Magiſtrat's unjuſt ſentence, but,
notvvithſtanding thereof, receive the innocent into their
houſe, and intertaine him friendly. And ſtill vve ſay, the
People vvere to do all that lay in their povver, to hinder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood to be shed, that ſo innocent blood might not
be laid to their charge: And in ſo far as they came short in
this, they made themſelves guilty be acceſſion, notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of any thing he hath ſaid.</p>
               <p>The next place he ſpeaketh to, is <hi>Deut. 13.</hi> vvhich vve
have already vindicated, and muſt obſerve this further, That
in all his long anſvvere he ſpeaketh nothing to that vvhich
novv vve are upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the hazard that People in ſuch a caſe
are into, both of ſin, and of judgment, if effectuall courſe be not taken to ſuppreſſe idolatry, and apoſtaſy from God,
and to put that crying evil avvay from amongſt them: For
<hi>v.</hi> 17. it is clearly held forth, that <hi>till this city and all which was
within it, was rooted out: the Lord would not turne from the fierceneſſe
of his anger, nor shew them mercy, nor have compaſſion upon them,
nor multiply them, as he ſwore unto their Fathers.</hi> So that their not
doing their utmoſt to execute this ſentence of God, made
them lyable to the conſtant abideing of the fierce anger of
God upon them, and cloſed the door of Mercy and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſo that they could not expect the bleſſings promiſed and
Covenanted.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Pag. 59.</hi> he cometh to ſpeak to <hi>Ioſ. 22: ver. 17, 18, 19.</hi>
and tells us <hi>That they were not private perſones that tranſacted that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:105606:136"/>
buſineſse with the Children of Reuben: for the body of the People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
with the Magistrates Supreame and Subordinate. What makes
all this for the encroachment of meer private perſons upon the uſe of the
Magiſtrates avenging ſword?] Anſw.</hi> It is true the Magiſtrates
and major part of the People were here concurring; but why
doth he not take notice of the words cited by <hi>Naphtaly</hi> (which
clearly hold forth the end of his adduceing that paſſage)
<hi>If yee rebel to day against the Lord, to morrow he will be worth with the
whole congregation of Iſrael,</hi> which do clearly hold forth, that
the defection of a part (though a minor part) will bring
wrath upon the whole Nation aud Society. And may not
any ſee hence; That each are to concurre in their places and
ſtations, according to their povver, to prevent this defection,
or to remove it, even when the major part is infected
with it; yea even though Magiſtrates should be remiſſe, and
should rather encourage then diſcountenance ſuch rebellion
againſt God? Seeing the reaſon holdeth <hi>à fortiori,</hi> for it upon
the defection of a minor part, wrath will come upon the
whole, much more will wrath come upon the defection of a
major part, and of the Magiſtrates too: And therefore if in
the former caſe, private perſons be bound to concurre with
Magiſtrates, for rooting out of that provoking ſin of a few,
then it cannot be unlawful for private perſones, in this later
caſe, to do what they can, to ſtirr up Magiſtrates to their
duty, if it be poſſible; and to prevent their owne deſtruction
from that wrath of God, kindled againſt all; and to remove
the provokeing cauſe of that anger: And, as we have
ſaid, they may take an effectual courſe for this, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching
upon the uſe of the Magiſtrate's avenging ſword,
or exercing any formall Magiſtratical power.</p>
               <p>The next place he ſpeaketh to, is <hi>Iudg. 20.</hi> where <hi>Iſrael</hi>
warreth againſt <hi>Benjamin</hi> becauſe of a notorious crime acted
there, and countenanced and defended by that whole Tribe,
to the end that ſuch a crying abhomination might be purged
out of the land, To which he anſwereth in short (to let paſſe
his unchriſtian jibes) thus [<hi>Though this was when there was no
King in Iſrael, yet it is likely they retained ſomewhat of their Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin
appoynted</hi> Deut. 17. <hi>which in ſuch a horrid caſe might draw
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:105606:137"/>
together in an extraordinary meeting: It was the body or the major part
of the People, that uſeth the ſword againſt the leſſer; which maketh noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the minor parts uſing the ſword to punish Magiſtrates &amp; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
part of the People alſo.] Anſw.</hi> Though I should grant that
they retained yet ſomething of the Sanhedrin, yet in all
this paſſage, there is no mention made thereof; but it is ſaid
<hi>v. 1.</hi> That <hi>all the Children of Iſrael</hi> went out, &amp; the <hi>Congregation</hi>
was gathered together as one Man, to <hi>Mizpeh;</hi> and reſolved
not to returne to their owne houſes, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. until theſe
Children of <hi>Belial</hi> in <hi>Gibeah</hi> had been executed, and evil was
put away from <hi>Iſrael, Cap.</hi> 13: <hi>v.</hi> 2. To ſay that this ſpeaks
not to our caſe, is but to wrangle; for ſure if we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that <hi>Benjamin</hi> had been maintaining their integrity, and
the true worshipe of God, againſt the generality of the
People, who had turned idolaters, and had raiſed war againſt
them, becauſe they would not depart from their profeſſion;
would he have condemned the minor part for ſtanding to their
defence in this caſe? Or if they should have joyned together
to have hindered the defection of the major part, or remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the corruptious that were prevailing; would he have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them? Sure this is not improve Scripture a right,
but rather to elude it; for there is not the leaſt shaddow, that
the ſtreſſe of the matter is laid on this, that they vvere the
major part.</p>
               <p>Finally he cometh to <hi>Achan's</hi> caſe, <hi>Joſ. 7.</hi> and tells us,
[<hi>That there is nothing in it, to juſtify private perſones riſing againſt
the Magistrates, and plurality of the people, to avert the judgments
of God; for what was done to</hi> Achan <hi>was done by the Supreame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat</hi>
Joſua.] <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But <hi>Naphtaly</hi> only maketh uſe of this
place, to shew that our reformers had great reaſon to feare
and tremble, leſt the manifeſt toleration of proud, cruel,
flattering Prelats, and idolatrous Prieſts, whoſe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and idolatry, had corrupted the whole land; might
involve the whole Nation in deſtroying indignation; ſince
the wrath of God for the hidden and ſecret ſin of one poor
<hi>Achan</hi> ſuddenly and fearfully overtook the whole People,
<hi>and all the congregation of Iſrael,</hi> ſo that <hi>that man perished not
alone in his iniquity.</hi> Now can any body deny this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?

But our <hi>Surveyer</hi> layeth downe againe his peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
aſſertions without further proof, and we have ſpoken to
them already, and need not repeat things ſo oft as he gives us
occaſion ſo to do, otherwiſe we should follow this fool in his
folly, and weary the reader as he doth, in repeating almoſt
whole pages <hi>verbatim,</hi> let any look and he shall finde the
whole 61 page, (except ſome groundleſſe jibes which do

shall then goe on, and draw forth our arguments from what
is ſaid, to shew that the late act ought rather to be praiſed
then condemned.</p>
               <p>For 1. Thereby they were endeavouring, according to
their power and places, (as that exigent required) when
all doores were cloſed from eſſaying any other meane, not
only to defend themſelves againſt manifeſt and intolerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
and oppreſſion, but to ſave themſelves, their poſterity,
and the whole land (ſo far as lay in their power) from the
wrath and vengeance of God, and the dreadful plagues and
judgments that were and are to be expected, for the dreadful
and unparallelable apoſtaſy and defection of a corrupt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.
Did God threaten that <hi>Zion</hi> should be plowed as a
field, and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> become as a heape, That <hi>Iacob</hi> should
be given to the curſe, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> to reproaches, for the ſinnes
of a corrupt miniſtry; and when our eyes did never ſee a
more corrupt company, who have partly apoſtatized from
their ſworne profeſſion, and partly are thruſt in over flocks,
to the ruineing of their ſouls, the corrupting of the truthes
of God, and to be a ſtanding occaſion of dreadful perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto them; and when, for this cauſe, nothing could
or can be looked for, from the hands of a juſt and jealous
God, but wrath without remedy, and judgment after judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
till we become as plowed fields, and as heaps: Can or
ought theſe to be blamed, who ſtanding to their ſworne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
were labouring in the integrity of their hearts, to
purge the land of theſe plagues and locuſts, that we might
become a holy and pure Church unto the Lord, and that the
Lord might delight to dwell among us; and for this end,
tooke their lives in their hands, and eſſayed that now ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:105606:138"/>
ſeing there was no other meane left unto them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to attaine this noble End.</p>
               <p>2. When one Apoſtat city not taken courſe with, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the command of God, would provoke God to anger
againſt the whole aſſembly of God's People, ſo that till it
was deſtroyed, he would not have mercy or compaſſion u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them; was there not much more reaſon to feare, that
God's anger should burne againſt <hi>Scotland</hi> his covenanted
People, and that he should have no more mercy on us, ſince
there was ſuch a dreadful defection in it, whereof not only
one city, but many cities were in an eminent manner guilty,
having ſo foulely departed from their ſworne truth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and openly and avowedly revolted from God and
his wayes, and ſince there was no other way imaginable to
prevent this heavy indignation of God? Shall any condemne
theſe, who our of Zeal to God's Glory, and for the good
of the poor land, whereof they were members, took their
lives in their hands, and did what lay in their power, to have
that corruption and apoſtaſy removed, and God reſtored to
his honour, and the land to its Covenanted integrity?</p>
               <p>3. Since the backſlideing and defection of a few members
of a Society, joyned together in a Covenant to God as his
People, brings vvrath upon the vvhole; if timeous remedy
be not uſed, as the forecited places shevv: Shall any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
theſe vvho endeavoured according to their povver, to
prevent the deſtruction that vvas and is to be feared, for the
defection not of a fevv, not of one poor <hi>Achan,</hi> but of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
and that of all ranks and conditions?</p>
               <p>4. Did the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> goe out as one man, to prevent
apoſtaſy, when they heard ſome rumore thereof in a part of
their number; and to take courſe with, and purge the land
of a crying evil that was committed in one of their cities: &amp;
who shall condemne theſe who lately went out with one
heart and ſpirit, to do what in them lay, to remove the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carryed-on
defection, and the dreadful evil of perjury and
many other hainous crimes, that did &amp; yet do abound, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Many of all rankes were guilty, even ſuch as should have
been, by their publick places and ſtations, eminently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:105606:138"/>
on the head of theſe worthyes, for the glory of God,
and the good of the whole Church and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>5. Seing the publick tranſgreſſions of Kings and Princes,
do hazard the whole Realme and Commonwealth, as the
inſtances formerly adduced do cleare; How much reaſon
have People of all rankes, qualityes and conditions, to be
doing what lyeth in their power, either to prevent and hinder
that theſe iniquities be not committed, which prove de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtructive
unto the Land, or labour by all meanes to have them
done away when committed, before the fierce anger of the
Lord break forth? And ſince it is not our and undenyable
how our Kings and Nobles, and other judges have revolted
from a ſworne Covenant, Truth and Profeſſion, and openly
and avowedly, renunced the intereſt of Chriſt, and conſpired
againſt his truth and cauſe; can any blame theſe worthies
who endeavoured according to their power, to have theſe
crying abhominations remedyed, that the wrath of God
should not conſume us root and branch, and burne ſo as it
should not be quenched?</p>
               <p>What can be replyed to theſe reaſons, is ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
already; and I would further propoſe this to be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
conſidered by all: let us put the caſe, That King and
Princes should conſpire together, to poyſon all the fountains
of water in the Land, and lay downe a courſe, how they
should be keeped ſo, and people should be forced to drink of
theſe poyſoned waters; would not any rational man think,
that when no meanes elſe could prevaile, People might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with force, ſee to their owne lives, and to the lives of
their little ones? And shall we be allowed to uſe violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
for the lives of our bodyes, and not alſo for the
lives of our ſouls? shall people be allowed to run together,
&amp; with force, when they can no otherwayes, keep the ſprings
of water cleare, for their owne lives or healths, and of their
poſterity alſo; and shall they be condemned for runing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to keep their Religion as it was reformed, pure and
uncorrupted? Who but Atheiſts will ſay this? Againe
put the caſe. That the Magiſtrates of ſome Brugh or City
were about to do, or had already done, ſome publick prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:105606:139"/>
bited action, which would ſo irritate the Soveraigne or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
that he would come with an hudge army and cut off the
city, man, wife and childe: would any in this caſe, condemne
the private inhabitants of that Brough or City, if, when no
other mean could be eſſayed effectually to hinder the ſame,
they should with force, either hinder them from doing that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritating
action, or if done, should endeavour to remedy
the matter the beſt way they could, for the good of the City,
to prevent its ruine and overthrow, and for their owne ſaifty,
and for the ſaifty of their poſterity? And why then shall
any condemne the late defenders, who, when the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
by their many ſinful and publick actions, had provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King of Kings to anger and jealouſy againſt the whole
land, ſo that in juſtice they could expect nothing but the
vvrath and vengence of God to root them out and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
laboured what they could, to have the wrath of the
King of Kings pacified, and the wicked deeds provoking him
remedied? Would the Soveraigne in the former caſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
theſe privat perſons traitours to their Magiſtrates, and
not rather more loyal Subjects to him, then the Magiſtrates
themſelves? And shall we think that the King of Kings shall
account the late act, diſloyalty to the King and Magiſtrates,
and not rather commendable loyalty to him, and faithful
ſervice?</p>
               <p>There is another argument much of the Nature with the
preceeding, taken from the grounds of Chriſtian love and
affection, whereby each is bound to preſerve the life and
welfare of another, as he would do his owne: and as each
would have another helping him, in the day when he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
wronged and oppreſſed, ſo he should be willing to helpe
others when it is in the power of his hand to doe it according
to that royal law of Chriſt's, <hi>Mat. 7: ver. 12. Luk. 6: ver. 31.
Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that men should do to you,
do ye even ſo them, for this is the law and the prophets.</hi> It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
and unchriſtian both, to ſay <hi>am</hi> I <hi>my brother's keeper.</hi>
Sure he who helps not his brother againſt a murderer, when
he may do it, is before God, guilty of the man's blood.
<hi>Meroz</hi> and the inhabitants thereof were to be curſed
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:105606:139"/>
bitterly, becauſe they came not out to the help of the Lord
and his People, againſt the mighty, <hi>Iudg. 5.</hi> Was not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
helped thus againſt the Tyranny and wickedneſſe of
King <hi>Saul?</hi> And honeſt <hi>Ionathan</hi> reſcued from the hands
of his bloody Father? <hi>Prov. 24: ver. 11, and 12. If thou
forbear to deliver them that are drawne unto death, and theſe
that are ready to be ſlame: If thou ſayest behold we know it
not, doth not he that pondereth the heart conſiderit? And he that
keepeth thy ſoull, doih not he know it? And shall not herender
to every man according to his work?</hi> Now the text maketh
no difference whether they be drawne to death unjuſtly by
private perſons or by Magiſtrates: They are (if they can
do it) with force to reſcue ſuch; for ſo the word imports as
<hi>I Sam. 30: 18. 2 King. 18: 34. 1 Sam. 17: 35. Hoſ. 5: 14.</hi>
And this did famous <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> avow unto <hi>Lithingtoun,</hi> in
his diſcourſe with him, regiſtrated in the <hi>hiſtory of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Hence it is that <hi>Ieremiah Cap. 22: 23.</hi> cryeth to the
People as well as to the King, <hi>execute judgment and righteouſneſſe
and deliver the ſpoiled out of the hand of the oppreſſour:</hi> and though
it be true, as <hi>Calvin</hi> on the place ſayeth, that this did chiefly
belong to the judges and Magiſtrates; Yet, when their
proceeding in this courſe of oppreſſing of the ſtranger,
the fatherleſſe and the widow, and of shedding innocent
blood, would provoke God to execute what he threateneth
with an oath, <hi>ver 5.</hi> And make that houſe a deſolation,
and prepare deſtroyers againſt it and the whole city <hi>ver. 7: 8.</hi>
and when all this is ſpoken in the eares of the people, it would
ſeem to import, that even they should have ſtood in the way
of ſuch oppreſſion, and delivered the ſpoiled out of the
hands of the oppreſſour; &amp; not have ſuffered innocent blood
to have been shed, eſpecially when inferiour as well as Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Magiſtrates were oppreſſing and tyrannizing, and were
the only oppreſſours and wolves as we ſee <hi>Eſa. 1: 21. and. 3,
12, 14, 15. Micha. 3: 9, 10. Ezech. 22: 27.</hi> And many of the
people conjoyned with them in the like, as encouraged
by their practice <hi>ver. 29. ſee furder for this Iſa. 1:
ver. 10, 17. Ier. 5: ver. 2, 5, 6.</hi> But ſayes our <hi>Surveyer
Pag. 53. [That ſuch prophetical preachings uttered to the body of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:105606:140"/>
Rulers and People, are to be underſtood as reproveing what was amiſſe
in every one, in their reſpective calling, and as injoying ſuch duties
as might be done by every one,</hi> ſalvâ juſtitiâ, ſalvo ordine, &amp;
modulo vocationis—<hi>but to ſay that they minded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
in People, the grand ſin of non-reſiſtence to the oppreſsing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
or to incite private perſones to pull the ſword out of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat's
hand, &amp; relieve the oppreſſed, &amp; execute judgment on the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours,
even Magiſtrats</hi> (as Lex Rex <hi>doth ſay</hi> Pag. 367,) <hi>is not only
a moſt fearful perverting of the moſt holy ſcripture—but a doctrine that
tends directly to horrid confuſion &amp; utter ſubverſion of humane ſocieties]
Anſ.</hi> We shall eaſily grant, that in thoſe ſermons, every one was
reproved for what was amiſſe in his reſpective calling, and all
were enjoyned to do, what might be done by them according
to their places and callings, and without wronging of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce:
But we averre, that it vvas the duty of privat perſones,
to hinder, ſo far as lay in their power, the shedding of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood, the oppreſſing of the innocent, and wronging
the vvidow and fatherleſſe. If a Magiſtrate in a rage run
upon an innocent perſon going by, to kill him, It is the
part of any private perſon that is next, to hinder the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
from committing manifeſt murther, without breach
of juſtice, order, or the extent of his calling: Bacauſe in
that caſe he is not acting the part of a judge. So a judge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
judgment, and manifeſtly oppreſſing the innocent, is
no judge authorized of God for that; but a privat perſon,
and may as juſtly be withheld from murthering or oppreſſing,
as any other Man. 2. They might preſſe them to relieve
the oppreſſed though they did not incite them to pul the
ſvvord out of the Magiſtrat's hand: <hi>viz</hi> by hindering, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their povver, oppreſſion to be committed; and
this might be vvithout the leaſt violence done to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate's
power and authority, as is shevved: So might they
move them to execute judgment not <hi>formally</hi> but <hi>materially,</hi> by
hindering juſtice according to their povver, or labouring to
have the lavv executed according to God's vvord. 3. <hi>Lex
Rex</hi> ſpeaketh no ſuch thing in that place, as any vvill ſee vvho
read it. 4. It is but his ignorance to ſay, that in this vve
fearfully pervert the <hi>holy</hi> ſcripture. 5. Hovv vvill he shovv
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:105606:140"/>
that this doctrine tends to horrid confuſion? He tels us <hi>Pag.</hi>
50. [<hi>That ſuch pretences will not be wanting to the worſt of men, and
the beſt Magiſtrate, proceeding moſt legally, shall never have ſecurity
from ſeditious partyes] Anſw.</hi> But ſure his doctrine tendeth
more to confuſion; for, by it every Magiſtrat of the land
hath povver to kill and deſtroy vvhom he vvill: and thus
Magiſtrates should be formally conſtituted wolves. 2. But
how oft will he put us to tell him, that the beſt truth may be
abuſed? 3. But let him ſpeak in earneſt, what would he
do if he ſaw his wife carryed away by ſome drunken officers,
before a judge drunk as a beaſt, ſo as he could neither hear
nor ſpeak ſenſe, who yet without further proceſſe, would
condemne her to be brunt as a witch, or executed as a harlot,
would he not labour, if he had power, to relieve his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
wife out of the hands of theſe bloody oppreſſours?
What would he then do with his pretences? Would theſe
ſcar his tender conſcience? I ſuppoſe not. And what if he
ſaw the King, without ground, or colour of reaſon, poſſibly
upon a miſtake, runing in a rage to kill his wife, or only ſon,
would he not help the innocent in that caſe, and hold the
King with force? Or would he only aſſiſt them by prayers
to God for them, by conſolatory words, by giving counſel
to them, or by ſupplications to the Magiſtrate with all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
reſpects, and if nothing could avail, ſit dovvne as
having diſcharged his duty; and vvould not reſiſt more?
(vvhich he thinketh is all vvhich is required of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones
<hi>Pag.</hi> 49.) If ſo, many might think he vvere acceſſory
to the death of his vvife or childe, and ſo poſſibly might the
King, when he came to himſelf, and his rage was off him, and
he convinced of his miſtake. And if he vvould hinder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood to be shed (as rational people will eaſily think
he might) hovv shall he ſalve the matter, for the vvorſt of
men may reſiſt the beſt Magiſtrate, proceeding moſt legally,
upon pretences, that the King is in a rage, he hath no shaddow
of law or reaſon for him, he is miſtaken of the perſones &amp;c.
And would he think, that in this caſe, there were a neceſſary
connexion betvvixt reſiſtence and revenge? and if he should
have the upper hand in the matter of reſiſtence, could he not
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:105606:141"/>
ſit dovvn ſatiſfied? If he could: then he may think that
theſe tvvo, may be ſeperated in exerciſe and practice, in
other caſes, as vvell as in his ovvne, unleſſe the fault be on
the Magiſtrate's ſide. Thus is anſwered alſo vvhat he hath
P<hi>ag.</hi> 49. for it is but the ſame thing which he hath in the place
before conſidered, He is tedious in his repetitions, and
therefore we Proceed to our arguments.</p>
               <p>And. 1. If Humanity, Brotherly Affection, Chriſtian
Love. Tenderneſſe and Compaſſion to a ſuffering injured
brother, call for help and releef at the hands of others,
according to their power and capacities: Then none can
juſtly blame or condemne the late riſers for endeavouring in
their places, &amp; according to their power, the releife of their
oppreſſed brethren, with violence, when no other meane
was left feaſible or practicable. Their Solemne covenants
did engadge them to account each injury done unto any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter,
upon that account, as done unto themſelves; And
to vindicate and maintaine the libertyes of the Subjects, in all
theſe things, which concerne their Conſciences, perſones,
and Eſtates, and who can blame them for paying their vowes
unto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>2. If this ſame duty was expreſly required of the people of
God of old, that they should endeavour to relieve the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and to prevent the shedding of innocent blood:
Then none can juſtly blame thoſe late valient vindicators
of juſtice, and relievers of the oppreſſed. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is true, as the places above cited do show. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. If their forebearing had made them guilty before God,
of the oppreſſion and bloodshed committed, vvhen it vvas
in their povver to help it: Then they could not forbeare to
do what they did, without ſin. But the former is true. The
very <hi>Egyptians</hi> knew ſo much by the light of nature, when by
their law, ſuch as did not relieve the oppreſſed, when it was in
their povver, vvere accuſed upon their head; and if they
vvere not able to help, they vvere bound to accuſe the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour,
or elſe they vvere to be vvhipped, &amp; to endure three
dayes hunger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:105606:141"/>
I shall cloſe this chapter, as I did the former, with a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of famous <hi>Mr. Knox,</hi> that it may be ſeen to be no nevv
doctrine of ours. In his admonition to the Commonalty
of <hi>Scotland</hi> he hath theſe words, neer the end, [<q>Theſe
vaine excuſes I ſay, will nothing availe you, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, who requireth no leſſe of the Subjects,
then of their Rulers—and if yee think that ye are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
becauſe you are not the chief actors of ſuch iniquity,
ye are utterly deceived, for God doth not only punish the
chiefe offenders, but with them, doth he condemne
the conſenters to ſuch iniquity, and all are judged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that knowing impiety committed give no teſtimony
that the ſame diſpleaſeth them. To ſpeak this matter more
plaine: As your Princes and Rulers are criminal with your
Bishops, of all Idolatry committed, and of all the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood that is shed, for the teſtimony of Chriſts
truth: and that becauſe they maintaine them in their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:
So are yee (I meane ſo many of you, as give
no plaine confeſſion to the contrary) criminal and guilty
with your Princes and Rulers, in the ſame crimes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you aſſiſt and maintaine your Princes in their blind
rage, and give no declaration that their tyranny diſpleaſeth
you. This doctrine I know is ſtrange to the blinde world,
but the verity thereof hath been declared in all notable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
from the beginning; vvhen the Original vvorld
perished by vvater; vvhen <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> vvere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by fire; and finally, vvhen <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> vvas horribly
deſtroyed, doth any think that all vvere alike vvicked
before the vvorld? Evident it is, that they vvere not, if
they be judged according to their external facts; for ſome
were young and could not be oppreſſours, nor could defile
themſelves with unnatural, and beaſtly luſts; Some were
pitiful and gentle of nature, and did not thirſt for the blood
of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles: but did any eſcape the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
and vengeance which did apprehend the multitude?
let the ſcripture witneſſe, and the hiſtories be conſidered,
which plainly do teſtify that by the vvaters, all flesh on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arth at that time, did perish, (<hi>Noah</hi> and his family reſerved)
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:105606:142"/>
That none eſcaped in <hi>Sodome</hi> and in the other cities adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
except <hi>Lot</hi> and his tvvo daughters; And evident
it is that in that famous city of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in that laſt and
horrible deſtruction, none eſcaped God's vengeance, except
ſo many as before were diſperſed. And what is the cauſe
of this ſeverity, ſeing that all were not alike offenders?
let flesh ceaſe to diſput with God, and let all men by theſe
examples learne betimes to flee and avoyd the ſociety and
company of the proud contemners of God, if that they
liſt not to be partakers of their plagues. The cauſe is
evident, if we can be ſubject, without grudging, to
God's judgments, which in themſelves are moſt holy and
juſt; for in the original world none was found that either
did reſiſt tyranny, nor yet that earneſtly reprehended the
ſame. In <hi>Sodome</hi> was none found that did gain-ſtand that
furious and beaſtly multitude that did compaſſe about and
beſiege the houſe of <hi>Lot</hi>—and finally in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was
found none that ſtudyed to reprepreſſe the tyranny of the prieſts
vvho vvere conjured againſt Chriſt and his Evangel; but
all fainted (I except ever ſuch as gave vvitneſſe vvith their
blood, or flying, that ſuch impiety diſpleaſed them) all
keeped ſilence, by the which all approved iniquity, and
joyned hands with the Tyrants, and ſo were arrayed and
ſet, as it were, in one battle againſt the almighty, and
againſt his Son Chriſt Jeſus; for whoſoever gathereth not
with Chriſt, in the day of his harveſt, is judged to ſcatter,
and therefore of one vengeance temporal, were they all
partakers,—will God in this behalf hold you as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents,
be not deceived dear Brethren, God hath punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not only the proud tyrants, filthy perſones, and cruel
murtherers, but alſo ſuch as with them did draw the yoke
of iniquity, vvas it by flattering their offences, obeying
their unjuſt commands, or in winking at their manifeſt
iniquity. All ſuch, I ſay, God once punished, vvith
the chief offenders. Be ye aſſured brethren, That as he is
immutable in nature, ſo will he not pardon you in that
which he hath punished in others, and now the leſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath plainly admonished you of the dangers
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:105606:142"/>
come, and hath offered you his mercy, before he poure forth
his wrath and diſpleaſure upon the diſobedient.]</q> So in his
Exhortation to <hi>England,</hi> P<hi>ag.</hi> 107. [<q>No other aſſurate
will I require that your plagues are at hand, and that your
deſtruction approacheth, then that I shall underſtand
that yee do juſtify your ſelves in this your former iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
abſolve and flatter you who liſt, God the Father,
His ſon Chriſt Jeſus, his holy Angels, the creatures
ſenſible and inſenſible in heaven and earth, shall riſe in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and shall condemne you, if in time you repent not.
The cauſe why I wrape you all in idolatry, all in murther,

               <p>THe author of <hi>Naphtaly Pag.</hi> 177, ſaid [<hi>That all powers are
ſubordinate to the Moſt high, and appoynted and limited by his

good; and our allegiance was and ſtandeth perpetually and expreſly
thus qualified,</hi> viz. in defence of Religion and Liberty, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our first and ſecond Covenants - all allegiance &amp; obedience
to any created power whatſoever (though in the conſtruction of charity
apparently indefinite, yet) in its owne nature is indiſpenſably thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted.</hi>]
By which words, any, who will duely conſider
the ſcope which that author doth drive at, will ſee, That his
meaning was, That as obedience and allaigeance is to be
given to Magiſtrates only in the Lord, So the ſame ought to
be promiſed with this qualification or limitation, ſo far as it is
not contrary to Religion and Liberty of the Subject: &amp; thus
we all ſwore to <hi>defend his Majeſties perſon and authority in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
and defence of the true Religion, and Libertyes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;</hi>
and it is plaine to all who will not shut their eyes, that
the foreſaid author putteth no corrupt gloſſe upon that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
clauſe and qualification; for while he is diſſuadeing from
taking of that bond, which was urged upon the People of
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he uſeth the words cited, &amp; furder addeth [<q>To
renew the ſame; or take any the like oath of allegiance pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſimply; purpoſely omitting the former and due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction,
eſpecially when the powers are in moſt manifeſt,
&amp;notorious rebellion againſt the Lord &amp; oppoſition to his
cauſe and Covenant, is in effect, equivalent to an expreſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
and diſowning of the ſame limitation, and of the
Soveraigne prerogative of the Great God and King over
all, which is thereby reſerved; &amp; as much as in plaine tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
to affirme, <hi>That whatever abuſed authority shall command or
do, either as to the overturning of the work of God, ſubverting
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105606:144"/>
of Religion, deſtroying of Rights and Libertyes, or perſecuting of
all the faithful to the utmoſt extremity, we shall not only ſtupidly
endure it, but activly concurre with, and aſſiſt in all this tyranny</hi>]</q>
What could have been ſpoken either more full, or plaine,
both for explicating the genuine import of that reſtriction
or qualification, or the authors Orthodox ſenſe thereof?
Yet behold how this wrangling pamphleter, becauſe he can
get nothing to ſay againſt the truth aſſerted, muſt wreſt
words and ſenſe and all, that he may have ſomething to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſtraw-adverſary of his owne ſetting up. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he tells us <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. [<hi>Can this aſſertion ſubſist that neither alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
or fidelity, nor obedience is to be given to any created
power, but in defence of Religion and Liberty?</hi> As if <hi>Naphtaly</hi>
had meaned, That no alledgiance, fidelity or obedience was
due, or to be given to the created powers, but when and in
ſo far as, they did actually owne, and contribute their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
for the promoving or eſtablishing of Religion and the
Liberties of the People. Whileas his meaning is clearly
ſeen to have been this, That as all powers are ſubordinate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God the great King over all; So all alledgiance, fidelity,
or obedience is to be promiſed and given unto them, with
a reſerve of the allegiance, fidelity and obedience due to
God the Higheſt of all; and that man's intereſt is not to be
preferred unto God's, but alwayes acknowledged in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
thereunto: So that when earthly powers are ſtated
Enemies to Chriſt and his intereſt, no abſolute allegiance,
fidelity, or obedience is to be promiſed, But alwayes with
this reſtriction, or limitation: Neither are the Subjects
bound to concurre, or aſſiſt them, while in ſuch a ſtated
courſe of oppoſition to the King of King's, and while actively
endeavouring to deſtroy his great intereſt in the world. But
what ſayes our <hi>Surveyer</hi> furder [<hi>That obedience is not to be given
unto any creature on earth, againſt Religion or the revealed will of God,
shall be eaſily granted; we ahhore the very thought of ſo doing.] Anſ.</hi>
Though he abhore the very thought of ſo doing; yet many
will ſay that he hath not abhorred to do it: It is againſt
God's expreſſe and revealed will to commit perjury, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunce
a Covenant ſworne with hands lifted up to the moſt
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:105606:144"/>
high God, and yet he knowes who is guilty of this, &amp; maketh
the will of a creature the Law of the Conſcience, when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix
is a full belly. [<hi>Againe</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>it shall not be ſaid
that obedience is to be given to powers againſt the liberty competent to us
as ſubjects, and conſiſtent with Soveraignity; yet ſo that the meaſure
of that liberty muſt not be made by every man's private will, but by
the declarature of the Parliament, repreſentative of the Subjects, which
beſt knowes what thereunto belongs.] Anſw.</hi> This royal liberal
man would ſeem to yeeld ſomething in favours of the liberty
of the People, but with his annexed clauſe and reſtrictions,
he takes all back again: For 1. ſayes he, it muſt be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siſtent
with Soveraignity,</hi> and how wide a mouth this Soveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
hath, in his and his complices eſtimation, many know,
and we have ſeem in part, even ſo wide as that is shall ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
up all the Peoples liberties; like one of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> leane kine
that eates up the fat and yet is never the fatter. Then 2.
it muſt be determined by the Repreſentatives, as if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
were not <hi>ex officio</hi> bound and obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the Liberties of the People, which belong to the
People, ere the Repreſentatives have a being; and as if it
were in the power of the Repreſentatives to ſell and betray
the Libertyes of the People; or as if no more were compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to the Subjects <hi>de jure</hi> then what they will: Hath a man
no more right to his lands aud heritages then what his advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
who betrayeth his truſt for a larger ſumme of money,
alloweth him or declareth? We know Parliaments can
baſely betray their truſt, and ſell away the Libertyes of a
People, contrare to their vow and oath to God, and their
obligation to the People, whoſe truſtees they should be; and
shall People have no more liberty competent to them, then
what a perfidious company conſpired againſt the good of the
Commonwealth, to pleaſure a ſinful Creature, determineth
by their declarature? This is hard if true, for then a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might ſell them and their poſterity for bondmen and
bond women to the <hi>Turk</hi> for ever. But we ſee no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for aſſerting an infallibility, or abſoluteneſſe of power
in Parliaments, then in Princes. What furder? [<hi>But to ſay,
that all (not only obedience but) allegiance and fidelity, due to any
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:105606:145"/>
created power is indiſpenſably reſtricted to this qualification in defence
of Religion and liberty, viz. of the Subjects, is a moſt falſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.]
Anſw.</hi> He ſaid not <hi>reſtricted to this qualification,</hi> but
<hi>thus qualified,</hi> and <hi>thus reſtricted.</hi> This muſt be either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or worſe in this pamphleter, thus to wrong the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
But, vvhat vvas the authors meaning vve have
shevved. Let us heare The pamphleting Prelate [<hi>It is knowne</hi>
(ſayes he) <hi>that a reſtriction excludes all other caſes which are not in
the reſtrictive propoſition included, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> All this is
founded upon his either wilfull or ignorant miſtake; for the
author took not the reſtriction, ſo (as we have ſeen) as to
exclude all fidelity or obedience, except in things tending
immediatly and directly unto the good of Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Subject: But ſo as that we might do nothing
in prejudice of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> nor yeeld obedience to
him in any thing tending to the hurt of either: &amp; thus is our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to be reſtricted, or qualified. We deny not obedience,
even when the act of obedience, cannot be properly &amp; directly
ſaid to be either in defence of Religion or the liberty of the
ſubject: So that we croſſe not what the miniſters ſaid unto the
doctors of <hi>Aberdeen:</hi> for we take not that clauſe as <hi>excluſive,</hi>
that is, that we shall never defend his perſon and authority but
when he is actually &amp; actively defending Religion &amp; Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes;
but only as a reſtriction or qualification, thus, that we
shall defend his perſon &amp; authority, ſo far as may conſiſt with
Religion &amp; Libertyes: And thus we agree alſo with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
aſſemblie 1639. for we ſay it is the Subjects duty to concurre
with their friends and followers, as they shall be required, in
every cauſe that concernes his Majeſties honour, yet ſo as
that they do nothing to the prejudice of Religion or Libertyes
<hi>But furder</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>as to the poynt of allegiance or fidelity,
that is another matter then obedience.] Anſw.</hi> True, when men
will become very critical; but the ſcope of the place
showeth in what ſenſe he took it, not only as includeing
an owneing of him as lawful and rightful King &amp;c. but
as includeing alſo a promiſe of active concurrence in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
of him and his intereſt: and ſo while this is urged
in an abſolute, illimited, unqualified or un - reſtricted
way, he made it all one with obedience. It is true, a man
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:105606:145"/>
may keep allegiance or fidelity to the King, when he cannot
obey his commands; yet the clauſe of the Covenant reſpects
allegiance as well as obedience, in ſo far, as we are not to
defend his perſon and authority abſolutely, but in defence of
the true Religion and Liberties of the Subjects. Allegiance
then is a comprehenſive thing, not only taking - in an owneing
of the King as rightful King, and fidelity to his perſon
crowne and dignity againſt conſpiracyes and treaſons; but
alſo an active concurring to promove his honour and dignity,
and to defend his perſon and authority: And ſo all who ſay
allegiance muſt be qualified according to this reſtriction, do
not meane every thing in allegiance, but that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Covenants. So that it is his ignorant inference,
to ſay. That that which <hi>Naphtals</hi> ſayeth is contrary to the
confeſſion of ſaith <hi>Cap.</hi> 23. §. 4. which ſayeth is <hi>difference in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
doth not make voyd the Magiſtrates juſt and legal authority, nor
free the people from their due obedience to him,</hi> unleſſe he think the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Covenant, interfereth with the confeſſion of faith,
which he dar not aſſert; but if he do aſſert it, let us hear
by his next what he will ſay to the <hi>Apologetical Relation,
Pag.</hi> 386. 387. 388. 389. 390. where that clauſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is vindicated. He addeth [<hi>It is the Lord's way for keeping
humane ſocieties from groſse diſorders, to allow to ſuch as are in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
power by lawful calling, the honour due unto their place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the maine things they pervert the Ends of government, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring
him by a falſe Religion, or ſeduceing others to their evil
way.] Anſw.</hi> Do we ſay that honour is not due unto Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of another Religion, becauſe we ſay that we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
allegiance and obedience to them <hi>in the Lord;</hi> and muſt
not concure with them, nor contribute our power unto
them, to the manifeſt detriment of Religion and Libertyes?
This is like the reſt of this Man's foolish inferences. Or
doth he think that we cannot give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things vvhich
are <hi>Caeſar's,</hi> unleſſe vve give him alſo, the things which are
God's, and are the Peoples? Then he citeth <hi>Calv. Instit.
Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c</hi> 20. §, 25. 27. But He ſpeaketh nothing contrare to
the buſineſſe we are upon: Doth he think that <hi>Calvin</hi> was
of the judgment that People are bound to ſweare abſolute
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:105606:146"/>
Subjection, allegiance or fidelity and obedience to all
wicked princes, whatever right they may have to the place?
That ſubjects are bound to obey, and to ſweare allegiance <hi>in
the Lord</hi> unto wicked Kings who denyeth? do vve ſay that
vvicked Kings, becauſe vvicked, are <hi>eo ipſo</hi> no Kings; nor
to be acknowledged as Kings? What then doth this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
make againſt thus? But 2. will he ſtand to what <hi>Calvin</hi>
sayeth? Then he muſt condemne vvhat King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have done, in taking the life of the <hi>Marquiſe</hi> of <hi>Argyle;</hi>
and ſay that they are guilty of innocent blood; for by vvhat
<hi>Calvin</hi> here ſayeth, vve were as much bound to acknovvledge
<hi>Cromwel</hi> then, vvhen he did Reigne, as now to acknowledge
the King: for he ſpeaks of all <hi>qui quoquo modo rerum potiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
How will he then free himſelf from treaſon? For ſure in
<hi>Calvine's</hi> judgment, <hi>Argile</hi> did but his duty, though he had
done more, and yet he was condemned as a Traitour: can he
reconcile this with <hi>Calvine's</hi> judgment?</p>
               <p>So then our promiſeing and ſwearing alleagiance, fidelity,
and obedience to the King, being with a reſerve of our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagiance,
fidelity, and obedience unto the Supreame King
of Kings and Lord of Lords, and according to that due
ſubordination, and thus limited and reſtricted, that we may
do nothing againſt God, or in prejudice of his intereſts; no
perſon can with any colour of law or conſcience, challenge
or accuſe any of Treaſon or Rebellion againſt the King, when
they preferre the intereſt of God unto Man's, and labour to
ſecure Religion and the intereſt of Chriſt, unto which they
are abſolutely, and indiſpenſably obliged, and from which
obligation and alleagiance, no authority of man can looſe
them, nothwithſtanding that in ſo doing, they poſtpone
the authority of man, and their alleagiance thereunto, and
lay it by; ſeing it is of no force, when it cometh in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
with the authority of God, and is ſtated againſt that
Religion, which by divine authority they are bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
with hazard and loſſe of their lives, goods and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
And therefore the late act of defence being, according
to their ſworne alleagiance to God, a neceſſary defence of
Religion, cannot be condemned of Treaſon or Rebellion,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:105606:146"/>
though it wanted that formality of the authority of Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
powers: As poſtponing the authority of inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
in act of obedience, and duty of alleagiance unto
the Superiour, can be no proper diſloyalty or rebellion; ſo
nor can the poſtponing of the authority, of Superiour and
inferiour Magiſtrates, in poynt of obedience, and performing
alleagiance unto the moſt Supreame, be really treaſonable,
ſeditious, or rebellious.</p>
               <p>2. If we be ſworne to maintaine the King's perſon and
authority, in the defence of the liberties of the ſubject:
Then who ever preferre the Liberties of the Subject unto his
perſon and authority, are not Traitours or Rebels: And
ſo the late act of defence, being for the liberties of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
when they were baſely betrayed, ſold, and given away,
by a company conjured into a conſpiracy againſt the ſame,
and were trode upon, and violently plucked away, cannot
in conſcience, or in the law of God, or according to any
juſt law of man, be accounted, or condemned as; an act of
Treaſon or Rebellion.</p>

favour and a ſcrine betwixt the Peoples Liberty, and their
bondage, cannot be given of God as a bondage and ſlavery
to the People. But the Power of a King is given as a
bleſſing &amp; favour of God to defend the poor &amp; needy, to
preſerve both tables of the law, and to keep the People
in their libertyes, from oppreſſing and treading on upon
another. But ſo it is, that if ſuch a power be given of
God to a King, by which <hi>actu primo</hi> he is inveſted of God
to do acts of Tyranny, and ſo to do them, that to reſiſt
him in the moſt innocent way, which is ſelf defence, muſt
be reſiſting of God, and rebellion againſt the King his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty;
Then hath God given a royal power, as incontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
by mortal men by any violence, as if God himſelf,
were immediatly and perſonally reſiſted, when the King
is reſiſted, and ſo this power shall be a power to waſte
and deſtroy irreſiſtably, and ſo in it ſelf a plague and curſe;
for it cannot be ordained, both according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and genuine formal effect and intrinſecal operation of
the power, to preſerve the tables of the Law, Religion
and Liberty, Subject and lawes; and alſo to deſtroy the
ſame. But it is taught by <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> That this power is
for Tyranny, as wel as for peacable government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
to reſiſt this royal power put forth in acts either of
Tyranny or juſt government, is to reſiſt the ordinance of
God, as <hi>Royaliſts</hi> ſay, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 13: 1, 2, 3. We know to
reſiſt God's Ordinance and Gods deputy <hi>formaliter</hi> as his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,
is to reſiſt God himſelf 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10:
<hi>ver.</hi> 40. as if God were doing perſonally theſe acts that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:105606:148"/>
the King is doing; and it importeth as much as the King of
Kings doth theſe acts, in and through the Tyrant. Now it
is blaſphemy to think or ſay, That when a Kings is drinking
the blood of innocents, and vvaſting the <hi>Church of God,</hi>
That <hi>God</hi> if he vvere perſonally preſent, vvould commit
the ſame acts of Tyranny (God avert ſuch blaſphemy)
and that God in and through the King his lavvſul deputy
and vicegerent, in theſe acts of Tyranny, is waſting
the poor <hi>Church of God.</hi> If it be ſaid, in theſe ſinfull acts of
tyranny, he is not God's <hi>formal vicegerent,</hi> but only in good
and lawful acts of Government, yet he is not to be reſiſted
in theſe acts, not becauſe the acts are juſt and good, but
becauſe of the dignity of his royal perſone. Yet this muſt
prove that theſe who reſiſt the King in theſe acts of Tyranny,
muſt reſiſt no ordinance of God, but only that we reſiſt
him who is the Lord's deputy. What abſurdity is there
in that, more then to diſobey him, refuſeing active obedience
to him who is the Lord's deputy, but not as the Lord's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,
but as a man commanding beſide his Maſter's war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand?</q>
               </p>
               <p>5. (<hi>Pag.</hi> 263.) <q>That which is inconſiſtent with the
care and providence of God in giving a King to his Church,
is not to be taught. Now God's end in giving a King to
his Church, is the feeding, ſaifty, preſervation, the
peacable and quyet life of his <hi>Church, 1 Tim. 2: 2. Eſai. 49:
ver. 23. Pſal. 79: 7.</hi> But God should croſſe his owne end in
the ſame act of giving a <hi>King,</hi> if he should provide a <hi>King,</hi>
who by office were to ſuppreſſe Robbers, Murtherers, and
all oppreſſours and waſters in his holy mount, and yet
should give an irreſiſtible power to one <hi>crowned Lyon</hi> a <hi>King</hi>
who may kill a Thouſand Thouſand proteſtants for their
religion, in an ordinary providence, and they are by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
law of God to give their throats to his Emiſſaries,
and bloody executioners. If any ſay, the King will not be
ſo cruel. I beleeve it, becauſe, <hi>actu ſecundo</hi> it is not poſſible
in his power to be ſo cruel; we owe thanks to his good will
that he killeth not ſo many, but no thanks to the genuine
intrinſecal end of a King, who hath power from God to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:105606:148"/>
kill all theſe, and that without reſiſtence made by any
Mortal man: Yea no thanks (God avert blaſphemy) to
God's ordinary providence, which (if <hi>Royaliſts</hi> may be
beleeved) putteth no bar upon the illimited power of a
Man inclined to ſin, and abuſe his power to ſo much
cruelty. Some may ſay, the ſame abſurdity doth follow
if the King should turne papiſt, and the Parliament and all
were papiſts, in that caſe, there might be ſo many <hi>Martyres</hi>
for the truth put to death, and God should put no bar of
providence upon this power, more then now; and yet in
that caſe. King and Parliament should be judges given of
God <hi>actu primo,</hi> and by vertue of their office obliged to
preſerve the people <hi>in peace and godlineſse.</hi> But I anſwere.
If God gave a lawful official power to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi>
to work the ſame cruelty upon Millions of Martyrs, and
it should be unlawful for them to defend themſelves, I
should then think that <hi>King &amp; Parliament</hi> were both <hi>ex of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio
and actu primo</hi> judges and Fathers, and alſo by that ſame
office, <hi>Murtherers</hi> and <hi>butchers,</hi> which were a grievous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion

of people; and if any man turne ſo diſtracted, as
he ſmite himſelf with ſtones, and kill all that paſſe by
him, or come at him; in that caſe the man is to be bound
and his hands fettered, and all whom he invadeth may
reſiſt him, were they his owne ſones, and may ſave their
owne lives with weapons. Much more a <hi>King</hi> turning a <hi>Nero,</hi>
King <hi>Saul</hi> vexed with an evil ſpirit from the Lord, may be
reſiſted: and far more if a King endued with uſe of reaſon,
shall put violent hands on all his ſubjects, kill his ſone and
heire: yea, any violently invaded, by natures law, may
defend themſelves; &amp; the violent reſtraining of ſuch an one
is but the hurting of one Man, who cannot be virtually
the Commonwealth, but his deſtroying of the community
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:105606:149"/>

               <p>7. (<hi>Pag.</hi> 335.) By the law of Nature, <q>a Ruler is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
to defend the innocent: Now by Nature, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
in the womb defendeth it ſelf firſt, before the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
can defend it; Then when parents and Magiſtrates
are not (and violent invading Magiſtrates are not, in that,
Magiſtrates) Nature hath commended every man to ſelf
defence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>8. (<hi>Ibid</hi>) <q>The law of nature excepteth no violence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inflicted by a Magiſtrate or any other; unjuſt violence
from a Ruler is thrice injuſtice 1. He doth injuſtice as a
man, 2. As a member of the Commonwealth. 3. He
committeth a ſpecial kinde of ſin of injuſtice againſt his
office. But it is abſured to ſay we may lawfully defend our
ſelves from ſmaller injuries, by the law of Nature, and not
from greater, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe and many moe, to this purpoſe, may be ſeen in that
unanſvverable piece: But I proceed to adde ſome mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
here.</p>
               <p>9. If it be lawful for the people, to riſe in armes to defend
themſelves, their Wives and Children, &amp; their Religion,
from an invadeing army of cut throat <hi>Papists, Turks or Tartars,</hi>
though the Magiſtrates Superiour and inferiour, should
either, through abſence, or ſome other phyſical impediment,
not be in a preſent capacity to give an expreſſe warrand or
command, or through wickedneſſe, for their owne privat
ends, should refuſe to concurre, and should diſcharge the
people to riſe in armes: Then it cannot be unlawful to riſe
in armes and defend their owne Lives, and the lives of their
Poſterity, and their Religion; when Magiſtrates, who are
appoynted of God to defend, turn enemies themſelves, and
oppreſſe, plunder, and abuſe the innocent, and overturne
Religion, &amp; preſſe people to a ſinful compliance there with.
But the former is true. Therefore &amp;c. The aſſumption is
cleare: Becauſe all the power of Magiſtrates, which
they have of God, is cumulative, and not privative and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
it is a power to promove the good of the Realme, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:105606:149"/>
not a power to deſtroy the ſame, whether by acting and going
beyond their power, or by refuſeing to act and betraying
their truſt. 2. No power given to Magiſtrates, can take
away Natures <hi>birth right,</hi> or that innate power of ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
3. It can fare no worſe with people in this caſe, then
if they had no Magiſtrates at all; but if they had no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
at all, they might lawfully ſee to their owne ſelf
defence. 3. The power given to Magiſtrates can not looſe
the obligation of people unto God's moral law; but by the
moral law they are bound, in this caſe of imminent danger,
to defend themſelves, their Wives and Children, and their
Religion: theſe are acts of charity, which Magiſtrates can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
looſe them from; otherwiſe Magiſtrates might command
us to kill the innocent, the widow and the fatherleſſe, and
we might lawfully do it at their command; which is moſt
falſe and abſurde: therefore neither can their expreſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
hinder us from relieving ſuch, whom we are bound
to relieve, nor exeem us from the guilt of Murther, before
God, if we do it not, but obey their prohibition. The
connexion of the propoſition I cleare thus. 1. The law of
ſelf defence is no leſſe valide in the one caſe, then in the other.
2. The law of charity obligeth in the one caſe, no leſſe then
in the other. 3. Magiſtrates are no more appoynted of
God to deſtroy the people themſelves, then to ſuffer others
to deſtroy them; and ſo the reſiſting of their violence in the
one caſe, is no more a reſiſting of the ordinance of God, then
the reſiſting or counter-acting of their prohibition, or ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
in the other caſe. 4. Magiſtrates are no leſſe to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted,
in ſo far, no Magiſtrates, when they counter-act
their commiſſion, then when they ſinfully betray their truſt,
and neglect their commiſſion. 5. Unjuſt violence offered
in Lives, Liberties and Religion, is no leſſe unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
when offered by Magiſtrats themſelves, then when
offered by ſtrangers, Magiſtrates permitting or connive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>10. If it be lawful for private Subjects to joyne together
in armes, and defend Themſelves, their Lands, Liberties,
Wives, Children; Goods, and Religion, againſt a forraigne
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:105606:150"/>
Enemie, invading the land to conquer and ſubdue the ſame,
with the Magiſtrates approbation, or expreſſe warrand.
Then it is alſo lawful to reſiſt domeſtick Enemies animated by
the ſame power and authority. But the former is true,
becauſe Magiſtrates, in that caſe, do profeſſe and avow
themſelves tyrants, ſeeking the deſtruction of the whole
Realme: and therefore are not Magiſtrates. Therefore &amp;c.
The conſequence is cleared abundantly in the preceeding
argument, and cannot be denyed: for, a domeſtick enemy is
more unnatural, unjuſt, ihhumane; illegal, hurtful and
dangerous, then a forraigne enemy.</p>
               <p>11. Such acts of unjuſt violence, which neither Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
themſelves may immediatly commit, nor may any
ſubject under them, without ſin and diſobedience to God,
execute, may lawfully be reſiſted by private perſones, when
committed in a rage, or cruelly executed by inſeriours.
But ſuch are acts of oppreſſing, plundering, ſpoyling Subjects
of their libertyes, becauſe of their adhereing to their ſworne
Covenanted Religion. Therefore &amp;c. That Princes and
Magiſtrates may not oppreſſe, and wronge the People, is
clear 1 <hi>Sam. 12: 3, 4, 5. 2 Sam. 23:3. 1 King. Cap. 21. and 22.
2 Chron. 9: 8. Pſal. 105: 14, 15. Eſa. 1: 23. and 3: 12, 13,
14, 15. and 14: 15, to 23. and 9: 7. and 16: 5. and 32: 1, 2.
and 49: 23. Ier. 22: 3, to 32. Zeph. 2: 8. and 3:3. Micah. 3:1.
to 12. Obad. v. 2, 10, to 17. Ezech. 22: 6, 7, 27. and 45: 8, 9.</hi> It
is contrare to their expreſſe commiſſion <hi>Rom. 13: 4, 5.</hi> That
their unjuſt mandats for oppreſſion and uſeing of violence,
are not to be obeyed, is no leſſe clear from <hi>Exod. 1: 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20. 1 Sam. 22: 17, 18. Pſal. 52: 5.</hi> So likewiſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be cleare, That it muſt alſo be lawful to reſiſt that
violence when wickedly and unjuſtly acted and executed:
For, what power Magiſtrates can not themſelves put into
execution, is not of God nor ordained of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the reſiſting of that, cannot be the reſiſting of any power
ordained of God: And againe, what power ſubjects cannot
lawfully put into execution can be no lawful Magiſtratical
power appoynted of God: For, if it were, a refuſeing to
put the ſame into execution were a real reſiſting of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:105606:150"/>
of God: And ſo a reſiſting of this, when wickedly
put into execution, is no reſiſting of the ordinance of God,
which cauſeth damnation.</p>
               <p>12. That it is juſt and lawful to flee from the violence of
Magiſtrates will not be denyed. But if that be lawful, when
ſubjects have no power or meanes whereby to reſiſt, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
unjuſt violence with violence, It cannot be ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to reſiſt the ſame unjuſt violence with force, vvhen
neither flying, nor hideing, nor other ſuch like meanes of ſaif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are practicable: Becauſe it is the principle of ſelf defence
againſt violence, that makes flight lavvful, vvhen there is no
poſſibility of reſiſtence; and the ſame principle of ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
will make reſiſtance lawful, when the other is not
practicable. Againe, the principle of charity to their Wives
and Children and other Relations, makes flight lawful,
when they can not otherwise avoide the unjuſt violence of
Tyrants; and the ſame principle will animate to reſiſtence,
when practicable, &amp; when they cannot flee with wives and
children and old decrepite parents &amp;c. Thirdly, the ſame
principle of conſcience, <hi>viz</hi> that they may keep their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Conſcience free and undefiled, which will prompt
to a flight, when there is no other remedy, will prompt alſo
to reſiſtence, when flight is not practicable. I remember,

only a withdrawing from under his dominion, and putting ones ſelf
under another dominion where his power reaches not: and ſo by flight
and withdrawing from the Kingdomes, the man ceaſeth to be a ſubject

<hi>a monſter
of a ſtöical paradox:</hi> what could his ſtoical braine have ſaid
more paradoxically? Flight and non-obedience both are a
reſiſting of the abuſed power; and if the cauſe be juſt
which is preſſed by the Magiſtrate, flight on that account, &amp;
non-obedience, is a reſiſtence of the powers ordained of

he is out of due order. But. 2. As we have ſeen, the
conſequence will hold, and we ſeek no more; we need not
make it a reſiſtence equal with forcible reſiſtence. 3. He
ſpeaketh of a flight out of the King's dominions, but what
ſayes he to a flight, when the perſones flying keep ſtill within
the dominions? Will he grant that this is liker unto a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence?
And he muſt, if his reaſons hold; for in this caſe,
the man ceaſeth not to be a ſubject nor cometh he to be under
another Lord: and if he grant this, our argument will ſtand
as firme as ever. 4. The man, for all the money he hath gotten
from his majeſty for his paines, or paine, is not afrayed to
rub, by what he ſayes here, upon his ſacred Majeſty and his
Royal Councel; for, if perſons withdrawne and out of the
Kingdom, ceaſe to be ſubjects to the King. How could the
King and council ſummon home the Scottish officers who
ſerved under the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and were ſervants to
them, and under their pay, and had been in their bounds,
all moſt all their dayes, yea ſome of them were borne under
the States; and yet for not comeing to the Kings dominions
upon his call and charge, they were denunced rebels &amp; fore
faulted, and ſtand under that ſentence to this day, for any
thing I know; which, though I account the moſt unjuſt,
inhumane, barbarous &amp; irrational act, that can be, ſo that it
may well be reckoned, among the <hi>Surveyer's</hi> monſters of

that Chriſt ſaid, alittle before he was to be apprehended,

garment, and buy one—and they ſay Lord here are two ſwords,
and he ſaid unto them, it is enough.</hi> Here is enough to evince the
lawfulneſſe of reſiſting with force unjuſt oppreſſours; for
if Chriſt had thought it ſimply unlawful, why would he have
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:105606:151"/>
deſired his naked private diſciples, to buy ſwords, which
are weapons for forcible reſiſtence and defence, and that at
ſuch a time? It is true, he would not ſuffer them to make
uſe of them as they would, not becauſe it was ſimply unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for them to reſcue him out of the hands of that band of
robbers; for he uſeth no ſuch argument to diſſuade them: but
becauſe, he was commanded of the father, to yeeld and to
lay downe his life, of his owne accord; and therefore was
it alſo that he would not uſe the help of angells, as he might
have done, in his owne defence; therefore ſaid he <hi>Ioh. 18:

this act of ſelf preſervation <hi>hic &amp; nunc:</hi> which was otherwiſe
lawful; as well as it did reſtraine from flight, a mean which
Chriſt at other times uſed, for his preſervation: Neither did

ſound reaſon, &amp; to all rational perſones, doth remedyleſly &amp;
unavoydably, tend to overthrow and deſtroy polities, all
order, and all humane ſociety, and open a gap and wide door
to all confuſion, diſorder, tyranny, oppreſſion, cruelty,
and injuſtice. Our <hi>Surveyer</hi> cannot deny this propoſition;
ſeing he maketh uſe if it, or of one very like unto it <hi>Pag. 43.</hi>
But to ſay that a poor oppreſſed people may not defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in extreame neceſſity, againſt the oppreſſion and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of Magiſtrates, and reſiſt unjuſt violence with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is to all rational perſones a remedyleſſe and unavoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
courſe laid downe, for utter overturning of all Society, &amp;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:105606:152"/>
is an opening of a door to all confuſion, diſorder, tyranny,
oppreſſion, Murthers, cruelty, injuſtice, &amp;c. for when
Magiſtrates turne Tyrants, oppreſſours, ſet themſelves
to ſeek the ruine and deſtruction of their Kingdomes, and of
all their Subjects, in bodyes, goods, and Conſciences, and
ſell themſelves to do ſuch villany and wickedneſſe, there is
no remedy, by this doctrine; the Commonwealth is utterly
gone; oppreſſion and Murthers are increaſed; all is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
and overturned; and there is no help. Thus God
shall have given a power to one man to kill and maſſacre milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Chriſtians, to deſtroy whole Commonwealthes, and
to root them out, and all their memorial, that no more
mention should be made of them. But who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
this? Yea if this were received as a truth, what
incouragement were it to tyranny and oppreſſion? And what
miſchief would not wicked hearts contrive and execute, if
they did not feare oppoſition and reſiſtence? This <hi>Surveyer</hi>
tels us <hi>Pag. 103.</hi> That it is enough to keep Kings right, to
tell them they muſt anſwer to God, But we ſee that for all
this, there are moe evil and wicked Kings, then good; and
it is more then probable, that that alone vvould no more
ſuppreſſe their tyranny, and keep them from wickedneſſe,
then the fear of the gallowes would keep theeves from ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and robbing; if they knew that no body would reſiſt
them, or oppoſe them with force, when they came to ſteal
and rob.</p>
               <p>15. By this doctrine, People should be in the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition imaginable when under governours; for not
only should they be lyable to all the oppreſſions of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
tyrannizing over them, and have their hands bound
up, ſo that they could not helpe themſelves; but alſo unto
the opreſſion and tyranny of every one who could but ſay,
he had a commiſſion from his Majeſty to kill and murther all
whom he pleaſed: For they might not reſiſt whether he
had a real commiſſion or not, leſt they should reſiſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God, in reſiſting a ſervant ſent of the King to
execute his luſt and cruelty, with expreſſe warrand and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:
&amp; thus there would be as many irreſiſtible tyrants,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:105606:152"/>
armed with abſolute and irreſiſtible power, as one Tyrant will,
and the people might no more uſe violent reſiſtence againſt
them, then againſt him. A doctrine, I am ſure, poynt blanck
contrary to all reaſon and equity.</p>
               <p>16. If forraigne princes may lawfully help a poor people
oppreſſed by their owne Soveraigne: Then people may
lawfully, if they be able, hold in the paines of theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
princes, and defend themſelves. But the former is
granted by caſuiſts and politicians. Therefore &amp;c. The
conſequence cannot be denyed: for forraigners have no
more power or authority over another ſoveraigne, then the
people have themſelves: and what juſtice, or equity of the
cauſe could warrand them to come to their reliefe and
ſuccoure, the ſame will warrand the perſones injured to help
themſelves, if they be able.</p>
               <p>17. As the law of Nature will allow this ſelf defence
even to private perſons, in caſes of neceſſity, So will the
law of Nations, and the Civil law; for it maketh no diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inction
betwixt ſelf defence uſed by private perſons alone,
and that which is uſed by private perſons having their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives
concurring: And where the law diſtinguisheth
not, we should not diſtinguish. As all law permits to
repel violence with violence; ſo doth it give this allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to all perſons whatſoever <hi>l. Liberam C. quando licet uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuique
ſine judic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. To maintaine, that in no caſe it were lawful for Private
ſubjects, to reſiſt the unjuſt violence, and to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the tyranny of Princes, would be a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
of our owne Princes <hi>K. Iames,</hi> and <hi>K. Charles,</hi> who
helped the private Subjects of other Princes againſt them:
and is it not unreaſonable to plead for more abſolute ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
then princes themſelves will plead for: Or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
that reſiſtence which even they will approve of, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and encourage to?</p>
               <p>16. If it were not lawful for private perſons to defend
themſelves againſt the manifeſt tyranny of a Soveraigne,
without the concurrence or conduct of a Parliament, or
their Repreſentative: Then the condition of ſuch as live
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:105606:153"/>
under ſuch a government where there are <hi>Ephori,</hi> or where
there is a Repreſentative conſtituted, should be worſe, then
is the condition of theſe, who want ſuch Repreſentatives.
But that were abſurd. Therefore &amp;c. The conſequence
of the <hi>Major</hi> is hence cleared: Becauſe, all the arguments,
which have been adduced by any, for proving the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of reſiſtence in caſes of neceſſity, will evince that a
people, who have no formal Repreſentative, may reſiſt the
tyranny of their Prince: But now if this were not allowed
unto a People having Repreſentatives, their caſe should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanely
be worſe: Becauſe their hands should be bound up
from that neceſſary defence, which otherwiſe they might
have uſed <hi>viz.</hi> when Repreſentatives should betray their truſt,
and comply with a tyrannous Prince againſt the people. The
<hi>Minor</hi> is moſt certane, becauſe Parliaments or Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
have been inſtituted for the good &amp; advantage of the
people: And therefore should not prove hurtful and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
otherwiſe they ceaſe to be a benefite and a bleſſing. A
benefite should not prove onerous, ſayeth the law, <hi>ſi filiusf
ff. ut legator nom. caveaetur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>20. If it be lawful for private perſons to reſiſt the Tyranny
of Parliaments, and other inferiour Magiſtrates: Then it
cannot be unlawful for them to reſiſt the Tyranny of others,
without their concurrence and conduct. But the former is
true, as all the arguments uſed by divines and politicians to
prove reſiſtence, will evince; and as ſeveral of our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
will very readily grant, though they will ſtifly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that no reſiſtence is to be uſed againſt the Soveraigne.
Therefore &amp;c. The connexion is hence cleare, That to
whom the greater is lawful, the leſſe is alſo lawful: Now it is
a greater matter to reſiſt a Parliament, then to wave them,
and miskend them, or to reſiſt others vvithout their help;
as all may ſee and will eaſily grant. There is not a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
command for Subjects to do nothing without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of a Parliament, then not to reſiſt them and oppoſe
them: Nor are people more obliged to the one, then to
the other.</p>
               <p>21. Privat perſons without the concurrence of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:105606:153"/>
may reſiſt and oppoſe the Prince, yea and binde his
hands, when in a fit of frenzie, of a diſtempered braine
and madneſſe, he would ſeek to cut his owne throat, or
with <hi>Saul</hi> would run upon his ſword. Therefore they may
alſo reſiſt oppoſe him, when in madneſſe and fury, he
would not only endanger his owne life in ſoul and body, but
vvould deſtroy the inheritance of the Lord, and cut off his
faithful and innocent ſubjects, and deſtroy the land. The
connexion is cleare: Becauſe more reſpect is to be had unto
the life of Thouſands, then to the life of one Man. The
antecedent is certane, becauſe otherwiſe they should be guilty
before the Lord, of his death, if they vvould not hinder it,
when it was in the povver of their hands; for he vvho hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
not a miſchief vvhen he may, he vvilleth it, and ſo is
formally guilty before God.</p>
               <p>22. Privat perſons, vvithout the concurrence of inferiour
Magiſtrates, may reſiſt the Soveraigne, vvhen in a rage he
runeth upon an innocent man paſſing by, and with <hi>Saul,</hi> vvhen
an evil ſpirit from the Lord came upon him, vvould caſt his
javelin or deadly inſtrument at the innocent <hi>Davids.</hi> This
no rational perſon vvill deny, vvho knovveth vvhat a hazard
it is to partake of other men's ſinnes: Love to the Prince
should preſſe to this perſerving of him from shedding inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood; and vvho doth not this vvhen he may, conſenteth
to that murther. Therefore they may alſo, no leſſe, yea much
more, reſiſt him, vvhen in his madneſſe and diſtemper, he
is ſeeking to deſtroy millions of the people of God: And
againe, much more may vve reſiſt him, vvhen he is ſeeking to
deſtroy ourſelves, vve being much more bound to love and
defend ourſelves, then to love and defend others.</p>
               <p>23. If it be lawful for private ſubjects, without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande
or allowance of Parliaments or their Repreſentatives,
to reſiſt a Tyrant, or the Tyranny of a Prince, with teares
and prayers: Then alſo, in caſes of neceſſity, it shall be
lawful for them to reſiſt his violent Tyranny and tyrannical
violence, with violence, But the former is true. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
&amp;c. The minor is cleare: For Royaliſts themſelves
will grant that <hi>praeces</hi> and <hi>lachrymae</hi> may be oppoſed to Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:105606:154"/>
Thus did the ancient Chriſtians reſiſt their tyrannical
Emperours with earneſt cryes and prayers to God, eſpecially
<hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtate, whom they ordinarily ſtiled <hi>Idolianus,
Piſaeus, Adonaeus, Tauricremus, alter Hieroboam, Achab, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,
&amp;c.</hi> And we are allowed to pray againſt the Enemies
of Chriſts Kingdome, againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> that great
Antichriſt, and all the little Antichriſts that make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Lord and his intereſt. Therefore we may alſo
reſiſt a Prince Tyrannically oppreſſing the People of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
the mountaine of the Lord, makeing havock of his
Church, when we are in probable capacity for that work.
The reaſon is becauſe, the one is no more condemned in
Scripture then the other. 2. The one is no more a ſinful reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Ordinance of God, then is the other. 3. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
themſelves will grant that reſiſtence by prayers and
tears is more powerful and effectual, then the other. 4. This
perſonal reſiſtence is as conſiſtent with that command, <hi>let
every ſoul be ſubject to higher powers,</hi> as the other is with that,
<hi>1 Tim. 2: ver. 1, 2. 1 exhort that ſupplications, prayers and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
be made for Kings, and for all in authority.</hi> 5. If the
Prince be good, the one is as unlawful as the other, and a
ſinful reſiſtence of the ordinance of God, no leſſe then the
other: Therefore when he becometh a Tyger, a Lyon, a
waſter of the inheritance of the Lord, an Apoſtate, as I
may not pray for him, except conditionally, but againſt him,
as an enemy of Chriſt's; ſo I may alſo lawfully reſiſt him with
violence. 6. It is cleare from other perfſons or things againſt
whom or which, I may lawfully pray, as inward or outward
Enemics, forraigne or domeſtick, be they inferiour or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,
againſt theſe I may uſe reſiſtence, in my ovvne ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
defence. 7. The lavves of the land make the one trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
as vvel as the other, and that deſervedly, vvhen
the Prince is doing his duty: but vvhen he turneth Tyrant,
neither can juſtly be condemned. 8. We have ſeen the one
practiced in Scripture and other Hiſtories, as vvell as the
other.</p>
               <p>24. If it be lavvful for meer privat perſons to refuſe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto the unjuſt and iniquous commands of Princes:
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:105606:154"/>
Then it is alſo lavvfull for them to reſiſt the unjuſt and illegal
Tyranny of ſuch. But the former is undengable. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo is the latter. The connexion is cleare. For 1. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is no more expreſly preſſed in Scripture, then is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
to Superiours: Therefore if not withſtanding of this
command, non-obedience be allowed yea and neceſsary,
vvhy not alſo non-ſubjection or reſiſtence? 2. The lavv of
God doth not preſſe this as more abſolute and unlimited, then
the other. 3. Non-obedience to the povver commanding
juſt things is a reſiſting of the ordinance of God, as well as non-ſubjection
thereunto: if notwithſtanding hereof non-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to unjuſt commands be allowed, why alſo shall not
non-ſubjection to tyranny be allowed? 4. The one doth no
more derogate from the lawful authority of the Soveraigne,
then the other. 5. The one is no more a wronging of the
Miniſter of God as ſuch, then the other; becauſe he is
no more the Miniſter and vicegerent of God in acts of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
then in commanding unjuſt things. And therefore
6. ſuch as reſiſt unjuſt violence, can no more procure to
themſelves damnation, then the ſuch as diſobey unjuſt commands.</p>

<hi>Pag. 28. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is taken from the duty of Children toward Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
unjuſtly afflicting them <hi>Heb. 12: ver. 9, 10.</hi> where, their
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:105606:155"/>
reverend ſubjection under unreaſonable and unjuſt dealing is
commended: and from the duty of Servants to ſuffer at the
hands of unjuſt and froward Maſters <hi>1 Pet. 2: 18, 19, 20.</hi> To
which we anſwere,</p>
               <p>1. That theſe examples are ſo far from making againſt us,
that they fully comfirme our poynt, as we have shewed a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bove:
For, notwithſtanding of what is ſaid in theſe places,
he cannot deny, but Parents may be reſiſted by their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
in ſeveral caſes, and Maſters by their Servants. It
would be ſtrange, if he should preſſe this ſubjection ſo cloſe
home, that now no Servant might lawfully reſiſt and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the fury of his Maſter; nor no Childe might hold his
furious Father's hands, and defend himſelf againſt his unjuſt
acts of cruelty. And <hi>Althuſius Pol. c. 38. n. 88, 89.</hi> tels us
that in ſeveral caſes, the father lòſeth the right of his fatherly
power over Children; &amp; maſters power, from
the law <hi>Tit. luſt quib. mod. jus Pat. Pot. amit. § Domin, luſt .de

Novel 115. Cap. 3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If theſe ſimititudes be hardly preſſed, it shall not now
be lawful for Subjects to reſiſt ſo much as by flying; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and ſubjection required of Children unto their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
will not ſuffer that to evite every ſmal injurie from their
parents, they should ran away from under their power and
ſubjection; nor might ſervants in thoſe dayes run away from
their Maſters, who had another dominion over them, then
Maſters now have over their Servants, who are free to goe
off when they will; himſelf acknowledgeth this <hi>Pag. 31.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. We have shewed above what a vaſt difference there is,
betwixt the power of Parents over their Children; and the
power of Magiſtrates over their Subjects: And he himſelf
doth confeſſe there is a difference; yet ſayes he, <hi>Pag. 29.
There is a full parity and agreement in this, that in the inflicting of
evils upon theſe who are under them (ſuch as are competent to them to
inflict within their ſphaere) a patient reverent ſubjection is due from
their inferiours, even when they abuſe their power.</hi>] <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is
the queſtion, if the parity hold even here in all poynts; for
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:105606:155"/>
ſeing theſe Relations are different one from another, even in
their nature and ground, it is but rational to think, that
there muſt alſo be ſome difference betwixt them, as to the
conſequent or reſult that floweth from that relation, elſe
it would follow that as Children are ſo Subject, as that they
can never but be ſubject, to their Parents; ſo Subjects could
never be free of their Superiours; and yet himſelf tells us,
that they may, by going under another government, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
to other dominions. 2. Who shall be judge,
whether the Superior keepeth within his ſpaere, yea or
not? If the Superiour, then there is no remedy at all;
for when he doth moſt exceed his bounds, he may
judge that he keepeth within bounds, and ſo whether he
keep within his ſphaere or not, there muſt no reſiſtence be
uſed, but a ſtupide ſubjection. 3. Whether may the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
be reſiſted by the inferiour, when he doth what is not
incumbent to him to do within his ſphaere, or not? If he
may not, then why is this parentheſis added, As a reſtriction
or limitation of the Subjection required? If he may be
reſiſted when he really goeth without his ſphaere, then this
makes for us; for he muſt grant that the Magiſtrate doth
nor preſcribe the limites of his owne povver, but God and
nature, and the conſtitution of the Realme. Novv God
hath never put it in the povver of Princes to preſſe their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to perjury, or to a complyance with a ſinful abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and abjured courſe; ſo that vvhn he doth thus, he
goeth beyond his ſphaere: His ſphaere is to rule for God and
the good of the land, and not to deſtroy the intereſt of
Chriſt, and the Commongood: and if he may be reſiſted,
vvhen he goeth beyond this ſphaere, then vve have all vve
aske. It vvas never vvithin his ſphaere, to break his compact
vvith his People: and vvhen he doth ſo, he is vvithout his
ſphaere and may be reſiſted, and this is alſo for us. Againe
he tells us in the 2 place. <hi>That though Kings are not fathers by
generation; yet as Kings and Magiſtrats should have fatherly hearts
to their ſubjects, (they being a ſort of official fathers to them, to procure
their good, and defend them from evil) ſo ſubjects ought to have ſuch
hearts to their King, as Children have to their fathers, giving them
ſpeical reverence, ſubjection and obedience, from their very ſoul and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:105606:156"/>
inward affection.] Anſw.</hi> All this ſayes that as Kings are
metaphorical Fathers, ſo Subjects, are metaphorical Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
But as it doth not ſay, that Kings should become Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
&amp; not carry fatherly affection tovvards their Subjects;
ſo it doth not ſay, that Subejcts may not reſiſt their tyrannical
rage and fury, vvherein they acte not as fathers, but as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
2. It is true, ſpecial reverence ſubjection &amp; obedience
is due to Magiſtrats, but alvvayes in the Lord; The relation
is mutual, if they carry not as official fathers ſeeking the good
of the ſubjects and defending them, but as devouring Lyons
ſeeking the deſtruction of their Subjects both in ſoul and
body, they cannot expect, according to vvhat he ſayeth, that
hearty ſubjection and obedience, vvhich othervviſe they
might have. 3. Being but official fathers appoynted by the
ſubjects, and ſet over them by their vvill and conſent, they
muſt have leſſe povver to vvronge the Subjects, then Parents
have to vvronge their Children, vvho have not that relation
by vertue of any formal compact with, or conſent of their
Children. So that when they do injuries, Subjects are in
a greater capacity to help themſelves, then Children are;
vvhen their Parents to injure them. He addeth [<hi>Although
ſome times they are not ſuch as they ought to be, yet they ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
their perſons (ſealed with Gods ordinance, and the image of
of his Soveraignity) ſacred and inviolable, reſolving to ſuffer any
thing of them rather then be guilty of parricide (although under the colour
of ſelf defence) Gods law in the fift command hath injoyned reverence &amp;
ſubjection to Princes under the title of Parents Calv. Iuſtit. Lib. 4.
Cap. 8. &amp;c. [Anſw.</hi> We are not ſpeaking of doing violence
unto the perſons of Soveraignes, or of committing parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
but only of the matter of reſiſtance, and of natural
ſinleſſe ſelfe defence, vvhich is far different from Killing of
Kings: If he think the one of the ſame nature vvith the other,
he vvrongeth the King's life, more then he is avvare of.
Though Children as Children may not Kill their parents,
yet they may defend themſelves from their unjuſt violence.
2. We grant Kings are comprehended in the fift commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under the title of parents, as <hi>Calvin</hi> doth; and not only
<hi>Kings,</hi> but all Superiours: &amp; yet he will not ſay, I ſuppoſe, that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:105606:156"/>
we are not to reſiſt the unjuſt violence of any ſuperiour, but
that they are all ſo ſacred and inviolable, as that in all things,
they muſt be ſubjected unto, without the leaſt reſiſtence:
and therefore what he addeth is not to the poynt.</p>
               <p>4. We have shewed above, that there is a vaſte diſparity
betvvixt Maſters and Kings, in reference to their ſlaves and
ſubjects; He himſelf acknovvledgeth this, <hi>Pag. 31. [Yet</hi>
(ſayes he) <hi>though there be theſe differences betwixt the dominative
or maſterly, and the Royal or Magistratical power, the inferiours ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
in ſuffering (even wrongfully, if God permit in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
the power to be abuſed) is no leſse under the one power, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the other, by vertue of Divine Law. Subjects ſerve the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
(though they be not ſlaves:) and not only conquered people
are called Servants,</hi> 2 Sam. 8: v. 14. <hi>but alſo ordinary ſubjects,</hi>
2 Sam. 11: V. 24. 1 King. 12: V. 4.—<hi>Though he alſo be
in a ſenſe their ſervant (not in relation of an inferiour to a ſuperiour,
for ſo the Magiſtrate is only the Miniſter of God for the Peoples good,
and never called their Miniſter) but in relation of the meanes to the
end—as Angles are ministring ſpirits for the heires of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Miniſters are Servants to the People, &amp;c.] Anſw.</hi> That
the ſubjection is alike in both theſe relations, can with no
colour of reaſon be aſſerted; for it is abſurd to ſay, that Subjects
who ſet up the Magiſtrate, who limite his power, who
binde him by Covenants, and deſigne their owne good in
ſetting him up, &amp; do it in a voluntary way, are the ſame way
ſubject to their Princes,; as ſlaves, who are as other goods for
the profite of the Maſter, &amp; are, both in bodyes &amp; goods,
otherwiſe ſubject unto their Maſters, and that in a manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their will, either being ſold, or redeeming their life in
war, by giving themſelves up as ſlaves. 2. As there are various
Kindes of Superiours, ſo the relation varyeth, and is more
or leſſe cloſſe and efficacious, and the ſubjection muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
vary: I am not alike ſubjected to every one that
is over me, as I am ſubjected to my Soveraigne; nor
am I ſo ſubjected to him, as to my natural parents, or as a
wife is to her husband. 3. Though the Subejcts in ſome
ſenſe call themſelves ſervants to the ſoveraigne, (which yet
is often a tearme of civil reſpect; for <hi>Naaman</hi> called himſelf
<hi>Elisha's</hi> ſervant 2 <hi>King. 5: 15.</hi> and <hi>Obadiah</hi> ſaid the like to <hi>Elijah
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:105606:157"/>
1 King. 18: 9.</hi>) yet if they be not ſlaves; they muſt have more
allowance then ſlaves have, and ſo have more povver to reſiſt
unjuſt violence then they had. 4. If the Magiſtrate be the
peoples ſervant in relation of the meanes to the end; then
the relation betvvixt him and his Subejcts, is not ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
as is betvvixt Parents and Children, or betwixt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and Slaves; for the end of theſe relations, is not the
good of Children and ſlaves: And next, Subejcts muſt
have more power allowed them to ſee to the end, which is
their owne good, and to ſee that the means prove not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
of the end: and if the meanes prove no meanes,
the relation falleth, and he is no more a ſervant ſeeking their
good, but a Tyrant ſeeking his owne. 5. It is ſooner ſaid
then proved, that the People who ſet up the King are not
ſuperiour to the King: He should have aſwered <hi>Lex Rex</hi>
as to this: but it is like, he thinketh that his ſaying thus, is
more firme and irrefragable, then <hi>Lex Rex</hi> reaſonings to the
contrary: But I know not who will think ſo with him.
6. There is a great difference betwixt Angels ſerving the
ſaints, or rather ſerving God that way; and the King ſerving his
People: The ſaints have no hand in ſetting up angels to
protect them, as People have in ſetting up Magiſtrates. 7.
If they be ſervants as miniſters are, then, though in regard
of their official power they should not be ſubject to the
People, yet they may be reſiſted, as was shevved above: and
this is all vve preſſe for.</p>
               <p>5. There is a great difference betwixt ſuffering of Buffett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and correction, and ſuch like petty, private, perſonal
injuries, at the hands of Parents or Maſters; and the ſuffering
of loſſe of Liberties, Life, Lands, Religion, and ſuch
like, which tend to the ruine of the Commonwealth. To
this our <hi>Surveyer</hi> replyeth two things <hi>Pag. 32. as, 1. [The grounds
that ſuch men goe upon for private perſones violent reſiſting the Magiſtrate
(viz. the abuſe of his power) if they hold good, will as effectually
evince a non-ſubjection &amp; violent reſiſtence to Parents and Maſters in
abuſing their power.] Anſw.</hi> We ſay not that the Magiſtrate's
abuſe of his power is the only ground of reſiſtance; this should
have been shewed, and not ſaid barely, as it is here: But
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:105606:157"/>
when other things give ground of reſiſtence, yea and a
call thereunto, it is enough for us to ſay, that we reſiſt not
the power, but the abuſe of the power. 2. Though we
walked upon no other ground (which is falſe, as is cleare
from what is ſaid) yet his conſequence would be null, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he should affirme, which yet he dar not, That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
is under no other obligation to his Subjects, then
Parents are to their Children, and Maſters to their Slaves.
But what ſayes he? 2. [<hi>as death is not, ſo no punishment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
inflicted is eligible, where lawfully it can be warded off. But this
is the ſtate of the queſtion, if private perſones may lawfully violente the
Magiſtrate abuſeing his power: if in greater evils unjuſtly inflicted,
there is alwayes a liberty for inferiours violently to re-offend the powers
above them? Why not in leſſe evils too? Theſe gradual differences of
inflicted evils cannot make ſuch variation, in the poynt of duty,
ſeing the grounds hold equally ſtrong; if a man may reſiſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
for abuſe of his power, he may do ſo alſo againſt his father,
or Maſter on the ſame grounds, and if he may not ſo deal with them,
he may not deal ſo with the Magiſtrate neither] Anſw.</hi> It is true
that no punishment unjuſtly inflicted is eligible where law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
it can be warded off; but there may be more ſaid, for
the lawfulneſſe of warding off of death, then for warding off a
little blow. And 2 there may be more ſaid for warding off a
blow, then for warding it off by violenting the Superiour:
We ſpeak not of violenting the Superiour, but of warding
off the blae and bitter blowes, and ſuch other iujuries equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to death, done by his bloody emiſſaries, which may be
done without violent re-offending the powers above us.
3. When the injuries are great and grievous, and not eaſily
reparable, God and nature will allow, a warding of theſe
off, even by violence, when they can no otherwiſe be shuned.
Though a Childe may willingly Subject himſelf unto corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
though he do not really deſerve it, yet if his father
in ſtead of taking a whipe to chaſtiſe him, shall take a ſword
to hew him in pieces, or a knife to cut his throate. I ſuppoſe
in that caſe, the Childe may refuſe hearty ſubjection, and
either flee away, or if he cannot, ſave his life ſo long as he
can, either by calling for help, or with his owne hands if he
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:105606:158"/>
be able. And here he will grant, I ſuppoſe, that the gradual
difference of inflicted evills will make a variation in poynt
of this duty of reſiſtence. So in ſmaller injuries ſubjects may
be patient, and beare a little, for redeeming more, and
rather ſuffer the loſſe of little then hazard all, but when it
comes to an extremity; and Life, and Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and all that is dear to them as men as Chriſtians, is
in eminent and unavoydable hazard, then they may lawfully
ſtand to their defence, and reſiſt that abuſed power, not
meerly, nor only, nor formally, becauſe it is an abuſed pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but becauſe it is ſo abuſed, as that it deſtroyeth the ends
for which it was appoynted, and deſtroyeth all that is deare
unto them, and which they are bound to defend, upon any
hazard, if it be in their power; becauſe the loſſe is irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Though a gradual difference of evil inflicted do not
vary the ſpece of evil inflicted, the leaſt evil inflicted being
an evil eſſentially as well as the greateſt, to him who doth
inflict it; yet it may alter the ground of reſiſtence, not only
of ſuperiours, but alſo of equals and inferiours; for I may
beare with a ſmal injury at the hand of mine equal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour,
and not ſo much as ſeek reparation by law, when
I ſee that either the matter is not <hi>tanti,</hi> or that I shall expend
more in regaining my owne, then all my loſſe was: But
will he think that upon this ground it will follow, that if
mine equal or inferiour shall endeavour by fraud or falsehood,
to take from me my whole eſtate, I may not then ſue him at
the law, and vindicate my owne? Sure it were irrational
to ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>6. This will ſpeak as much againſt reſiſting of the inferiour
powers, as reſiſting of the Supreame: For they are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical
Fathers too, and ſuperiours over us, as well as
the Soveraigne, and the compariſon will hold in the one,
as well as in the other. Now if he think that the concurrence
or command of the Inferiour Magiſtrate, will not warrand
Subjects to reſiſt the Supreame; He muſt alſo ſay that the
concurrence or command of the Superiour, will not warrand
a reſiſting of the inferour; and ſo it shall be alike unlawful to
reſiſt any, if this compariſon hold, according to his urging
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:105606:158"/>
of it: For it was not lawful for the Childe to reſiſt the
Mother, but to ſuffer patiently her chaſtiſment, though
the Father should have been indulgent, and would have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
the Childe, or extenuated and excuſed the Childe as
not guilty of the fault alledged. So was the childe alſo oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be Subject unto his Father's corrections, though the
indulgent Mother would have taken the Childe's part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Father.</p>
               <p>7. The Servant was to bear buffets patiently 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. &amp; after
Chriſt's example was not to buffet againe; for <hi>Chriſt being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled
did not revile againe,</hi> and ſo the place ſpeaketh not againſt
reſiſtence for ſelf defence; but againſt buffeting againe, which
is no formal warding off of blowes, &amp; floweth not from ſinleſſe
nature ſeeking to defend it ſelf; but rather from a ſpirit of
revenge: So that, for all this, the Servant might have warded
off blowes, and ſaved his head with his armes, when his
cruel Maſter was ſeeking to break his head.</p>
               <p>8. It is one thing to ſpeak of what a Childe may do, who
hath no power to reſiſt his father, or what a ſlave is called to,
who hath no power or probable way to reſiſt his Maſter;
&amp; another thing to ſpeak of what a Nation, or a Conſiderable
part of a Nation may do againſt a few, whoſe unjuſt violence
they are able to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>9. The maine ground of this argument is a miſtake; for
he thinketh that patient ſuffering is inconſiſtent with reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But <hi>Lex Rex quaeſt 30. Pag. 281.</hi> hath shewed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencie,
(but it is his beſt, according to his uſual cuſtome,
to paſſe over ſuch things as he cannot anſwere.) So that the
conſequence is a meer nullity: for becauſe servants are to ſuffer
unjuſt buffetings, at the hands of their wicked Maſters, It
will not follow, That therefore they are obliged in conſcience
to non-reſiſtence: for as <hi>Lex Rex</hi> sheweth, The Church of
God was to <hi>bear</hi> with all patience <hi>the indignation of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
she had ſinned Micah. 9 10, 11, 12.</hi> and yet she was not
obliged to non-reſiſtence; but rather obliged to fight againſt
here Enemies. <hi>David</hi> beare patiently the wrong that this Sone
<hi>abſolome</hi> did to him, as is clear by 2 <hi>Sam. 25: ver. 25, 26. and
Cap. 16: v. 10, 11, 12. Pſal. 3: v 1, 2, 3.</hi> Yet did he lawfully
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:105606:159"/>
reſiſt him and his forces. So we are to beare ſickneſſe, paines,
and torments, which the Lord ſendeth on us; and yet very
lawfully may we labour and uſe all lawful meanes to be freed
from them.</p>
               <p>10. Chriſt's Rule to us; <hi>Math.</hi> 5: <hi>v.</hi> 39. is, <hi>that whoſoever
shall ſmile us on the right cheek, we should turne the other to him alſo,</hi>
and what more patient ſubjection can be required by a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
of his ſubjects? and yet this will not make it altogether
unlawful for private perſones to defend themſelves from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
violence offered them, by their equalls or inferiours.
No more will it follow from that patient ſubjection that we
owe to Rulers, that in no caſe we may reſiſt their unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and defend ourſelves there from.</p>
               <p>11. I hope notwithſtanding of any thing, that is ſpoken
in theſe paſſages, he will allow children when wronged by
their Parents, and Servants when iniured by their Maſters,
liberty to complaine to Magiſtrates who are over both, and
yet this is the uſeing of a legal reſiſtence, and as much oppoſite
(if at all oppoſite) to the patience and ſubjection injoyned,
as is violent reſiſtence, when that legal reſiſtence cannot be
had; as ſuppoſe, when Father and Son, and Maſter and
Servant are living in no Community, where there are Rulers
and Judges over them: and if this be lawful in this caſe (as
it cannot be denyed) then muſt it alſo be lawfull for ſubjects
to repel the unjuſt violence of Princes with violence: Becauſe
there is no political Rulers over both <hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>People.</hi> But People
muſt make uſe of that <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>tribunal</hi> of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath allowed, and by innocent violence, repel the unjuſt
violence of Princes, ſeing there is no other remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His ſecond ground out of Scripture is taken from</hi> Mat. 5:
ver. 10. 1 Pet. 4: ver. 14, 17. <hi>and the like places;</hi> [Where there
is a commended ſuffering for Chriſt and Righteouſneſſe ſake, and
conſequently a ſort of commanded ſuffering: a ſuffering contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from ſuffering for evil doing, even a cleanly ſubmiſſion to ſuffer
in and for well doing (when God in his providence permits Rulers ſo
to abuſe their power) which paſſive ſubjection or ſubmiſsion is not
grounded on the Rulers abuſe of his power through his corrupt will,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:105606:159"/>
but upon the peculiar command of God enjoyning ſubmiſſion in ſuch
caſes.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Theſe &amp; the like ſpeak nothing at all to the poynt:
For, as we may be perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls,
Yea and by inferiours; ſo we are to ſuffer that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
when God in his providence calleth us thereunto,
with patience and humble ſubmiſſion of Spirit. But is this a
good argument, to prove that it is unlawful for us to reſiſt
and repel injuries offered to us by equals or inferiours? And
if it will not prove it unlawful for us to reſiſt our equals or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours,
neither can it hence be inferred that it is unlawful
for us to reſiſt Superiours. 2. By this ſame reaſon the King
if a Chriſtian, is bound to ſubmit as well to his ſubjects, as
they to him; at leaſt, he is not bound to reſiſt a foraigne King
invading him for Religion, which I know not who will
grant. 3. That God alwayes calleth us to ſubmiſſio nor
paſſive ſubjection, when in his providence he permits Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to abuſe their power, is the thing in queſtion, and this
argument doth no way prove it. 4. We grant, that God
calleth us to ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake, patiently and
Chriſtianly, whether at the hands of Superiours, or at the
hands of equals or inferiours, when in his providence we
are ſo ſtated, as that we muſt either ſuffer, or ſin by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
a teſtimony for his truth and cauſe: But that, when
a door is opened for eshewing ſuffering, and God in his
providence ſeemeth not to call us thereunto (as he never
doth, when he giveth a faire way of preventing it) we are
called to ſuffer, and bound to chooſe ſuffering at the hands
of any, is denyed and not proved by him.</p>
               <p>But furder he tells us. That [<hi>Lex Rexquaest. 30. Leers at
paſſive obedience, as a chymaera, as a dreame, and as involving a
contradiction: And he thinks</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>he speaketh acutely,
in ſaying, God never gave to any a command to ſuffer for well doing,
nor at all to ſuffer (ſuffering depending on the free will of another
without us, and not on our owne free will; and ſo not falling under
any command of God to us,) but he reaſones</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>very
ſophistically, inferring that becauſe meer ſuffering, which neceſſarily
depends on the action of another, is not commanded to us, therefore
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:105606:160"/>
ſubjection to ſuffering, or paſſive obedience is not commanded, when the
Magistrate inflicts ſuffering.] Anſ.</hi> The worthy Author of <hi>Lex Rex</hi>
was there anſwering the objection of <hi>Royalists,</hi> who alledged
ſuch places, where, they ſuppoſed, we were commanded to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and among ſeveral aſſertions, which he laid down to
ſolve this, he had this aſſertions, That ſuffering formally as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
nor non-reſiſting paſſive, could fall under no formal
law of God, except in two caſes, 1. in the poynt of Chriſt's
paſſive obedience, and 2. indirectly and comparatively,
when it cometh to the election of the witneſſe of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will ſuffer or deny the truth of Chriſt, ſo that this
alternative muſt be unavoydable, otherwayes (<hi>ſayd he</hi>) no
man is to expect the reward of a witneſſe of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> who having
a lavvful poſſible meane of eshevving ſuffering, doth yet
caſt himſelf into ſuffering needleſly. Novv vvhat a meer
vvrangler muſt this be, vvho ſayeth, that that vvorthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
did reaſon ſophiſtically in ſo inferring, vvhileas he is
only anſvvering the objection: and hereby he doth it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently;
for if it be evinced (as he hath unanſvverably evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it) that paſſive obedience or paſſive ſubjection is not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi>
commanded; then their arguments proving this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
ſubjection to be our duty, are null; and ſo they cannot
hence inferre, that non-ſubjection paſſive is forbidden. And
vvhat have they gained then out of theſe places? Can this
<hi>Surveyer</hi> affirme that paſſion as paſſion, or ſuffering formally
as ſuch, cometh under a command of God? no, he dar not,
but muſt vvith <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſay, that <hi>it is impoſſible that meer paſſion,
(as to be whipped, to be hanged, to be beheaded should be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of an affirmative or perceptive command of God.</hi> Why
then is he offended vvith <hi>Lex Rex?</hi> Why jeers he at that
worthy Author, ſaying <hi>he thinks he ſpeaks acutely?</hi> is this
to anſwere <hi>Lex Rex</hi> to jeer at what is there ſayd, aud then
be forced (or ſpeak non-ſenſe) to affirme the ſame thing
that is there aſſerted? But ſayes he, <hi>Pag. 34. [Subjection
to the paſſion may fall under a command, and this is called paſſive
obedience, which implyes more then meer paſſion or ſuffering; even
a diſpoſition and motion of the heart to lye under that lot with an eye
to God, whoſe ordinance is uſed upon the ſufferer; only it is called
paſſive obedience, becauſe as to the preciſe ſuffering the punishment,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:105606:160"/>
there is no external action done, enjoyned by the law or command
of the Magistrate, as there is in active obedience, although there
be ſome diſpoſitive or preparatory actions in order to ſuffering (not
inferring a direct preparation to a mans owne ſuffering) which he may
and ought to do, as going to a gallowes on his owne feet, or up a ladder,
or laying down his head on a block, that it may be ſtrucken off.]
Anſw.</hi> That ſubjection to the paſſion might fall under a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
was granted in ſome caſes by <hi>Lex Rex,</hi> as was ſaid;
but that it falleth under a command when God openeth a faire
door to eshew it, he is not able to prove. 2. Hovv proper
it is to call that ſubmiſſion paſſive obedience, is not worth
the while to enquire, <hi>Lex Rex</hi> tolde us (and he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it) that it was <hi>repugnantia in adjecto</hi> to call it obedience,
ſince obedience properly ſo called, is relative eſſentially to
a law: Now there is no moral law enjoyning this, for no
man is formally a ſinner againſt a moral law, becauſe he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
not the evil of punishment, nor are theſe in hell for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
obedient to a law, becauſe they ſuffer againſt their will.
3. As for that diſpoſition and motion of heart, which he
ſpeaketh of, that is nothing but what <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſaid <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>modus rei</hi> the manner of ſuffering, was under a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and indeed obedience to that was and is obedience to
a moral law. But the <hi>Surveyer</hi> called it an errour to ſay that
only the <hi>modus rei</hi> is commanded or forbidden, and why?
becauſe <hi>(ſayes he,) That ſame command that forbids reſiſting the
Magiſtrate in doing his duty, enjoyneth ſubmiſſion and paſsive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him, although we were able by force to deliver ourſelves,
out of his hand.] Anſw.</hi> Then by him, there is no medium
betwixt this ſubmiſſion to paſſive obedience, and poſitive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence:
And ſo, either he muſt ſay that flying is reſiſting,
(which yet <hi>Pag. 41.</hi> he calleth a monſter of a Stoical para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox)
or he muſt ſay, that flying and refuſeing to ſubmit to
this paſſive obedience, is a ſubmitting to this paſſive obedience:
And whether this will not rather look like a monſter of
a Stöical paradox, let all men of common ſenſe judge.
2. Is the guilty perſon bound by any moral law, to ſuffer
death or whipping, if the Magiſtrate will not execute the
ſentence upon him? Or is every one in that caſe bound to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:105606:161"/>
deliver up himſelf to the Magiſtrate, &amp; accuſe himſelf, and
purſue the accuſation until the ſentence be executed? If
not, how doth this paſſive ſubmiſſion fall under a moral
law? If he ſay, when he is apprehended or in hands,
he is not to reſiſt, but ſubmit to the ſtroke. <hi>Anſwer. 1.</hi>
Will not any ſee, that then the <hi>res ipſa</hi> is not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but the <hi>modus rei,</hi> and ſo <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſaid true, <hi>Pag. 318.</hi>
That paſſive obedience to wicked Rulers was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<hi>Rom. 13.</hi> only in the manner, and upon ſuppoſition
that we muſt be ſubject to them, and muſt ſuffer againſt our
wills all the evil of punishment that they can inflict, Then
we muſt ſuffer patiently. But 2. Though we be bound to
ſubmit to the Magiſtrate doing his duty, and inflicting juſt
puniſhment, will it follow that therefore we are bound to
ſubmit to the Magiſtrate doing not his duty, but inflicting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
punishment? Or doth the ſame paſſive obedience to
powers punishing unjuſtly fall under the moral law? How
doth he prove either the conſequence or the conſequent?
[<hi>We aſſert</hi> (ſayes he Pag. 53.) <hi>That a private perſon though wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
afflicted by the lawful Magiſtrate proceeding according to law,
(let it be ſo that it is</hi> lex malè poſita <hi>or an evil law) is hound not only
to Chriſtian patience in ſuffering—but unto a ſubmiſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repelling of violence by violence; and that in conſcientious reſpect
to the ordinance of God, wherewith the lawful Magiſtrate is inveſted
(although abuſeing it in this particular) and with a tender regard to
the prevention of ſeditions and confuſions in humane ſocieties.] Anſ.</hi>
1. This is dictator-like to prove the concluſion, by aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; what a ridiculous fool is he to come with his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and yet give us nothing but the very thing controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Is not this a very hungry empty man, to beg (when
he cannot better do) the very thing in quaeſtion? 2. Then
it ſeemeth, he will grant that a privat perſon may reſiſt the
lawful Magiſtrate, when proceeding contrary to law;
where is then the conſcientious reſpect to the Ordinance of
God, wherewith the lawful Magiſtrate is inveſted; and
that tender regaird to prevent ſedition, &amp;c. which he talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of? Sure in the one caſe, the Ordinance is but abuſed,
as it is in the other. 3. Let me ask, if there were a juſt
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:105606:161"/>
judge ſitting, who would execute juſtice and judgement for
God, and were ſummoning him to anſwere for his perjury,
apoſtaſy, and other villannies which he is conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of, and ſome others are privie to, and could witneſſe
againſt him; would he compeare, or rather would he not
run from under the reach of juſtice, and ſecure himſelf? or
if apprehended, would he not labour an eſcape to ſave his
neck from the rope? If ſo (as all who know him will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryly
belveeve he would) where would then this ſubmiſſion
be which is due unto the Magiſtrate? And where would
his conſcientious reſpect to the Ordinance of God not abuſed,
but very rightly uſed in that particular, be? 4. If a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
abuſeing his power to the deſtruction of the Subjects,
should be reſiſted, what inconvenience would follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon?
[<hi>Seditions</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and confuſions would be unavoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
if every one, as he thinks himſelf wronged, shall be allowed to
uſe force upon the lawful Magiſtrate proceeding by law; the greatest
Malefactors being ready to juſtify themſelves, and to violate the juſteſt
Megiſtrates in their just proceedings.] Auſw.</hi> This is but the old
ſong chanted over and over againe to us, and may therefore
be diſmiſſed with a word: <hi>viz.</hi> That as the Magiſtrat's
abuſe of his power in a particular, will not make the power
it ſelf unlawful (as he will grant,) ſo nor will the abuſe of
this reſiſtence in a particular, make reſiſtence it ſelf unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
2. We plead not for reſiſtence by every one who thinketh
himſelf wronged, but for reſiſtence when the wrongs are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
notour, undenyable, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> grievous and intolerable, and
done to a whole land, to God's glory, to Chriſt's intereſt,
to a Covenant ſworne and ſubſcribed by all, to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
lawes of the land, to the compact betwixt King and
Subject, to Religion, Lawes, Libertyes, Lives, and all
which is dear to People. Theſe wrongs as they are no petty
injuries, ſo nor are they quaeſtionable or uncertane, but as
manifeſt as the ſun at the nonetide of the day. 3. What if
the Magiſtrate or his Emiſſaryes proceed not according to law?
And what if the law, which they pretend, be no
law <hi>de jure,</hi> or a law made <hi>a non habente poteſtatem</hi> (as shall be
manifeſt to be our caſe) should there no reſiſtence then be
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:105606:162"/>
uſed but a ſtupid ſubmiſſion, out of a pretended and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
regaird to the prevention of ſeditions and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?
4. Since he thinks that ſo much regaird is to be
had to the prevention of ſeditions and confuſions in ſocieties,
ſure he should think that as much regaird is to be had unto the
prevention of the utter ruine &amp; deſtruction of ſocieties. Now,
if magiſtrates abuſeing their power to the deſtruction of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietyes,
might not be reſiſted; hovv shall they be preſerved
from utter ruine, vvhich is much more carefully to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
then ſeditions and confuſions in ſocieties: And
ſince he thinks, vvithout ground, that our doctrine is ſo evil
and ſcandalous, and openeth a vvide gap for all vvicked ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
perſones to vvork confuſion in the Commonvvealth,
and to overthrovv the beſt and juſteſt Magiſtrates; vve have
juſt ground to think that his doctrine is not only evil
and ſcandalous, but moſt perverſe, vvicked and adhominable,
opening a vvide door to all tyranny, oppreſſion, cruelty; and
an encouraging of all vvicked Tyrants to deal vvith their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as ſo many Brutes or vvorſe, vvithout all fear of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
and to deſtroy utterly all Commonvvealths, or
make them meer priſon-houſes for ſlaves, &amp;c. And, if this
doctrine of his tend not more to libertiniſme, then ours, let

not ſay, that Chriſtianity deſtroyeth Magiſtracy, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empteth
Chriſtians from ſubjection unto Magiſtracy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates:
As ſome Hereticks then did, abuſeing their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
liberty, to deſtroy Magiſtracy; &amp; as Heathens objected
unto Chriſtians 'as <hi>Gerhard de Magiſt. Polit. n.</hi> 34. thinketh,
vvhich (as ſome think) vvas the occaſion of <hi>Paul's</hi> aſſerting the
ordinance of Magiſtracy. Nor 2. do vve ſay, That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavvful
for Chriſtians to be ſubjects unto Heathen Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
vvhich, becauſe Chriſtian Gentiles might have
drunk in from ſome jevves, particularly the <hi>Gaulonites,</hi> vvho
held it unlavvful to yeeld any ſubjection unto <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
or to ſtrangers, might have been the occaſion of <hi>Paul's</hi>
diſcourſe of this Ordinance. And therefore to confute theſe
miſtakes, The Apoſtle ſayes <hi>Let every
ſoul be ſubject unto higher powers,
&amp;c.</hi> that is, acknowledge even ſuch lavvful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
though they be heathens, and yee chriſtians, vvheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
jevves or gentiles, and think nor yourſelf exeemed
from the duty of ſubjects tovvards ſuch. So that this makes
nothing againſt us, and the ſubjection here required, upon this
account, is not the ſubjection novv in quaeſtion; for a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of open and notour tyranny, othervviſe unavoidable,
doth vvell conſiſt vvith this ſubjection, <hi>viz.</hi> an acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of Magiſtrats as lavvful <hi>powers</hi> ordained of God,
for the good of the Subjects.</p>
               <p>2. The vvord <hi>ſubjection</hi> being thus taken in a general
comprehenſive ſenſe, as containing in it all that duty which
is required of Subjects tovvard their Superiours, The oppoſite
tearme <hi>reſistence,</hi> or counter-orderedneſſe muſt alſo be taken
in a general comprehenſive ſenſe, as including all the contrary
evils. Now, as obedience is a ſpecial poynt of ſubjection
unto Superiours, So diſobedience is a ſpecial poynt of contra
ordinatneſſe. But, as an univerſal and unlimited obedience,
in all poynts, is not here required, ſo neither can an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
and unlimited ſubjection to ſuffering be here required: for
as it can not be proved, that every act of diſobedience is a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:105606:163"/>
reſiſtence here condemned; &amp; that every act of obedience, is
a part of the ſubjection here required; So nor can it be proved,
that every act of reſiſting or refuſeing paſſive obedience is
here condemned, and that every act of ſubmitting to paſſive
obedience is here commanded. But only that that obedience
is commanded, which is due to Magiſtrates; and that reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
vvhich is unlawful, &amp; is oppoſite unto that ſubjection
required, is prohibited. So that this place cannot prove that
all reſiſtence is unlawful; becauſe non-obedience is reſiſtence,
or a contraordinatneſſe; and yet all non-obedience is not here
prohibited. Againe, the <hi>ſubjection</hi> comprehends that honour
and reſpect, which is due unto Superiours, and which is
both inward in the heart, minde and thought, and outwardly
expreſſed in words, geſtures, carriage, &amp;c. So muſt the word
reſiſtence comprehend within it ſelf, all that is oppoſite there
unto. Now, as by this place, it cannot be evinced that it is
unlawful to reſiſt abuſed power, or perſons abuſeing their
power to tyranny and oppreſſion, in our thoughts, and by our
words: for then it should be unlawful to abhore, &amp; deteſt the
oppreſſion and tyranny of cruel tyrants; or for the Mesſengers
of the Lord to rebuke them for the ſame; or for People to pray
&amp; ſupplicat to God againſt them, which is utterly abſurd
and falſe: So nor can it be evinced by this place, that it is
unlavvful to reſiſt ſuch abuſeing their povver, by bodyly
force; for the text ſpeaketh no more againſt this, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the other; and yet the other is lavvful; and therefore
ſo may this be, for any thing that is here ſaid: The one is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
as vvel as the other, though not ſo great, but <hi>majus &amp;
minus non variant ſpeciem.</hi> And therefore, if this text to not
condemne all reſiſtence, it cannot be evinced that it condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the reſiſtence vveſpeak of.</p>
               <p>3. Not withſtanding of the Reſiſtence that here ſeemeth
to be prohibited; yet we know that the Senate not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<hi>Nero,</hi> but proceeded againſt him by way of open juſtice,
depoſed him, and condemned him for tyranny, adjudging
him to have his head faſtned to a forke &amp; ſo to be publickely
whipped to death, and then precipitated from a rock, but he
eſcaped &amp; killed himſelf (as hiſtorians ſay:) and in this fact
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:105606:163"/>
they are approved by learned politicians, and lawyers. See
<hi>Bod in de Repub. lib.</hi> 2: c. 5. So that either he muſt ſay that <hi>Nero</hi>
was not the higher power, who might not be reſiſted, but
that the Senate was above him; or that ſuch as juſtify the
Senate are in an errour, and ſo he muſt condemne them for
what they did, without any colour of reaſon.</p>
               <p>4, This text will no more plead againſt reſiſting of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
powers, then againſt reſiſting of inferiour Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:
For the text ſpeaks of all in any ſupereminency: It
ſpeaketh of <hi>powers</hi> in the plural number: ſee the <hi>dutch annot</hi> on
the place: &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> mentioneth <hi>inferiours</hi> as well as the <hi>Supreame.</hi>
Now will the <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſay, that in no caſe, it is lawful to reſiſt
even by force, the inferiour Magiſtrates? will he ſay that
we may not oppoſe them when abuſeing their power: And
if he grant that in ſome caſes, inferiour Magiſtrates may be
reſiſted, he muſt alſo grant that this text doth not forbid or
condemne all reſiſtence to he higher power; but only a
reſiſting of legal and lavvful commands, whether by diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
or by armes.</p>
               <p>5. Though we cannot ſay, that the Apoſtle is ſpeaking
here always of the ordinance of Magiſtracy in the abſtract,
ſo as altogether to exclude the perſons inveſted there with;
yet we think it hardly ſaife to ſay, that there is nothing here
to be underſtood of the abſtract office; as when he ſpeaketh
of the original and riſe of the office, and of the end and
proper native effect thereof, it is more proper to underſtand
that of the office <hi>in abſtracto,</hi> then of the <hi>Suppoſita</hi> ſo inveſted.
Next whatever is required here as due to the <hi>Suppoſita,</hi> it is
upon the account of the office, with which they are inveſted,
and in ſo far, aud no furder: And therefore though the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and ordinance cannot be reſiſted, yet the perſon who is
there vvith inveſted, may be reſiſted, not as he is inveſted,
but as he abuſeth the povver, and ſo deveſteth himſelf: for as
he abuſeth the power he cannot be looked on as inveſted there
vvith, in ſo far; eſpecially if he abuſe it in the maine and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
ends for vvhich it vvas appoynted: for then he is <hi>de jure</hi>
and upon the matter utterly deveſted thereof. Furder what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſubjection is due to the perſon, it is upon the account of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:105606:164"/>
the office, which he beareth; and no more ſubjection is due
to him upon that account, then is due unto the office it ſelf,
or to the civil legal authority which is imported by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
word (if ſo much, ſeing, <hi>a quo quidquam eſt tale, id ipſum
eſt magis tale.</hi>) Therefore the ſubjection vvhich is not due
to the office, cannot be due to him: Novv ſubjection is due
to the office as it is the office: And an abuſed office is not
the office, <hi>Ergo</hi> that ſubjection is not required to the abuſed
office which is due to the office. <hi>Ergo</hi> nor is it due to him vvho
abuſeth the office. The office vvill not vvarrand a ſubjection
to that vvhich is not the office; and an abuſed office is not the
office.</p>
               <p>6. The ſubmiſſion or ſubjection here required, is not unto
Tyranny, or Tyrants vvho abuſe their povver unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Commonvvealth, and to the ruine of the
Subjects as ſuch: For, ſuch are not the ordinance of God
(nor ordained under God, but oppoſite to God) unto which
alone, the ſubjection here ſpoken of, is due. <hi>Gerhard de magiſt.
polit. n.</hi> 54. Tels us that the apoſtle doth acurately diſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish
betvvixt the povver, and the abuſe of the povver; and
ſayes the povver itſelf, and not the abuſe of the povver is
of God; and alſo, that he diſtinguisheth betvvixt the office it
ſelf, &amp; the perſon in office: the perſon oft by fraud, violence &amp;
falshood and other evil meanes, by cruelty &amp; tyranny, both
aſſumeth the place, &amp; exerceth the office, &amp; in this reſpect
is not of God <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8: 4. 2. The reſiſting of Tyrants cannot
procure damnation unto the reſiſters, becauſe they have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
no command. 3. Such are not a terrour to evil works,
therefore ſubmiſſion is not due unto them as ſuch. 4. Such
will not give praiſe to ſuch as do vvell; but that is the power
vvhich is not to be reſiſted, of vvhich vve are to be afrayed,
and of which vve shall have praiſe vvhile vve do that vvhich
is good. 5. He is not to be reſiſted vvho is the Miniſter
of God for good. But Tyrants, <hi>Neroes</hi> who vvished <hi>that all
the Romans had but one Neck, that he might cut them all off at one
blow,</hi> are not miniſters of God, in ſo far, but miniſters of
Satan. 6. Such are not the revenger vvho beareth the ſword
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:105606:164"/>
to execute wrath upon him that doth evil, but rather imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the ſvvord to deſtroy ſuch as do vvell, to ſubvert Lawes,
Religion and all that is good: Therefore it is not of ſuch as
ſuch, that the text ſpeaketh, when it ſayes we muſt yeeld
Submiſſion. 7. As it is not upon the account of their
playing the tyrant, aud overturning Religion, Liberties
&amp; Subjects, that tribute is to be payed to them, ſo nor is
ſubjection to be yeelded unto them, in all poynts, but as
they are God's Miniſters attending continually upon this
very thing, to ſuppreſſe wickedneſſe, &amp; promove godlineſſe.
8. Nor is it upon any other account, that fear, honour, and
cuſtome is to be given unto them. And ſo the text conſiders
theſe povvers, to vvhom ſubjeciton is due, not as Tyrants, or
as abuſeing their power to the ruine and deſtruction of all;
but as carrying themſelves as the Miniſters of God, for the
ends appoynted, aud not as the Miniſters and ordinance of
Satan. Therefore not vvithſtanding of any thing in this
Text, ſuch may be reſiſted, or rather their Tyranny may be
reſiſted, which is not, nor never vvas ordained of God,
and vvhich is diretly oppoſite unto, and no part of that
povver ordained of God. And though <hi>Nero</hi> and ſome others
vvere real Tyrants, yet neither doth the text name him, nor
doth it preſſe ſubjection to tyranny in any, for leſſe to his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;
but only ſubjection to the powers that are of God, &amp;
ordained of him, of which there might have been ſome vvho
were not Tyrants, even when <hi>Nero</hi> was playing the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
And it is as rational to underſtand the text of thoſe,
as of <hi>Nero</hi> or ſuch like. However vve finde ſubjection is
preſſed to the povver vvhich is ordained of God, and that is
not the power as it is abuſed. From all which it is cleare, that
it is not the <hi>ſuppoſita,</hi> but <hi>ſuppoſita</hi> as ſuch, which are not to be
reſiſted, or ſuch as carry in a due ſubordination unto God, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Apoſtles arguments preſſe only ſubjection unto ſuch,
and not unto Tyrants, who are a terrour to good works, and
a praiſe to ſuch as do evil and not the miniſters of God, nor
revengers to execute wrath upon ſuch as do evil, but rather on
ſuch as do good neither do they attend upon this thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and are ſo far from being the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:105606:165"/>
of God, that they are reſiſters Themſelves of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
by making lawes contrary to God's lavv, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
ſuch as obſerve God's lavv. It cannot therefore be
more ſinful to reſiſt ſuch, then to reſiſt a deputy perſecuting
ſuch as keep the King's lavves, and making lavves of his owne
directly contrarie to the King's lavves; for he is the Rebel and
the reſiſter of God's ordinance, and not they vvho are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to their Soveraigne.</p>
               <p>To this he maketh ſome reply <hi>Pag.</hi> 37. and [<hi>(ſayes) It
hath been often granted, and ſtill is, that no man or Magiſtrate on
earth, hath a moral power, commiſſion or command from God to do
evil, or to afflict any unjuſtly,</hi> 2. <hi>The queſtion is not concerning
the Magiſtrat's duty, but anent the Subject's duty, in caſe through
the permiſſion of divine providence, the Magiſtrate abuſe his place and
power, in unjuſt afflicting the innocent; whether the private Subject
may uſe violence againſt, or upon the Magiſtrate, or should rather
ſubmit to ſuffering,</hi> (though unjuſtly) <hi>not for reverence to the
abuſe of the power, but in reverence to God, whoſe ordinance the power</hi>
(which he abuſeth) <hi>is] Anſw.</hi> 1. If Magiſtrates have no
moral power, commiſſion, or command to do evil, The
reſiſting of that evil is no reſiſting of any moral power from,
or commiſſion given by God; as, if they have no power to
command evil or ſin, reſiſting of that command by non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
is no reſiſting of their power or commiſſion.
2. Though the queſtion should not be concerning the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate's
duty, yet we are to enquire, what that power is,
againſt which, Subjects may uſe no violence. 3. If Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
be bound not to uſe violence, but rather ſubmit to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
when the power is abuſed, not for reverence to the
abuſe of the power, but in reverence to God, whoſe power
it is: Why shall they not alſo be bound, rather to yeeld
obedience to, then to reſiſt by non-obedience, unlavvful
commands, though not for reverence to the abuſe of the
power, yet in reverence to God, whoſe ordinance the power
which is abuſed, is; as he ſayes? Sure the text here maketh
no difference, and if there be any difference he muſt prove it
from ſome other text, which we have not yet ſeen, nor expect
to ſee in haſte. 4. We have shewed already, that, he ſayes
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:105606:165"/>
without ground, that the abuſed power is of God, or his
ordinance. But there after, ſayes he, [<hi>And although the ſpirit</hi>
of <hi>God in deſcribing the Magiſtrate ſayes,</hi> he is the miniſter of
God &amp;c. <hi>It is not meant that that is the formal reaſon of ſubjection
to him, (in the full latitude of ſubjection) nor that the Magiſtrates
then exiſting and in being, to whom the people are commanded to be
ſubject, and forbidden to reſiſt, were ſuch</hi> de facto <hi>in all
their actings—but what the Magiſtrate is</hi> ex officio, <hi>and what he
should be</hi> de jure.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He ſeemeth to diſtinguish here
betwixt a ſubjection in it's full latitude, and a ſubjection not in
it's full latitude; but how doth he explaine this diſtinction,
that we may know what to make of it? He ſeemeth alſo to
grant that ſome ſubjection, though not ſubjection in its full
latitude, hath that deſcription of the power, for it's <hi>formalis
ratio,</hi> formal reaſon: But what can his meaning be, ſeing the
text maketh no difference? Is this his meaning, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
active, or active obedience hath that for it's formal
reaſon, ſo that the ſubject is to obey no power, but that which
is for a praiſe of the good, and a terrour to the evil &amp;c. But
ſubjection paſſive or paſſive obedience goeth upon another
ground, and muſt be yeelded to a Magiſtrate even when he is
not a miniſter of God for good? If this be his meaning;
it is but a shameful begging of the queſtion: and if he grant,
that any ſubjection is due to the Magiſtrate, only as he is a
miniſter of God, we are gainers; for he can never prove
the other from this text; and ſubjection here is conſidered
&amp; preſſed in its full latitude; and theſe are laid dovvne as the
grounds thereof. This vve may ſaifly averre, until he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the contrare, which we deſpaire to ſee done; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
ſeing the text fully cleareth the ſame: For as
ſubjection in its full latitude is preſſed, ſo all the Apoſtle's
arguments, &amp; motives, ſpeak to it in its full latitude: <hi>There is
no power but from God,</hi> preſſeth whole ſubjection; becauſe the
whole power is from God, &amp; not a part of it alone: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt ſpeak to all the relative parts of ſubjection. So the
other argument. <hi>v.</hi> 3; taken from the end of Magiſtracy,
ſpeaketh to the whole of ſubmiſſion in its full latitude: &amp; alſo
the other argument take from the nature of his office: and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:105606:166"/>
ſo the reſt. So that all the motives or grounds of ſubjection,
which are here made uſe of, ſpeak to all the parts of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
And therefore if they be the formal reaſon of one
part thereof, they muſt be the formal reaſon of the whole.
2. We do not ſay, that all the Magiſtrates then exiſting
were <hi>de facto</hi> ſuch as they were bound to be <hi>de jure</hi> (nor can
we ſay that they were all like <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Caligula</hi>) nor dar he ſay
that ſubjection in its full latitude, as comprehending as well
active as paſſive obedience, commonly ſo called, was to be
given to <hi>Nero</hi> and his like, or was here commanded to be
given: and what hath he then gained? But it is like all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
he taketh <hi>ſubjection</hi> for paſſive obedience. But 1. can
that be ſubjection in its full latitude? 2. Was that the maine
thing controverted then? 3. Doth the motives ſpeak to
that alone? 4. How will he prove that paſſive obedience is
here ſpoken to at all; ſince all the particulars mentioned are
actions, and dutyes of action? What ſayes he further?
<hi>Pag.</hi> 32. [The Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>the perſon inveſted with
power, calling him</hi> the Miniſter of God for good, no ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to good works, but to evil, a praiſer of good, &amp;c.
<hi>shews only what a Magiſtrate should be</hi> ex officio <hi>and is</hi> de jure; <hi>but
layes not this as the ground of ſubjection and non-reſiſtence to him
but this, that he is a ſuperiour power ordained of God: if he abuſe his
place, he is to anſwere to God for it, but the abuſe of the power in a
particular, doth not nullify the power, or make it no power—he
abides inveſted with authority—ſubjection of one ſort or another
is due to him, becauſe he is</hi> in officio, <hi>not becauſe he abuſeth his
office.] Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> giveth us here a new Analyſis of
the text, that no commentator hath hither to thought upon:
no motive, according to him, is here made uſe of, except
one, and yet none can reade the place, but they will finde
it otherwayes: Sure the cauſal <hi>for, ver.</hi> 3, <hi>and</hi> 4. is as clear a
ground of a motive as the <hi>for v.</hi> 1, 2. By his way all the reſt
of the arguments uſed <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. have no influence on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and non-reſiſtence preſſed; and yet the text giveth
this reaſon why ſuch as reſiſt the power receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
damnation <hi>viz. for Rulers are not a terrour to good works
but to the evil, &amp;c.</hi> and this, with what followeth hath no

ſmall force to preſſe ſubmiſſion, and non-reſiſtence. 3. It
is true if he abuſe his place, he muſt anſwere to God for it,
but that will no more prove that paſſive ſubjection, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
(as he calleth it) is alwayes due to him, then it will
prove that active obedience is alwayes due unto him. 4. We
grant that the abuſe of the power in a particular doth not nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
the power; Yet, when the abuſe is ſuch, as deſtroyes
the maine ends of the power, ſure if it be not wholly, it is
in a great part, nullified <hi>de lure.</hi> But whether the power
be nullified or not wholly, it may be reſiſted in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
when it is palpably abuſed: For then the power
which is of God, is not reſiſted: But only the abuſe of the
power, or that which is not the power ordained of God.
5. Subjection, it is true, of one ſort or another is due to him
becauſe he is <hi>in officio,</hi> and therefore ſo long as he is <hi>in officio,</hi>
he is to be acknowledge to be <hi>in officio,</hi> and to be obeyed in
things lawful: Honour, reverence, tribute, and cuſtome is
due to him, and, in matters of smaller moment, his penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
are to be endured, when there is no faire way to shun
them: But hence it will not follovv, that he muſt never
be reſiſted, even when he intends nothing but the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Libertyes and Religion; and overturneth the ends
of government, and croſſeth the maine and principal ends of
his office and power. Then he tells us <hi>ibid. [That among
many things wrong</hi> Lex Rex <hi>hath that true word</hi> Pag. 325. We
are to ſuffer evil of punishment of Tyrants, ſome other way,

ſuffer ill of punishment of Tyrants,</hi> ex Hypotheſi <hi>that they inflict

that makes for him? Sayeth <hi>Lex Rex</hi> that vve are to ſuffer
abſolutely all the evil of punishment, vvhich they vvould
inflict upon us? No ſuch thing ſayeth he. 3. If he ſeek
no more then vvhat <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſayeth here, vve are agreed;
but ſure he muſt then recal vvhat he hath formerly ſaid. 4.
Ay, but ſayeth he, this is all we require, to ſuffer evil of
the Magiſtrate, without violating his perſon, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his paternal authority: But 1. there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt ſuffering evil indefinitly and abſolutely,
and ſuffering evil <hi>ex Hypotheſi</hi> that it be inflicted: <hi>Lex Rex</hi>
ſaid this laſt, and not the former. 2. We may refuſe
to ſuffer evil of the Magiſtrate without violating his perſon:
every reſiſtance of unjuſt violence offered by Magiſtrates,
is not a violating of his perſon, nor neceſſarily accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
therewith; for the violence reſiſted, may be, and oft
is, committed by his Emiſſaries. 3. Though we are
bound to ſuffer (<hi>ex Hypotheſi</hi> that we do ſuffer) of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
upon the account of a paternal authority; yet it will
not follow that ſuch may not be reſiſted; for though the Son
is to ſuffer evils at the hands of his father, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
theſe, upon a paternal account; yet in ſome caſes,
the parent may be reſiſted, even by the Children, as is
ſaid. 4. No reſpective reverence to the ordinance doth
abſolutely bind us to ſuffer; for he will grant we may
flee; and here he ſayeth, we may by petitions move a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.
5. What if the evil be great and imminent, and
flying is not practicable, and not only there is no moving of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:105606:167"/>
forbearance by petitions, but very ſupplicating is diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under higheſt paine? Are we then humbly to ſuffer
that wrong, and ſo give up all our Necks, our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and our Religion to the luſt of a Tyrant, without any
reſiſtance? This is the quaeſtion, and we are waiting for
proof of it. 6. It is true when providence ſo ordereth
matters, that we cannot shun ſuffering, then we are to
regaird both God's providence, and reſpect that ordinance
which is abuſed, and ſo ſuffer ſuch evils of theſe, under
another notion, then of equals; and yet it will not hence
follow that we are abſolutely bound to ſuffer, and never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee in end, (which I would have the reader
ſpecially to notice) that he cannot urge this place againſt
us; but he muſt the ſame way hence enforce an abſolute
and univerſal obedience in all things whatſomever; and
alſo condemne other Royaliſts, and it may be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

               <p>Our <hi>Surveyer,</hi> cometh next to ſpeak of the example of
the primitive Chriſtians <hi>Pag.</hi> 38. &amp;c. and this he muſt
usher in with his ordinaire jeers, and ground leſſe reflections,
telling us that <hi>His opinion hath been the common ſenſe of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God's children before this fiery yron age; and that their ſober
examples, are of more weight and imitation, then the furious
practices of any of late, whereunto they have been inflamed by the
doctrines of popular paraſites and fierce demagoges, ſuch as this libeller
and his complices.</hi> But we have found, &amp; poſſibly may yet finde
further, how far he is miſtaken in this. And in deed in ſome
reſpect, this may be well called a fiery iron age; for I beleeve
ſince Chriſtianity was heard of, there was never ſo much
obduration of conſciences, ſo ſeared with hote irons, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammed
with rage againſt piety, fidelity, truth and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of heart, as is this day: It were well to be wished hat
this <hi>Surveyer</hi> and his complices would take either the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Prophets, or Apoſtles, or of theſe ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who lived neareſt to the light of the Apoſtles times,
and learne after their example to be more ſober, and conſtant
to his principles; ſure he will not finde in their practices, ſo
much perfidy, treachery, debauchedneſſe, hatred of piety,
perſecution of truth, and of the godly, as both he and his
complices are notoriouſly guilty of. Will he find among
them ſuch court paraſites, ſuch patrons of Apoſtafy, ſuch
authors of rebellion againſt God, ſuch Tyrannogogues, and
baſe flatterers, as he and his fraternity are? Will he finde in
all their writings ſuch bitter invectives and reproaches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the vvay of God, and his People, as may be ſeen in
theſe fevv sheets? Will he find ſuch commendations of
tyranny, oppreſſion, bondage and ſiavery, as if it vvere
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:105606:168"/>
nothing but the compound of juſtice and equity? But vve
come to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of his argument is this, <hi>That though by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of</hi> Tertul. Apolog. cap, 1. 33. and 37, and Cyprian. ad
Demetrianum. <hi>It is apparent, the Chriſtians wanted not might to
raiſe armes, againſt the Emperours; yet they never uſed any reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
either for the defence of themſelves, or for thereſcueing of their
oppreſsed brethren: Yea even after that in</hi> Conſtantin's <hi>dayes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
had been legally established, and the Chriſtians able enough to
defend themſelves, yet they uſed no violence agaiſt the Arrian and
Apostat Emperours who ſucceeded: Vnder the perſecuter</hi> Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian
<hi>there was the</hi> Theban Legion <hi>conſiſting of 6666. who yet
did not reſiſt him: and that the greateſt part of the army, under</hi> Julian
<hi>the Apoſtate, was Chriſtian, appears by their general outcry at the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of</hi> Jovinian, nos ſumus Chriſtiani, <hi>yet did they never oppoſe
him width force.</hi>]</p>
               <p>To which we anſwere.</p>
               <p>1. Though this <hi>Surveyer</hi> would appear tobe a man
of a very meek and Chriſtian diſpoſition, and cryeth out
of ſuch as are not of his opinion, as men of the fiery iron
age; yet, though we will not take upon us to judge his heart,
any may ſee part of his ſcope and intention, in mentioning
this argument, to be this, That we may be reaſoned into a
perfect ſtupidity and inſenſibility, and the King encouraged
to contrive and proſecute an Eleventh perſecutoion, on all
who profeſſe the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in his three dominions: For
what end elſe doth he adduce the example of the primitive
Chriſtians, who would not reſiſt the Emperours their bloody
Emiſſaries, ſent out to put into execution their cruel, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and barbarous Edicts, and to fulfil their luſt and deſire,
to extinguish the very Name of Chriſtians; but to ſing us a
ſleep, ſo that if the King will, the may command his bloody
and cruel Emiſſaries, to make amaſſacre on all that will no
abjure Chriſt and his intereſt, and cut all their throats in a
few dayes, without the leaſt fear of oppoſition? If this be
not his deſigne, let him tell me, what he would have
Chriſtians doing, in caſe ſuch a thing as this should be?
Would he have them reſiſting, or only holding up their
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:105606:169"/>
throats to the bloody executioners? If he would not have
any reſiſtence made, even in this caſe, then we ſee what his
principles drive at, and many may judge what a cruel bloody
heart he muſt have. If in this caſe he would allow a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
where is the force of his argument then? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is their example adduced? and what becometh of his
inſolent exclamations. <hi>O ſilly,</hi> foolish, and feminine Chriſtians
then! and o illuminated, maſculous and martial Spirits of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
now!</p>
               <p>2. He may remember what he tels us, when he is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the inſtances of reſiſtence adduced out of Scripture,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 67. <hi>That every example recorded in Scripture is not imitable:</hi>
And may not we ſay here, That every example recorded in
Church Hiſtory (far more fallible then Scripture, and far
leſſe to be regairded, ſeing what things are recorded in
Scripture, are writen for our inſtruction) is not imitable.
So that reduce this argument into forme, it will quickly evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish;
for it muſt ſtand upon this medium. That what ever the
primitive Chriſtians did, layeth a binding obligation upon
us; But this is falſe, as we shall undenyably evince; and
where is then the force of the argument? Though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
plauſible and taking, yet when preſſed it doth eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porat.</p>
               <p>3. If their practice be a binding precedent in this matter;
ſo muſt it be in all other things: and particularly it muſt be
unlawful for us now to reſiſt, in our owne defence, a raſeal mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
aſſaulting us with ſtones in the open ſtreets, againſt
all law and equity; for <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the ſame place tells us,
that they would not reſiſt the <hi>Inimicum vulgus</hi> the common
people, who was malitiouſly ſet againſt them, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
them with ſtones and fire, ſuo jure with out any kinde of
law or judicial procedoure: Yea <hi>Tertullian</hi> puts no difference
betwixt the <hi>Emperours</hi> and meane perſons, in poynt of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
Saying, <hi>Idem ſumus Imperatoribus, qui &amp; vicinis noſtris,
malè enim velle, malè facere, malè dicere, malè cogitare de quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
ex aequo vetamur. Quodcunque non licèt in Imperatorem, id nec

or deed againſt any whatſomever, then againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.

But who will ſay that in this, their practice or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to us a binding precedent? 2. Several of theſe Fathers
thought it unlawful to kill in their owne defence. See <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

ſome other part of the world, and they would not. Yea
<hi>Tertullian</hi> did condemne flight in time of perſecution, in his
Book <hi>De fugâ in perſecutione.</hi> But will any condemne this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
now, or think it unlawful, or unbeſeeming Chriſtians
to flee from the fury of enraged perſecuters? Sure this <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer</hi>
doth often grant it to be lawful. It ſeemeth then that
either he hath catched ſome errour in his head, that is not
Chriſtian (as he ſpeaks of us, <hi>Pag.</hi> 39.) or all which the
primitive Chriſtians maintained in opinion and practice, was
not ſo Chriſtian as to be perpetually obligeing. 4. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Chriſtians ran to martydome, when neither cited,

any ſay that Every Chriſtian is bound and obliged to do ſo
now? How then shall their meer example be obligeing in
the other practice? 5. The primitive Chriſtians would not
bow their knees upon the Sabbath Dayes nor eat blood.
Muſt that example of theirs perpetually oblige us now? 6.

as he hath to call us, <hi>Iam ſumus ergo pares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. He cannot shevv us, that theſe Fathers did account it
unlavvful, ſimply in poynt of conſcience, to reſiſt Emperours
vvickedly perſecuting: They hold forth no ſcriptural ground
condemning the ſame, but rather ſeeme to ſay that it was out
of a deſire of Martyrdome, which (as <hi>Sulpitius Sever us</hi> ſayeth)
they ſought for more earneſtly, then in his dayes men gaped
for Bishopricks; &amp; therefore they willingly yeelded up their
lives and all, to the cruel rage of perſecuters, that they
might obtaine the crowne of Martyrdome, It is true,
<hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayes, <hi>Apud iſtam diſciplinam magis occidi licet quam
occidere.</hi> But this ſayes not that it is ſimply ſinful t kill in
ſelf-defence: but that they chooſed rather to be killed or
martyred.</p>
               <p>6, Though we shall not goe about to call in queſtion the
truth of <hi>Tercullian's</hi> narration concerning the number &amp; power
of Chriſtians in his time (and yet <hi>Mr Goodwin</hi> in his <hi>Antica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

makeyth it very probable that he vvas miſtaken in his

Or that if it vvas ſo, it vvas not knovvn to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and ſo it vvas all one, as to reſiſting upon that ground.)
Yet vve may ſay, That there might have been many things,
vvhich in prudence might have made them to forbeare to goe
to an open vvar, or riſe in armes againſt the Emperours, even
this, that the Emperours alvvayes had a greart militia, many
and ſtrong armies on foot, againſt vvhich, for naked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(though many) ſcattered up and dovvne the Empire,
having fevv or none to command or lead them forth to battel
in their defence, to riſe in this caſe, had been no probable
meane of ſaifty to themſelves, or of defence; but rather a
meane to provoke the Tyrant more, and procure unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:105606:170"/>
more ſuddaine deathe and deſtruction. So that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

interpriſe, vvas but ſmall and very improbable.</p>
               <p>7. The ancient Chriſtians vvere not ſo utterly ignorant,
nor ſo void of humanity and Chriſtian love and Zeal, that
being able to help, they vvould ſuffer their brethren to be
dravvne to death; what ever this <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſayeth: but ſome
times they reſcued the oppreſſed out of the hands of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours:

               <p>8. Before Conſtantin's dayes, none of the Emperours
owned or profeſſed the Chriſtian faith, ſo that religion was
not then eſtablished by lawes, as our Religion is: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all that <hi>Tertullian</hi> or <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſay, cometh not home to our

               </p>
               <p>9. Though it is true that when <hi>Conflantine</hi> obtained the
Empire, Chriſtian Religion was more ſecured and eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then formerly, yet did not the ſucceeding Emperours
when they came to the throne, ſweare to maintaine the ſame,
and all who owned it; they did not receive the imperial
crowne on theſe tearmes; nor were the ſubjects bound unto
them on theſe conditions; and ſo the inſtances adduced
after <hi>Constantin's</hi> dayes, ſute not our caſe, wherein Religion
is become not only a legal right of the People, but a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental

               <p>10. As for the Chriſtians not reſiſting the <hi>Arrian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
it ſpeaks nothing: For, that controverſy was long
under debate, even in Conſtantin's dayes, and decreaſed
nothing, for all the ſentence of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, which
paſſed againſt it; and hereby Bishop was againſt Bishop,
Province againſt Province, Council againſt Council, and at
length all the world almoſt was turned <hi>Arrian.</hi> What wonder
then that there was no general oppoſition made againſt theſe
Arrian Emperours, when their Subjects imbraced the ſame
deluſion? And as for particular oppoſitions, we shall ſee ſome
inſtances afterward.</p>
               <p>11. As for the <hi>Theban Legion,</hi> their non-reſiſtence ſpeaks
nothing to our caſe, for then Religion was not ſetled by
law. 2. For ſix thouſand, ſix hundered, ſixty ſix men
to interpiſe a warre againſt the Emperour and al his

And therefore the ſenſe of their ſpeach was only this: Since
yee are a Chriſtian we will be all Chriſtians alſo, take you
the imperial throne notwithſtanding of that. Moreover,
though the ſouldiers in <hi>Iulian's</hi> army should have ſcrupled at
making reſiſtence againſt their Emperour and General, unto
whom they were ſworne as ſouldiers, it ſpeaketh little to the
poynt; for ſubjects are not ſo under their Soveraignes, as
Souldiers are under their Commanders and Generalls, they
are under the General's pay, and ſo his ſervants, and are
hired for his behoove, but the King doth not hire Subjects,

when this <hi>Macedonius</hi> was about to deſtroy the temple in

they came as ſuppliants and (as <hi>Socrat.</hi> ſayes <hi>Lib. 7. Cap. 18.</hi>)
craved that they vvould pity their caſe, and not ſuffer them
to be ſo oppreſſed; and the Emperour made this one cauſe

of the vvar, vvhich he undertook againſt him; and vvas one
of the cauſes (as the hiſtorie tells us) that made the <hi>Romans</hi>
angry with them: and vvhen the Perſian King demanded back
his fugitives, it vvas anſvvered, they vvould not do that, yea
and that not only they vvould endeavour to ſet the ſuppliants
at freedome, and deliver them from their oppreſſours; but
alſo that they vvould undergoe any thing for the good of the
Chriſtian Religion and (as <hi>ſocrat</hi> ſayeth <hi>lib. 7. c. 18.</hi>) they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
not only to aide them, but alſo with all might poſſible,
generally to maintaine the quarrel in the behalf of Chriſtian
Religion. Againe our <hi>Surveyer</hi> tels us, that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings
had once ſubmitted to the Romans. Which whether true
or falſe, is not mentioned in all this hiſtory, either as the
ground moving the oppreſſed Chriſtians to flee to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> for help, or moving <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to wage vvarre
againſt them. And ſo by this example of theirs, we ſee that
oppreſſed ſubjects may run and ſeek releef from ſtrangers,
when they cannot help themſelves. Thus we ſee this <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer's</hi>
argument is many wayes weak, and againſt himſelf.
Moreover, 4. When <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was forced to flee out of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Gregorius</hi> was brought thither with armed ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and put in poſſeſſion of the Church, the Citizens of

was ſuch that they could not enter, till there were ſome

the year 404. when the Emperour had banished <hi>Chriſoſtome,</hi>
the People flocked together about the palace, ſo that the
Emperour was neceſſitated to call him back againe from his

His doctrine, not ours, overthroweth God's order: It is
God's order that Commonwealths be preſerved from ruine
and deſtruction; that Magiſtrates should lay out themſelves,
and all their power for the good of the Realme over which
they are; for as <hi>Ciecro</hi> ſayeth <hi>eo referenda ſunt omnia its qui praeſunt

how mutable and inclineable to tyranny the will of Princes
is, all ages hath witneſſed) The Commonwealth is remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſty

turne Tyrant (and one wreatched Counſeller may in a short
time by aſſe a Prince, that is not otherwiſe wel balaſted, to this)
ruine is unavoydable. But by our doctrine, there is a remedy
to preſerve the commonwealth from ruine; &amp;more regaird is
to be had to this, which is the end, then to the Prince who
as ſuch, is but a medium to this end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Such as plead for
the good of humane Societyes, should as much labour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the utter overturning of the ſame, as to prevent ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Good phiſitians will labour more carefully to prevent
death, then to prevent a little diſtemper or ſickneſſe; yea and
will cauſe a diſtemper to prevent deſtruction: but this monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank,
if he procure with his preſcriptions preſent eaſe, careth
not though the patient die the next day. But 3. How doth
our doctrine open a perpetual gap to ſeditions? Becauſe
(ſayes he) by our way every private perſon is made judge
not only his owne actions, but of his ſufferings, and he
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:105606:174"/>
muſt ſuffer no more then he thinks meet. But 1. would he
have all the Subjects becomeing more ſenſeleſſe and ſtupide
then beaſts? Would he have them caſting away their ſoul &amp;
judgment, that they should have no more uſe of their reaſon,
to judge what either is commanded or impoſed by penalty?
If he grant a judgement of diſcretion in actings, how will he
ſalve the Magiſtrat's credite and honour, and prevent rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
and ſedition, if there be ſuch a neceſſary connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the exerciſe of this judgement and the conſequent he
dreameth of? For diſobedience is a reſiſtence, as well as
non-ſubmiſſion to the punishment. 2. Though we allow
to every one a judgement of diſcretion, yet we allow no
man's judgement to be the rule of his walking: We ſay not
that an erring judgment is a rule to walk by, and therefore
we ſay that a ſubject is bound to obey the Magiſtrates lawful
commands, though he in his private judgement should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
them ſinful; ſo we ſay he is bound to ſubmit to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
which is juſt and juſtly inflicted, though he judge
otherwayes: Yea we grant furder, he is bound to ſubmit
to unjuſt ſentences patiently, when he cannot by faire and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
meanes shun them. Yea moreover we grant that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of ſmaller moment, he may lawfully beare with the loſſe
of a little to redeeme more, or ſave more from hazard. But
our queſtion is, if the Body of a land or a conſiderable part
thereof, ought ſtupidly to ſubmit to the loſſe of Life, Lands,
Libertyes and Religion, when not only they judge theſe to be
in hazard; but when all who have eyes in their head ſee it &amp;it is
undenyable, being written on all the Acts &amp; actings of theſe in
power, &amp; palpably &amp; too too ſenſibly felt by al ſuch as deſire to
keep a good conſcience, &amp; to be keeped free from the rageing
wickedneſſe &amp; apoſraſy of this generation. 4. Though I know
few malefactors, who, when attached, arraigned &amp; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
would not do what they could to deliver themſelvs from
death, though this queſtion had never been ſtarted; yet
our doctrine will not warrand ſuch to do violence to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate:
For we judge it not enough that they ſay they are
innocent and deſerve on punishment. Our caſe is a caſe that
is manifeſt and not our, and a publick injury avowed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:105606:175"/>
And will he think that becauſe a Malefactor juſtly
condemned to die, may not reſiſt the Magiſtrate executing his
office, Therefore a Land may not defend themſelves, againſt
the Kings Emiſſaries ſent out to execute unjuſt ſentences, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ruine and deſtruction of Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
               <p>His 2. Reaſon <hi>Pag. 44.</hi> is in ſumme this <hi>[That by this way
Magiſirates in doing their duty cannot be ſecured: for it is not enough
to ſay, let Magiſtrates rule rightly, and not oppreſse, becauſe that
in the holy permiſſive providence of God, oft the beſt princes are not

party, may move them to fancy ther Prince a Tyrant, and thereupon
account themſelves free to offer violence: And from reſiſtence they
will goe to revenge (the fury of evil conſciences instigating them)—in
hiſtories it will be found, that hardly did ever people reſiſt a prince,
but in end it came to revenge; and of times the beſt princes have been
worſt uſed, at leaſt as evil as the naughtieſt, as may be ſeen a
mong the Roman Emperours, and Chriſtian Emperours and Kings:
and amongſt our own Kings &amp;c.] Anſw.</hi> Lend us this argument,
and we shall ſee what to make of it. By his doctrine people
can never be ſecured from unjuſt violence, or from continual
oppreſſion and ſlavery; for it is in vaine to ſay, let them do
that which is right, and Magiſtrates will do their duty, for
albeit it be true that faithful and honeſt ſubjects, may in the
way of their duty, expect from God that he will incline the
hearts of Magiſtrates to reſpect and encourage them; yet in
the holy permiſſive providence of God, it comes often to
paſſe that the beſt people are not beſt uſed by their princes:
And this all hiſtories both ancient and moderne abundantly
demonſtrate. This court divine is all for the ſecureing of the
Prince in all his tyrannies &amp; oppreſſions; and ſpeaks nothing
for guarding the ſaifty of the people, which is the end, for
which Magiſtrates were appoynted: And this is to pervert
the order of nature, ſo to ſecure the meane as to deſtroy the
end: For that is to make the meane the end, and no more
the meane. 2. We juſtify not Subjects as are unruly &amp;
ſeditious againſt good Magiſtrates doing their duty; nor do
we plead for Subjects riſeing up in armes againſt their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:105606:175"/>
for every ſmall injury, or when they deviate in a little
from the right way: Let him grant to us, That ſubjects may
oppoſe their Magiſtrates, and reſiſt unjuſt violence with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
when, in ſtead of being Magiſtrates they become
wolves and Tygers; and in ſtead of being paſtors of the
people, they become lyons ſeeking to deſtroy and devoure
them; and when they overturne the ends, for which they
were appoynted, and deſtroy the liberties of the Subject, &amp;
overturne the Religion, which they were obliged &amp; ſworne
to defend, in their place and according to their power, and
we deſire no more. 3. If any under pretext of repelling of
violence, shall unjuſtly injure the Magiſtrate, we approve
not ſuch, we juſtify them not, let them anſwere for that
themſelves. This is nothing to our queſtion: if he ſay that
our doctrine openeth a gap to this, He is miſtaken, for
ſuch as ſay that the ſinful and unjuſt commands of Magiſtrates
should not b e obeyed, do not open a gap to all diſobedience,
even in the moſt juſt commands. And ſince he will grant
that unjuſt commands ought not to be obeyed, let him cloſe
the door here, ſo that from this there shall be no hazard of
mocking the Magiſtrate, when commanding juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
dutyes; And with the ſame engyne shall we cloſe the
door, ſo that when we ſay that Magiſtrates deſtroying Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Libertyes and what is dear to Subjects, may be reſiſted,
we shall ſecure the Magiſtrate from violence and oppoſition,
when he keepeth within his ſphaere, and doth his duty. 4. If
the matter paſſe from reſiſtence to revenge, we approve it
not; if the pride and haughtineſſe of the ſpirit of Princes be
the cauſe of this, let them ſee to it, and labour to prevent it,
by condeſcending to the juſt &amp; equitable demands of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
and grieved ſubjects. 5. We do not deny but God
may ſtir up an <hi>Abſolome</hi> and other conſpirators againſt a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>David,</hi> for his owne holy ends. But, in ordinary
providence it is to be ſeen, that good Princes, while alive and
when dead, have had more reſpect of their Subjects; then
others, who have been moſt flagitious and wicked: The books
of the <hi>Kings</hi> &amp; <hi>Chronicles</hi> demonſtrate this. That good Kings
have been much honoured and reverenced while living, and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:105606:176"/>
much lamented when dead; and upon the contrare, vvicked
King's have either been cut off, or when dead have not been
deſired, nor burned with the burnings of their fathers, nor bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed

6. As for the difference that God in his providence hath put
betwixt Heathenish and Chriſtian Kinges ſee what <hi>Evagrius</hi>
ſayeth <hi>Eccleſ. hiſtor. cap.</hi> 41. ſpeaking againſt <hi>Zoſimus,</hi> he hath
theſe words worth the marking. [<hi>Let us ſee if thow will, how
the Emperours which were</hi> Hethnickes <hi>and</hi> Panimes <hi>maintainers of
Idolatry and paganiſme, and how on the contrary, ſuch as cleaved
unto the Chriſtian faith, ended their reigne: was not</hi> Cajus Julius
Caeſar <hi>the first Emperous, ſlaine by a conſpiracy? did not certane
ſouldiers with naked ſwords diſpatch</hi> Cajus <hi>the nephew of</hi> Tiberius?
<hi>was not</hi> Nero <hi>murdered by one of his familiar and dear friends?
Had not</hi> Galba <hi>the like end,</hi> Otho &amp; Vitellus, <hi>who all three reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only Sixteen moneths? what shall I ſpeak of</hi> Titus <hi>whom</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus
<hi>poiſoned, although he was his owne brother? what ſayeſt thow of</hi>
Commodus?—<hi>what shall I ſay of</hi> Marcinus? <hi>did not the
ſouldiers uſe him like a captive, about</hi> Byzantium, <hi>and cruelly put
him to death?</hi>—<hi>what shall I ſay of</hi> Maximinus <hi>whom his owne
army diſpatched—were not</hi> Gallus, <hi>and</hi> Voluſianus <hi>murdered by
their owne army? had not</hi> Aemilianus <hi>the like miſerable end—But
ſince</hi> Conſtantine <hi>began to reigne-was there any one Emperour in that
city</hi> (Julian <hi>a man of thine own Religion-only excepted) that was
murthered by his owne ſubjects?]</hi> It were an endleſſe work to run
thorow hiſtories, and show, how for the moſt part, (contrare
to what he ſayes) theſe Kings who have been reſiſted by their
Subjects, whether in the time of Heatheniſme, or ſince
Chriſtianity was profeſſed, have been moſt flagitious and
wicked? Sure, if we should goe no further but to our owne
hiſtory, we shall finde this put beyond all queſtion, the
<hi>Surveyer</hi> himſelf being witneſſe, who ſayes <hi>Pag. 78.</hi> that the
inſtances of oppoſition made unto the Scotish Kings adduced
by the <hi>Apolog.</hi> were but [<q>the inſurrection of Nobles againſt
the Kings, and violent oppreſſions of ſuch of them, as have
been flagitious and tyrannous.</q>] And thus he contradicteth,
what he juſt now ſaid. But to what purpoſe is all this ſtir?
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:105606:176"/>
He ſayes, but can he prove, that we aſſert, That any party
of the people, when ſtrong enough, may get up againſt the
King and all Magiſtrates, when they judge that they deal
wrongouſly and injuriouſly with them? Sure the thing
which we affirme is far contrary to this, as hath been often
times shewed. We know that [<q>the evil wit of a ſeditious
party can ſoon paint the Beſt King as a black and ugly Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant]</q>
and vve know alſo, that the evil wit of a hired court-paraſite,
and beſe flatterer can paint out the blackeſt <hi>Nero,</hi> or
<hi>Caligula,</hi> or a <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> as a brave and virtuous prince. And
this is nothing to our caſe, when the acts of Tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
are as legible, as if written with the ſun-beames:
It behoved to be ſtrange virmilion that would ſerve to make
the apoſtaſy, perjury, oppreſſion and tyranny of the novv
Prince and Rulers, appear vvhit and comely; and he needs no
great vvit vvho vvould painte out theſe groſſe acts under the
forme of ugly Tyranny: Yet vvith all vve shall vvillingly
grant to him, that, <q>[All the fearers of God should rather
indure ſome acts of real tyranny, then by doctrine or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of reſiſtence, open a door to the deſtruction of good
Kings (by a party not of their ſpirit, but lurking under their
pretences) and to the continual diſſolution, concuſſion,
and deſolation of humane ſocieties]</q> for this is not the thing
vve are againſt: Some acts of Tyranny vve are vvilling to
endure, provideing he vvill grant us liberty both to teach &amp;
practiſe reſiſtence, vvhen the acts of tyranny are not one or
two, but many; nor acts of Tyranny in ſmaller and leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
matters; but ſuch as tend to the deſtruction of the
true Libertyes of the Subject, to the overturning of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
vvork of Reformation, ſvvorne-to by all rankes and
degrees of people; hovvbeit men of corrupt principles, and
of another ſpirit, should lurk under theſe pretences. Is it
not reaſonable, that vve alſo demand of this <hi>Surveyer</hi> vvhile
he is in a good mood, That he vvould evidence ſo much fear
of God, as not to condemne reſiſtence unto real tyranny, ſo
as to open a gap to all the ingrained &amp; bloody <hi>Ner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

prodigious Canibales, to vvaſte &amp; deſtroy at pleaſure the beſt
of Subjects. What follovveth concerning obedience active
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:105606:177"/>
and Subjection paſſive, hath been ſpoken to formerly, and
it is needleſſe fill up pages vvith repetitions, as he doth:
only vvhereas he citeth <hi>Apolog. Pag. 376, &amp; 377.</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ſubjection is neceſſary, and ſuppoſeth that this is
repugnant to vvhat <hi>Naphtali</hi> ſayeth, He vvould knovv that
he is in a great miſtake, for the queſtion there is concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
in things indifferent, or of ſubmitting to the penalty,
and that by a few privat perſones; and though in this caſe a
ſingle perſon, who will not obey the Magiſtrate in theſe
matters muſt yeeld the penalty, and ſo acknowledge his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
it will not follow that a multitude or a Community,
forced under intolerable penaltyes to acts of impiety and
hainous tranſgreſſion, and who can defend their rights and
juſt privileges palpably and iniquouſly violated, may not
repel ſuch unjuſt force with force; &amp; reſiſt intolerable tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
abuſing the ordinance of God to all acts of wickedneſſe,
and to the overturning &amp; deſtroying the very ends of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
And to this <hi>Naphtaly</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Pag.</hi> 28. So that he but
gives vent to his profane Spirit, to cry out, as he doth <hi>Pag.</hi> 46.
and ſay [<q>
                     <hi>Good God! to what times are we reſerved?</hi> to ſee ſo
certane truths, that may be reckoned among the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veables
of Religion, and the ancient land marks removed,
by an upſtart furious Crue, who by their new principles
(as falſe as new) ſeek to confound both Church and State?
The lawfulneſſe of privat men's counter acting, and violent
reſiſtence to a whole Church &amp; a whole State, is a maine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of their new faith, &amp; to do ſo is one of their new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
added to God's.</q>] For 1. It never was a certane truth,
nor ever was reckoned among the immovables of Religion
(except by Court divines, &amp;baſe flattering Sycophants, whoſe
maine and only Religion was and is, to pleaſe the King, that
he might full their bellies) that abſolute and illimited ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
was due to Princes by the whole body of the People,
ſo that if he should ſend our Emiſſaries, like ſo many wild
Beares, to kill Man, Wife, and Children, Without
colour and pretence of Law or reaſon, People should do
nothing but caſt open their breſts, and hold up their throats,
that they may be devoured at once: what ſound Divine ſayeth
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:105606:177"/>
ſo? What ſound Divine putteth this brutish ſubjection
among the ancient land marks? Yea what ſober Royaliſt
(that is not with this <hi>ſurveyer</hi> intoxicate with Royal gifts,
till his braines be crack't, and his rationality brutified) dar
poſitively averre that this is to be put among the immoveables
of Religion? 2. This principle which he calleth new, and
as falſe as new, is an old truth verified by the practices of all
ages, and is as true as old; which he might eaſily ſee, if his
new dignities and gifts had not blinded his eyes, and made
him as falſe and perfidious, as he is notour. 3. He tells
that our principle tends to confound both Church and State;
becauſe we plead against Tyranny either in Church or State;
a pretty reaſon: Becauſe we plead for that, which tendeth
to the preſervation of Church and State, in being and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
therefore we plead for confounding Church and State?
whereas his principle of Tyranny, in Church and State, is
the readyeſt way imaginable to deſtroy both, as hath been
ſeen by many ſad and dreadful examples, before our dayes.
4. This man who hath perfidiouſly renunced his Covenant
with God, and avowed his perjury to all the World, and
his palpable breach of, and caſting behind his heels the third
command, talks of our adding new articles to our faith, and a
new command to God's; becauſe we will not deny the
principles of nature, nor grant that free-born ſubjects are
ſlaves or brutes: And with him, Tyranny is the ancient
Land-mark, and the chief poynt of his Religion, and a maine
article of his faith, and one of the grand commands of the
time. But many know at whoſe girdle his faith and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
hangs: But we will chooſe none of his Religion, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
articles of faith, or commands; For they change
with the Court: and we know Court Divinity is a coat of
many colours, faire and fashionable, but ſuch as will
neither keep from cold, nor cover our nakedneſſe, far leſſe
ſave from God's wrath in the day of accounts.</p>

To which we anſwere 1. That the queſtion, which theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
ſpeak to, is different from ours: We ſpeak not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
vvhat a privat ſingle perſon may do vvhen arraigned

may do, when unjuſtly oppreſſed &amp; perſecuted by Magiſtrats,

privat perſons or a community their defending themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
unjuſt violence: and this truth which we maintain, was

that ſuch, though wicked, while they are in office, should
be acknowledged as God's deputyes; for, (ſo ſayes he §. 25.)
[<hi>In homine deterrimo honoreque omni indigniſſimo penes quem modò

quam Dominus justitiae ac judicit ſui Miniſtris verbo ſuo detulit:

noſtris omnibus qualescunque tandem ſint.</hi>] And would have
us §. 31. carefull not to rub contempt upon, or to violent
the office, or ordinance of God, even in ſuch; which
we eaſily aſſent unto: Becauſe that this is not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to a ſinleſſe ſelf-defence, and reſiſtence made to
their open Tyranny, when ſeeking to deſtroy Religion,
Libertyes, and every thing that is previous and deare unto
the Subjects. It is true, ſome-where his expreſſions ſeem to
condemne reſiſtence, but that which we have mentioned is
the maine thing he preſſeth: and he doth not ſpeak to the caſe
of reſiſtence particularly. 2. Though we should grant that
in this particular <hi>Calvin</hi> is not ours; yet the <hi>Surveyer</hi> muſt know
that §. 31. he is againſt him alſo, for the <hi>Surveyer</hi> putteth
Parliaments &amp; all inferiour Magiſtrates in the ſame condition
with private Subjects; and yet <hi>Calvin</hi> ſayeth that ſuch as are
as the <hi>Ephori</hi> among the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> the <hi>Tribuns</hi> of the
people among the <hi>Romans;</hi> and the <hi>Demarchi</hi> among the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniens;</hi>
and the Eſtates of Parliament, may and ought to
ſuppreſſe the Tyranny of Princes: And ſo in this matter
<hi>Calvin</hi> shall be more for us then for him. 3. It would be
noted, both in reference to the teſtimony cited out of <hi>Calvin,</hi>
and to the teſtimonies of other following, That the caſe
which they ſpeak to, is different far from ours: For with us,
both King and Subject are bound in a ſolemne Covenant to
God, to maintaine and promote a work of Reformation,
and upon theſe tearmes did out King imbrace the Scepter, and
became obliged by conditions unto his People: And ſure
more may be ſaid for our defending our ſelves, our Covenant,
and our Religion, when unjuſtly perſecuted by the King,
then for other privat Subjects, who are (by Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
under Heathen Princes, or conquerours, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Princes of a different Religion, and who have no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

Claſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Pag.</hi> 680. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which we anſwere,
1. The queſtion which he moveth <hi>Pag.</hi> 680.
doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
us: For there he ſayes that meer privat perſones may
not depoſe Kings or Princes, or riſe againſt them for this end,
<hi>Vt eos à dignitate, ſeu gradu ſuo
deturbent.</hi> Now this is not
our queſtion, which is concerning neceſſary ſelf-defence in
caſes of extreame neceſſity. 2. He grants it lawfull to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Magiſtrates, who ſet limites to the Prince, if the
Prince violat his compacts, and break his Covenant, to
force him to ſtand to his conditions, <hi>eum in ordinem cogere, ac
vi redigere, ut conditiones &amp; pacta quae fuerat pollicitus, compleat,
idque vel armis cum aliter fieri non poſſit.</hi> Our <hi>Surveyer</hi> will not
aſſent to this which <hi>Martyr</hi> ſayeth, notwithſtanding he account
him one of the moſt learned of our Proteſtants. 3. It is
true <hi>Pag.</hi> 682. he would have private perſones enduring a
Tyrant, who commands contrary to equity, and good
lawes, and ſuffer him patiently, as we are to ſuffer patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſickneſſe. But who ſeeth not, that notwithſtanding of
this patient ſubmission, we may uſe reſiſtence, as we may
uſe reſiſtence, by all lawful meanes, to ſicknesse and diſeaſes.
4. Though we should yeeld that ſuch a Tyrant as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
should not be reſiſted, viz. ſuch an one as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
<hi>contra aequum bonum ac leges,</hi> yet our caſe is different:
For not only are there ſuch acts of iniquity commanded; but
alſo Subjects are compelled by meer force and cruelty, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to, and approve iniquous courſes; and our Magiſtrates
are in a ſingular manner obliged to proſecute the Ends of a
ſworne Covenant, which the Subjects deſire to adhere unto,
and for adherence thereunto, are perſecuted in a moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and cruel manner. So that this is tyranny of a higher
nature, then what <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſpeaketh of.</p>
               <p>In the next place he citeth <hi>Rivet. in Decal. Pag.</hi> 233. <hi>and</hi> 235.
But we anſwere. 1. <hi>Rivet</hi> granteth it lawful unto all, <hi>vim vi
repellere</hi> to repel force with force, a proveth it. 2. In
the place by him cited, he is ſpeaking of a private man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
the violence of another, who, if (under pretext of
exponeing the law of Nature) should avenge himſelf, <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vato
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:105606:179"/>
appetitu vel contumaciâ,</hi> or raiſe ſeditions againſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
he should but abuſe his power and liberty, and this
we grant. But our caſe is of a Community, to which <hi>Rivet</hi>
ſpeaketh nothing. Yea 3. in the other place, though he
will not have a private perſon kill his Father or a Magiſtrate,
in his owne defence; yet he granteth it lawful to reſiſt, ſo
far as can be, to hinder our owne destruction [<hi>Id</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>nos abſolute ſontimus de Parente &amp; Principe; quibus licet quidem
reſiſtere, quantum id fieri poteſt, cum invadunt injuſte; eo fine ut
impediamus perniciem noſtram.]</hi> Whence it appeareth that
<hi>Rivet</hi> is much for us; for he acknowledgeth it lawful for a
private ſingle perſon to defend himſelf, as much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
from the unjuſt aſſaults of Princes, Much more then
shall it be lawfull for a community to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King's Emiſſaries.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Rivet</hi> he citeth <hi>D. Ames conſ, cas. Lib. 5. cap. 20.</hi> But
Doct. <hi>Ames</hi> ſpeaketh nothing againſt us, for he is ſummarily
holding forth what is the duty of Superiours towards their
inferiours, and of inferiours towards their Superiours; and
among the dutyes of inferiours, he reckoneth ſubjection and
obedience, but what calleth he this <hi>ſubjection?</hi> Doth he
meane thereby a ſtupide and abſolute ſubmiſſion to all acts of
Tyranny and opreſſion? No, but ſuch an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their power &amp; authority as hath with it a care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the ſame unhurt. Now this is conſiſtent with reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
in caſes of neceſſity: A community may defend
themſelves from unjuſt violence of Magiſtratees, and yet
attempt nothing againſt their juſt power and authority, but
labour tenderly to preſerve the ſame. 2. It is true, that he
ſayeth all violent inſurrection is oppoſite hereunto, and alſo
contempt: But that is violent inſurrection againſt the power
and authority, and not againſt the perſon who is abuſeing his
povver to the ruine and deſtruction of the Commonvvealth;
for no body will deny but tyranny, and the Tyrant as ſuch,
may be deſpiſed and undervalued, vvithout vvrong to the
povver and authority if ſelf. So may that be reſiſted vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
violation of the power. 3. It is true he ſayeth that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
may be, vvhere there is not obedience, but wherein
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:105606:180"/>
ſayeth he doth this ſubjection conſiſt? <hi>In ſubmiſsâ recuſatione
obedientiae, quando illicitum eſſe conſtat quod a ſuperiore mandatur;
in a ſubmiſſive refuſeing to give obedience.</hi> And this is ſome
other thing, then a ſtupide ſubmission to all acts of Tyranny.
4. This ſame <hi>Ames Cap.</hi> 25. where he is ſpeaking of Maagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and Subjects, and shewing the duty of ſubjcets
unto them, puts ſubjection and obedience together §. 16.
Wherefore, as hence it cannot follow, becauſe obedience is
due unto them, when they command things juſt and agreable
to God's Law; that therefore obedience is due unto them,
when they command things unjuſt and repugnant to the Law
of God: So nor will it follow, that becauſe ſubjection is due
unto them, when their power is not abuſed to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Commonwealth; therefore ſubjection is due unto
them or non-reſiſtence, when they tyrannize over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
ſtates and bodyes of their ſubjects, and laboure to
overturne all. 5. It is true he ſayeth <hi>Cap.</hi> 31. §. 10. that the
perſon invading may be ſuch, and there may be ſuch other
circumſtances, as that the perſon invaded may rather chooſe
to die, as to Kill: But that ſpeakes nothing to our caſe,
which is a reſiſting to the King's bloody emiſſaries, not by
one private perſon, but by a Community: And ſince <hi>D.
Ames</hi> in the ſame <hi>Chapt.</hi> §. 4. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thinks it lawful for a
private perſon to defend himſelf even by killing the aggreſſor,
when there is no other remedy, he will abundantly juſtify our
practice. And likewiſe he alloweth this defence even in the
behalf of others. §. 9. <hi>Rectè etiam extenditur ad defenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

poſtula lex, ut proximum diligamus ſicut nosipſos!</hi> And therefore
<hi>Ameſius</hi> is much for us.</p>
               <p>As for the two Papiſts <hi>Eſtius</hi> and <hi>Tollet</hi> whom he citeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they ſpeak not againſt us, who plead for the Liberty of ſelf
defence unto a Community againſt the Magiſtrate, and not to
every private ſingle perſon; neither plead we for a power of
Killing Kings. And if they were againſt us he could not
have much reaſon to ſay, that we joyned hands with Papiſts.
Thus are all his authorities from divines anſwered, let us ſee
what he ſayeth further.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:105606:180"/>

inflicted by the Magistràte, more then to active obedience unto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful

comes under no command of God? Yea that it is a ſin againſt
God's command to be paſsively ſubject to unjuſt ſentences, and that it
it an act of grace and vertue, for a man to reſiſt the Magiſtrate vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,

Whenſoever the perſones injured thought the ſentence

do homologate with their practices as to the State, we
may now ſee; for it is the way which they clearly owne,
that every perſon (when and ſo long as they are able, or

how introductory of ſchiſme, hereſies and all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
into the Church, is well diſcovered by the learned
Reviewer of the pamphet intituled <hi>presbytery no papacy, &amp;c.</hi>
And with equal reaſon, may the ſame grounds be made uſe
of againſt this man's inciteing all private perſons, to
counteract the Magiſtrate violently, when they think
he doth them vvrong, or when they account their ſentences
unjust.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw,</hi> 1. It is a poor defence of a weak and tottering cauſe,
to follow ſuch courſes as this <hi>Surveyer</hi> doth. To wreſt and
wire-draw the ſayings of his adverſaries, is neither a faire way
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:105606:181"/>
of confirming his owne opinion, nor a ſolid way of confute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his adverſaries. He ſets dovvne ſome ſentences here,
as aſſertions of <hi>Lex Rex:</hi> And if any vvill consult the places
cited, they vvill diſcover unhandſome dealing. I shall only
ſet downe what <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſayeth, and the Reader, vvhen he
compareth, may judge. <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſayeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 313. [<q>That
patient bearing of evil and reſiſtence, are not incompatible
in one &amp; the ſame perſon] <hi>Pag. 314.</hi>
                  </q> He ſayeth [<q>one act of
grace and vertue is not contrary to another, Reſiſtence is in
the Children of God, an innocent act of ſelf preſervation,
as in a patient ſuffering, and therefore they may well ſubſiſt
in one.] And <hi>ibid</hi> [Neither ſuffering formally as ſuffering,
and ſo neither can non-reſiſting paſſive fall under any moral
law of God, except in two caſes]</q> 
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 322. [<q>when a man
may preſerve his owne life, and doth not that which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
law alloweth him to do, rather to Kill as be Killed,
he is guilty of ſelf murther; becauſe he is deficient in the
duty of lawful ſelf defence.] And <hi>Pag.</hi> 463 [It is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hononrable
to the Majeſty of the Ruler, that we deny Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
ſubjection to him, when he punisheth beſide his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
more then it is againſt his Majeſty and Honour, that
we deny active obedience, when the Commandeth illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q>]
I shall not trouble the Reader with words, to diſcover
the difference betwixt what <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſayeth, and what this <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer</hi>
alledgeth he did ſay; ſeing the judicious and obſervant
Reader will <hi>Sine monitore</hi> eaſily perceive it.</p>
               <p>2. What the <hi>Surveyer</hi> driveth at in making this parallel now,
may be obvious to any, even to imbarque with himſelf and
his party, the few of thoſe who were for the Publick Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that have hitherto gotten grace of the Lord to abide
faithful, and not to ſay a confederacy with all, with whom
this Apoſtate generation hath now baſely conſpired, againſt
Chirſt and his intereſts. But we hope that thoſe few will be
ſo far from intertaining their former prejudices againſt their
faithful and affectionat Brethren, who withſtood theſe Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
and owned the Proteſtations; that on the contrare,
perceiving themſelves miſtaken as to what they feared, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Proteſters, as if they had intended to overturn
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:105606:181"/>
all diſcipline and Church government, and to ſide with
Sectaryes; ſince themſelves have novv ſeen ſome of them
owneing the ſame unto death, and becomeing a martyr upon
the account of Church privileges, &amp; all the reſt (ſcarce three
of foure excepted) abideing faithful, and ſuffering upon that
account unto this day; and ſince with all they ſee the feares
of the Proteſters, concerning the inclination to Malignancy
and Prelacy, of the far greater part of theſe, who ſtifly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
theſe Reſolutions, now verified beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
and that their objecting, that the major part of the
Miniſtery was then corrupted, was too too true, and too well
grounded, which things, if theſe faithful men who now ſtand,
had but ſuſpected then, as now they ſee with their eyes, they
would, (we are confident) have forborne to have ſided
with them in theſe debates, and much more heartily
have concurred with the honeſt propoſals of the Proteſters,
for a through way of purging the church of ſuch corrupt
naughty perſones, as have now moſt baſely betrayed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of Christ, and departed from their profeſſion and
Covenant, and made that Church a hiſſing and a by-word to
all nations, by returning with the Sow to the puddle and
with the dog to their vomite. Theſe worthy men, I ſay,
perceiving now how far they have been miſtaken not to
their grief but to their joy (as famous and zealous <hi>Mr Wood</hi>
one of their number, did before his ſickneſſe, after ſome heavy
groans, plainely profeſſe and declare to a credible perſon, yet
on life to verify the ſame, if any should queſtion it) will be
ſo far from owning this man and his principles, that they
will rather, (we hope) condemne their former practices,
if not altogether yet in ſo far at leaſt, as it is now viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
they did tend, to the ſetting up of a arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and tyranny in the Church, and are now improved by
this <hi>Surveyer</hi> to confirme a Tyranny in the ſtate. Sure they
now ſee, what ſome at leaſt of theſe, who were very active
and forward to ſcrew up that debate to the hieght, and to
preſſe and abſolute ſubjection, might have been driveing at
under hand, though they made ſuch faire profeſſions of their
firme purpoſe to adhere to presbyterian government, as
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:105606:182"/>
moved others to entruſt them with the management of their
affairs at Court, and while entruſted therewith, deſtroyed
and overturned the whole government, ſo that now they will
be loath to ſay as the <hi>Reviewer</hi> did <hi>Pag.</hi> 5, 6. [<hi>That the innocency
of his agency, to prevent the evils the proteſters were endeavouring to
bring upon this Church, and his carriage and integrity in managing
that Trust, are ſo wel: known at home and abroad, that we beleeve he
needs not write Apolog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ticks againſt the ſlanders of their tongue or pen.</hi>]
And rather blush when they read or remember this: &amp; we are
hopeful that ſuch and the like perfidious practices well pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
will not only contribute much to re-unite them in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
affection, unto their faithful Brethren now in the ſame fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
with themſelves, for the ſame cauſe and intereſt; but
alſo cauſe them reflect upon their former proceedings, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what a native tendency, that which gave the riſe to all
that debate, had unto this, which is to day our ſin, our shame,
and our Sorrow, that they may joyne with the Reſt of the
faithful of the land, in mourning for ſuch national ſinnes,
Whereby the wrath of God may be turned away from us,
and the Church reſtored to her former beauty and integrity, in
the Lord's good time.</p>
               <p>3. It is Manifeſt, that this <hi>Surveyer,</hi> who ever he be, &amp;
ſome others with him, had ſome other thoughts in their
heads at that time, then they durſt expreſſe; &amp; finding the
far greater part of the Miniſterie corrupted, would have
had the reſt reſolving upon an abſolute ſubmiſſion to all their
determinations, though they had been openly &amp; avowedly
to introduce prelacy, yea &amp; popery, &amp; to have ſubmitted
to their ſummar cenſures of depoſition, &amp; what elſe they
thought good to inflict, without the leaſt reſiſtence or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracting,
&amp; thus to have patiently ſubmitted, to ſee Chriſt
&amp; his royall truthes banished out of the land by eccleſiaſtical
acts, &amp; Popery &amp; Prelacy re-eſtablished by horrible iniquity:
Though we were ever confident, ſuch as now through grace
abide ſtedfaſt, had no ſuch thoughts or intentions.</p>
               <p>4. This <hi>Surveyer</hi> dealeth with all alike: as he miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<hi>Lex Rex</hi> in the civil debate, ſo doth he now miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the proteſters in the Church-debate; for when or where
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:105606:182"/>
did they ſay, That perſones were not bound to ſubmit, but
to counter-act the judicatories of the presbyteriall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whenſoever they thought the ſentence wrong &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull?
Did they ever aſſert that a mans owne conſcience,
was the only vvarrand and ground of his ſubmiſſion or non-ſubmiſſion,
or of his obedience or disobedience?</p>
               <p>5. So doth he abuſe &amp; miſrepreſent <hi>Naphtaly,</hi> as any vvill ſee
who conſidereth his words in the place cited, which are theſe.
<hi>Now how a diſcretive judgment in theſe caſes, both of unrighteous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
&amp; wicked violence, &amp; ſpecially in the later, which is (by
far) the more ſenſible, doth neceſſarily remaine with the people, &amp;
in what manner the ſame is to be determined &amp; cautioned, ſo as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to licenſe diſobedience against authority, nor create ſeditions in
the Commonwealth, is already fully cleared.]</hi> This is ſome other
thing then to ſay, that al is to be referred to every man's privat
diſcretive judgement, vvithout any caution or limitation
added or ſupponed.</p>
               <p>6. Becauſe it is not our purpoſe to revive that debate
vvhich vvas betvvixt the Proteſters &amp; the Publick Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners;
but as vve vvish it had never been heard of, ſo vve
deſire it may buryed in perpetual oblivion; &amp; that hence
forth there may be hearty joyning in the cauſe &amp; cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God, for proſecution of all the ends thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our ſeverall capacities, That ſo we may become
one ſtick in the hand of the Lord, &amp; renunce this apoſtacy,
&amp; all courſes tending thereunto, &amp; ſo goe on as before that un
happy difference broke out, with zeal, &amp; unanimity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we shall forbeare to examine what that Reviewer, of
<hi>presbytery no papacy, ſaid:</hi> And though we finde that much
of what the <hi>Surveyer</hi> ſayeth here, is borrowed from that
<hi>Reviewer,</hi> &amp; is anſwered already as to our purpoſe; yet we
finde the <hi>Reviewer</hi> grant ſeverall things, which will quite
deſtroy the parallel, as to our caſe, &amp; shew the <hi>Surveyer</hi>
to have been but a fool in mentioning that pamphlet now.
For 1. He <hi>Pag.</hi> 104. ſayeth [<hi>We do not urge ſubmiſſion, in this
matter betwixt us, in matters of doctrine, or articles of faith, in
morshipe, government, nay nor rules of diſcipline.]</hi> And ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuats
as much, as that if the <hi>Dogmatick</hi> and <hi>Diatactick</hi> power
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:105606:183"/>
of Chriſt's courts be abuſed, and corrupt doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
preſſed, he would not be for ſubmiſſion: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon this ground, waves the arguments of the proteſters,
taken from the inſtance of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> not ſubmitting to the
<hi>Arians,</hi> depoſeing him for aſſerting the divinity of the Sone of
God; and the 11. <hi>Arg.</hi> making a ſuppoſition of enacting the
Maſſe, and all the hereſies of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaying [<hi>For when Church
judicatories deny homage to the Sone of God and returne to</hi> Rome,
<hi>We shall not debate the poynt of non-ſubmiſſion only with them, but
shall run from them as from synagogues of Satan.</hi>] Upon this ſame
ground he waves the argument 13. which did shew that this
ſubmiſſion was prelatical: And the paſſage of our <hi>confeſſion
of faith</hi> ratified An. 1567. which is thus, art. 12. [<hi>So far as
the Council proveth the determination and commandement that it
giveth, by the plaine word of God, ſo ſoon do we reverence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the ſame; but if men under the name of a Council, pretend to forge
unto us new articles of our faith, or to make conſtitutions repugning to
the word of God, then utterly we muſt refuſe the ſame, as the doctrine
of devils, which draweth our ſouls from the voyce of our only God, to
follow the doctrines &amp; conſtitutions of Men.</hi>] So doth he upon this
ground lay by what they ſaid <hi>Pag.</hi> 49. [<hi>That by this ſubmiſsion
there was no remedy, but that, at one ſtroke, the precious intereſts of
Chriſt and truthes of God muſt be borne downe, and buryed in oblivion,
and the Saints and Miniſters of the goſpel be buryed under the rubbish
thereof.</hi>] As alſo their <hi>Arg.</hi> 15. which did shew, that this
unlimited ſubmiſſion did [<hi>Leave the Church deſtitute of all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
remedies, in the caſe of a general defection, and open a wide door for making the government of the houſe of God degenerate into
Tyranny, &amp;c.</hi>] And their 2 <hi>Argum</hi> shewing how contrary
it was to Scripture, and how hard it was to ſay that a man
duely qualified, being ſuſpended from the Sacrament, or
from the exerciſe of his Miniſtery, or excommunicated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of his preſſing and holding forth ſome precious Truth
of God, which a Church judicatory condemneth for a lie,
should ſubmit: And alſo their 8. <hi>Arg. Pag.</hi> 108. which
was this [<hi>What is denyed</hi> jure <hi>to Oecumenick Councils, and ſo
lawfully called Prophets and Miniſters of the goſpel, to</hi> Nathan, <hi>to</hi>
David, <hi>to</hi> Paul, <hi>to an Angel from heaven</hi> Gal. 1: ver. 18. <hi>cannot
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:105606:183"/>
warrantably be given to General Aſſemblies. If—they teach or
decree not according to the word of the Lord, we are to counteract,
and to contradict</hi> Gal. 1: ver. 8. <hi>Therefore, &amp;c.</hi>] Now in all
theſe caſes the <hi>Reviewer</hi> would not plead for ſubmiſſion to
Church judicatories: Why then doth this <hi>Surveyer</hi> plead for
abſolute ſubmiſſion and unlimited to civil powers, ſince he
is pleaſed to draw a parallel betwixt them? But we ſee that
evil men and ſeducers waxe worſe and worſe. So that by the
<hi>Reviewer's</hi> conceſſions, we are not bound to ſubmit vvhen the
higher povvers perſecute us for truthes ſake, deny homage
to the Sone of God, preſſe the approving of corruptions in
the poynt of government, deſtroy the precious truthes of
God, and intereſts of Chriſt, make a general defection and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy:
And in a vvord, turne Enemies to the liberties
of the People, deſtroy the Covenanted vvork of God, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the Subjects in bodyes, States, and Conſciences; and
ſo croſſe the very ends for vvhich they vvere appoynted.
2. The <hi>Reviewer Pag.</hi> 109, 110. though he vvould have ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
in the matter of diſcipline, vvhere the hazard is only
perſonal, and a mans ſuffering is not <hi>tanti</hi> as to diſturb a vvell
ſetled national Church, vvhere doctrine and vvorshipe are
in their integrity; yet he thinks the caſe is of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vvhen a National Church in her judicatoryes intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
falfe doctrine, and corrupt vvorshipe, to be impoſed
upon a Church: And ſo dar not affirme that ſubmiſſion is in
this caſe due. Why vvill not the <hi>Surveyer</hi> take notice of this &amp;
grant ſo much in our caſe? We should readyly grant to him,
that ſubmiſſion might be yeelded in ſmaller matters, when
the hazard was only perſonal, and the ſuffering of one, or of
a few, was not <hi>tanti</hi> as therefore to diſturb the ſetled State,
wherein the maine matters were keeped in their integrity.
But he cannot in reaſon demand more of us, (if the parallel
hold) or ſeek ſubmiſſion, when Higher powers are overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the precious Truthes of God, and intereſts of Chriſt,
are deſtoying a glorious work of reformation, are preſſing all
to open and avowed perjury, are deſtroying the fundamental
rights, libertyes and privileges of the Chriſtian Subjects, and
tyrannizing over their Eſtates, their Bodyes and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:105606:184"/>
3. So tender was the <hi>Reviewer</hi> that <hi>Pag.</hi> 115. he
would not urge ſubmiſſion to ſentences of inferiour courts,
when appeales from one judicatory to another could not be
had; yet ſo untender is our <hi>Surveyer</hi> that he will have abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and unlimited ſubmiſſion yeelded, when he knowes that
not only is there no liberty of appeal granted, but not ſo much
as liberty to petition and ſupplicate, to get any thing that is
amiſſe righted. Thus he would have the whole land ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to meer and cruel tyranny. 4. <hi>Pag.</hi> 129. the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewer
ſaid <hi>[We never aſserted a judicatory might be contra-acted in
no caſe, as we cleared before]</hi> far leſſe will be affirme, that a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory
may not be contradicted in any caſe, <hi>ibid.</hi> Hovv
cometh it then, that our <hi>Surveyer</hi> doth not follow the <hi>Reviewer's</hi>
footſteps; but pleadeth for abſolute and illimited ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
in all caſes vvhatſomever. 5. <hi>Pag.</hi> 131. vvhen he
comes to that argument taken from the Tyranny which would
hereby be introduced in the Church, which would conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
condemne defenſive armes uſed againſt Tyranny in
the State: He only ſayes <hi>[That no learned man would ever allow
people to riſe (far leſſe a party only) against a prince upon the account
only of the unjust ſufferings of particular perſones, whole yet the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of Church and State were well ordered-while yet they adhered
unto &amp; overturned none of the righteous things in a nation.]</hi>
Sure then it will be allowed by him, that people, though the
leſſer part, defend themſelves againſt Tyranny; when not
only particular perſones are unjuſtly ſuffering, but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
things once concluded and confirmed by lawes, Oathes
Vowes, Covenants, Acknowledgments, Declarations, &amp;
Proteſtations, are overturned; the work of God razed to the
fundation; perjury and breach of Covenant eſtablished;
Conrſes laid downe for a conſtant exerciſe of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion &amp;c.
againe. 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 134. [<hi>let once</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
grow ſo corrupt as to condemne the dutyes of preaching Chriſt, and
participation of publick ordinances, in the very nature and kinde, and
as to all ſorts of perſons univerſally—and in that caſe we shall
without ſcruple conclude them no true courts of Chriſt, &amp; conſequently
not to be ſubmitted unto; yea in caſe ſuch decrees were published, we
should hold it a caſe of confeſſion for miniſters to preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and people
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:105606:184"/>
to frequent ordinances ſo long as they had liberty or oportunity.]</hi> How
then can ſubmiſſion be given to theſe in povver, vvho novv
have deſtroyed the intereſts of Chriſt, and vvill ſuffer none
to plead or contend for Chriſt and his oppreſſed truth, or
ſpeak againſt perjury and dreadful defection, vvhere of
the land is novv guilty? But enough of this, vve pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another particular which we shall here examine is that
diſcourſe he hath concerning I</hi> Sam. 8: ver. 10. Pag. 63: 64.
<hi>The ſumme of what he ſayeth is this.</hi> [It is true (<hi>ſayes he</hi>)
the place, <hi>I Sam. 8: ver. 10.</hi> neither contradicts nor repeales that
law <hi>Deut. 17: ver.</hi> 14.—But it is falſe that only the
tyranny of a King is there ſpoken of by way of meer diſſuaſive: <hi>Moſes</hi>
and <hi>Samuel</hi> agree: The one shewes what a King should do <hi>ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi>
and <hi>de Jure,</hi> The other what a King may do, by the power he

                  </gap>oxious to punishment, from Subjects,—
or what a people should ſuffer of an evil King, without attempt of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon him. The one ſets out Gods approbative law, The other
his permiſſive law—as albeit the Lord approve not divorce, yet by
a permiſſive law, <hi>Deut 24: ver. I.</hi> Husbands had liberty to put
away their Wives, without being obnoxious to humane punishment—
The fact it the manner of Tyranny, but the permiſſive power without
punishment from ſubjects, is the juſt right of all lawfull Kings—
Though <hi>Samuel</hi> might have here intended to diſſwade the people; yet
his maine intention was to shew the people their duty under a Kings op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what they were to ſuffer without reſiſtence; for to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
should he have written the Manner of the King in a book, and
laid it up before the Lord, <hi>1 Sam. 10: ver. 25.</hi> But to teach the
people their beheaviour to the King? So that this was not the law of the
King, <hi>Deut. 17.</hi> which was already keeped in the Ark.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> It is well that he granteth that this <hi>

                     </gap>us Regis</hi> Or <hi>the
manner of the King</hi> is <hi>de facto</hi> the manner of tyranny; and ſo
that it was no wayes lawful for the King to do theſe things
there mentioned, which yet other Royaliſts do peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
deny and averre hence, that Kings have full, abſolute and
illimited power over the Subjects perſons and goods. And
thus as to the King's part, he muſt grant that what is here
ſpoken, is contrary to what is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.</p>

                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:105606:185"/>
2. All the circumſtances of the text shew, that this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of the King is ſpoken of meerly in way of diſſwaſive;
for it was a King to judge them like unto the Kings of other
Nations, which they were ſeeking, and this diſpleaſed
<hi>Samuel ver. 6.</hi> and the Lord ſaid to <hi>Samuel,</hi> that hereby they
had rejected not <hi>Samuel,</hi> but himſelf, that he should not
reigne over him, <hi>ver. 7.</hi> and the Lord commanded him ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely
to proteſt againſt them, and then shew them the
manner of the King: and what elſe was this for, but to bring
them off their purpoſe, and diſſwade them from proſecuteing
it any furder? But it is ſaid, <hi>ver. 19. Nevertheleſſe the people
refuſed to obey the voice of Samuel.</hi> now what elſe was the voyce
of <hi>Samuel</hi> then a diſſwaſion? Let him look the <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Dutch Annot.</hi> upon the place, and other Commentators, and
he will finde it ſo</p>
               <p>3. That which he takes the meaning of this <hi>manner of the
King</hi> to be, is the old ſaying of <hi>Barclaius</hi> long ſince exploded
by <hi>Althuſius</hi> in his <hi>Politic. cap.</hi> 19. <hi>num.</hi> 58. thus [<hi>Impunity</hi>
(ſayes he) <hi>in committing wickedneſe can make no right: Princes
have no power to do evil, but only to help, comforte, and to promove
the good and profite of the people,</hi> Vaſq. Lib. 1. cap. 1. and 2. c. 26. num. 2, 3. contr. Illuſtr.—<hi>To do evil is no act of power, but
of infirmity that cannot abstean from doing evil,</hi> Vaſq. D. L. C. 27.
<hi>for ſo a company of Thieves, and Incendiaries, which can do many
things, which they ought not, should be ſaid to do theſe things by a

Let him conſider alſo what famous and learned <hi>Voetius</hi> ſayeth
to this, <hi>Diſp. ſelect. part. 4. pag. 222.</hi> Where he tells us that to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:105606:185"/>
do evil with impunity, is not <hi>Ius,</hi> doth found no <hi>Ius</hi> Or right,
neither is founded on the law of God, of Nature, of Nations,
nor on the civil law. And as to that which the <hi>Surveyer</hi>
ſayeth, that it is a <hi>Ius,</hi> becauſe it shewes what people were
to endure willingly, and might not reſiſt. He anſwereth,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 223. That then the people should be the ſubject of this
right or <hi>Ius,</hi> and not the King; and ſo it could not be called
the <hi>manner of the King,</hi> but the <hi>manner of the People.</hi> Againe
he ſayes, evil, loſſe, vexation, paſſion, and not to hinder
evil, in Scripture phraſe, is rather called ſomewhat oppoſit to
<hi>Ius,</hi> then <hi>Ius</hi> or right, viz. a privation of it.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>As for his ſimile of a permiſſion granted to men to put
away their Wives, it is not of the ſame nature with the
former evils (ſayeth</hi> Althuſius <hi>in the place above cited.)
And the Author of</hi> Lex Rex, pag. <hi>137. ſaid well,</hi> [If ſo, a
power to ſinne, and a power to commit acts of Tyranny, yea and a
power in the Kings Sergeants, and bloody Emiſſaries, to waſte and

a lawful power it muſt be, if it cometh from God, whether it be from
the King in his owne perſon or from his Servants at his command, and
be either put forth in acts, as the power of a bill of divorce, was a
power from God, exempting either the husband from punishment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, or freeing the Servant who at the husbands command should
write it, and put it into the hands of the Woman. I cannot beleeve
that God hath given a power and that by law, to one man, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Twenty Thouſand cut throats to deſtroy and kill all the children
of God, &amp; that he hath commanded his children to give their necks and
heads to <hi>Babel's</hi> ſones without reſiſtence. This I am ſure is another
matter then a law for a bill of divorce to one woman, married by free
Election, of a humorous and inconstant Man. But ſure I am God
gave no permiſſive law from Heaven, like the law of divorce; for the
hardneſſe of heart, not of the jewes only, but alſo of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
and heathen Kingdomes under a Monarch, That one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
may, be ſuch a Law of God as the law of divorce, kill by bloody cut
throats all the nations that call on God's name, men, women, and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>5. The reaſon which he giveth <hi>Pag.</hi> 64. is the ſame that
<hi>Barclaius</hi> gave viz. <hi>[To what purpoſe should he have written the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:105606:186"/>

King is ſet over them</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10: <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>When there was no pleace
for repentance, no remedy, no uſe of terrifying or diſſwading them, the
only uſe of recording it, was to teach the people their beheaviour towards
their King, and patience under him, and that it should not be free for
them to shake off the yoke of his government, or to offer violence to him
albeit he should overſtretch his power too far. This recorded was not
the law of the King,</hi> Deut. 17. <hi>which was already keeped in the ark
with thereſt of the law.</hi>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though the King was ſet
over them, he had need to have had his duty writen before
him in a book, and keeped to poſterity, no leſſe then the
People should have ſtood in need to have had their duty ſo
recorded. 2. To ſay that it vvas to teach the People their
duty, is but a begging of vvhat is in queſtion: And it is not
probable that <hi>Samuel</hi> vvould vvrite the rules of Tyranny in a
book, and lay it up before the Lord in the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
ſeing he vvas to teach both King and People, <hi>The good
and right way,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12: <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24, 25. 3. The <hi>English An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notators</hi>
tell us on the place, that this manner of the Kingdome
which <hi>Samuel</hi> vvrote, vvas <hi>[Not as it is commonly practiſed,
Chap. 8. ver. 9,</hi>—18. <hi>but as it-ought to be in a lawful and free
Monarchy appoynted by God himſelf, according to the fundamental
lawes of the Kingdome, teaching what dutyes the King ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
in the government of his people, and the people in their ſubjection

<hi>Dutch Annot.</hi> ſay, [<hi>This is not of the way, manner and cuſtome of
actings which Kings ſometimes take up contrary to law, but of the lawes
which</hi> Samuel <hi>by God's inſtinct made or inacted, concerning the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment

God vvould take care of theſe lavves, to uphold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them, and to punish theſe that should vilify and break
them] <hi>Cornel. à Lap.</hi> and <hi>Lyra</hi> ſay the ſame upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Deodat</hi> tells us that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (it was the fundamental lawes of the
Kingdome, inſpired by God to temper Monarchy, with a
liberty befitting God's People &amp; equity toward a nation—
to withſtand the abuſe of an abſolute power.</q>] But this <hi>Surv.</hi>
ſayeth that all this is <hi>but a gueſſe without ground.</hi> But what
are his reaſons? <hi>[Had there</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>been any ſuch ſpecial
fundamental lawes, the Ten Tribes had a faire ground of pleading
upon the ſame, before their revolt, but no ſuch thing is heard of, and
it is as eaſy to deny it, as it is to affirme, that there was any ſuch fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
law] Anſw.</hi> Whether the Ten Tribes did plead
this <hi>in terminis</hi> or not, is not, it is true, aſſerted or heard
of, but it is undenyable that they did plead it upon the matter,
when they required nothing but what was conſonant unto the
law <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and becauſe it was refuſed, they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
free to make choiſe of another King. 2. What more
force hath his denyall then ours? we bring approved authors
for what we ſay, and he ſatisfyeth himſelf with his owne
word, and thinks that that is ſufficient to confute all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators,
even ſuch as himſelf a little thereafter citeth and
approveth in other things <hi>viz Deodat.</hi> What ſayes he more?
<hi>[The People claimed no vote in ſuch fundamental lawes—and it was
their intereſt to be conſulted with in the matter.] Anſw.</hi> The
People were ſo bent to have a King upon any tearmes, that
they conſulted little their owne welfare and faifty. But
<hi>Samuel</hi> was more tender of them, and they might have
concredited that matter unto him, being a Man of approven
integrity, and known to be one that ſought their good, and
had no good will to ſet a King over them. But ſayes he,
<hi>[had they thought of any ſuch Covenants or lawes fundamental, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
liberty might be left them to reſiſt their Kings, or take order with
them, how eaſily could they have shewed the weakneſſe of</hi> Samuel's
<hi>diſſwaſion, and ſaid, if the King be evil, we will reſiſt him] Anſw.</hi>
This was done after the matter was paſt remedy, and a King
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:105606:187"/>
they vvould have, and a King God would give them in his
wrath. 2. We finde <hi>chap. 14.</hi> that they did reſiſt him,
when he was going to shed innocent blood, whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to theſe fundamental lavves or not, is not much
matter.</p>
               <p>6. Though all which he deſireth here, should be granted
to him, he would not gaine his poynt, unleſſe he should
prove that this was a ſtanding precedent to all nations in all
time coming. Which ere he do, he muſt conſider and confute
what worthy and renowned <hi>D. Voetius</hi> hath ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
in his book before cited, diſp. <hi>de Iure Regio Hebraeorum</hi> §. 1.</p>
               <p>What he ſayeth; <hi>Pag.</hi> 68. shall be conſidered in the next

for this windy man would ſeem to be voluminous,
by filling many pages with the ſame things repeated over
and over againe, that if he cannot ſay much for his hire, he
may ſeem to be at ſome paines to ſay many words, and
waſte much paper. And therefore we proceed to take notice
of ſome other objections.</p>

               <head type="sub">Three Principall Objections
Anſwered.</head>
               <p>THere are three grand objections which the <hi>Surveyer,</hi> here
and there throw his pamphlet, maketh uſe of, and which
ſeem to militate againſt ſome of our forementioned argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
as. 1. That there were not (in the caſe now under
debate) inferiour Magiſtrates, a Parliament, or the <hi>primores
Regni,</hi> or the <hi>Epiori,</hi> and States of the Realme, concurring
in that defence: and whatever may be ſaid in the defence of
a warre carryed on by theſe, againſt the illegal violences and
extreame oppreſſions of a prince, will not warrand the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of meer privat perſons. 2. That in the caſe now
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:105606:187"/>
controvetted, it was not the Body of the land or the whole
Community that made this oppoſition to Magiſtrates Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
and inferiour; But only a ſmall inconſiderable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
in reſpect of the whole land: and ſo though it should
be lawful for the whole body of a land to joyne together, to
defend themſelves againſt the tyranny and oppreſſion of a
Prince, without the conduct and concurrence of inferiour
Magiſtrates; yet it will not hence follow, That it is lawful
for any part thereof, to uſe ſuch reſiſtence. 3. That the
party, which lately made oppoſition, had no ſufficient ground
to take armes, ſuppoſe it had been lawful in its owne nature,
there being no ſuch provocking cauſe or occaſion given
by the Prince. And though it should not be thought very
neceſſary to inſiſt on theſe now, ſeing this laſt was ſpoken to
in the clearing of the queſtion, and the firſt was touched alſo
formerly <hi>cap.</hi> 2. And all our arguments conclude for a People
without their <hi>primores</hi> or Parliaments; and So do many
both of our arguments and inſtances adduced, ſpeake clearly
&amp; undenyably, unto the caſe of a conſiderable part, though not
the whole of the community, defending themſelves againſt
manifeſt and unjuſt violence; yet that the matter in hand may
be fully cleared, we shall ſpeak alittle further to theſe three
objections here.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt (though the ſurveyer be <hi>in malâ fide</hi> to make
uſe of it, unleſſe relinquishing all his brethren the Royaliſts,
he grant it lawful for people with a Parliament to reſiſt,
which neither will he nor dar he do; And therefore we
shall ſpeak to this objection, rather for the ſatisfaction of
others.) We deſire theſe things may be conſidered.</p>
               <p>1. That as neceſſity did put people at firſt, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
&amp; election of a Parliament, to manage their affaires,
which they could not ſo conveniently do themſelves, without
confuſion, diſcords, and other inconveniences, which
would necceſſarily attend a communities meeting together,
for carrying of theſe matters: So it was the certane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of their profite and advantage, that did prompt
them unto the ſetling of this frame and conſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:105606:188"/>
2. Whatſoever power theſe Commiſſionated, according
to that frame and model condeſcended upon, had or have,
is not in and from themſelves, but from the People, no leſſe
then the Prince hath his power from the People; as was
shewed above: For no man can imagine any difference, as
to the ſubordinate and inſtrumental riſe of the power, of the
<hi>Prince</hi> and of the <hi>Ephors:</hi> So that as his power is from the
People under God, ſo is the power which they have. <hi>[Theſe
publick Miniſters of the Kingdome (ſayeth</hi> Althuſ. Pol. c. 18. n. 3.)
<hi>are choſen by the united and conſoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ated body of the People preſerve the whole
aſſociated body, and her rights; and are inſtructed with neceſſary
power and authority, which to performe they are obliged by oath.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Hence, really the power of the People is greater then
the power of any delegated or conſtituted by them; for the
cauſe is more then the effect: and the Parliament doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the People, but the People do not repreſente the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
Therefore the power of the People muſt be more.
His povver who doth conſtitute another, or depute him as a
guardian to ſome buſineſſe, or to overſee ſome of his matters,
is greater then any povver, vvhich that other deputed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
Curator hath. Parliaments then being but as Tutors
and Curators unto the People, muſt have leſſe povver then the
People have <hi>[mandans vero) ſayeth</hi> Althuſius pol: c. 18. n. 92.)
<hi>vel injungens alii rerum ſuarum procurationem, eſt inſtar imperantis,
rogantiſve, ſuſcipiens vero talem adminiſtraetionem, inſtar obtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis,
inſervientis, &amp; officium ſuum alteri praeſtantis.]</hi> So that
the Parliament is but a ſervant to the People: and the povver
of a Maſter is alvvayes ſuperiour to the povver of a Servant
as ſuch.</p>
               <p>4. It is irrational to think, that the People in chooſeing
the <hi>Ephori</hi> or Parliament-members, and committing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of their weighty affaires unto them, did
denude themſelves of all that innate and radical power,
which they had to manage their owne matters; ſeing no ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
neceſſity could compel them to it, nor any foreſeen
advantage or profite, which thereby could redound unto
them, move them and perſwade them thereunto: but on
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:105606:188"/>
the contrary, much hazard and diſadvantage might at the
very firſt appeare upon ſuch a ſurrender as this. Much leſſe
could they denude themſelves of that power of ſelf defence,
which by no law of God or man they might law fully give
away.</p>
               <p>5. Whatever power Parliaments have, it is to be exerced
and put in practice for the good and advantage of the People.
Their power is for the profite, and not for the hurt of the
People, and to this ſcope and end should they level all their
labours, travails, paines, endeavours, cares, thoughts,
conſultations, conferences, votes, deliberations and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<hi>L. Imperial. C. de nuptijs L. bene a Zenone C. de quadr.
L. 8. C. de legibus. L. praecipimus 34. C. de appell.</hi> (See <hi>Althuſ. pol. c.</hi> 18. <hi>n. 7:</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>6. Hence Their power is not abſolute, infinite, or unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but hath its owne bounds and limites over which it cannot
lawfully paſſe. They are to rule and do all, for God and the
good of the Realme, whoſe ſervants they are. They are
the Miniſters of God for the Peoples good <hi>Rom. 13. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. When they tranſgreſſe) their true limites (which no man
will ſay is impoſſible) by commanding what God hath
forbidden, or forbidding what God hath commanded in his
holy law: or when they ſeek not the publick good of the
Land, but their ovvne private advantage, They are not, but
ceaſe to be, the Miniſters of God and of the People, and
become private perſons, who ought not, in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
wherein they goe beyond their bounds, to be obeyed:
As ſayeth <hi>Althuſius ubr ſupra n.</hi> 41. and proveth by many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors:
And the reaſon is cleare, for no inferiour can diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul
God's Law, or free us from ſubjection thereunto. They
have no power to command ſin, God never gave them ſuch
a power: And the People could not give it, for they had it
not themſelves, neither had they a power to wronge and
deſtroy themſelves, and ſo they could not give this unto
them.</p>
               <p>8. If theſe <hi>Ephori</hi> or <hi>Truſtees</hi> betray their truſt, and feel or
baſely give away the libertyes and privileges of the people,
which they were intruſted with, the people cannot thereby
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:105606:189"/>
be brought into a remedileſſe condition, or lose their privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
vvithout all hope of recovery. If a Tutor waſte and
deſtroy the Pupil's Eſtate, the law provideth a remedy for
the Pupil: If a commiſſioner or deputy betray his truſt, the
maſter's loſſe thereby is not irremediable: If an advocat
betray a client's cauſe, The client will finde ſome relief.
[<q>The peoples right (ſayeth <hi>althuſius ubi ſupra. n, 124)</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no prejudice, nor doth the Prince—obtaine any
more tyrannical power, by the negligence, perfidy, deceit,
colluſion, treachery, prevarication, and conſpiracy of
the <hi>Ephori</hi> or <hi>primores regni,</hi> with the prince—for it is
unjuſt &amp; abſurd to affirme that the <hi>Ephori (or parliament-men)</hi>
can tranſferre unto the Tyrant, what they never had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or can deſtroy or alienate the rights of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
in prejudice of the whole Realme, and that contrare
to the fundamental lawes of the land, or ſuch, as the prince
ſwore to maintaine, and which containe the ſpirits and life
of the Commonwealth.</q>]</p>
               <p>From theſe irrefragable truthes, ſo conſonant to right
reaſon and atteſted by learned politicians, it will clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
1. That the Peoples caſe is not vvorſe by Parliaments,
then it would have been without them. 2. That Parliaments,
cannot tyrannize by any law or right over People. 3. That
no treachery or perfidy of Parliaments, neglecting their duty
or betraying their truſt, can prejudge the people of their due
rights and privileges. 4. Parliaments not concurring with
the People in their neceſſary defence, cannot looſe them from
the obligation of nature, to defend themſelves from ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and intolerable oppreſſion. 5. If Parliaments in ſtead
of acting the part of Truſtees, Tutors, Curators, Delegats
and Servants, shall turne Tyrants, wolves, Tygers, and
Enemies to the Commonwealth themſelves, of conſpire,
joyne, or enter into a confederacy with a Tyrant, and ſo
ſeek the deſtruction of the community; The community is
allowed to ſee to the preſervation of their owne rights and
privileges, the beſt way they can. 6. And ſo in ſome caſes,
when the hazard is great, the loſſe irreparable, private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:105606:189"/>
may defend themſelves againſt manifeſt Tyranny and
oppreſſion, without Parliaments.</p>
               <p>All this ſeemeth to be cleare and undenyable <hi>In theſt.</hi> Let
us next ſee what way this shall ſute, or what more can be ſaid
for, our caſe, <hi>In hypotheſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And. 1. It is beyond contradiction, that the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did baſely betray its truſt: for politicians tell us, That
it belongeth to theſe <hi>Ephori.</hi> To vindicate and maintaine the
compact and Covenant which is betwixt the Prince and the
People. To keep the prince or the ſupreame adminiſtrator
of juſtice, within his bounds and limites, that he turne not
a tyrant, or an oppreſſour of the People. To hinder him
from violating the law of God. To reſtraine and coërce
him from violating the lawes of the land, and the rights of
the kingdome. To hinder the execution of the unjuſt and
illegal decrees and mandats of the Prince. To defend the
proper and incommunicable rights and privileges of the
People. To cognoſce whether the Supreame Magiſtrate
hath done his duty or not, and to hinder him from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Tyranny. See for these particulars <hi>Althuſius, Pol. c. 18.
n. 48, 55, 63, 65, 68, 83, 84.</hi> Where all theſe are abundantly
confirmed. Now, it is not our to all who conſider either
what they did, or what was enacted by them, and ſtands
regiſtrated to all generations, how the late Convention
(which hardly can be accounted a lawful Parliament) not
only came short of their duty in theſe particulars, but ſtired
a direct contrary courſe, as we shall shew in a few words.
For 1. So far were they from maintaining that compact and
Covenant, which was betwixt the King and the People.
That they declared theſe Covenants and engagements null:
declared the very Parliament and committees, that called
him home and crowned him, null: condemned the very trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
that were had with the King before he came home.
2. So far were they from keeping the Prince within his
bounds and limites; That they ſcrewed up his prerogatives to
the higheſt peg imaginable, and did inveſte him with ſuch an
abſolute unlimited and infinite power, that he might do what
he pleaſed without controle. 3. So far were they from
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:105606:190"/>
hindering him from tranſgreſſing the lawes of God, That they
concurred with him, to enact lawes diametrically oppoſite
to the Law of God, to condemne and overturne the work of
God, To ſet up an abjured prealcy, and force conformity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
beſide other acts which they made to hinder the courſe
of juſtice. 4. So far were they from hindering him from
violating the wholeſome well ſetled and eſtablished lawes of
the land, that they concurred with him to overturne theſe, to
the great loſſe and detriment of the Nation. 5. So far were
they from preſerving the rights of the Kingdome, That they
made a voluntary and baſe ſurrender of theſe unto the pleaſure
and arbitrement of the Prince, in annexing to the crowne
The ſole choiſe and appoyntment of the officers of State and
privy Councellers, and the nomination of the Lords of
Seſſion; in diſchargeing all meetings, Councels, conventions,
or aſſemblies of the People, without the King's command or
expreſſe licenſe: In giving away to him as his right, the
ſole power of raiſeing the Subjects in armes; of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ordering, disbanding and otherwiſe diſpoſeing of them;
And of all ſtrengths, forts, or garriſons within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
all which politicians will grant to be the proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
rights of the Kingdome: 6. So far were they from hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the execution of his unjuſt decrees and mandates,
that whatſoever he pleaſed to command, was by them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
yea and fortified, ſtrengthened and corroborated,
and put into a ſtanding law, how dishonourable ſo ever it
was to God, how repugnant to equity and reaſon, and how
noxious ſoever it might prove to the Nation. 7. So far
were they from deſending the Libertyes and Privileges of the
People, that they baſely gave them away, by denying them
to have any power to defend themſelves againſt manifeſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
or power to call Parliaments or other meetings for
their advantage, in caſes of neceſſity; by giving away to the
King yeerly fourty Thouſand pound Sterline, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishing
of the Nation and redacting it to ſlavery: And
by Tendering unto him all the lives and fortunes of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to maintaine his intereſt; and offering Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
foot men, and two Thousand horſemen ſufficiently arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:105606:190"/>
and furnished with fourty dayes proviſion, to be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
as they shall be called for by his Majeſty, to march to
any part of his three dominions, for any ſervice wherein his
Majeſties honour, authority or greatneſſe might be concerned:
Which how ever it may be coloured with ſpecious pretexts;
yet, al circumſtances conſidered, was nothing but a real manci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the liberties of the People unto the will and pleaſure
of a Prince. 8. And ſo far were they from calling the King to
any account, and from impedeing Tyranny, that in effect
they declared the King exempted from all ſuch tryal or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and that he might exerce what tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
he pleaſed without controle: For they gave unto
him abſolute and unlimited power over all perſones and in all
cauſes; They declared him to have abſolute power to call,
hold, prorogue, and diſſolve Parliaments and Conventions
and Meetings of the Eſtates: And That no acts, ſentences,
or ſtatutes to be paſt in any of theſe meetings, can be bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or have the authority and force of lawes, without his
authority and approbation interponed, at the very making
thereof.</p>
               <p>2. It is notour to all who read their acts, How they have
enacted and concluded things moſt unlawful and unjuſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Law of God and right reaſon: Condemning
Solemne Covenants ſworne by all rankes of People in the
land, in the moſt ſolemne manner; introduceing abjured
Prelates; Eſtablishing tyranny in the Church; condemning
and razeing to the fundation the Covenanted work of God;
enjoyning a conformity unto corrupt courſes; preſſing perjury
and Apoſtaſy, by forceing all in publick places, and
others, to ſubſcribe declarations and oathes, contrary to their
former ſacred and inviolable Covenants and oathes made to
God.</p>
               <p>3. By confirming, ratifying and approveing theſe courſes
of Apoſtaſy and defection, and eſtablishing theſe into lawes,
and binding and forceing the People unto obedience, by their
irrational and inſupportable penalties annexed, They have
laid downe a conſtant courſe for tyranny and oppreſſion of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:105606:191"/>
the People in Eſtates, bodyes, and conſciences, without all
hope of remedy or redreſſe.</p>
               <p>4. As Parliaments with us are not conſtant and fixed courts,
but ambulatory and occaſional, ſo they have laid downe a
courſe, that we shall never have a Parliament that shall red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe
the wrongs, injuries, oppreſſions and tyranny of
Princes; or heare the juſt grievances of the Subjects: For
when the Prince oppreſſeth the People, and turneth a <hi>Nero</hi> and
<hi>a Caligula;</hi> there shall be no remedy, becauſe they have given
him abſolute power to call Parliaments, and who can expect
he will call a Parliament in that caſe? or if he do call, he hath
abſolute power to raiſe them and diſmiſſe them when he will;
and is it probable that he will ſuffer them to ſit when they are
doing any thing againſt him? Or if he should ſuffer them to
ſit, what can they do? None of their ſentences or acts
have power, unleſſe he will add his authority, and will he
ratify or approve any thing that is againſt himſelf, and his
tyrannous will? Beſide, that they have denuded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of all power of ſuppreſſing tyranny, by declareing his
power ſo abſolute and infinite, as that no bounds can be ſet
unto it, no power can ſuppreſſe his tyranny, or call him to an
account.</p>
               <p>5. Not only have they laid downe a courſe that we shall
have no Parliament to interpoſe for the relief of the People, &amp;
to ſuppreſſe Tyranny; But alſo they have laid downe a
courſe that there should be no Magiſtrats in shires or brughs,
that should help, according to their power and place, the
oppreſſed and grieved Subject, and concurre for their relief:
Becauſe all ſuch, ere they be admitted to their places, muſt
conforme unto this abhominable courſe of defection, and by
ſubſcribeing declarations, Binding themſelves by oaths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and oppoſite to the ſolemne Covenants, under which
the Land ſtandeth bound and obliged before the Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
with them in this Apoſtaſy, againſt the intereſt of God
in the Land.</p>
               <p>From all which we think theſe things will clearly follow.</p>
               <p>1. That it may be much doubted if this laſt convention
can be accounted, by any law either of God or Man, a lawful
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:105606:191"/>
Parliament, having ſo palpably betrayed their truſt, in ruleing
not for God and his intereſt, but againſt him, end enacting
things to his dishonour; in ſelling and giving away the old
and undoubted Privileges of Parliament; and in betraying,
dilapidating, diſponeing, and giving away the native and
unqueſtionable Rights and Privileges of the People; and in
overturning the fundamental lawes of the Land; and annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the fundamental article of the compact betwixt King and
People. Seing Politicians will grant, that ſuch are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
but private perſones: though we should make no
mention of other informalities which uſually weaken or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul
the conſtitution of a judicature of that nature, in poynt of
formality; as liberty denyed to ſome shires to chooſe ſuch
members as they thought good; prelimitation uſed to all;
the admiſſion of ſome as members not capable of an election,
according to our ancient and received cuſtome; the denying
of free liberty of debateing, reaſoning, diſſenting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting,
which is allowed in all free Judicatories, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on of matters in a head-ſtrong, violent, and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
manner, without ſuch previous deliberation, or ſerious
conſideration, and pondering the weight and moment of matters,
as would have become a judicature by its conſtitution and
nature ſo ſage and honorable.</p>
               <p>2. The native, ancient and undoubted Privileges of the
People are <hi>de Iure</hi> intire and inviolated, notwithſtanding of
any thing done by this late meeting, which had no power to
do what they did: And therefore could not wronge the rights
and Privileges of the People.</p>
               <p>3. That there is no hope, or humaine probability now
left, that ever the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> shall have a Parliament
by the courſe laid downe or inferiour Judges to reſent the
injuries, oppreſſion and Tyranny done to and exerciſed upon
them; but that ſtill their bands shall be made ſtronger, and
the yoke of oppreſſion and Tyranny wreathed cloſſer about
their neckes. So that there was not, neither is there any
hope (ſo long as this courſe of defection ſtandeth and is not
overturned) that Parliaments now, or the <hi>Primores Regni,</hi>
or inferiour Judges, shall concurre for the ſuppreſſing of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:105606:192"/>
bearing downe of oppreſſion, defection and apoſtaſy,
according as they ought.</p>
               <p>4. That while matters are ſo, the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> are
as if they had no Parliaments, nor inferiour Judges, for that
end; and cannot be ſuppoſed or imagined to be in a worſe
condition, then if they never had had my ſuch, to protect
them from the tyrannical and arbitrary luſt and domination
of Princes. And therefore muſt be allowed to uſe the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
and liberty which nature hath granted unto them, to
defend themſelves from unjuſt tyranny and oppreſſion of
Princes, Parliaments, and inferiour Judicatories, when
their Repreſentatives palpably betray them into the hands of
their adverſaries, yea and conſpire with their adverſaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and their Privileges; and inſtead of Patrons
and defenders of their rights and privileges, turne enemies
thereunto, and take courſes utterly to deſtroy all.</p>
               <p>By this, I ſuppoſe, the firſt Objection is ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
yet I shall adde this word more, and would deſire
that all who are of a contrary judgement would anſwere this
quaeree. Whether or not vvould they think it unlavvful, for
private perſons vvithout a Parliament, privy Council, or
other inferiour Magiſtrates, to reſiſt a Prince, or his Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
if he vvith the conſent of theſe should transferre unto
him ſelf the proper and immediat right unto all the Lands,
Rentes, Tenements, poſſesſions, Heretages, and goods
within the vvhole Land, vvith full povver to ſell, diſpone,
and give avvay the ſame unto whom he pleaſed; and preſently
upon the paſſing of that act, cauſe eject, diſpoſſeſſe and remove
all the preſent heretours and poſſeſſours, or put them to buy
it of nevv of him, or take tackes thereof as takſmen, fermers
or tennents? If they think that in this caſe they might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
reſiſt ſuch horrid tyranny, Then why not in our caſe,
when the People, contrary to all law, oathes and vowes,
are put out of the poſſeſſion of their Covenanted Religion,
reformed in doctrine, worshipe, diſcipline &amp; government, &amp;
that by meer violence and tyranny? Sure ſuch matters as
touch Soul and conſciences, ought to be as deare to People,
as what concerneth their bodyes and eſtates. Or if we
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:105606:192"/>
should put the caſe, That the King were about to ſell the
whole Land unto the Turk, or unto Irish bloody Papiſts,
&amp; by bribes or promiſes, should procure the conſent of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
&amp; the concurrence of Council and other judicatories
(as really upon the matter, walking according to the acts they
have made, he may) Might it be unlawfull for People in this
caſe, without the concurrence of inferiour Magiſtrates, who
had now ſold them, and baſely betrayed their truſt, to ſtand
to their owne defence, and to the defence of their poſterity,
and their lives, rights, liberties and privileges? And if this
cannot be aſſerted by any man, who hath not made a perfect
ſurrender of his owne reaſon, unto the will and luſt of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
why can reſiſtence in our caſe be condemned: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſoul matters are of infinite more worth, then theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things; And it were leſſe bitter to know and ſee our
poſterity redacted into a ſtate of perfect ſlavery unto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners,
as to their outward privileges, them to ſee them
shut up into a cloſſe priſon of ſoul ſlavery and bondage,
deſtitute of the pure and lively ordinances of ſalvation, and
fruſtrated of the glorious and excellent liberties and effects of
a purely preached goſpell, and ſo shut up in a dungeon of
ignorance, ſuperſtition, and all Prophanity, that they
should never know what true liberty meaneth?</p>
               <p>As for the next objection taken from this, that they were
not the Whole Body of the land, but only a part thereof,
which cannot be ſo well juſtified. It may eaſily be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
That it being lawful for a ſingle perſone, in ſome
caſes, to defend himſelf from unjuſt violence: It will be much
more lawful for a conſiderable part of a Kingdome to defend
themſelves, though they get not help of others. Though all
be bound to help a ravished maide, yet though none should
help, she may reſiſt and defend herſelf. But to leave this,
becauſe we have adduced many arguments that concludes the
caſe lawful even for a part of the Kingdome, we shall ſpeak
to the complex caſe, not only as it was a defence but alſo a
probable meane to put a ſtop unto the courſe of defection.
Which was and is carryed on; and to redeem the land from
ſpiritual bondage and ſlavery, as well as bodily. And to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:105606:193"/>
this we ſay. That when the caſe is a publick caſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the land, no leſſe then theſe who jeoparded their lives
for the ſame, no man in reaſon can condemne theſe few that
undertooke the interpriſe, the profitable effects of which
would have redounded to the whole: When a city is on fire,
no man will think the few that hazard their lives, to quench
the ſame, are to be blamed, though the reſt doe lye by, and
will not concurre. The men of <hi>Ephraim, Benjamin</hi> and
<hi>Iſſacher,</hi> who followed <hi>Deborah</hi> and jeoparded their lives upon
the high places of the field, that they might deliver the
whole land from under the Tyrranny of <hi>Iabes</hi> King of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
though <hi>Reuben God</hi> and <hi>Zebulon</hi> did not concurre, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their duty, were not the more to be blamed, but are
the more praiſed and commended; and ſuch as came not put
to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty were under a bitter
curſe. The common tye of Chriſtianity and brotherhood
and other ſupervenient obligations did oblige all the Land (as
was shewed above) to concurre as one man, to endeavour the
deliverance of he Land from dreadful oppreſſion and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and becauſe the greateſt part, like <hi>Iſſacher</hi> in an other caſe,
loved to couch under the burden, and refuſed to contribut
their help for their owne delivery, and proved enemies, shall
theſe few who ventured their lives and Eſtates, and all which
they had, for the liberation of the land, be the more, upon
that account, condemned? What hight of abſurdity were
this? Had the Men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> good reaſon to challenge
<hi>Iephthah Iudg. 12: ver. 1, 2. &amp;c.</hi> becauſe he fought with the
Midianites without them, when he ſayes, that he had called
them and they would not come out? If an Enemy invade
the land, and ſuch provinces as are furtheſt from danger shall
neglect or refuſe to concure with the reſt to expell them,
yea shall ſtrengthen the invadeing enemy, shall theſe be
blamed who are next to the danger, to take the alarme
at the firſt, and do what in them lyeth, for their owne
ſaifty and the ſaifty of the whole land? Therefore, ſeing
the cauſe which theſe few owned was of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
and equally reſpecting the whole land, ſince
the reſt would not concurre, as they were bound to do,
they are more praiſe-worthy then blame-worthy that ventured
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:105606:193"/>
all for the good of the whole land, and did what
in them lay, to redeem the whole land from that oppreſſion
and bondage, under which it was lying. If it had been ſome
ſmall petty particulare of their owne, it had been more
lyable to the cenſures of men; but the cauſe being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
which they did owne, (a Covenant ſworne by all
ranks of People, and a Covenanted work of reformation,
and liberty from tyranny both in Church and State, was a
cauſe not peculiar unto them, but common to all the land,)
it is the hight of abſurdity, illegality, yea and inhumanity, to
accuſe them of Treason of ſedition, or to condemne their
interpriſe upon that account. So that though the major part
of the land turne ſo corrupt, as to imbrace a corrupt abjured
courſe, ſee their privileges taken from them, the vvork of
God overthrovvne, lavves ratifying and approving Religion
reformed in doctrine vvorshipe diſcipline and government,
and ſecureing people in their peacable and Chriſtian poſſeſſion
of theſe, novv abolished reſcinded and annulled; their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,
as civil ſcotish men, and as Chriſtians, ſold avvay; their
fundamental compact, and the cardinall clauſe of that contract
betvvixt King and Subject, cancelled and shamefully brocken;
Tyranny and oppreſſion of conſciences, bodyes and Eſtates
eſtablished; and no legal remedy or redreſſe apparent or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
and shall notwithſtanding of all this, love to ſit ſtill &amp;
not to be ſtirr themſelves, according to their places &amp; power,
for ſecureing Religion, lawes, &amp; libertyes; For extirpating ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
prelacy, and malignancy; and reſtoreing the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Chriſt to their wonted purity, &amp; delivering the land
from ſlavery &amp; bondage, &amp; from ſtupenduous apoſtaſy &amp; defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
at which the Heavens may ſtand aſtonished, and all
men and angels may wonder: Shall their negligence and
deficiency in duty, binde up the hands of the wel affected,
and render them utterly incapable in law, to minde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and the good of the whole land, the good whereof
they are obliged by many bonds and obligations to ſeek by
all farie meanes poſſible? Neither doth the lawes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the lawes of God, nor particularly the bond of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
love to their Native land, to their Mother Church,
and to their Chriſtian oppreſſed brethren, nor the bond of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:105606:194"/>
their Covenants, ſolemne vowes and engadgments, ſo limite
this duty, and looſe them from all endeavour after a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
But by the contrare, if God give any probable
capacity, upon all theſe conſiderations, they are the more
obliged to lay out themſelves to the utmoſt, and to account
themſelves the more indiſpneſably obliged thereunto, that
as the hazard is greater, the loſſe is the more certane and
irrecoverable. Wherefore, ſeing the ground and ends of the
riſeing of these few, was not particular, but general and
national, the good and benefite of the interpriſe redounding
unto all, no leſſe then to themſelves, and being that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
all, no leſſe then they, were obliged by ſolemne vowes
and moral bonds, their caſe muſt be otherwise conſidered,
then the caſe of a few malcontented perſons, who becauſe of
ſome particular injuries done to themſelves and for ſome
particular ends proper and peculiar to themſelves alone, ariſe
in rebellion againſt the lawful Magiſtrate. The Royaliſts
themſelves allow it lawful for any privat perſon to kill an
uſurper or a Tyrant <hi>ſine titulo,</hi> and why? But becauſe the
good of this action doth redound not to himſelf alone. But
to the whole Land; So in ſome places a reward is promiſed to
all ſuch as shall kill a <hi>Bear,</hi> or any ſuch noyſome beaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the good and frute of this action concerneth moe then
themſelves, and therefore though all were bound to do what
they did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they are not blamed but rewarded for what they
have done. So should theſe rather have been revvarded then
blamed or condemned, for vvhat they did interpriſe, for
the univerſal and national good of the vvhole Land.</p>
               <p>As for the third Objection, ſo much hath been ſpoken of
that already; whether we mean the particular ſufferings and
oppreſſions of the People of Galloway, (The <hi>Naphtaly</hi> is
full to this purpoſe,) or the general calamity, by reaſon of
apoſtaſy, defection, perjury &amp; oppreſſion in Religion and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertyes,
which is ſo noture that none who hath not renunced
common ſenſe together with Religion &amp; honeſty, can deny it,
or pretend ignorance thereof, that we need do no more here,
but give a short reply to what the <hi>Surv.</hi> hath ſaid to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
only we would adde this. That if That learned lawyer <hi>Althuſius</hi>

of a Tyrant, and of Tyranny, we may have good ground
to ſay that our land beareth many blae marks of that tyranny:
for, ſayeth he [there is one kinde of Tyranny, which conſiſteth
in violating, changeing or removing of <hi>fundamental lawes,
ſpecially ſuch as concerne Religion: &amp; ſuch,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>was</hi> Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
Philip <hi>the King of</hi> Spaine, <hi>who contrare to the fundamental Belgick
lawes, did erect an adminiſtration of juſtice by force of armes; and
ſuch was</hi> Charles <hi>the IX.</hi> of <hi>France that thought to overturne the
Salicque law</hi>] and whether our King be not in this guilty in
overturning the fundamental lawes, concerning our reformed
Religion, let the world judge. Next ſayes he [<hi>when he keepeth not
his faith and promiſe, but deſpiſeth his very oath made unto the people.</hi>]
and who is more guilty of this then King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> n. 9.
He giveth us this mark [<hi>when the ſupreme Magiſtrate marketh uſe
of an abſolute power, and ſo breaketh all bands for the good of humane
ſociety</hi>] and are not the bonds both of piety and juſtice novv
violated? n. 11. He tels us <hi>a Tyrant doth take away from one
or moe member of the Commonwealth, free exerciſe of the orthodox

n. 10 [<hi>who hindereth the free ſuffrages of Members of Parliament, ſo
that they dare not ſpeak what they would.</hi>] &amp; how much of this we
finde to be true, in needleſſe here to expreſſe. Then n. 23,
24, &amp;c. he tels us [<hi>he is a Tyrant who takes away from the people
all power, to reſist his tyranny, as armes, ſtrengthes, and chief men,
whom therefore though innocent, he hateth, afficteth and perſecuteth,

which he confirmeth by ſeveral Scriptures: And how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
theſe are to our preſent caſe, all know who is not an

many things to alledge, none can juſtly blame us for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that vve are oppreſſed and borne dovvne vvith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
tyranny; and now we goe on to conſider what
he ſayes.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt he tells us, <hi>Pag. 68. [That their life and
blood was not ſought upon any tearmes, there was no forceing them to
idolatry, nor falſe worſhipe, nor frighting them to any thing of that
kinde, upon paine of their lives; only for contempt of the outward
ordinances of God, purely adminiſtred in an orthodox Church, they
were put to pay ſuch moderate fines, as the publick lawes had appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Without any actual invaſion of them or their perſones. They
were the first aggreſſors, murthering the Kings Servants, and ſeiſeing
on his chief officer. They had never before that aſsayed ſupplicating,
(which was not forbidden them to do, if ſo be they would have done
it without tumults and combinations) but flew to the ſword and
marched on to mock authority with armed petitions, as they mocked
God by ſinful prayers, to proſper their evil courſe.] Anſw.</hi> 1.
What intention there was to ſeek the life and blood of theſe
People, God koweth: But ſure all who knew their caſe,
ſaw that their life was only left them, that they might feel
their miſery. So were they oppreſſed and haraſſed, that
death would have been choſen rather then life. Were they
not beaten, wounded, and bound as beaſts, their goods and
ſubſtance devoured before their eyes? were not their lands
and tenements laid waſte, and many redacted to beggary?
Beſides other inhumane barbarityes, which they were made
to ſuffer. 2. We ſee he would allow it lawful to reſiſt, if
the King should force to idolatry and falſe worship, and
what will he do then with his arguments, which will not
allow that exception, as they are urged by him? He muſt
neceſſarily grant that they are inconcludent, &amp; that it holdeth

beit they were not forced to idolatry; yet by the ſame law,
reaſon and equity (or rather Tyranny and inquity) they
might have been forced to that, as to what they were forced.

wicked and debauched Curates, thruſt in upon them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare

was abjured, and caſt out of the Church with deteſtation,
and ſo to concurre in their places and ſtations with, and give
their teſtimony unto, a moſt wicked and unparallelable courſe
of defection and Apoſtacy from God, and his holy wayes
and works; and thereby to condemne the Reformation of
Religion in doctrine, Worshipe, Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which God had vvonderfully vvrought amongſt us,
and vvhich all ranks of People vvere ſolemnely ſvvorne to

of God purely adminiſtred; vvhen all knovv how
theſe profane vvretches, made all vvho, ever knevv vvhat the
ſervice of the true and living God vvas, to abhore the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Lord: For they deſpiſed the Name of the Lord,
and offered polluted bread upon his altar, and made the table
of the Lord contemptible, they offered the blinde, the
lame, and the ſick, and torne, and thus they vovved &amp;
ſacrificed unto the Lord a corrupt thing: Yea their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of ordinances vvas, and is to this day, rather like
hiſtrionick acts, and ſcenes, then the ſervice of the true and
living God: And vvhat ſober ſerious Chriſtian, yea vvhat
ſoul that hath any beleeving apprehenſions of the Majeſty of
God, can be vvitneſse, let be a concurring actor in, and
conſenter unto, ſuch abhomination and idol-like Worshipe?
5. He talkes of an orthodox Church, vvherein perjury and
ſuch like abhominations are approved and countenanced,
maintained and avovved; and vvherein the vvork of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion, in Doctrine, Worshipe, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Government is condemned; a Covenant abjureing
Popery, Prelacy, Prophaneſſe, Schiſme and Hereſy, and
whatſoever is contrary to ſound doctrine, and the power of
godlineſſe, condemned and annulled; and wherein Atheiſme,
wickednesse, ignorance, licentiouſneſse, and all ſort
of prophanity, yea and blaſphemy aboundeth, and wherein
there is ſo much Popery and idolatry countenanced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
at, and ſuch abhominations reigneing. Our firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:105606:196"/>
of faith recorded in Parliament <hi>Cap. 18.</hi> giveth this as
one note of a true Church viz. That in it <hi>Eccleſiasticall Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
be uprightly ministred, as God's Word preſcribeth, whereby vice is
repreſſed &amp; vertue nourished!</hi> But now there is a diſcipline repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Gods Word adminiſtred, whereby vice is nourished &amp;
virtue ſuppreſſed. 6. He ſayes that the fines were moderate?
But more immoderate fines, and exorbitant penaltyes, vvere
never impoſed by Rulers, except ſuch whoſe deſigne was to
Tyrannize over the ſoules and conſciences of poor people:
and to the payment of theſe tranſcendently exorbitant penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,
they were conſtrained, not in a legal manner, as it ought
to be in a civil and free republick, but in a military, compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
conſtraineing way, whereby their perſones and goods
were tyrannically and inhumanely invaded, plundered, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and ruined. 7. It is true, providence ſo ordered
it, that the firſt that was vvounded was one of the ſouldiers:
But <hi>Naphtali</hi> tels him that the countrey men were neceſſitated
thereto in their ovvne defence; for vvhen they but deſired
the ſouldiers to looſe the poor man, vvhom they had bound
hand and foot like a beaſt, they vvere aſſaulted vvith
drawne ſwords; and ſo firſt and laſt they vvere invaded, and
provocked, &amp; were not the firſt aggreſſours: &amp; beſide, that
was but a meer accidental emergent: &amp; though they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
without that occurrent provocation, joyned together
to have repelled unjuſt violence, none in reaſon could have
called them the firſt aggreſſours, being ſo long before that
time, at two inrodes, beſide this laſt, ſo barbarouſly and
inhumanely uſed by <hi>Sr Iames Turner</hi> that bloody executioner
of illegal tyranny, and brutish beaſtly <hi>Doeëg,</hi> who having
renunced all humanity &amp; compaſſion, raged like a wilde beare
to the laying waſte of that countrey ſide. So that here was no
violent re-offending uſed without a previous actual invaſion,
made by companyes of armed men, ſent to eat up, root out and
deſtroy a worthy and precious countrey-ſide <hi>An imminent
danger</hi> ſayes the law, is a ſufficient ground to take up armes,
and that is <hi>not previous ſtrokes</hi> but <hi>the terrour of armour or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
L. ſed &amp; ſi. ff. ad Leg. Aquil. l. 3. quod qui armati ff. de vi
&amp; vi armâta.</hi> Sure here was enough to warrand a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:105606:196"/>
to ſtand to their defence, and to prevente their utter
ruine and deſtruction, which was certanely expected, and
this was to them the laſt and moſt inexorable caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And ſo the places which he citeth out of <hi>Lex Rex</hi> do
partly confirme this, and partly are not to the purpoſe, being
ſpoken of a ſingle perſon buffeting his maſter after he hath
been buffeted, or having received deaths wounds, ſeeketh to
revenge himſelf on his aggreſſor. 8. He tels us they should
have firſt ſupplicated theſe in power: But they had ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
already <hi>Sr Iames Turner,</hi> and their caſe was made worſe
and not the better thereby, and all joynt petitioning was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as treaſonable, and what could they then have done?
The moſt peacable manner of ſupplicating, if it had been in
a joynt manner, that could have been deviſed, had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
tumultuous. And Since it was ſo, what could they
do, but after the example of our progenitors, advance with
armes in the one hand and a petition in the other? 9. The
Prophane man talks of their mocking God by their prayers,
and of their ſpoyling loyal perſons: but as they have the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of all among whom they were, that they were not to
be charged with plundering, taking nothing unleſſe it were
a few horſes, and ſuch things as were neceſſary for the defence
of their lives, and for the welfare of the Countrey, wherein
many do ſuppoſe they were but too too ſpareing, ſeing the
benefite was common to all, and they were to venture their
lives, not for themſelves alone, but for the whole Countrey:
So the Lord gave proof that he hath accepted their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
though it was not his appoynted time to reſtore our
Kingdome, in that he did ſo ſignally ovvne and countenance
ſuch as vvere honoured vvith martyrdome, for the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Ieſus, and for his intereſt and cauſe. But this man
ſpeakes like himſelf vvhen he addeth <hi>that both they and others
have cauſe to bleſſe God that they had no ſucceſſe, which might have been
a ſnare and ſtumbling block to them and others alſo.</hi> For vve knovv
indeed that it is no ſmall mercy, not to thrive in an evil vvay,
and therefore vve think that He and his vvicked fraternity, on
whom the Lord is raineing ſnares, by ſuffereing them to thrive,
have great cauſe to lament the blak day that is coming, and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:105606:197"/>
to tremble both for the imminent judgments, and for the
dreadful plague and judgement of hardneſſe of heart, vvith
vvhich they are already viſited of the righteous God; Yet
vve knovv That a vvay may be his vvay, vvhich he vvill not
proſper for a time, till the cup of the <hi>Amorites</hi> be full, and
he hath attained his other holy ends, vvhich he deſigneth in
caſting his Church into a furnance: And if he judge of cauſes
alvvayes by the event, he shevveth himſelf a ſtranger to the
Soveraigne vvay of the Lord, in all ages.</p>
               <p>As to other thing, he ſpeaketh <hi>Pag. 10.</hi> and ſayeth
(<hi>doth not the true proteſtant Religion as it is held forth inſcripture, and

and invite all, according to his power, to imbrace it? Is
he not willing and deſirous that the lawes be vigorouſly executed againſt
papiſts, and all perverters of this ſound doctrine? are any ſpoiled
of their lawful civil libertyes? What one thing hath he done without
conſent of the Peoples Repreſentatives in Parliament, at which any
may except as a grievance? what burden hath he laid upon their Eſtates,
but by law or by their owne conſent, in a neceſſary exigence? Anſw. 1.</hi>
If the proteſtant Religion continue without variation, in the
leaſt, vvhat meaneth then the bleating of the sheep and
lowing of the oxen; in every ones eares? what meaneth the
many Jeſuites, and Seminary Prieſts that goe up and downe
the land? what meaneth the many maſſes that are uſed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of that land, and in the very heart thereof, in and
about Edinbrough? What church diſcipline is uſed againſt
theſe? belike the Prelates have no will to trouble their old
brethren, the native and faithful children of their catholick
Mother, the whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they minde, yet once
againe, to take a drink of the cup of her fornications, and
to returne as prodigal Children unto their former dear
Mother, the bloody harlote, the mother of fornications.
And hovv cometh it that one <hi>Mr. Tyry,</hi> formerly a knovvn
papiſt, is admitted to a prefeſſorshipe in St. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> vvho
not only cannot be reconciled to that miniſter who motioned
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:105606:197"/>
the giving to him, that <hi>Head</hi> to handle <hi>de anticbristo Romano,</hi>
but even in his <hi>theſes</hi> did aſſert that the <hi>Pope</hi> was not Antichriſt.
But what is become of the Religion of the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
as it was reformed in doctorine, worshipe, diſcipline and
government? What is become of theſe Covenants vvhich
were our ſtrong bulvvarks againſt propery? and vvhat is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the many acts of Parliament ratifying and approving
theſe Covenants? Are not all theſe caſt avvay? are not vve
caſt open unto the aſſaults of that bloody Beaſt? what meaneth
the great increaſe of the number of papiſts, ſo that the
very Parliament it ſelf, in their ſtatute 8. ſeſſ. I. (a mok-act
never put into execution) ſayd that <hi>the number of Ieſuites,
Priests, and Papiſts did now abound more, then ever they did under
the Government of his father and grand father?</hi> What meaneth
the reſcinding and anulling the firſt act of the 12. <hi>parl</hi> of K.
<hi>Iames</hi> 6. holden <hi>Anno 1592. in all the heads clauſes and articles
thereof,</hi> in their <hi>act. 1 ſeſſ. 2.</hi> whereas that act did not alſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
and approve presbyterial government; but did alſo ratify
and approve all privileges, libertyes, immunityes, and
freedoms, granted by his hieghneſſe his Regents, in his name,
or any of his predeceſſours, to the true and holy Kirk eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
within the Realme, and declared in the firſt act of
Parliament <hi>Anno 1597.</hi> and all and whatſomeever acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and ſtatutes, made before by his Highneſſe and his
Regents, anent the liberty, and freedome of the ſaid Kirk;
and particularly the firſt act of <hi>parl Anno 1581.</hi> and all other
particular acts there mentioned: and this act <hi>Anno 1581.</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth
all preceeding acts, particularly that made in the reigne
of Queen <hi>Mary, Anno 1567.</hi> anent abrogating all lawes, acts
and conſtitutiones, canons civil and municipal, with other
conſtitutions contrare to the Religion then profeſſed, and all
poſteriour acts namely ſuch as abolished the <hi>Pope</hi> and his
uſpurped authority; that anulled the acts made againſt God's
word and for maintainance of Idolatry, the act ratifying the
confeſſion of faith of the proteſtants of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the act a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bolishing
the Maſſe, and for punishing hearers and ſayers
of the ſame: acts made, anent the admiſſion of them that shall
be preſented to benefices having cure of miniſtry; anent the

King's oath to be given at his coronation; anent ſuch as

ſchools; anent the juriſdiction of the Kirk; anent the true

true Kirk of God and Religion; anent ſuch as are declared
not to be of the true Church: And alſo the ſaid act An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
1592. ratifieth all other acts made in favours of the
Kirk, ſince the yeer 1581. So that by this late <hi>Act</hi> made
<hi>Anno 1662.</hi> all the acts made in favours of the Church
and of the proteſtant Religion, are annulled and reſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
for there is no exception added, but the ſaid act in
all its heads, clauſes and articles, is declared null and
voide. Where is then our legall ſecurity for our proteſtant
Religion, and Libertyes of the Church? Sure theſe things
preſage no good to the proteſtant Religion. But 2. What
way the King doth advance this bleſſed truth of the ſaving
goſpel (if he meane hereby the proteſtant Religion) we
are to learne: For his publishing in print that the Papiſts
have been faithful ſubjects to him and his father, whileſt
others, under pretence of Religion, had involved the
Kingdomes in blood; and by theſe Papiſts meaning with
others the irish rebells, who, for promoving the Romish
bloody deſigne, executed that bloody Maſſacre in <hi>Irland:</hi>
the report whereof made all proteſtants to tremble and to
ſtand aſtonished, giveth us but ſmall hopes, that ſo long as
he is of that minde, he shall ever do any thing effectually
for promoving or maintaineing the Proteſtant intereſt: His
advanceing of Papiſts to greateſt places of publick power
and truſt <hi>England,</hi> in Parliament, Council, Court, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyes,
and the Army, ſpeakes rather an encourageing and
inviteing of perſons to turn Roman Catholicks: His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videing
a houſe for Fathers and friers ſpeaks out no good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and deſigne. Let the <hi>Surveyer</hi> read what is ſaid to
this purpoſe in the Preface to <hi>Naphtaly.</hi> 3. He tells us that
the King is willing and deſirous, that the lawes be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
againſt Papiſts and perverters of ſound doctrine; But
how cometh it then, that there are no ſayers of Meſſe and
ſeminary Prieſts ſentenced, according to the law? Did
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:105606:198"/>
ever the King write to the Council for ſuppreſſing of Popery.
as effectually as he hath done for ſuppreſſing of conventicles?
Or did he ever chide the Council, or depoſe any member
thereof, or any other inferiour Magiſtrate, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their negligence in this? But be it whoſe fault
it will, ſure we are there is more care taken to ſearch
out conventicles, then the meetings of Papiſts or Quakers:
Is the Towne of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> under ſuch a bond to ſuppreſſe
meetings for Maſſe, and others of the like nature; as they
are for ſuppreſſing of honeſt Proteſtants, meeting for the
Worshipe of God according to the purely reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
Did ever any Arch-Prelate procure an order from
his Majeſty to ſtirr up the leazye council to diligence in this
matter? Wherein I pray doth either the Kings willingneſse,
or the vvillingneſse of the Council, or of other Inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
to have the lawes againſt Prieſts vigorouſly put into
execution, appear? And where are we then, when all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
from the higheſt to the loweſt connive at, if not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
countenance and approve of Papiſts, and Popish
idolatry; and the true Worshipers of God are hunted out,
caſt into priſones, banished into <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Tangyr,</hi> and made
to ſuffer ſuch inhumane Barbarities, and all to pleaſure the
perjured Prelates, who are more afrayed of a few honeſt ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of God, then if legions of Papiſts were ſwarming in the
Land, knowing how ſoon, they would be willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
theſe ſerpents in their boſome, and joyne with them
to root out the Proteſtant intereſt; whileas they hate the
truly godly with a perfect hatred, as being of principles irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
with theirs, and having ends before their eyes
diametrically oppoſite to what theſe intend? Yea, where
are we, when almoſt all the Rules propoſed by <hi>Adam Cont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>
the Jeſuite, for introduceing of Popery, in his <hi>Polit.
Lib. 2. Cap.</hi> 18. are ſo exactly followed: as when he adviſeth
that. 1. They proceed as muſitians do in tuneing their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
gradually, and piece by piece. 2. That they preſſe
the Examples of ſome eminent Men as a meane to draw the
reſt. 3. That Arch-heretikes (that is moſt Zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants)
be banished all at once, or if that cannot be done
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:105606:199"/>
ſaifly, by degrees. 4. That ſuch be put from their dignities,
and all place &amp; power of truſt. 5. That Proteſtant Religion
be made odious, by loading ſuch of their opinions, as are
moſt obvious to a harsh conſtruction. 5. That they foment
the quarrels that are among Proteſtant, and ſtrengthen that
party that is moſt ready to comply with <hi>Rome.</hi> 7. That they
diſcharge and hinder all private conventicles of Proteſtants.
8. That ſevere Lawes be made, and rigorouſly executed
(though not againſt all, yet) againſt the moſt dangerous.
Who ſeeth not, what a conformity there hath been and yet is,
betwixt the practices of this Apoſtate, Popish, Prelatical and
Malignant faction, which hath now deſtroyed the work of
God, and thoſe Rules mentioned? And what lyeth latent
under board the Lord knoweth. 4. He asketh the queſtion if
any of the People of the Land be ſpoiled of their lawful civil
libertyes? As if a man should enquire if the Sun were riſen
at twelve houres of the day. Our Religion reformed in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Worshipe, Diſcipline and Government, which was
one of our maine civil &amp; moſt lawful libertyes, is taken from
us. The liberty of ſupplicating, which the Law of God, the
Law of Nature, and the Law of Nations allow, it taken from
us. The liberty of free election of Members of Parliament,
was taken away. Liberty of proteſting in Parliament was
taken away. The Kings prerogative is ſcrewed up to ſuch a
hieght, that it overturnes the true native libertyes of the
Subjects Many honeſt Subjects are caſt into priſone, no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
being once alledged far leſſe proved againſt them.
The due exerciſe of their Religion as was covenanted, is
taken away, Lawes are not executed in a civil manner, as they
ought to be among free Subjects. Iudicatories are ſet up
and erected without the conſent of the People, or their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives.
Libertyes and Privileges of brughes and ſuch
incorporations are taken away, unleſse they will renounce
and abjure a lawful, religious, and neceſsary Covenant.
The free exerciſe of juſtice eſpecially againſt Nobles, is ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
The Lieges are not ruled by the Lawes of the Land, but
by the arbitrary will and luſt of few Prelates and the privy
Council. Will he ask now if our libertyes be taken from us?
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:105606:199"/>
or will he call theſe unlawful? 5. He asketh in the next place,
what one thing the King hath done, without conſent of the
Peoples Repreſentatives in Parliament, at vvhich any may
except as a grievance. It ſeemeth he is either of a very short
Memory, or he thinks the High commiſſion-court a very
ſmall inconſiderable buſineſſe; for the conſent of Parliament
vvas never had unto this inquiſition-court, neither of old,
nor of late: And yet this was ſuch an heavy yoke of bondage,
that made all the land to groan, and againſt which, as a moſt
intolerable grievance, all the corners of the countrey could
give in their exceptions. And as for this late Repreſentative
(ſo called,) they have enacted many things contrare to their
power and turſt, as vve have shewed: No power under
heaven could enact what they have enacted: No power
under heaven could anul, condemne, and reſcinde lawful
Covenants made with the moſt high God: They were not
<hi>in tuto</hi> to reſcinde and anull unalterable lawes, more firme
and fixed, then any Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> For
lawes confirmed with oathes, and ſolemne vowes to God,
are not ambulatory, as other politick lawes. And therefore all
the lawes being good and neceſſary in their owne nature,
by the ſupervenient addition of an oath confirming and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the ſame, became abſolutely unalterable by any Man
or company of Men whatſoever. So that all the lawes made
by King and Parliament to the prejudice of the Covenanted
work of reformation, are intolerable grievances, dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to God, and prejudicial to the welfare of the Subject;
and to which, neither People, nor their Repreſentatives
real of ſuppoſed, could ever lawfully conſent. 6. He asketh
what burden he hath laid upon their Eſtates, but by Law?
But this is a vaine florish, ſeing all that know what that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was, know how prone and ready it was, to devote
(if it could) unto the luſt of the King, the Souls, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
Eſtates, and all which the Subjects had, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gairding
either the true liberty or reall advantage of the
People.</p>

the good of the People. The ſame is alſo cleare from the
following obſervations, which do manifeſtly poynt at the
clearing of people being bound in duty to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Religion, conforme to their engagements
vowes and Covenants, which ſtill ſtand in force, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of any thing done to the contrary of late, in their acts
reſciſſory and condemnatory.</p>
               <p>3. The very words themſelves, to any who is not utterly
blinded with prejudice, can import no more then that, when
through the notorious and mainfeſt perverſion of the great
ends of ſociety and government, the bond thereof is
diſſolved, and the perſons now relapſeing into their Primeve
liberty and privilege, may no leſſe now joyne and aſſociate
together, to defend Themſelves and their Religion, then
at firſt they entered into ſocietes: For, as their entering into
ſocieties was for this end, and their ſetting up of Magiſtrates
over themſelves was for this end; ſo when the Magiſtrates
croſſe their end and rule, and thereby annul the relation, or
make it invalide for the ends, they may joyne together now
for theſe ends, as they might have done before the formal
inſtitution of Government. And who can deny this to be a
truth? Or who can hence inferre (but he who is of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
ſpirit, and for his perverſe ends ſeeketh to pervert all
things) that he pleadeth for the lawfulneſſe of Peoples crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

4. Suppoſe the words should be capable of that gloſſe'
which the <hi>Surveyer</hi> putteth upon them; yet as they lye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with what preceedeth and with what followeth they
can, at moſt, be but a <hi>Medium</hi> for proving the intended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion;
and ſo muſt be conſidered as founding an argument
<hi>a Majori ad minus,</hi> from the more to the leſſe; to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
if when through the manifeſt and notorious perverſion
of the great Ends of ſociety and government, the bond
thereof is diſſolved, and perſons relapſe into their primeve
liberty, ſo that according as the ſimilitude of their caſe, and
exigence of their cauſe requireth, upon the ſame principles,
they may againe aſſociate and combine into new and diſtinct
Societies and Commonwealthes, for their defence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:
Then much more may they lavvfully novv joyne
and aſſociate together for their defence and preſervation,
without making any ſuch rupture, or new erections: but
endeavouring to keep the old Society firme and intire, undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and unweakened. So that though his gloſſe should
be admitted, he doth but bewray the ignorence of his capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
braine, to take the <hi>Medium</hi> for the concluſion. And
the antecedent will be granted by politians, and is expreſly
aſſerted by <hi>Althuſius, Polit, Cap. 20. Num. 20.</hi> in caſe the
Prince keep not his promiſe, but violate his faith and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>5. Suppoſe alſo that this which he alledgeth had been the
authors poſitive aſſertion, can he hence inferred with any
colour of reaſon, that it was or is the deſigne of the author
and his party, to diſſipate and diſſolve the old ſetled frame
of this Kingdome, and erect new Commonvvealthes vvith
nevv diſtinct Soveraignes? Seing every one knovveth,
that many things are lavvful, vvhich are not expedient, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
nor neceſſary; &amp; that it vvere the reſult of no mature
deliberation, but of madneſſe and folly, to intend and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
ſuch a thing. vvhich (though lavvful in it ſelf, yet) all
things conſidered vvere, very inexpendient and unneceſſary,
yea not only not advantageous to their ends and purpoſes, but
quite deſtructive thereof.</p>

Novv ſince the <hi>Surveyer</hi> hath dravvne in this controverſy
by the eares, and ſet it in the front of his learned and elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
pamphlet, vve muſt ſuppoſe him one vvho is vvell verſed
in this topick, and can give a good account of his politick
notions touching this quaeſtion. But alas if he had a real
adverſary to deal vvith (as novv he doth but faigne one to

our ovvne making) his ridiculous and yet audacious folly,
vvould eaſily be made to appear: his adverſary vvould laugh
(as indeed he vvould have cauſe) at the shakeing of his
ſpear.</p>
               <p>He maketh this the <hi>theſis</hi> which he undertaketh to confirme.
That [<hi>when politick bodyes are ſetled in voluntary aſſociations, or
whatever way in the courſe of divine providence, they have been reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to live under the ſame lawes and authorities, and have continued
long in the union of a common interest, under the protection of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,
to break off from the body in ſeditious ſeceſſions, cannot but
be diſpleaſing to God; and they are no other then firebrands, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of humane ſociety, fighters against God and his ordinance,
who inſtigate People to cut off themſelves from the body of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth whereof they are members.</hi>] But would not his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tell him that he had granted as much in the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
preceeding, as would make him and his poſition both
ridiculous: For he hath granted <hi>That the Lord hath not by
any precept particularly determined the bounds of every embodied Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
ſociety,</hi> There <hi>being some greater, and ſome leſſer, acting
under their ſeveral heads and ſouveraigne Magiſtrates.</hi> And ſeing
neither God nor Nature hath determined the quantity and
extent of each Republicki or embodyed Politick Society,
what more affinity hath it with ſinful ſedition, to ſay,
that greater bodyes may be divided and ſubdivided into
leſſer Republicks, then to ſay that moe leſſer bodyes may
aſſociate together to make one greater, eſpecially ſeing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians
tell us that the ends of government are more eaſily
attained in a leſſer Republick, then in a greater; and that a
mid way commonwealth neither too larg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, nor too little, is
the beſt, as being leſſe ſubject to vices and greater calamities,
as was to be ſeen in the Roman Republick before it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:105606:206"/>
in the dayes of <hi>Marius, Sylla, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
and is to be ſeen this day in the Commonwealth of Venice,
and the like, as <hi>Althuſius</hi> shewes us, <hi>Polit. Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>num.</hi> 11.
The time was when all the World was under one head, and
after they were multiplied, they became diſtinct Republicks
without any ſinful or ſeditious ſeceſſion. The time was
when all theſs weſterne parts were under one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and was nothing but a ſeditious ſeceſſion, cauſed
by firebrands, the ground of their becoming many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Republicks? The time was when <hi>Scotland, England,</hi>
and <hi>Irland,</hi> were diſtinct Kingdomes, and under diſtinct
Soveraigne Magiſtrates, and what repugnancy were it either
to the Law of God or nature, to ſay they might be ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?
So were there once Seven Kings in <hi>England</hi> at once:
and moe then one King in <hi>Scotland</hi> at once: and by no reaſon
can he prove that it should always be, as it is at preſent, but
by the ſame reaſon his adverſaries could prove him guilty of
treaſon; for he behoved to ſay, that becauſe we were once all
under one Emperour, we ought to be ſo ſtill, and that the
King muſt either hold his crowne of the Emperour, or be
an uſurper and a ſeditious rebel; for in the courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
we were then reduced under the ſame Lawes and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
and continued in the union of a common intereſt
for ſome good ſpace of time, Yea and obſerve many of theſe
civil Lawes yet. Thus we ſee whither this advocate will
drive the matter, and how little ſervice he doth his Majeſty for
all his rich recompence.</p>
               <p>But it may be his arguments are cogent and binding: He
hath many words, <hi>Pag.</hi> 4, &amp; 5. to prove that this is contrary
to Religion, The ſum is this. [<hi>Never greater perverſion of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
then in the times of many of the Prophets, and in the dayes
of Christ, and his holy Apostles, and primitive Chriſtians, and yet
this was never their doctrine or ſenſe.] Anſw.</hi> Is this all that he
can ſay, to prove that this is contrary to Religion? Sure
his adverſary will think that he hath little Religion who
ſayth ſo, and that he hath farleſse loyalty to his Maſter the
King of Great Britane; for why? Becauſe contrare to the
doctrine of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and the ſense of all the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:105606:207"/>
primitive Chriſtians, he acknowledgeth the King of Britane
to be a diſtinct King from the Roman Emperour, and not
to depend upon him. They never taught that <hi>Britane</hi> and
<hi>Irland</hi> should be ruled by a King diſtinct from him, and that
theſe Iſlands should be ſeparate from the Roman Empire,
and ſo the King holds his Crowne by uſurpation, and by an
irreligious ſeceſſion from the Empire, which neither Chriſt
nor his Apoſtles ever taught, and muſt not this man and not
we, acknovvledge <hi>Iudas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Theudas</hi> to be his
Maſters: For they taught (eſpecially the firſt, as <hi>Ioſephus,</hi>
and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> out of him shevv us) that no tribute should be
given to the Roman Emperour; and he vvil do the ſame,
and ſay that it should be payed to king <hi>Charles the II.</hi> Next
his adverſary vvould tell him, that if this were held and
maintained as a poynt abſolutely neceſsary to ſalvation, then
his argument vvould ſay ſomething; But ſeing it is only held
as lavvful, and according as providence determineth it to be
convenient or inconvenient, to be practicable, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
if the doctrine of the Prophets and of Chriſt and his
Apoſtles, do not condemne it, as ſimply ſinful: And that
by this argument of his, it should be utterly unlawful now
for <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and other adjacent Countreyes, to
joyne together in one: and proclame King <hi>Charles</hi> their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord and King: becauſe neither Prophets nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
taught any ſuch doctrine, that many ſeveral ſocieties
should joyne together under one head: And who is a friend
to the Kings greatneſſe now? If this man be worthy of his
wages, let all the World judge. Moreover they would
tell him, that in the dayes of ſome of the Prophets, there
was a greater diſſipation and ſeceſſion, then any that is now
deſired, when the Ten tribes ſeparated themſelves from the
other two, in the dayes of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and erected themſelves
in a diſtinct Republick, under a diſtinct Supreame Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;
and we finde not this reproved by any of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
yea we finde a Prophet ſent to tell <hi>Ieroboam</hi> that God
would give him Ten Tribes, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 11: <hi>ver. 21. &amp;c.</hi> and
when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> would goe and reduce them under his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
by the power of the ſword, we finde another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:105606:207"/>
ſent to diſſwade him, in the Name of the Lord, 1 <hi>King.</hi>
12: <hi>ver. 22, &amp;c.</hi> and ſaying that that <hi>was from the Lord.</hi> And
ſure this poſitive is as forcible, as his negative. And furder,
even in the dayes of the primitive Chriſtians, the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
was divided, and how it is now ſubdivided and re-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
into many fractions, we all know: and can he shew
us where any of the godly zealous Chriſtians and ſervants of
God ſpoke againſt this as a ſeditious practice?</p>
               <p>But is may be that he vvill prove this aſſertion, though not
diſſonant to Religion; yet diſſonant to ſound reaſon. Let
us hear hovv he doth it? [<hi>For</hi> (ſayes he Pag. 5.) <hi>it hath a
clear tendency to break in pieces all humane ſocietyes—which no wit
of man can preſerve from diſſolution, if this principle be drunk in:
For by this Man's opinion, the judgement of the perveſion of the ends of
government is put over to the diſcretion of the ſufferers of prejudice,
and they are accordingly to determine their actions, and nothing should
hinder them but want of probable capacity to through their work.</hi>]
But poor Man, as he hath made shipevvrack of faith and of a
good conſcience, ſo hath he made shipvvrack of his reaſon
alſo; for his adverſary vvould novv think the cauſe vvon:
For grant once that a ſeceſſion and ſeparation may be made,
vvhen the ends of government are manifeſtly perverted, and
they vvill ſeek no more, for they vvill readily grant it ought
not to be, vvhen there is no juſt cauſe, ſuppoſe that a great
part should in their diſcretion judge there were real cauſe;
And where is he now? Where is the poſition that is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonent
to Religion and Reaſon? Will he alſo owne it? Did
<hi>Naphtaly</hi> ſay that when ever a few of a ſociety thought in their
judgement of diſcretion, that the ends of government were
perverted, they were replaſed into their primaeve ſtate of
liberty, and free to make ſeparations from the old ſociety and
aſſociate into new combinations? And ſince he did not ſay
ſo, how can this advocate make his poſition appeare diſſonant
either to Religion or Reaſon? But the man, let him
be never ſo well hired, is obliged to reaſon no better then he
can. Let him grant (and he cannot well deny it) that it is
lawful for a great ſociety to divide into two or moe leſſer,
when the ends of government are really and manifeſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:105606:208"/>
in that greater ſociety ſo united, and his adverſaries
will ſoon ſatisfy him (if he be rational, or a man fit for ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
who will be ruled with reaſon) concerning the judgement
of that perverſion. He but expoſeth himſelf to pity, when he
cryeth out (taking alſo God's name in vaine) [<hi>To what times
are we reſerved, wherein the unmeaſureable and aciouſneſſe of Men
dar preſent ſuch poyſon to a Chriſtian People, and to attempt the
breaking them in pieces by ſuch doctrines which both Religion and ſound
Reaſon abhorres.</hi>] For no body hath either ſeen Religion nor
found Reaſon alleged againſt that poſition (which he ſayeth
<hi>Naphtaly</hi> ſetteth down.) But we will ſee more of this vaine
Man's ridiculous ranting in the following words [<hi>Dar this
libeller</hi> (ſo ſpeaketh this non-ſenſical railer) <hi>ſay that this is a
fundamental conſtitution of political ſocieties, that at the arbitrement
and lust of any minor part of private perſons, pretending a perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the ends of government (a pretence that will never be wanting
to Malecontents and Malapert wicked ones, Even Katherines and
highlandish theevs, and it is real to them if they themſelves be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
judges) they may make ſeceſſion from the ſociety in which they
are imbodied, and renunce their obligation to the government thereof.</hi>]
Now he ſoares high in his ſcurril rhetorik, and as orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his diſcourſe, he muſt bring in his <hi>Katherines</hi> and
<hi>Highlandish theeves,</hi> but to what purpoſe is all this ſuperfluity
of vaine empty words? Where or when ſaid <hi>Naphtaly,</hi> That
that was the fundamental Conſtitution of politick ſocieties?
What rational Man ever ſaid ſo? Is this the only thing
which he denyeth? Sure he is an ill maintainer of the union
of his Majeſties dominion; for his adverſaries will grant
all this, and yet ſay and be able to maintaine (for any thing that
he hath ſaid) that when the Ends of government are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and notoriouſly perverted, people relapſeing into
their primaeve liberty and privilege, may, according as the
exigent of their caſe requireth, aſſociate into new ſocieties
for their defence and preſervation. But he addeth <hi>pag. 6.
[Suppoſe there be a breaking off, upon that pretenſion (which will never
be wanting to cover ſedition and confuſion) of perverſion of the ends
of government, the party making ſeceſſion may haply meet with the
ſame meaſure they gave, for if a minor party ariſe among them
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:105606:208"/>
with the ſame accuſations, muſt they not have the ſame privilege?
And where shall there be a ſtand?</hi>] His adverſaries would ſoon
reply, that whatever be in that abſurdity, it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
them, for they plead not for a diſſolution upon a meer
pretenſion of this perverſion: And beſide, they plead not for
it, even where there is a real and not our perverſion, as a thing
neceſſary, which they muſt goe about, never once conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether it be expedient or inexpedient, and whether
they ſee a more feazable way of attaineing the ends of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without ſuch perverſion, after the ſeparation is
made, them before, or not: But only as a thing lawful,
which may be done when they ſee it moſt convenient for the
ends of government: And when they walk by this rule and
principle, they will ſoon ſee where to make a ſtand. For
they will finde that the crumbling of Societies into too many
and too ſmall bodyes, would put them as far from attaineing
the ends of governments, as they were while aſſociated in
a greater body. And this is all which he hath to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
For as touching his application of this <hi>pag. 9. and 10.</hi>
all alleging that there is no perverſion of the Ends of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
now, it hath been ſpoken to already, and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
in this poſition (if there be any ſuch, which I am
ignorant of) will think and make out, that the ends of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
are ſo far perverted, that if there were no other
thing lying in the way of a ſeceſſion, then vvhat he hath ſaid,
they vvould think it of concernment to minde this outgate,
vvhich they had no thoughts of before. And the King
should then think himſelf little obliged to this man and his
defences, and wish that he had been ſleeping when he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
ſuch a debate, and himſelf had beſtowed his gold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
way: For ſure, if ſuch a thing were upon the heart
of people now (as I hope &amp; am confident it is not) they will
profeſſe themſelves obliged to this <hi>Surveyer,</hi> for putting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their head firſt, and that all which he hath ſaid againſt it,
would rather invite and encourage them to it, then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them from it.</p>
               <p>May not then this Man be ashamed to take his Majeſties
Money, and do ſo bad ſervice for it, as he hath done? But
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:105606:209"/>
Some will poſſibly ſay what could any perſons have ſaid more;
Well, though ſome should think me officious to take his
Majeſties part and defend his cauſe, un-hired, yea and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
yet I will propoſe one thing, which I am confident,
shall be more effectual, for preſerving the immemorially ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Dominions, to all generations, without diſſipation or diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
or any hazard or feare thereof; Then what this
Pamphleting Prelate hath ſaid, Or will ſay, though he
should write volumes, at this rate: What is that, you
will ſay? It is no great ſecret, yet if heartily followed,
it shall prove infallibly effectual. Let his Majeſty Turne

which he ſwore with hands lifted up to the moſt high

wronging of the King's Perſon or his juſt authority, was not
intended by thoſe worthies who aroſe for the maintenance of
Religion; as ſuch of them who were publickly put to death,
did openly upon the ſcaffold confeſſe and avow; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
alſo how the Author of <hi>Naphtaly</hi> hath been miſerably miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood
by him.</p>
               <p>It is not our purpoſe, nor our preſent buſineſſe, to ſpeak
unto this head, and shew for what cauſes, or by whom
kings are to be queſtioned, depoſed, or executed: Far
leſſe is it our purpoſe to defend the taking away of the late
King's life, though this railing Pamphleter thinks to faſten
this upon <hi>Naphtaly.</hi> And therefore we might palse what he
ſayeth to this purpoſe, <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Yet as in the preceeding
Chapter, we have shewed how ill he hath maintained the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and conjunction of his Majeſties Dominions; So in
this, vve shall shovv hovv vveakly he hath guarded his
life, againſt ſuch as vvould oppoſe themſelves unto him, in
this queſtion.</p>
               <p>But firſt, vve vvould take notice vvhether <hi>Napthtali</hi> hath
given him ſuch ground to faſten upon him the juſtification of
the murther of the late King, as he allegeth. [<hi>The matter</hi>
(ſayes the Surveyer) <hi>in dealing with Magiſtrates (according to</hi>
Naphtali's <hi>minde) reſts not in a meer reſiſtence of them by meer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſons, but goes on to a retaliating and revenging upon them
wrong ſuppoſed to be done—for his man againe jeers at the
Soveraigne Powers Privilege, and Impunity of Divine exemption.]
Anſ.</hi> Doth this man know what he writeth? Doth <hi>Naphtaly</hi>
ſay, That private perſons may revenge wrongs upon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magiſtrate, becauſe he jeers at ſuch as plead for ſuch
a Privilege and impunity unto Soveraigne Powers, as will
exempt them from all tryal and punishment, both of God
and Man? What meaneth he elſe by this impunity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
exemption? Then he tells us, <hi>pag. 71,</hi> and 77. That
<hi>Naphtaly Pag. 29.</hi> reflects not obſcurely upon the horrid mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our late Soveraigne. Let us hear <hi>Naptaly's</hi> words, then
shall we better judge, [<hi>And as theſe inferiour Princes</hi> (ſayes
Naphtaly, Pag. 29.) <hi>Do often forget their ſubordination to the
moſt High in their unjuſt commands, and would uſurpe his throne, by
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:105606:211"/>
an uncontrollable Soveraignity: So the Lord by the warrand of his
Word and approbation of his providence, and alſo of the People (when by
them oppreſſed, but by himſelf animated &amp; ſtrengthened) hath declared
&amp; made void this their pretended exemption &amp; impunity, &amp; removed
the carcaſſes of ſuch Kings, and broken their ſcepter: amongst which prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
the instance of theſe times, whereof we now ſpeak, is worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
and deſerveth better to be remembered]</hi> Now <hi>Naphtali</hi> is
ſpeaking of what fell out betwixt the year 1494. and the
year 1560. in that place, and makes no mention of what fell
out an 1560. and afterward till he come to <hi>Pag. 31. &amp;c.</hi> Sure
then, the times he is ſpeaking of being before the year 1560.
are far from the times wherein King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.
But ſayes he, there was no ſuch thing as murthering
of Kings or dethroning of them, at that time, <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet
the Lord, at that time, declared and made void the pretended
exemption and Impunity of Princes and Soveraigne Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
by removing in his providence their carcaſſes, and by
the approbation of the people, when by them oppreſſed, &amp;
by himſelf animated, breaking their ſcepter; as vve finde
was done to the Q. Kegent <hi>anno 1559.</hi> when she was by the
People, the Nobles, Barons and Burgeſſes aſſembled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
upon the affaires of the commonwealth, <hi>Octob. 20.</hi>
depoſed from her Regency, and upon the ninth of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n</hi> the
next yeer, God removed her carcaſse by death, ſo that the
land was no more troubled with her.</p>
               <p>Who may not now ſee what a poor ground this <hi>Railer</hi> had,
to father ſuch a tenet on <hi>Naphtali,</hi> as he doth? And what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the King's cauſe hath gotten by this, we shall novv
ſee. He tels us <hi>Pag. 72. [That moſt of the venome this man</hi>
(meaning <hi>Naphtali<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) hath againſt the powers ordained of God, he
hath ſucked out of the breasts of</hi> Lex Rex. <hi>It were not right to dig
up all the pestilent untruths of that piece, ſet forth in moſt impertinent
and ſophiſtical reaſonings, mixt with infinite humane bitterneſſe,
againſt the late King: Only as it were to be wished that ſuch errours,
might be buried in eternal oblivion; ſo it is to be regrated that too too
many of the Ministry and others in</hi> Scotland <hi>have been poyſoned
with ſuch principles, and the ſame not being very like to be ſuddenly
extirpat, the more need have the powers above us to be watchful] Anſ.</hi>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:105606:211"/>
The author of <hi>Lex Rex</hi> and of <hi>Naphtaly</hi> alſo, aſcribe as much
to the powers ordained of God, as God's word will allow;
and are no way oppoſed unto them, but only unto Tyranny,
which is no Ordinance of God: and this Man rather ſpitteth
venome in the face of the power ordained of God, vvhen
he goeth about to patronize and defend their illegal and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quous
exorbitances, as if theſe were the ordinance of God,
which are rather the ordinance of Satan: Sure this is not
farr from blaſphemy, to call ſuch courſes the Ordinance of
God. 2. He hath taken a short cut. I confeſſe, to anſwere
that unanſwerable book <hi>Lex Rex.</hi> To ſay, that it is full of
peſtilent untruthes, ſet forth in moſt impertinent and ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
reaſonings. Had King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, when he read
that book, remembered this, or thought upon it, he would
not have ſaid he feared (as is reported he did) that it should
not have been anſwered. But what Man, who hath not de
nuded himſelf of all wit and reaſon, will take, upon this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
Apoſtat's word, theſe Truthes which <hi>Lex Rex</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
(&amp; which this Man was ſo unable to anſwere, that
I much queſtion if he well underſtood many of them, or if
his lumpish braine could diſcerne betwixt a ſophiſtical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and a true and real reaſon) to be untruthes; and theſe
truthes ſo wholeſome and uſeful to all Republicks, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be knowne and wel digeſted by all who conſult the
welfare of commonwealths, to be peſtilent untruthes, and
his unanſwerable reaſons, to be impertinent and ſophiſtical?
3. I am ſure all the Cavaliers, and the Malignant ſquade
would have thought him well worth his gold, if he had in a
ſober rational manner diſcovered the impertinencies and
ſophiſtical reaſonings in that book, which yet is like to ſpeak
after it is burned, and under a legal reſtraint, though he
should have ſpent the moſt part of his dayes upon it; it may
be, the Royal cabal would have thought it <hi>Dignum opus,</hi> and
have canonized him for it, and adviſed the King of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the iſſue of ſuch a worthy &amp; ſingular pillar of the tottering
throne. But the man knew how far his ſtock would reach,
and that all the gold in the Kings treaſures could not make his
head ſtronger then it was, how ever it might ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:105606:212"/>
fortify his purſe; and therefore, ſeing his short
horns could reach no further, his Majeſty muſt reſt ſatiſfied with
this: And <hi>Lex Rex</hi> muſt be declared, as it is, to be furder
unanſwereable. 4. Seing he wisheth that ſuch errours
might be buryed in oblivion, why did not his vvork follovv
his vvish? Why did he dig up the untruths (if ſuch) againe,
when he was not able to bury them dead nor alive? Prudence
(if he were not innocent of it) might have taught him
ſilence, ſeing he knew he could anſwere no better. 5.
Such as have received theſe principles finde them more
wholeſome food then his ſoure leaven. 6. He needs not
ſtirr up the Powers to more cruelty and tyranny then alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
they exerce, neither vvill that be a vvay to extirpate theſe
principles, but rather a way to root them more deeply in the
heart.</p>
               <p>But now what ſayes he to the thing. He tells us in the
firſt place: That [<hi>The God of order hath in all humane political
Societyes appoynted under himſelf a ſupreame power, whether ſubjected
in a ſingle perſon, or in a complex company, which orders the whole body,
having nothing before or above it, in the nature and order of civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and governs all in the ſociety, and is governed by none therein:
to ſay that a perſon is chief, and yet hath a Superiour or equal is to
ſpeak contradictions: wiſe men have ſaid, that a multitude of Gods
is the nullity of Gods, and multitude of infinites ſo called makes
none of them infinite, ſo a multitude of ſupreame powers in one civil
ſociety destroyes divine order.] Anſw. 1.</hi> It is true, God hath
appoynted in all humane political ſocieties, a ſupream power.
But I ſuppoſe, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> will grant, that this may as well
be a Parliament, as the King, and what hath he then ſaid for
ſecurity of the King's life, by this argument? 2. What ever
ſupream power, whether in one or moe perſons, God hath
appoynted over politick ſocieties, he hath done it by the
People; and ſo the People, who make and ſet up, under
God, theſe ſupreame povvers, are above theſe ſupreame
powers; If he will not take my word for this, let him
read and conſider how it is proved in <hi>Lex Rex,</hi> in many places,
ſpecially <hi>quaes;t.</hi> XIX. And if he will not reſt ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
let him try his hand, And anſwere what is there
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:105606:212"/>
ſaid, if he can. 3. Politicians will tell him that the King's
ſupremacy of power, is only in reſpect of the adminiſtration,
and execution of the lawes, according to the power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto him, by the People: let him read and conſider
well <hi>Althuſius</hi> his politicks, as to this. 4. And ſo, though
in reſpect of this executive adminiſtration, he be chief, and
governeth all: yet in reſpect of the royal fountaine-povver
of Government, the People are above him, becauſe they
give this out to him, and may, in caſes of neceſſity, recal
it, and give it to another; So that ſtill they reſerve a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine-power
over him, to be exerced in caſes of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity:
and therefore, there is no contradiction here, becauſe
<hi>non ad idem:</hi> the father is above the ſone, and yet ſubject
to him, if he be a judge. The Emperour is above the prince
palatine, and yet in ſome caſes that Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is his judge; as the
Tutor hath the ſupreame executive power, and the pupil can
not act without him; Yet in caſe of male adminiſtration, the
pupil hath a power to call him to a account. But finally
what if his adverſaries should ſay, that the King is not that
Supreame power in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but that a Parliament, as the
Peoples Repreſentatives are above him? He may ſee much
ſaid to prove this in <hi>Lex Rex,</hi> and in the <hi>Apologie.</hi> And how
shall he be able to confute that? And if Parliaments have
povver to depoſe Princes in <hi>Scotland</hi> (as hath been often
practiſed) hovv hath he ſaved the King's Scepter and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
But he addeth, as a short anſvvere to cut all off that
is ſaid, [<hi>A chimaera of idle diſtinctions is whelped by the late Maſters
of confuſion</hi> of co-ordinate and collateral Soveraignes in one
Kingdome, the fountality of Royalty in the People (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumable
at their pleaſure) is talked of, alſo Kings and People
there being mutual Magiſtrates to punish one another,—
and courts of neceſſity and tribunals of nature, where People
are judges accuſers and all, <hi>are bigly talked of; but theſe are only
cloaks of fig leaves to cover horrid rebellion &amp; diſorder.] Anſ.</hi> Every
thing muſt goe for a new whelped <hi>Chimaera,</hi> which this
blunt head cannot underſtand: Can he confute ſuch of
theſe diſtinctions as <hi>Lex Rex</hi> maketh uſe of? Why doth he
it not then? How doth this maſter of diſorder blow avvay
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:105606:213"/>
theſe figleaves, yea or diſcover them to be such? Is this
the vvay he takes to ſalve his Maſter's life? By his calling
ſuch diſtinctions <hi>Chimaeraes</hi> and figleaves; he vvill not ſave a
tyrannical Magiſtrate from depoſition or vvorſe, by that
povver vvhich is cleared by theſe diſtinctions. 2. As for
theſe courts of <hi>neceſſity, &amp;c.</hi> Royaliſts muſt grant them,
vvho grant povver in ſome caſes to People to reſiſt and depoſe
Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> vvhen they turne habitual tyrants, ſell the
Commonvvealth and the like: and in ſuch caſes, vvhen the
Prince doth ſuch horrid things, vvhich himſelf <hi>Pag.</hi> 24.
thinks can hardly befal a Prince in his natural and right vvits:
Hovv shall theſe things be judged, if he allow no courts,
but the ordinary courts of juſtice, and no court of neceſſity?
Ay, but he ſayes thereafter [<hi>That it is certaine Supreame power
is indiviſible and incommunicable to diſtinct ſubjects, in any one po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Society.</hi>] Though the ſupreame executive power of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration be ſo, either in one, called a Monarch, or in the
plurality of beſt and chiefeſt, as in Ariſtocracy, &amp;c. yet the
fountaine power of government (which <hi>Lex Rex</hi> tells him is
diſtinct from the power of governing <hi>Pag. 50.</hi>) abides intire
in the People, by which they may call the Governours to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
depoſe them, and ſet up others to execute the lawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
2. <hi>Grotius</hi> will tell him that the King may have one half of the
Soveraigne power, and the Senate or Parliament the other,
and if the King aſſume that part which is not his, he may be
reſiſted, where is then the indiviſibility or incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of this power, which he talketh of? Thinks he that
there is no mixed Monarchy? And if part of the Soveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
belong to the Parliamet, as the Peoples Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
(as is certaine in our conſtitution) the King cannot be ſo
Supreame as he would have him. Therefore he addeth.
[<hi>But why should we doubt that where there is a King (one truely ſo)
his Soveraignity is matchleſſe on earth, when the Scripture calls him
ſupreame. 1. Pet. 2: ver. 13. is there any equal to the Supream, in
order of civil government, by whom he is judgeable or punishable? if any,
he is not not Supreame not the government Royal.] Anſw.</hi> This
<hi>Chimaerical</hi> Man gives us a diſtinction of Kings, ſome truely
ſo and ſome falſly ſo: And what, and who are theſe? It is
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:105606:213"/>
like the King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> are not
Kings truely ſo, as he ſaid, becauſe forſooth they are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
above all Law and coercion. But what if more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
politicians then ever he was, ſay, that ſuch are moſt
truely Kings? And what if his adverſaries ſay and prove
alſo, that the King of <hi>Britane</hi> is not ſuch a King, as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
truly ſo? His ſaying that the King of Britane is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
will note prove that he is ſo, and will be found but
a weak defence for his life, if he be not able to prove him
above all judgement and punishment, which we have not
yet ſeen, and diſpaire to ſee, done. 2. Theſe words
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: <hi>ver.</hi> 13. may be as well rendered, <hi>The King as ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,</hi>
and can import no more, but one who had a ſupreme
or ſupereminent place in the adminiſtration of government,
notwithſtanding whereof he might be &amp; was accountable to
the <hi>Senat</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> for learned politicians and lawyers
prove that the ſupreame power of government was in the
Senate, even at this time, which clearly appeared in their
judging and condemning <hi>Nero,</hi> and other impious and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Emperours. So that even hence we ſee that one may
be ſupreame in order of civil government, and yet both
judgeable and punishable. 3. His adverſaries will not
much care how he call that government, Royal or not; and
whether he call the government of Britane Royal or not.
Names in theſe matters and titles, which goe much by
fashion or fancy, are but weak arguments; and he will never
be able to ſtop the mouth of his adverſaries, who would
plead for calling King <hi>Charles</hi> to account and for judging him
and punishing him, by ſaying he is a King, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a Royal government, they would account theſe but
thinne wals, and uſeleſſe cloaks of fig leaves to preſerve and
defend intolerable tyranny. Hath this man no better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
then thiſe wherewith to defend his Majeſtie's Royal
life and perſon? Or hath the King no better advocate to defend
his cauſe? But it may be this profound Statiſt will ſpeak
more nervouſly in the following obſervations. Therefore,</p>
               <p>Let us hear what he ſayes in the 2 place, [<hi>It is certane</hi>
(ſayes he) <hi>no man can be judged or punished but by his owne judge,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:105606:214"/>
who is above him, and hath authority over him, by lawful commiſſion
from God; or from men authorized by God to give ſuch commiſſion,
now who shall be judge to theſe inveſted with Soveraigne Majesty, ſeing</hi>
Every ſoul under them is commanded to be ſubject to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Rom. 13: ver. 1. and ſeing the Supreame Power of the ſword
is committed unto them, and not to others, but by deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and in dependence upon them—<hi>in a true Monarchy
there muſt be an exemption and impunity (as to ſubjects) of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
inveſted with Soveraignity and Majeſty: God's Law, Natures
Light, and ſound reaſon, are all for this, that ſuch as are inveſted
with Soveraigne Majeſty, having the legislative power; the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctional
power, the coërcive and punitive power originally in himſelf,
muſt enjoy exemption and impunity (as to ſubjects actings againſt
them) the contrary tenet overthrowes the order of God And Nature,
and precipitates humane ſocieties in a gulf of endleſſe confuſions.]
Anſw. 1.</hi> Here is enough to ſatisfy his adverſaries: For 1.
They will tell him, that he hath not yet proved the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Britane</hi> a true Monarchy, in his ſenſe; and ſo he
but begs the thing in queſtion here. 2. They will tell him,
that the King hath not the ſole legislative power, nor ſole
juriſdictional power, nor ſole cöercive and punitive power;
far leſſe, all theſe ſolely and originally in himſelf: And it is
but to ſuch Soveraignes that he pleads for this exemption &amp;
impunity. Doth not his Advocat deſerve a ſingular reward;
who pleadeth his Maſter's cauſe ſo dexterouſly, by proving an
uncertanty, by that which is more uncertane, &amp; founding all
upon his bare word? A noble champion forſooth, or rather a
Monſter, whoſe word muſt be a law, &amp; an irrefragable reaſon
too. Thus it ſeems, what ever power he give to the King
there is the Dictators power that the thinks is ſolely in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and that originally: but for all this he hath one diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that he is of little authority and of as little
credite, with ſober rational perſons. 2. He will grant that
ſuch Monarchies, as he accounts only true, are not every
where, no not where there are perſons called Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours:
How cometh it then that the order of God and
nature is not overthrowne in theſe Dominions and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
and that their Societyes are not precipitated into a gulf
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:105606:214"/>
of endleſſe confuſions? Shall nothing preſerve the order of
God and nature, but that which is the moſt ready mean to
deſtroy it, <hi>viz.</hi> an uncontrollable power in one Tyrant, to
deſtroy all his Kingdome, Man, Wife and Childe. 3. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians
will tell him, that the <hi>Ephori,</hi> the Parliament are
his judges; and that the People who by a lawful commiſſion
from God made him King and authorized him, are above
him and have authority over him, in caſe he turne a Tyrant
and pervert the ends of government. 4. Though it be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
there be an ordinary ſtanding judge to cognoſce of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
which fall out betwixt one private perſon and another;
yet it is not alwayes neceſſary there be one condeſcended on,
to judge betvvixt the Soveraigne and the People, vvhen
the controverſy falleth out betvvixt them, more then that
there should be a ſtanding ordinary judge to decide contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
falling out betvvixt tvvo diſtinct and independent
Kingdomes. 5. What commiſſion from Man authorized
by God had the high Prieſt, and ſuch as joyned vvith him,
vvhen they depoſed and killed <hi>Athaliah?</hi> if he ſay, she was an
uſurper True, yet she poſſeſſed the place ſix years peacably
without moleſtation; and who was judge, whether she was
an uſurper or not? Had the matter been referred to her, she
would have been as far from calling herſelfe an uſurper, as
a Tyrant now will be from judging himſelf a Tyrant: And ſo
as in this caſe, the Tyrant <hi>ſine titulo</hi> had a judge above her,
though she was inveſted with Soveraigne Majeſty, ſo in the
other caſe, The Tyrant <hi>exercitio,</hi> though inveſted with Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Majeſty, hath a judge above him. 6. The place <hi>Rom. 13.</hi>
is to be underſtood (as was shewed above) of inferiour
Magiſtrates as well as of the ſupreame: And it ſayes of all in
authority, that ſuch as are under them should be ſubject unto
them, In ſo far as they are ſubjects unto them: ſo in poynt
of adminiſtration of juſtice according to equity, all are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the ſupreame or ſupereminent governour; but when
he becometh a Tyrant, he becometh ſubject unto them,
who gave him that power, and ſet him up, under God.
7. He inſinuats that inferiour Magiſtrates are not eſſential
Magiſtrates, but deputation from and in dependence upon
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:105606:215"/>
the King. But <hi>Lex Rex, Queſt. 20.</hi> hath by many cleare and
unanſwereable arguments evinced the contrary.</p>
               <p>In the third place he citeth ſome ſentences of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
calling the <hi>Emperours ſecond unto God, and above all men, and
only ſubject unto God:</hi> Of <hi>Optatus</hi> ſaying, <hi>that none are above them
but God.</hi> And of <hi>Ierom</hi> ſpeaking of Pſal. 51. <hi>againſt thee thee
only have I ſinned,</hi> ſaying that <hi>David ſpoke ſo becauſe he feared
none;</hi> And of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> on the ſame words ſaying, <hi>that he was
King, and under no Law—and therefore he did not ſin againſt
man.]</hi> But all this is no purpoſe: For 1. himſelf will
grant that all Kings are not thus exempted, and his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
will prove the King of <hi>Britane</hi> one of theſe limited, and
reſtricked Kings, that are obnoxious to examination, and
punishment; and theſe ſayings cannot prove that all Kings
are ſo, yea or ought to be ſo. 2. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to vindicate
the Chriſtians who would not acknowledge the Emperour
to be God, and to shew how notwitſtanding they reſpected
him according to his place, would give him as high titles as he
could, though not out of flattery, and ſo make him the
higheſt perſon in the Empire, and above the heathen Gods;
yet he did not ſet him above all the People in their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
the <hi>Senate,</hi> or if the did, the Senate proved him to be
in a miſtake, by taking courſe with ſeveral of theſe leud and
wicked Tyrants. 3. <hi>David's</hi> ſingle act of adultery and
murther were no ſuch acts of Tyranny, as are cenſurable with
depoſition, and ſo it ſpeaketh not to the caſe. 4. It might
be that <hi>de facto</hi> he did not fear another, as <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayes. But
that will not ſay, that <hi>David</hi> might have deſtroyed the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of the Lord without controlle, or that other Princes
are, or should be, exempted from reſtraint and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

5. Himſelf will not ſtand to what <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayes, for he
addeth immediatly, <hi>[There is no doubt but</hi> David <hi>was ſenſible
both of the horrid injury he had done to</hi> Uriah <hi>(the occaſion of that</hi>
Pſalm) <hi>and of the ſcandal he had given to God's People, in
which ſenſe, he might be well ſaid to ſin against both.]</hi> 6. The
words of the text vvill not beare that vveight. <hi>viz.</hi> That
he had no other judge but God, or that (as <hi>Deodate</hi> ſayeth)
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:105606:215"/>
he was exempted from all punishment of men, &amp; was obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
to no humane tribunals; but as other commentators ſay,
the words are to be taken in a comparative ſenſe, that this was
the greateſt aggravation of his guilt, that it was ſuch a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
traſgreſſion, in his ſight who was privy to it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he did conceale it from all others, ſo far as he could: ſee
the <hi>Dutch Annot.</hi> on the palce: and therefore to expreſſe his
ſpiritual ſenſe of the ſin commited againſt God (againſt
whom properly ſin as ſin is commited) he uſeth this rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical
ingemination: And if the words should have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
what the <hi>Surveyer</hi> would have them to import, they
had not been appoſite to expreſſe his ſpiritual grief &amp; ſenſe of
the hainouſneſſe of the crime commited. Then he tels us what
excellent <hi>Mr Calvin</hi> ſayeth <hi>Inſtit. Lib. 4. cap.</hi> 20. § 27. <hi>and 31.</hi>
and then ſayes [<hi>It is a wonder how many who pretend reſpect to</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin
<hi>should dar to violate the ſacroſanct Majeſty of Kings, if they will
but read over that chapter.</hi>] But is it not a wonder, how this
man who ſeemeth to have read over that chapter and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
§. 31, should paſſe by what worthy <hi>Calvin</hi> ſayeth in
the end of that ſection, or should have ſo little reſpect unto
that worthy man (whom he himſelf accounts to be worthy
of reſpect, and but deſervedly) as to plead for an incontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
power in Kings, When yet famous <hi>Calvin</hi> tels us there
that if the <hi>Ephori</hi> or <hi>States of Parliament,</hi> connive at the King's
tyranny, and ſuffer him to oppreſſe and inſult over the poor
People, they are wickedly perfidious, and palpably betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their truſt.</p>
               <p>Then in the 4 place he tels us [<hi>That it is not denyed, that the
King is bound before God to rule his People according to the Law of God;
and that it is groſſe to ſay,</hi> Regi quicquid libet licet.] This is
good, but what then? What if he deviate? [<hi>We maintai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

(ſayes he) <hi>that as ſure truth That impunity (as from ſubjects)
neceſſarily attends Soveraignity by the Law of God, reaſon, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
For no man can be judged or punished but by a judge above
him; and the Supreame hath none ſuch, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> But <hi>Mr
Prelate,</hi> your adverſaries will maintaine the contrare, as a ſure
truth: We looked for a fourth proof and not for the thing
in queſtion, or a repetition of what is ſaid: The ſame thing
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:105606:216"/>
repeated ſix times will not make ſix arguments; <hi>Mr Bishope</hi>
give a new proof, if you can, of this firme truth which you
maintaine? We maintaine, by the Law of God, Nature,
and Reaſon, No man hath an uncontrollable power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
millions, to cut off the heretage of the Lord, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
his Intereſt: And we have shewed our grounds for
this. 2. How was <hi>Athaltah</hi> judged? And what a judge
was <hi>Iehu?</hi> 3. It hath been told him, that the ſupreame
governour hath a ſupreame power above him: The power
of the People that made him Supreame governour, is above
him, and can depoſe him, and put another in his place. He
may be a Supreame governour &amp; diſpenſator, and yet their
ſervant, accountable unto them, and cenſurable by them,
when he deviates and turnes a Tyrant, and a Wolfe, and a
Tyger. When one King wrongeth another, that other will
both judge and punish him, if he be able, and yet is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a judge above him. Much more may the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of the People; who ſet him up and impowered him,
both judge him and punish him.</p>
               <p>But the good man thereafter would adviſe Kings not to
abuſe this inviolableneſſe, but ſo much the more to fear ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
punishments from God; and for this cauſe would have
them reading the 6 chapter of <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Book of <hi>Wiſdome.</hi>
But was there no texts in all the divine Word of God, that
he would put into the King's hand to read, that he muſt ſend
him to the Apocrypha? It is true Kings would do well to
remember that they have a God above them, who will not
be mocked, but will bring them to an account of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
though they should eſcape Mens hands: and to the end
they may be put in remembrance of this, they ſtand in need of
other monitors, then the Men who have forgote it, and
ſend them to Apocrypha to finde it: And this should keep
them within the boundaries of God's Law. But as the fear
of punishment from Man, will reſtraine ſome from ſtealing,
whom the fear of God would little overawe; So it may
be the feare of punishment from Men, would have no ſmall
influence to make ſome Kings walk by a rule. And <hi>Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God animates his People to ſuch actions, is blaſphemy, albeit he

declares that they are not uncontrollable or inviolable.
2. His adverſaryes vvill tell him, that the depoſeing of
Tyrants, or the executing of juſtice on them, is no ſinful
Murther nor ſinful depoſeing of Princes. 3. If he had once
proved that ſuch actions as theſe, vvere horrid and ſinful,
then he might ſay that it vvere blaſphemy to ſay, that God

that ever wrote before him, and not only will have
the perſons of lawful princes, though flagitious and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
ſacred and inviolable; but alſo the perſones of the moſt
manifeſt uſurpers; for he ſayes, that it was not according to

make head againſt theſe Tyrants that oppreſſed the people of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:105606:217"/>
God, in the dayes of the judges, but extraordinare, which
motions we have no ground to waite for now. And ſo this

of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> as of the <hi>King:</hi> And if this be a faithful advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
let all the world judge, and let the author of the pamphlet

and ignorance.</p>
               <p>He tels us thereafter how [<hi>The</hi> Apologiſt <hi>labours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

relation driveth at no ſuch deſigne there, but
only cleareth thereby, that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> have not a
ſupremacy above Parliaments; but that rather Parliaments
are above them; for they have punished them. He addeth
[<hi>The moſt that all of them amount to is nothing, but the inſurrection
of Nobles</hi> (Proceres <hi>as</hi> Buchanan <hi>calleth them) againſt the Kings,

of legality, which uſe to be followed with other notorious
Malefactors? Is not this a brave <hi>Goliah</hi> that cometh out to
defend the King's ſacred perſon, when all which he at
length can do, is to defend him, from being adjudged in a
formal mode, to loſſe his head and his Crowne; that he
shall not be called publickly (as other Malefactors are) to
the judges barr, and there be impannelled as a Tyrant and
Traitor to God and the Countrey? If this man deſerve his
wages, let wiſe Men judge; ſeing all know that there is
greater difficulty in taking away Tyrants, then in taking
away other Malefactors: And that hardly can ſuch a legal
way with all its formalities be followed with them, which
is followed with others: And that ſometimes, ſome Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
though they were never Princes, muſt be ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in a more brief manner and privately alſo, and yet it is all
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:105606:217"/>
one upon the matter, if the man be guilty and really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by his judges. And ſo it is all one, if a Tyrant be
adjudged worthy of death or depoſition, by a Parliament
the Repreſentatives of the People, and accordingly cut off
from government, or out of the land of the living, whether
it be done by a publick Meſſenger, with ſound of Trumpet,
and by the hand of a publick lictor and executioner, on a
publick ſcaffold; or by force of armes, vvhen the former
meanes cannot be ſaifly uſed, nor ſo ſecurely. And it vvas
not the inſurrection of nobles as ſuch, but as <hi>proceres</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores
Regni</hi> that were inſtanced, and of lawful Parliaments
(ſuch as were uſed in theſe dayes) ſentenceing and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Kings for tyranny, and other miſdemeanours. Let him

<hi>Grafton,</hi> and he will finde it ſo; particularly, let him ſee
and conſider how <hi>Ferlegus</hi> was adjudged worthy of death,
but for <hi>Ferguſius</hi> his Father's ſake, was only impriſoned; and
thereafter with the unanimous conſent of all, being ſuſpected

I crave leave to ſay</hi> à facto adjus non ſequitur.] Thus that
worthy Author; and could he have uttered his judgment
more ſpareingly and ſoberly, in a matter that was not of great
Moment to the queſtion in hand, ſo that though he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
to have ſpoken any thing to this at all, his cauſe had
not been, in the leaſt, weakened; and though we should
grant that the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> could not have judged <hi>David</hi> for
theſe facts (which yet we can cannot do) what loſſe shall
we have? Seing we may eaſily grant and <hi>Lex Rex</hi> with us

acts were not acts of Tyranny, and what shall this vaine

account him a fool in the firſt magnitude, in handleing ſuch
a cauſe, which ſo nearly concerneth his Majeſties life, after
ſuch a manner, that a very ſchool-boy may ſmile at? Then
he addeth, [<hi>So</hi> Pag. 348, and 428, and 238. <hi>and often elſewhere,
he (that is</hi> Lex Rex) <hi>will have the Eſtates executing the moral

coaction of Law; and yet not ſo, if it be made a matter of conſcience; is
the preſervation of the peace of the commonwealth, no matter of conſcience
to him? Or is not the constitution freeing the King from coaction of
Law (for that end) warrantable?] Anſ.</hi> Doth not this <hi>ignoramus</hi>
know that a queſtion of this nature may be conſidered and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
politically and theologically: And that many things
may be tolerated or forborne in poynt of policy, upon poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
grounds and ends, which, if conſidered <hi>ſtricto Iure,</hi>
according to conſcience, should not be forborne, nor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated.
<hi>David</hi> in point of policy, did forbear to execute the
Law upon the Murtherer <hi>Joab,</hi> whom yet in poynt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
he accounted a man of death, and therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the execution of the Law of God, unto his Son
<hi>Solomon:</hi> and this toleration or forbearance may be lawfull or
unlawful, according to the weight of the matter tolerated,
or forborne, and the nature and weight of the grounds in
policy, upon which this forbearance is determined. So that
though we should ſuppone it lawful for a Commonwealth to
enact and determine in Law, that their King should not be
queſtioned for one ſingle act of Murther or Adultery, as other
perſones are: Yet in poynt of conſcience, if the queſtion be
ſtated <hi>in theſi,</hi> whether a King may be queſtioned for one ſingle
act of Murther and Adultery, as another private perſon,
it may be anſwered affirmatively, becauſe the Law of God,
makes no exception of perſones. 2. It may be made a matter
of conſcience, to make the King free of the coaction of Law,
in ſome ſmall and inconſiderable particulars, becauſe of the
probable hazard into which the Commonwealth may be
brought by coërcing of him, which all the value of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
anent which the coaction is exerced, will not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile.
But it will never be allowed, in poynt of conſcience,
to make him free of all coaction of Law, ſo as he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
control, murther millions, deſtroy and waſte Religion:
For that were not conduceable to the peace of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
but a ready way to deſtroy all: So that a conſtitution
freeing the King from all coaction of Law, how ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the preſervation of the peace of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
can never be warrandable. For that were to make

judge, and were judged.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>(Sayes he)</hi> It is good that this Metaphiſical Statist was no
Chief Priest or member of the Sanhedrin in <hi>Davids</hi> time; for he
would have afforded a corrupt expoſition of the Law to cut off the King.
What ſots were the Priests &amp; Prophets at that time that did not inſtigate
the Sanhedrin? This man could have told them that they were
above him, and they were bound to execute the Law upon him.]
Anſw. <hi>It was good that this ſuperlatively irrational paraſite.,</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:105606:220"/>
and infraphyſical fooll was not breathing in theſe dayes; for
he would have told Kings, you may Kill, murther, maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre,
deſtroy all the land, Man, Wife and Childe, without
the leaſt fear of reſiſtance; and have told the People, the
Sanhedrin, and all the Elders of Iſrael, though your Kings
turn butchers and deſtroyers of the People of God, worſe
then ever <hi>Nimrod</hi> or any that ever breathed ſince his dayes,
you have no more to do, but hold up your throats, or flee to
the uncircumciſed out of the inheritance of the Lord. But
what ſayes all this to the thing? Doth this pove that <hi>David</hi>
or any King was excepted in the Law of God? Where,
In what chapter, or what verſe shall we finde this? Good
Maſter prelate tell us, or where we shall finde it in your book
of wiſdome? 2. We finde not that any of the Prieſts or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
reproved <hi>David</hi> for ſpareing <hi>Ioab</hi> that murtherer,
who shed the blood of war in peace, <hi>2 King. 2: ver. 5.</hi> was
it therefore right in <hi>David</hi> to have ſpared him? Sure they
might well have told <hi>David,</hi> that though <hi>Ioab</hi> was a great man,
yet he was above him, to punish him as well as another
Man, for his ſin; and in poynt of conſcience, and by
God's Law he was bound to do it. Theſe ſinful acts of <hi>Ioab</hi>
were more notoure then what <hi>David</hi> had done in ſecret:
And becauſe we finde not that he vvas reproved upon this
account, shall vve therefore uſe this Man's dialect; and ſay,
<hi>What's ſots or coldrife ſenſeleſſe Men were the Prieſts and the Prophets of
that time, who did not inſtigate</hi> David <hi>to execute the Moral Law on</hi>
Ioab, <hi>that wrath might be turned away from the Land?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. He tels us, that the author of <hi>Lex Rex [Vtterly miſtakes
the meaning of the Word of God, Gen. 9: 6. (as for the other texts they
clearly concerne Magiſtrats only toward ſuch over whom they have power,
but does neither instigate the inferiour Magistrates against the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
nor the People against any of them) where it is ſaid,</hi> he that sheds
mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed.] <hi>Anſ. 1.</hi> The
author of <hi>Lex Rex</hi> doth not ſay that theſe places do inſtigate
the inferiour Magiſtrats againſt the ſuperiour, nor the people
againſt both; but that they poynt forth the Magiſtrate's
duty to judge righteous judgment, and to accept no Mans
perſon, be he a Prince, or be he a poor Man. And if they
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:105606:220"/>
concerne Magiſtrates toward ſuch over whom they have
power, The author of <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſeeketh no more; for he
had proved, (and this vaine windy man hath not the head,
though he want not a heart and good will to it, to anſvvere
his arguments) that the <hi>Eſtates</hi> and Repreſentative of the
People, have power over the Prince. 2. It is a hard cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to ſay that he hath utterly miſtaken the meaning of <hi>Gen. 9:
ver.</hi> 6. Let us hear how? [<hi>Concluding hence,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that
there is here a precept that the blood of every man (though he be in the
ſupreame power) should be shed by his inferiours, if he shed blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently
and without cauſe.] Anſw.</hi> But this is not the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that <hi>Lex Rex</hi> draweth from the place, He only ſayeth.
That in this place there is no exception made of the Prince,
though he be the Supreme power: And can this Man for
all his skill demonſtrate the exception? <hi>Lex Rex</hi> ſaid not that
his blood should be shed by his inferiours, but by the Eſtates
of the land, who are his ſuperiours, what way then hath he
miſtaken the meaning of this word? What furder <hi>[Suppoſeing</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>this word not only to be predictional—but alſo diatactick
and perceptive, there must be meet limitations of the ſentence, both
in the ſubject and attribute]</hi> Grants all, what limitations will he
have in the ſubject, that sheds mans blood? <hi>[It is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>only of ſuch as have no authority, and do it out of
private revenge; for we muſt not owne the fancies of</hi> Photinians
<hi>and</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>that condemne lawful warres, and capital punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.]
Anſw.</hi> This is good and granted, for we ſay that
even the King, when murthering unjuſtly, acteth as a private
perſon, and is prompted by his revenge: did he ſuppoſe that
<hi>Lex Rex</hi> was a <hi>Photinian</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſt?</hi> If not, why did he
trouble himſelf with this? But what ſayes he to that which
he cals the attribute? <hi>[Certanely</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>taking the word as
a precept, It is not meant that it is the duty of every man or any man
indifferently, to shed the blood of the perſon who sheds innocent blood;
but of the Magiſtrate who is judge above him. All interpreters are
agreed, that here is (if not the inſtitution yet) the approbation of the
office of the civil magiſtrate.] Anſw.</hi> Did the author of <hi>Lex Rex</hi>
ſay that it was the duty of any man indifferently, to punish ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitally
shedders of innocent blood? ſaid he any thing againſt
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:105606:221"/>
agreement of interpreters concerning the inſtitution or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the office of the civil Magiſtrates? Sure
when he ſaid, and elſwhere proved, that the Eſtates of the
Realme were above the King, he fully agreed with theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
touching the meaning of that place; ſo that that
<hi>Surveyer</hi> might have ſpared his paines in reciteing their words, for
he ſayes nothing againſt what either <hi>Pareus, Pet. Martyr,
Muſculus, Bezelius, Diodate,</hi> or the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe</hi> ſay. Let
us hear how he applyeth this to the purpoſe? [<hi>But</hi> (ſayes
he) <hi>if the perſons inveſted with Supreme power of the ſword, abuſeing
their power become guilty of shedding innocent hlood, who (in that
ſociety where of they are heads) shall judge or punish them? who is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
over the ſupreme to punish him?—It is inexplicable how
any in whom the Soveraigne Majeſty, &amp; Magiſtratical power reſides,
should, according to order, be punished by ſubjects.] Anſw.</hi> This
is the knot of all, but it is nothing elſe than what we have
heard againe and againe, and hath been ſpoken to already. But
yet, becauſe it is to him inexplicable, and a Gordian Knot,
let us ſee if we can looſe it without Alexander's ſword. He
will grant (or if he will not, but retract what he hath els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
granted, ſpeaking of a legal reſiſtence, all the lawyers
in <hi>Scotland</hi> will grant it) that if any in the King's name shall
ſeek to diſpoſſeſſe a Man of his inheritance, the man may
defend his right by law, and the King by his advocate muſt
pleade his cauſe before the ordinary judges; and theſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
judges, muſt judge righteous judgment according to
law, and give out a decreet in favours of the ſubject againſt
the King, and ſo condemne the King of injury and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
intended againſt the ſubject: Now who but the ordinary
judges, in civil Matters, are judge here to the Supreme? &amp;
yet theſe judges, in another reſpect, are but ſubjects: doth
he not now ſee how ſuch as are meer ſubjects in one reſpect,
may judge and punish him who is inveſted with Soveraigne
Majeſty and Magiſtratical power, and ſo in another reſpect
are above him. And what if I ſay, that as, in civil Matters,
the ordinary judges may judge the King, ſo the juſtice general
or his deputy conſtitute ordinare judges in criminals or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals,
may iudge him when he committeth a capital crime?
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:105606:221"/>
let him or any Man elſe shew me a reaſon, why the
one should be, and the other may not be, in poynt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
But if we ſpeak of a Parliament the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
of the People, the caſe is ſo cleare that there is
no difficulty; for that is a judge alwayes above him, and
ſo even according to his limitations, if the King shed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood, by them may his blood be shed.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Pag. 81.</hi> he ſayes [<hi>When the Apoſtle</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>ſayes</hi>
let every ſoul be ſubject to Superiour powers, <hi>that</hi> (every ſoul)
<hi>doth not comprehend the ſupreme power it ſelf (for how can the
Man inveſted with it, be ſubject to a ſuperiour power?) but it is
meant that every ſoul under the ſuperiour power or ſupreme, should be
ſubject to it.] Anſw.</hi> Yet againe the ſame thing which we
heard before. Is he not able to underſtand this, how
one who is ſupreme, in one reſpect, may be inferiour, in
another reſpect? The father hath a Supreme paternal power
over the Son, yet the ſone, being a judge or Prince, may
be over him, as <hi>David</hi> was over <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> over <hi>Kish.</hi>
But (ſayes he) <hi>Let men (as they will) indulge themſelves in
their ſeditious Notions, they muſt at laſt ſiſt in ſome ſupreame power
on Earth which is not judge able or punishable by any.] Anſw.</hi> Be it
ſo, what hath he gained for the King his Maſter? Muſt
either he be the ſupreme power on earth which is not judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
or punishable by any, or muſt there be none? His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
will ſoon deny the conſequence: And he, let him
indulge himſelf in his Tyrannical Notions, as much as he
will, shall never be able to confirme it. How then shall he
defend the ſacred perſon and life of the King? What ſayeth
he further? [<hi>If ſoveraigne Majeſty be placed in Parliament or
People (who may be guilty of shedding innocent blood, as well as the
King) who shall shed their blood when they tranſgreſſe? Shall this
be reſerved to the ſounder and ſmaller part of the People (as this Man
ſpeaks Pag. 240.] then there is ground enough laid for Eternal confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion]
Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> either ſubtilly or ignorantly
confounds things here, which should be conſidered diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and leadeth his unwarry reader off the way: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we would have the Reader (though all this is nothing to
the purpoſe in hand to prove the King uncontrollable, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punishable
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:105606:222"/>
and unjudgeable for any of his acts) take notice
of theſe few things which will help to cleare the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
1. That there is a not-judgeableneſſe (to ſpeakſo) and
not-punisheableneſſe <hi>de facto,</hi> which may be ſaid of ſome
notorious rebels and out-Lawes, whom neither Law nor
power of authority can cöerce, and there is a non-punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe
and non-judgeableneſſe <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ure,</hi> when one is exeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Law-judgment and Law-ſentence, ſo that he is
above all tryal and ſentence of Magiſtrates: Caſes may fall out
wherein ſuch as are punishable &amp; judgeable <hi>de Iure,</hi> according
to an ordinary way laid downe or allowed by God, may
notwithſtanding be unpunishable and not-judgeable <hi>de facto,</hi>
either through corruption prevailing over all, or prevalency
of power in the punishable perſon or perſons: And this,
though in an ordinary way irremediable, yet ſpeaks not againſt
the Ordinance and appoyntment of God and Nature. 2. That
there is a difference betwixt perſonal faults of Governours,
or ſuch as are inveſted with authority and power, as was
that act of Murther and Adultery in <hi>David;</hi> and publick
miſcarriages in poynt of governm. &amp; in exerceing the power
wherewith they are inveſted: of perſonal faults, ſpeaketh
<hi>Lex Rex</hi> in the place now under conſideration; and upon this,
have we vindicated that worthy Author, from vvhat this
perverter of all things hath ſaid. But here he mixeth theſe,
and confoundeth them, that according to his vvay, he
may pervert the truth. 3. There is a difference betvvixt
ſimple acts of male-adminiſtration in leſſer matters; and
betvvixt ſuch acts of male-adminiſtration, as pervert the
ends of government. 4. There is a difference betwixt palpable,
cleare, and undenyable miſcarriages; and betvvixt ſuch as
are not ſo cleare nor unqueſtionable. 5. There is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to be made betvvixt ordinary ſtanding caſes; and an
extraordinary emergent: in an extraordinary caſe, vvhile
the diſeaſe is deſperate, a deſperat-like and extraordinary
remedy may be uſed without overturning the ordinary way,
which is to be uſed in ordinary caſes, Theſe things will help
us to nnravel his confuſed diſcourſe. And ſo we Anſwere.
1. If Parliament-members or privat perſons among the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:105606:222"/>
People shed innocent blood it is no difficulty to know who
should judge them. 2. If a Parliament as the Peoples Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
Murder the innocent, I ſee not why they may not
be called to an account by a poſterior Parliament, as when a
beanch of judges in civil matters, conſpire together to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,
by their unlavvful and unjuſt decreets, palpably ſuch
and not our to all; vvhen they are depoſed and others put in
their places, the oppreſſed may get his cauſe righted, and
reparation of dammage of them: Or vvhen a juſtice generall
manifeſtly &amp; palpably murdereth the innocent, he may be made
to anſvvere before another put in his place: if this may be done
(as I judge in poynt of conſcience it may) ſo may the other be
done with Parliaments. 3. If Parliaments conſpire to overturne
Religion, Lavves, Liberties, and thus deſtroy the Republick,
I judge vvith <hi>L. R. Pag. 240.</hi> that the ſounder part, if they
be able, may reſiſt and hinder, ſo far as they can, that deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and ruine of the Republick. Neither ever shall he prove
that this is a ground for Eternal confuſion: O ſayes he, [<hi>Any
leſſer part, when they have or think they have will and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rengh enough to
through their buſineſse, will undoubtedly call themſelves the ſounder
part, and labour to beare downe the corrupt plurality.] Anſw.</hi> This
remedy to prevent deſtruction and ruine to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
may be of the Lord, though it should be abuſed by
ſinful men; for the beſt thing may be abuſed: And it is not
the meane allowed by God and Nature which layeth a ground
for eternal confuſion; but the abuſe of the meane maintained,
whereof we are not guilty. But we have had abundance
of ſuch rotten conſequences from him, who knoweth better
what it is to deceive the ſimple with ſophiſtications, then to
ſatisfy the judicious with ſolid reaſons. Then he addeth,
<q>[But the Chriſtian Reader may eaſily ſee how hard this
Author is put to it; and for all his ſaying that according to
God's Law, Kings muſt be punished as well as others,
yet is he forced to acknowledg a Supremacy of power in
ſome, not punishable by any but by God.</q>] <hi>Anſ:</hi> This is but
what we heard juſt now, and whether true or falſe, it helpeth
him nothing: Have that Supremacy of power, which is
not punishable by any but by God, who will, if the King
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:105606:223"/>
have it not, the King's life is not ſecured: And if he ſay, if
any have it the King muſt have it. True, if this rotten malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and paraſitical <hi>ignoramus</hi> can make no bad inferences; but
he hath already ſo often diſcovered vanity in this way of
argueing, that we cannot account him infallible: And therefore
let him prove his conſequence; for we know him better then
to take any thing from him upon truſt. Well, what way doth
he clear this, of <hi>Lex Rex?</hi> 
                  <q>[For <hi>(ſayes he) Pag. 389.</hi>
when he hath given all power to the Parliament over the
King, he objecteth to himſelf; <hi>who shall punish and coërce the

Parliaments,</hi> and <hi>Pag. 211.</hi> he ſayeth, <hi>by the people and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

Parliaments hearken to this.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the firſt place
cited, <hi>Lex Rex</hi> is not ſpeaking of Parliaments power over the
King (as this ſquint-eyed <hi>Surveyer</hi> thinketh,) but is handling
that queſtion <hi>whether or not Monarcy is the beſt of governments?</hi> And
is shevving in vvhat reſpects it is beſt, and in vvhat reſpects
it is vvorſte; and shevveth hovv a mixt Monarchy is beſt;
and then anſvvereth ſome objections: And to that vvhich
ſome might object, <hi>That Parliaments might exceed their bounds,
and who should coërce them?</hi> He anſvvered, <hi>That poſteriour Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
might do it;</hi> and ſo there vvas a <hi>ſalvo</hi> in that mixture of
governmemt 2. In the other place he is shevving vvhat
relation the King hath to the Lavv, and that he is not the
ſole Lavv maker, nor ſole ſupreme judge: And anſvvereth
that objection, <hi>That the three Eſtates as men and looking to their
owne ends, not to Law and the publick good, are not fundamentalls,
&amp; are to be judged by the King.</hi> viz. <hi>That they are to be judged by
the people and the conſcience of the people.</hi> Why calleth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dity
inn reaſon is here? <q>[Who ever head of this (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) that
one Parliament poſteriour should punish the prior? Their
acts they may retract indeed, but to punish them for their
acts, is moſt abſurd, becauſe the prior Parliament in the
capacity of that judicatory, had as much povver as the
poſterior. States men vvill vvonder at this doctrine, that
Members of a Parliament should be punished for their free
votes, by a ſucceeding Parliament, and far more at the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:105606:223"/>
ſubjecting them to the conſcience of the People.</q>] <hi>Anſw.</hi>
1. It is no ſmall punishment and cöercion to a Parliament,
to have all their deſignes, conſultations, and concluſions
overturned, which may be done by poſteriour Parliaments
2. If Parliaments, by their free votes, ſell Religion, and
the Liberties of the land unto the <hi>Turk,</hi> and ſo deſtroy the
ſame, and betray their Truſt, I ſee not vvhy they ought not
be punished for their paines. If they should enact and put to
execution the act, vvhen made; That all vvho vvill not
bovv and burn incenſe to an idol should be brunt quick, I ſee
not, vvhy they may not by a poſteriour Parliament be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
and punished for that innocent blood vvhich they
have shed. 3. His reaſon to the contrary, is not good; for they
never had povver or commiſſion for overturning the ends of
government, and deſtroying the Commonvvealth: if the
Magiſtrates of a Brugh betray their truſt, dilapidate the rents
and revenues of the city, ſell and diſpone the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
thereof, may not the ſucceeding Magiſtrates call them to
an account for that, notvvithſtanding that in the capacity
of that judicatory, they had as much povver (if any) as
the poſteriour 4. Wonder at it vvho vvil, that vvhich is
right is right: and it is conſonant to equity, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of the People be ſo far judges of vvhat is done by
their Repreſentatives, as not to ſuffer them, in their name,
and by any povver borrovved from them, to deſtory the
Commonwealth and to overturne the fundations of Religion
and Liberty, &amp;c. [<q>But then (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) another objection
he makes <hi>poſteriour Parliaments and People both may erre.</hi> He
anſvveres, <hi>All that is true: God only muſt remede that.</hi>
                  </q>]
What can he make of this? [<q>Well then (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) if Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
or People deſtroy or murther perſons innocently,
God only muſt remeed that; there is no povver on Earth to
call them to an account: Who ſees not that at length the
author is driven to acknowledge a power, which if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
cannot be judged by any on earth.</q>] <hi>Anſw. Lex Rex</hi>
is not there ſpeaking of particular acts of injuſtice Or ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
but of the whole ends of government: And ſo if
Parliaments and People concurre and joyne together to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
all, the world ſees that there is no remedy on Earth:
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:105606:224"/>
Neither needed he to ſay that he was driven to this, ſeing it
was ſo obvious to all who have eyes in their head. Though
God hath appoynted meanes &amp; ordinary rules to help abuſes
that are ordinary; yet when corruption is univerſal the
ordinary meanes cannot availe, God himſelf muſt helpe that: &amp;
who knoweth not that extraordinary ſuppoſeable caſes cannot
infringe, or invalidate the ordinary rules for ordinary caſes.
Now all this is but vaine idle worke, and of no advantage
to his cauſe; for he shall never hence prove though he should
argue till his eyeſtrings break, that this Soveraigne uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable
power, which is not cenſureable nor punishable, is
only in the King: And if he do not this, how ſtops he the
Mouth of his adverſaries? Hovv ſalves he his Majeſtie's
life, or the King from all hazard of cenſure? But then he
adds to as little purpoſe, That [<hi>It may be ſeen that his principles
lead him to owne a meer democracy (which is the worst of governments)
as the only lawful government: he placeth and fixeth the unpunishable
ſoveraignity there.] Anſw.</hi> This is a groſſe miſtake: For this
Man underſtands not what a democracy is. He takes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy
to be where all governe: But that is no govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where there is none to be governed, but all are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.
Democracy is where ſome are choſen out of all
the People by turnes, without reſpect had to birth, meanes
or other privileges, to governe the reſt. And <hi>Lex Rex</hi> will
not ſay that theſe governours have an uncontrollable ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity,
but may be oppoſed &amp; reſiſted, by the body of
the People who chooſe them, as well as the King in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
or the Primores Regni in an Ariſtocracy; becauſe
under all ſpeces of governments, the fountaine power and
Majeſty abides in the People, and is reſumeable, in caſes of
neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſeen how poorly and weakly this vaine man
hath maintained the King's life and ſacred perſon, and how
by his foolish ſophiſtications, and his weake and impertinent
anſwers and aſſertions, he hath put the King's life in greater
hazard then it was; for theſe poor people never had a thought
of wronging his Majeſtie's perſon, or of ſpoyling him of his
life, but now vvhen he hath ſtarted the queſtion without any
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:105606:224"/>
provocation or juſt ground and occaſion given; and can ſay
no more then he here hath ſayd for that cauſe, hath he not
invited people to think of what they might do? And I am
ſure if they have no other reſtraint to binde up their hands,
all which he hath ſaid, will be but like the new ropes to
<hi>Sampſon.</hi> That which followeth in his third Chapter touching
the Covenants betwixt King and People, is impertinent to
his preſent purpoſe: For <hi>Naphtaly</hi> maketh uſe of theſe to
prove the lawfulneſſe of reſiſtence, as may be ſeen <hi>Pag. 19,</hi>
and 30. and for that end, we have vindicated them in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
diſcourſe from all his corrupt gloſſes and evaſions. And
wiſe Men will think him ſo far from deſerving a reward, for
what he hath done, that they will think he rather deſerveth
to be whipped, for his miſmanageing this queſtion of ſo great
conſequence, which he undertook to defend; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
for bringing the arguments, which are adduced to
evince the lawfulneſſe of reſiſtence, as if they did with equal
force ſtrick againſt his Majeſtie's life and perſon; whereas
many will be cleare for reſiſting, that will not be ſo cleare
for punishing or executing the Prince: and ſince by his
folly, and imprudent impertinency, making the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
prove both, people shall ſee that by what right they
may reſiſt, by the ſame right they may capitally punish the
Prince, they will be ſo far from being ſcarred form reſiſtence,
which natures light doth ſo evidentlly demonſtrate to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and neceſſary; that they will be more emboldened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
perceiving how they may do more, which poſſibly
would never elſe have come into their minde: and ſure all
which <hi>Naphtaly</hi> hath ſaid, could not have ſuggeſted ſuch a thing
unto them, or occaſioned their thoughts thereabout, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Readers will judge.</p>
               <p>If any aske what he hath left undone for ſecueing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie's
perſon and life? I am ſure to name no moe he hath
forgotten one thing, and that is, the preſſing of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
League and Covenant</hi> on the People; but knowing what
he hath both ſaid and done againſt this, he thought he could
not fairely retract and condemne his owne tongue and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:105606:225"/>
actions; yet if he think himſelf obliged to venture his life for
the life of his Majeſty, he might have alſo thought it his duty,
to take shame to himſelf, to repent of what he had done, and
recant what he had ſaid, for the ſecureing of his Majeſtie's
life and perſon. Now that the preſſing of this Covenant
upon the People, would be a ſoveraigne remedy to preſerve
his Majeſtie's life, his Majeſtie's Royal father knew it,
when being in the iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> &amp; fearing that violence should
have been done unto him by theſe in whoſe cuſtody he was,
he ſent for <hi>Mr. Ieremiah French</hi> miniſter of that place to which
<hi>Carisbrook</hi> caſtle belonged, and deſired him to preach the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and preſſe it upon the People, that thereby they
might be engaged to reſcue him, in caſe any ſuch thing
should be attempted by that part of the army: See for this the
poſtſcript to the <hi>Covenanters Plea.</hi> And ſure I am, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
would (as I ſaid before) faithfully minde this Covenant,
and cauſe the People ſtand to it, form the higheſt to the
loweſt, he would finde, that there could not be a more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
meane imagined, for ſecureing his perſon, then that
would be. If he would faithfully owne, and according to
his power lay out himſelf, for ſetling and ſecureing the maine
things contained in that Covenant, and walk in that due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
unto the Supreame governour of heaven and earth;
The very conſcience of theſe great and maine things, would
preſſe a conſcientious reſpect to, and a faithfull care of his
Majeſtie's perſon, in reference to theſe great Ends. Which
would prove more effectual for this end, then volumes of
railing ſophiſtications, which this perjured, Prophane and
malignant Prelate and anticovenanter could write and ſend
abroad.</p>

               <p>We grant that every man should walke in his owne calling

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:105606:226"/>
his owne buſineſſe, <hi>1 Theſſ 4: ver. 11.</hi> But when He and his
Party have perfidiouſly forſaken their calling, and have not
loved the honour to be quyet to do their owne buſineſſe, but
have ambitiouſly uſurped the honour and dignity of abjured
prelacy, and become Lords and Councellers and Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and thereby brought the wrath of God upon the land,
for our defection and Apoſtaſy, and are perſecuting all who
will not hold them in their ſaddle, and bear up their rideing
mantles, to the wronging of their owne ſouls and conſciences;
other perſons muſt minde their general calling as Chriſtians
and good Countreymen, and endeavour an averting of the
wrath of God, and a ſetting on foot againe a work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
according to their power: Ay but ſayes he,
[<hi>Satan can drive men under ſeveral colours of</hi> extreme neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
lawfulneſſe of the matter of actions, the goodneſſe of
ends and intentions, the want of others to do the work,
and mens owne probable capacity to do it? <hi>to act ſuch things,
whereof God will ſay I never required them at your hands.]
Anſw.</hi>
This is true, but what will he hence prove? Will he hence
conclude that God may not animate ſome, to ſome rare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes,
in a time of real extreame neceſſity, the matter of
the action being unqueſtionably lawful, their ends and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
really good and commendable, there being alſo a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of others to do the work, and themſelves in ſome
probable capacity for it? His conſequence will be denyed.
[<hi>This vaine Orator</hi> Naphtaly (ſayes he) <hi>will have the inſtance of</hi>
Phineas <hi>a precedent for any private perſons, (ſuch as lately did riſe)
under colour of high pitches of zeal and fortitude, to execute juſtice on al
powers and people of the land, as being fallen in ſuch a fearful Apoſtaſy,
as (keeping the true Protestant Religion,) do vary from them,
in the external ordering of the Miniſtry of the Church, and imbraceing
that way and order, against which there is no command of Christ,
yea for the conſonancy whereof to his word, much and very much may
be ſayd, &amp; hath been.] Anſ.</hi> He would fain mince the defection,
vvhereof he and the reſt are guilty, and tell us that they keep
the true proteſtant Religion; but hovv vve have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
and that all the difference is about an external ordering
of the miniſtry of the Church, againſt which there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:105606:226"/>
of Chriſt, and for which much may be ſaid, &amp; hath been
ſaid. But this is not the place to ſpeak of the abjured prelacy,
occaſion may given further in his following part: only we
would ſay that much more hath been ſaid againſt it, to shovv
it utterly unlavvful, then he òr all his fraternity vvill be able to
anſvvere: And unleſſe he prove it abſolutely neceſſary,
and no other forme lavvful, vvhich he dar not ſo much as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to prove, he shall never cleare the land of fearful
Apoſtaſy and defection, in renunceing a Covenant ſvvorne
by all ranks of people. And becauſe his feares are moſt about
himſelf and other Apoſtates, he ſuppoſeth that that diſcourſe
in <hi>Naphtaly</hi> is brought in of purpoſe to incite ſome to execute
juſtice on him, and ſuch as he is; vvhereas any may ſee that
it is caſt in among other things adduced to juſtify our firſt
Reformers: And ſo timorous is he, that becauſe that fact of
<hi>Phineas</hi> is not ſimply and poſitively declared not imitable, he
thinks it is held forth as a precedent to incite: Whereby
vve ſee vvhat an ill conſcience is. Ay but (ſayes he) [<hi>Though
he turne himſelf</hi> Proteus. <hi>like into many shapes—he cannot
put a ſufficient bar against confuſions under ſuch pretexts.</hi>] And
vvho ſuch a <hi>Protëus</hi> as this <hi>Surveyer,</hi> and his fraternity, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of baſe changelings: But thinks he it poſſible that any
doctrine can be ſo clearly and diſtinctly aſſerted as none vvill
ever abuſe to errour and confuſion? The Scripture is plaine
enough againſt Lordly Prelates, and Covenant breaking,
and yet we know how ſome can abuſe theſe truths of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to defend defectiion, and the overturning of the work
of God in his Church, and ſo confound and overturne all.
Thereafter he tells us, [<hi>That when this diſcourſe was first looked
upon—men of judgement conſidered that as the former bloody inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
were endeavoured to be juſtified by him, So he was laying
downe grounds for ſome mercyleſſe Maſsacre, and horrid aſſaſſinations,
on perſons in power and others—for now no man can have ſecurity
of his life.</hi>] What theſe men of judgment could be, who
could either ſuppoſe the former, if they conſidered the place
where that diſcourſe ſtood; or could fear the later, if they
conſidered the diſcourſe it ſelf, I cannot tell: But it is like,
he and the reſt of the Apoſtates, are accounted the Men of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:105606:227"/>
judgment; &amp; indeed as theſe might have fancyed the former,
ſo they might have feared the later: for were this fact of <hi>Phineas</hi>
aſſerted to be as much imitable as any other uncontrollable
example in ſcripture, all perſons, notwithſtanding thereof,
would have ſufficient ſecurity of their life, except ſuch as were
guilty of dreadful apoſtacy, cauſing, the plague of God to
break out upon the land: And we know the beſt examples
may be abuſed. And therefore that which he ſayeth <hi>pag. 106:
&amp;</hi> 107. concerning <hi>Munſter</hi> madneſſe, and the Murtherers
of the two <hi>Henries of France</hi> the 3. and 4. and the gunpouder
Traitours, and <hi>Arthington Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Hacket</hi> in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s
dayes, is nothing to the poynt: for neither heare we
that any of theſe founded their actions upon <hi>Phineas's</hi> fact:
and though they had done ſo, It would not have proved that
it was not imitable, in any caſes: for why? Wicked Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
have perſecuted innocents, in all ages, shall therefore
the examples of good Magiſtrates executing juſtice on wicked
apoſtates, and flagitious perſones and idolaters, be declared
altogether un-imitable, becauſe ſome corrupt Magiſtrates
under that pretext abuſe that power, and perſecute ſuch as
they should rather honour and highly reward? would not
any body ſmile at ſuch a conſequence? And yet ſuch is his
here. Let him make it to appear, that the matter of the actions
of theſe perſons was lawful, and the neceſſity extreme, and
the caſe was the ſame as to the deficiency of others to do the
work, and that they were in a probable capacity to do it, &amp;
then he shall ſpeak more home to the caſe. He needs not
tell his readers, <hi>Pag. 107. [That ſuch abhominable courſes
carryed on under pretext of heroick motions, and rare exitations
of the ſpirit, should make the fearers of God very cautelous
against the principles of this Man, which lead this way.</hi>] For
that man neither approveth theſe courſes, nor any ſuch
like, nor doth his principles lead that way, whatever
he imagine; nor doth he aſſert (as he alledgeth,) <hi>[that
there needs no ſtanding upon an externall call, if men think they have
his internal call to uſe the ſword for vengeance against Apostate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates—and
Reforme an Apostate Church, their zeal is
a ſufficient call to riſe up in a</hi> Phineas <hi>like fortitude, without further,</hi>]
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:105606:227"/>
as any vvill ſee vvho reads over that diſcourſe. Nor needeth
he to ſay, <hi>[that if people be ſo principled, it were better living under
the great Turk, where no man is to loſſe his life but by Law, then in</hi>
Scotland,] For he doth not expoſe any to the fury of private
perſons, who can pretend rare and heroick excitations of the
Spirit to execute juſtice on men, when they think there is
cauſe (as he ſuppoſeth in the following words) nor could
he rationally be ſuppoſed to do ſo, though he had clearly
and poſitively aſſerted that that fact of <hi>Phineas</hi> was, in all
poynts &amp; alwayes, imitable; far leſſe when he is loath to aſſert
ſo much, as this <hi>Surveyer</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth in the
following words, <hi>Pag. 108.</hi> confeſſing that he ſaid, <hi>we hold
no ſuch inſtances as regular precedents for all times and perſons uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally.</hi>
What diſpleaſeth him then? <hi>[But where is</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>the caution that is put in against any that will pretend heroïcal
excitations by the ſpirit, as a ſufficient cal: he hath opened a door but how
will he cloſe it againe? Anſw.</hi> What could himſelf ſay more to
bar a heady People from ſuch pretenſions of <hi>Phineas</hi>-like
motions, then that it was not a regular precedent for all
times and Perſons? Is it not poſſible (as hath been ſaid) yea
and often ſeen, that the moſt cleare and approved examples
have been abuſed? And what can be ſaid to this, but that
ſuch muſt run their owne hazard and beare their owne guilt?
God only can prevent all confuſion in all caſes. It is falſe
which he addeth that <hi>[This man hath proclamed this libertiniſme
to private perſons, upon pretence of heroïck excitations of Zeal &amp;c. to
riſe up againſt all powers above them; for they are made judges in their
owne private diſcretion, when it is fit to fall in hand with ſuch irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
practices; and when it is that ſuch heröick excitations are upon
their ſpirits, and when it is that matters are ſo far out of order that they
cannot be amended without their violent interpoſeing, and pulling
downe of powers: All this is referred to private perſons diſcretion.]
Anſ.</hi> No ſuch thing is there ſaid, and <hi>Phineas</hi> inſtance will give
ground for no ſuch thing, though it were preſſed as a moſt
regular precedent. As we grant with him, that <hi>Quakers</hi> and
<hi>Ranters, &amp;c.</hi> may ſtart up, aud plead their impulſes, and
that People (when they minde changes) will not want
pretexts: But what ſayes that againſt the thing, ſeing the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:105606:228"/>
beſt things may be abuſed? Ay but <hi>Naphtaly</hi> (ſayes he)
holds <hi>[That Magiſtrates when patroniſers of abhominations ought
without doubt be ſuppreſſed by all meanes; ſo that if there be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
capacity for armes, a dag or a dagger, a piſtol or a poiſoned
poinard, a ſpanish fig or ſome ſecret applications, may do the buſineſſe
with ſome great ones] Anſw. Naphtaly</hi> in the place cited <hi>Pag. 18.</hi>
is ſpeaking of open idolatry, blaſphemy, perjury, venting and
ſpreading of hereſy, and ſuch like abhominations, which
being moſt dishonourable to God, &amp; pernicious to all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,
ought, ſayes he, by all meanes to be ſuppreſſed,
that is by all faire and poſſible meanes, for <hi>illud tantum
poſſumus quod jure poſſumus,</hi> and ſo, had he not been too
captious, be reaſon of (it is like) his green wound, he might
have ſpared the reſt, and to his liturgical prayer following
<hi>[That the life our dread Soveraigne may be bound up with the Lord

let is Majeſty and other Magiſtrates, reforme their wayes,
and turne to the Lord, and execute judgement on him and his
complices, and all the reſt, who now pretend to honour
the King, and to feare God, but in effect to deifie a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and renunce their homage to the King of Kings, and ſo
provoke him to deſtroy both them and their King, by their
apoſtaſy and wicked defection, and that openly before men
and Angels, as <hi>David</hi> hanged up the Sons of Saul before the
ſun; and then they need not fear either dag or dagger, piſtol
or poyſoned poinard, a ſpanish fig, nor any ſuch ſecret appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
               <p>Thereafter <hi>Pag. 109.</hi> he comes more particularly to conſider
that diſcourſe, and gives us there and in the following <hi>Pages 7.</hi>
or 8. <hi>Anſwers</hi> The firſt is [<hi>That it is much doubted if</hi> Phineas
<hi>was a meer private perſon, being the high Prieſts ſon, and a chief
prieſt, and a Prince in his tribe</hi> Numb. 31: 6. Joſ. 22: 31, 32.
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:105606:228"/>
                  <hi>one of the great Council</hi> Num. 1: 16. and 16: 2. <hi>who did in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maltime,</hi>
Numb. 25: 6, <hi>meet with</hi> Moſes <hi>the chief Magiſtrate
to lament the ab hominable idolatry, and bodyly filthineſse committed
at that time, and to conſult and adviſe, about the authoritative
reſtraining of this wickedneſſe: In the mean time when the great
council are humbled before the Lord,</hi> Zimri <hi>with his Midianitish wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man,
are in their very ſight going in to the tent, and</hi> Joſephus
<hi>ſayes, that before</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Council, he juſtified the fact,
and pleaded frowardly to have and retaine her. In this caſe of ſo
effronted wickedneſse,</hi> Phineas <hi>then one of the congregation or great
Council v. 6.</hi> roſe from among the congregation <hi>(or great Council
which shewes he was ſitting amongſt them) &amp; under the eye &amp; knowledge
and approbation of Moſes the ſupreame Magistrate, purſued them
both to the tent, and thruſt them thorow.] Anſw. 1.</hi> Then it ſeemes
this fact of <hi>Phineas</hi> was a laudable act of judice in a Magiſtrate,
and ſo muſt be a precedent example for judges and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
in all time coming, and by this example, any member
of the Council might lawfully riſe up, and execute judgment
on this wicked wreatch and his curſed fraternity, who have
brought, by their apoſtaſy and defection from the Covenant
and cauſe of God, the wrath and curſe of God upon the
land. 2. That <hi>Phineas</hi> was the High Prieſt's ſone, we know;
and that he was afterward High prieſt himſelf, is truth; but
that he was at this time a publick Magiſtrate, or a member of
the great Sanhedrin, we ſee not. It is true there were ſome
Princes of the tribes, men of renowne <hi>Numb. 1. ver. 16.</hi> but he
is not mentioned among thoſe; neither were theſe the great
<hi>Sanhedrin.</hi> So <hi>theſe</hi> princes of the aſſembly <hi>Numb. 16: 2.</hi> were
not the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> which did conſiſt but of 70 Members,
<hi>Numb. 11.</hi> Nor was <hi>Phineas</hi> one of them. And that congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the children of Iſrael mentioned, <hi>Numb. 25: 6.</hi>
amongſt whom <hi>Phineas</hi> was <hi>ver. 7.</hi> was not the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi>
which we never finde (as I remember) ſo called; but the
whole body of the People, who were then mourning partly
for the ſin commited, and partly for the execution, when
the heads of the People vvere hanged up, and a thouſand
moe killed by the judges, at <hi>Moſes</hi> his command: for <hi>Paul
1 Cor. 10: ver. 8.</hi> ſayes there died of the plague tvventy three
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:105606:229"/>
thouſand, and here vve finde there fell in all tvventy foure
thouſand. Againe it is remarkable that this ſingle act of
<hi>Phineas</hi> in killing two perſons is ſo much rewarded and taken
notice of by the Lord, yea more then the many who were
killed by the judges <hi>ver. 5.</hi> So that it ſeemes he was no
publick Magiſtrate: and that he did it with the approbation
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is probable; but that <hi>Moſeſ</hi> did command him, we
ſee not; only we finde that the Zeal of God moved him,
and therefore is he highly rewarded, though he was but
<hi>the ſon of Eleazar the ſon of Aaron.</hi> Yea that which the <hi>Surveryer</hi>
citeth out of <hi>Deodat</hi> rather confirmeth this, for <hi>Deodat</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it an act of extraordinary zeal &amp; motion of God's Spirit,
and he addeth that <hi>Moſes</hi> the Supreme Magisſtrate did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it; but what needed this, if he had been a Magiſtrate,
ſeing there was a command given to the Magiſtrates <hi>ver. 5.</hi>
and a command is more then an approbation, <hi>Aquinas</hi> and
<hi>Gerhard</hi> call him, it is true, a judge, but we ſee no proof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they could evince that he was a member of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi>
of which <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> ſpeaks in his <hi>Aarons rod. lib. I. c. I.</hi> The
<hi>Dutch Annotat.</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106: 31. Suppoſe him to have been
no Magiſtrate, but ſay that this fact was beſide his ordinary calling.</p>
               <p>His 2. anſwere is <hi>Pag. III. That ſuppoſe he had been a meer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſon, yet it could prove nothing, becauſe he did it with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
and good liking of Moſeſ, and ſo he is but the executor of
that unanimous ſentence. Anſw.</hi> But not only is this not written,
but the ſcripture giveth another ground of his fact, then any
warrand or command of <hi>Moſes:</hi> And ſo his anſwere <hi>in rebus
facti, a non ſcripto ad non factum non valet conſequentia</hi> is not to
the purpoſe. Now I ſay the ſcripture giveth another ground
<hi>viz.</hi> his zeal for his God, which is not ſpoken of the other
judges who ver. 5. were commanded of <hi>Moſes</hi> to execute
judgment, yea that word <hi>Pſal. 106: 30. then stood up Phineas
and executed judgment</hi> clearely hinteth at more then his being
a meer <hi>ſatelles Magiſtratus,</hi> and the ample reward which was
given him, and the Lord's counting it to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſpeak ſome other thing, then that he had a call of the

In the 3 place, he ſayes. <hi>[The caſes are different; for then
was horrible idolatry and villanous whordome committed avowedly,
and with a high hand, in the ſight of the Sun, and in way of open doing
deſpite to God, but it is not ſo now.] Anſw.</hi> Prudence might have
taught him to have concealed this, for it were eaſy to draw
ſuch a parallel as would make him afrayed, if any did intend
to follow that example: For I am ſure what ever he account
of the preſent apoſtaſy, and how ever he mince it, as no
doubt <hi>zimri</hi> would have minced his uncleanneſſe, when he
juſtified the fact before the Council, as he told us <hi>Ioſephus</hi>
ſaid; yet the apoſtaſy and perjury is open, avowed, abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and villanous, committed in the ſight of the Sun, in
deſpite of God, and maintained as right and lawful, howbeit
it be ſuch as the very heavens may be aſtonished at: For ſuch
open, avovved, malapert vvickedneſſe, defection and perjury
(all things conſidered) vvas never heard of in any generation.
Hovv our reformation, aud confeſſion of faith is maintained,

a change of the exterior forme of Church government, yet
when he is before his judge, he shall finde in the cup of this
iniquity, manifeſt &amp; avowed perjury, overturning of the work
of God, deſtroying of the intereſt of Chriſt, blaſphemy, near
unto that unpardonable ſin (if not the very ſame,) in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
the works of the right hand of the Moſt high, on
Satan; open and avowed perſecution of godlineſſe; opening
of a gap to all licentiouſneſſe, horrid iniquity, increaſe of
idolatry; villanous and avowed whordome, Sodomy,
atheiſme and devilry, and more wickedneſſe then tongue can
tell, or pen can paint out, but is on clear record before the

               <p>4. (Sayes he) <hi>[Let it be ſo, that he was a meer private man,
and had no warrand from the Supreame Magistrate to do what he did,

they can shew as good warr and and approbation from God as he could.]
Anſw.</hi>
That he had God's warrand and approbation vve do
not doubt; but that it was ſuch an approbation as was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to extraordinary un-imitable acts, is the thing in queſtion,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:105606:230"/>
we grant with him. That God is the Lord of all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
and of all men's lives, can (when it pleaſeth him)
croſſe ordinary rules, and apppoynt ſome to execute his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
extraordinariely, but the question is whether every
thing, which the <hi>Surv.</hi> accounteth extraordinary, is ſo indeed.
<hi>[He may</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ſend</hi> Moſes <hi>to kill the Egyptian</hi> Eglon <hi>to kill</hi>
Ehud (he should ſay <hi>Ehud</hi> to kill <hi>Eglon</hi>) Elias <hi>to destroy companyes
of men with fire from heaven, or to kill</hi> Baal's <hi>Priests: He may command</hi>
Abraham <hi>to kill his ſone</hi> Iſaac: <hi>he may excite</hi> David <hi>to a bloody duëel

theſe inſtances alike extraordinary and unimitable? Sure
Royaliſts will think that <hi>Ehud's</hi> killing of <hi>Eglon</hi> may warrand
any private perſon now, to kill a tyrant without title. But
I lay more weight upon <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> his distinction in this
matter, in his debate with <hi>Lithingtoun, hist. of reformation,</hi>
Pag. 390. <hi>(edit in fol.) [And as touching</hi> (ſayes Mr. Knox)
<hi>that ye alledge that the fact was extraordinary, &amp; is not to be imitated.
I ſay That it had the ground of God's ordinary judgement, which
commandeth the Idolater to die the death: and therefore I yet againe
affirme, that it is to be imitate of all these that preferre the true honour
of the true worshipe and glory of God, to the affection of flesh, and
wicked Princes.]</hi> and when <hi>Lithingtoun</hi> replyed. <hi>That we are
not bound to follow extraordinary examples, unleſſe we have the like
commandment and aſſurance</hi> (the ſame which this <hi>Surveyer</hi>
ſayeth.) He anſwered <hi>[I grant if the example repugne to the law,
as if an avaricious and deceitful man would borrow Silver; Rayment,
or other Neceſſaryes from his Neighbour, and withhold the ſame,
alledging that ſo he might do, and not offend God, becauſe the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
at their departure out of Egypt, did so to the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>The
example ſerved to no purpoſe, unleſſe that they could produce the like
cauſe, and the like commandement, that the Iſraelites had: And
that becauſe their fact repugned to this commandement of God</hi> Thou
shall not ſteal: <hi>But where the example agrees with the law, and is,
as it were, the execution of God's judgment, expreſsed within the
ſame, I ſay that the example approved of God stands to us in place
of a commandement; for as God, in his Nature is constant and
immutable, ſo can he not condemne in the ages ſubſequent, that
which he hath approved in his ſervants before us; but in his ſervants
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:105606:230"/>
before us, he in his owne word confounds all such as crave further
approbation of Gods will, then it already expreſsed within his ſcriptures;
for Abraham ſaid, They have</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets &amp;c. Even
ſo I ſay, that ſuch as will not be taught what they ought to do by the
commandement of God once given, and once put in practice, will not
beleeve nor obey, albeit that God should ſend Angles from heaven to
instruct that doctrine.]</hi> Now ſure I am this fact of <hi>Phineas</hi> was
according to the law, and to the expreſſe minde of God, and
why then might it not be imitated in the like caſe? what
warrand, command nor commisſſion had <hi>Phineas</hi> which none now
can expect? 1. <hi>(ſayes he) [He had the Motion and direction
of God's Spirit, which was</hi> loco ſpecialis mandati.] <hi>Answ.</hi> We
know men muſt need the Motions and directions of God's
ſpirit to ordinary and allovved dutyes: Hovv shall
theſe make this fact altogether un-imitable? It is true
<hi>Calvin</hi> ſayeth <hi>it was ſingular and extraordinare motion,
which may not be drawne to a common rule,</hi> but notwithſtanding
thereof, I ſee not how it should be altogether un-imitable or
uſeleſſe. But grant it were ſo, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſayeth, unleſſe he
ſay that it is never to be imitated, in no caſe, and that no ſuch
thing is ever to be expected, which I ſuppose he will not ſay,
how will he prevent confuſions thorow the abuſe of corrupt
men, who can pretend as wel theſe ſingulare and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare
Motions, as the examples of <hi>Phineas?</hi> As for what he
tells us <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> ſay of <hi>Samſon's</hi> caſe, is not to the
poynt: Becauſe according to that ſolid diſtinction of <hi>Mr.
Knox,</hi> that was contrare to an expreſſe law, <hi>Thou shall not kill,</hi>
and ſuch alſo is the example of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 2. He tells us,
That [Phineas <hi>had not only a large reward of his fact,</hi> Numb. 25:
ver. 12, 13. <hi>but an ample approbation of it.</hi> Pſal. 106: sver. 31:
it was accounted to him for righteouſneſſe. <hi>i. e. as a righteous
action, both as to the intention of it (God's honour) and as to the
ground and warrand of it (God's direction) God doth not approve
or remuner at any action, which one way or other he doth not command.]
Auſw.</hi> This is all granted; and as it ſayeth that <hi>Phineas</hi> was
no publick perſon or Magiſtrate, otherwiſe there had been
no doubt anent its being accounted to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
though it had not been expreſly mentioned by the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:105606:231"/>
Spirit of God, for it ſayeth that sometimes private perſones
are allowed of God, to do what he requireth in ordinary to
be done by Magiſtrates. [<hi>There are none of theſe extraordinary
actions</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>mentioned in Scripture, but either God's ſtirring
up men to the ſame, or his approbation of the ſame, one way or other is
noted: See</hi> Judg. 3: ver 10. <hi>and</hi> 5: ver. 7. <hi>and</hi> 10: ver. 23.
<hi>and</hi> 3: ver. 9, 15. <hi>and</hi> 2: 16, 18.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> Will he ſay that
all theſe instances were extraordinary and not imitable?
Whence will Royaliſts then prove, that privaate persons may
kill a Tyrant without title? And if they be not altogether
unimitable, then the cauſe is here yeelded; for God may be
ſaid to <hi>raiſe up,</hi> and to <hi>ſtir up Mens Spritis</hi> even to imitable
actions; &amp; ſo he hath given us no reaſon as yet to prove <hi>Phineas</hi>
fact altogether unimitable; nor will the real rebukes, which
he ſaith God gave the late riſers, proclame that they had not
his approbation, unleſſe he ſay that God's approbation of
actions must alwayes be interpreted by the event, which is
not consonant to true Divinity.</p>
               <p>In the 5. place he tells us, [<hi>That if once men come to preſſe the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
of this instance, they must ſay, first, that even when the
Magiſtrate is godly and zealous and willing to execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(as</hi> Moſes <hi>was) private perſsons may do it, and without any
legal proceſſe, 2. goe to mens tents and chambers and stob them, and 3.
that though ſuch things be done</hi> inconſulto pio Magiſtratu, <hi>yet
the doer must not be challenged.] Answ.</hi> It will be sufficient if it
be granted, when the caſe is every way the like, or whose:
It is true, <hi>Moſes</hi> was not unwilling, but it is like at preſent in
capacitated, through the want of aſſiſtence of inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
many of whom were guilty, and many had been
executed; and through grief, while lying mourning before
the Lord. 2. There needed no legall proceſſe; for both
the law and the ſentence was written with characters of blood
upon the carcaſes of thouſands; &amp; this Mans fact was notour
and avowed, to all the Congregation. 3. He had the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative
conſent of that pious Magiſtrate: why then may
not the like be done in the like caſe, where the <hi>Ius,</hi> and the
<hi>factum</hi> is as clear and undenyable as here, and the Magiſtrate,
who should execute the ſentence is out of a preſent capacity,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:105606:231"/>
and the matter admitteth of no delay as here, (for till this
was done, the plague was never ſtayed,) much more if he
will not, and wrath is ſtill poured out from the Lord; and
the Magiſtrate by his place is bound to aſſent, &amp; approve
of the thing. If such a fact were done in the like caſe, would
any think that the perſon should be challenged and not rather
approved by the Magiſtrate?</p>
               <p>In the 6. Place he <hi>giveth us, the diſtinction betwixt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and heröical acts, telling us that a heroick act doth not deviat
from the rule of a common vertue, but only proceeds from a more
intenſe diſpoſition to a high pitch of vertue and of the acts thereof: But
an extraordinary action goes beyond any ordinary rule of common reaſon
or divine word, as that Abraham should kill his Sone Iſaac.] Answ.</hi>
We shall not contend with him much about this, since he
will grant that heroick actions are imitable, as not being
contrary to a rule of common vertue; though extraordinary
actions, which are rather contrary to the rule of common
vertue, may not be imitated: And he hath not yet proved,
neither can he prove that <hi>Phineas's</hi> fact was so far beyond any
ordinary rule of common reaſon or divine word, as was that
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the like. We shall grant with him. That
[<hi>Extraordinary actions, are ſuch as are done upon ſpecial mandate of
God, and are not within the compaſse of ordinary acts of obedience
according to the rule, that is ſet.</hi>] And that [<hi>men may have heroick
motions &amp; actions within the bounds of an ordinary calling, as</hi> Luther
<hi>had; as ſometimes, though they have an extraordinary calling, they
may want heroical motions, as</hi> Peeter <hi>when he diſſembled.</hi> [But
what ſayes this to <hi>Phine as</hi> his fact? [Phineas (ſayes he)
<hi>had not only excitations of zeal and heröical motions, but (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing
him a meer private person) he is to be looked upon as having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
calling from God.] Answer.</hi> Doth this man give a
diſtinct ſound? He complained of the Author of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
concerning <hi>Phineas,</hi> that he turned himself <hi>Protëus.</hi>-like
into many shapes, and we finde himself doing little better
here: He dar not ſay positively whether he was a meer
private perſon or not, but if he was ſuch, then the action
was extraordinary; but what if he was not? Then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was neither extraordinary nor heröical, and thus we
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:105606:232"/>
are no wiſer then we were; for we know not what to make
of the action; nor what to make of the perſon, but we muſt
judge of the perſon by the action; And of the action by the
perſon. That is to ſay, if he was a Magiſtrate then the action
was ordinare, but if he was a private perſon then the action
was extraordinary: and <hi>è contra,</hi> if the action was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he was a private perſon, and if it was ordinare and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
Then he was a publick perſon. Is not this a ſingularly
ſatisfactory way of anſwereing? But it is obſervable that
he dar not here ſay that <hi>Phineas's</hi> fact was extraordinary, but
that he is to be looked upon as having an extraordinary call,
now a man may have an extraordinary call to an action imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
as the Apoſtles had an extraordinary call to preach the
Goſpel, and yet that action of theirs is imitable. But how
proves he this extraordinary call? <q>[It is (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) fully
enough inſinuated both by God's approving and rewarding
him <hi>Numb. 25.</hi> (and he rewards not our wil - ſervice,
nor approves it, but what he hath enjoyned himſelf) and
alſo by <hi>P ſal.</hi> 106. where it is ſaid Emphatically <hi>it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him for righteousneſſe:</hi> though judging according to
ordinary Rules, it might be imputed to him for ſin (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeing
him for a meer private man) yet, having God's
warrand, whoſe will is the rule of righteouſneſſe, the deed
was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe]</q> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true,
God revvards not, nor approves not vvil-ſervice, yet he
approves and revvards other actions, then ſuch as are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and not imitable. 2. God's <hi>imputing it unto him for
rightoeuſneſse,</hi> ſayes clearly he vvas a private perſon, and
that God accepted of his ſervice as a noble act of holy zeal for
God and his glory, and rather ſpeakes out an encouragement
to all, to do the like in the like caſe, then any extraordinary
call he had, vvhich none novv can expect.</p>
               <p>Then in the 7 place he ſpeaks of <hi>Callings</hi> &amp; ſayes that <q>[Every
calling a man hath to any work Muſt be either Mediate or
immediate (there is no mids betwixt theſe two, as there is
not between contradictories) if they be not called by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of men, &amp; their allowance, they muſt plead an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
calling from God.]</q> 
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Beacauſe I minde not to enter
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:105606:232"/>
into a Logomachy, or debate about words, &amp; tearmes; I
would deſre him to tell me, what call men have to run together
to extinguish a fire in a city, when the Magiſtrates through
wickedneſſe or negligence will not, or do not, call People
forth unto that work. They have not Man's call, nor have
they an immediate call from heaven, and yet they have a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
call from God, Nature and neceſſity, to ſave the city,
their houſes, goods &amp; little ones, from being burnt into ashes.
And what ever name he give to this call, we will allow it to
private perſons to defend Religion and a land form ruine and
deſtruction, when Magiſtrates do not nor will not do their
duty. And when men, whether out of ſecret impulſes,
heroical motions, or out of meer ſenſe &amp; conſcience of duty,
do this, they do not deſert their owne calling and ſtate, like
theſe ſpirits <hi>lud. ver. 6.</hi> Nor do they intrude upon the
Magiſtrate's office, though they do materially that work for
that exigent, which Magiſtrates by office were bound to do,
being called thereto by God, by Nature, and the call of
inevitable neceſſity, which knoweth no humane law, and
to which ſome divine poſitive lawes will cede. But then he
ſayes <hi>Pag. 115. [Why is not alſo ſufficient for the office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
without a call from men externally?] Anſw.</hi> And doth he
think that neceſſity will not allow a man ſufficiently gifted and
qualified to exerce that office without an externall call from
men, in ſome caſes? What if a company of Men be caſt out
on an iſland, having no correſpondence nor poſſibility of
correſpondence with other places, whence they might
have ſome lawfully called Miniſter; and there be one among
them qualified for the work, might not he in that caſe think
himſelf called of God to exerce that function? And when
we grant this, we need not yeeld unto <hi>Anabaptiſts, Enthuſiaſts
photinians,</hi> or the like, who are againſt an external call at any
time, alledging that gifts are ſufficient [<hi>And</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>how
shall be refuſe to admit women to Baptize Children in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?]
Anſw.</hi> He shall not refuſe providing he shew the
neceſſity, which he shall not be able to do unleſſe he turne
Papiſt, and then he will imbrace the conſequent alſo, without
our admiſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:105606:233"/>
In the 8 place he comes to tell us that [<hi>It is in vaine to ſay
that</hi> God's hand is not shortened, &amp;c. <hi>for our queſtion is not of
that, but if now after the Canon of holy Scripture is perfected ſealed
and conſigned, we have warrand to look for any extraordinary perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones,
having Gods ſecret and ſpecial Mandates, to do works which
any ordinary calling doth not intereſt them in?] Anſw.</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes
and predictions of future events, are not works, which
any ordinary calling men have, by allowance and approbation
of Men, according to the rules of common reaſon and the
word, doth intereſt them in; and doth he think God's ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and perfecting the Canon of Scripture hath ſo bound him
up, as that he will not, or cannot now give ſuch a Spirit unto
any? 2. The queſtion rather is; Whether now when the
Canon is ſealed and perfected, examples of Zeal and valiant
acting for God and his glory, in times of corruption and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
in actions not contrary to the Law of God, regiſtrated
in Scripture, be not for our uſe and inſtruction, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table?</p>
               <p>When <hi>Naphtaly</hi> wished that all God's People were as
<hi>Phineas</hi> He concurreth with him [<hi>In wishing that they may be
filled with zeal to his glory as</hi> Phineas <hi>was; but not that they should
have the ſame exerciſe of zeal, unleſſe they could be certified of their
warrand and calling to do ſo, as he was.] Anſ.</hi> That he was certified
of his calling &amp; warrand we doubt not, but that he had ſuch a
call as no man now is capable of, is the queſtion; &amp; he hath not
yet cleared it. [<hi>The Apoſtles of Chriſt</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>are to us examples
of zeal for God in their Miniſtery; but who will ſay that the acts which
they Zealouſly did, by virtue of their extraordinary calling, as</hi>
Peter's <hi>killing</hi> Ananias, <hi>are for our imitation.] Anſw. Peter</hi> killed
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> by a power of miracles, which none now
have. <hi>Phineas</hi> did not kill the Prince and his whore, by a
power of miracles. Their examples are imitable according

it is commanded that the whole city, when it becometh
idolatrous should be cut off by fire &amp; ſword: And <hi>Lev. 24.</hi> it
is ſtatuted, that the blaſphemer should not live; to which we

preſent did conſent, and did not withſtand; but we ſee
nothing in the text shewing that the Prophet founded his fact
upon that conſent. It is true, the King might have been ſo
aſtonished by that prodigious ſight, that he durſt not ſpurne
againſt the Prophet, and all the People: But that for all
this, he gave any expreſſe command, either through fear,
or deſire to have raine; or that the Prophet either ſought,
or had his warrand and command for what he did, we ſee
no ground for it in the text, More then <hi>Samuel</hi> had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand

none more then our Court novv in being, that none durſt
without manifeſt hazard openly rebuke in the gate, or in

diſcourſe is but an hiſtorical deduction of the troubles, the
Church of Scotland, in her reformation, hath met with
at the hands of a popish, prelatical and Malignant faction,
with a neceſſary vindication of the truth, which is allovved
to all hiſtorians, that thereby, truth may be the more cleared,

do not all ſee, who conſider either its ſcope, or its method,
or the vvhole ſtraine of the diſcourſe, that it can be tearmed
nothing elſe, then a moſt impudent, inſolent and infamous
libel, being not only larded, with bitter invectives againſt
the Cauſe and People of God, and railing ſpeaches more
ſuteable (if ſuteable for any rational creature) for open ſcolds
and brawling wives, then for a man, (unleſſe he except ſuch
a man, as hath by perjury and more then feminine levity,
declared himſelf, by his owne grant, to be <hi>one of a debauched
conſcience</hi>) but alſo tending moſt falſly to father on the honeſt
people of God ſuch things as never came into their mindes:
Whereby this railing <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> proveth himſelf, to all ſober
judicious perſons, to be an impudent lying calumniator; and
his pamphlet, a more then ordinarily inſolent, baſe, lying,

his rewarders will finde) moved the debate; unleſſe he bring
ſome other things above board, in the next part or parts, then

               <p>4. Moreover, he tells us, that [<hi>here ſome doctrines in</hi>

               <p>5. In this 1. <hi>part</hi> he tels us that [<hi>He Repreſents the dreadful

wickedly for God, &amp;c.</hi> A paſſage which moſt fitly quadrats
with him (unleſſe he ſay he intendeth not to plead for God,

who, as Job's Friends conſpired againſt <hi>Iob,</hi> and maintained
a wrong <hi>theſis,</hi> &amp; erred no leſſe in the <hi>hypotheſis</hi> or in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

                  <hi>Anabaptists</hi>) he would reckon the faithful of the land, who
adhere to their Covenants, and are conſtantly ſet againſt that
abjured hierarchy. But when we marke his ſcope, we ſee
what he would ſay in plaine tearmes, if he durſt for shame,
<hi>viz.</hi> That they are now the only militant Church of the
Lord in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This is a great change, I confeſſe, when
Chriſt shall have no other Church in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the perjured,
apoſtatical, popish, prelatical and malignant faction, that
hath been from the beginning, an heart and avowed enemy to
the Church and People of God, and never more wicked and
debauched then it is this day: And yet ſo holy is it, that it
muſt arrogate to itſelf alone, the name of the Church.
But what Church? Be-like the Synagoge of Satan which call

who ſay they ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat, are ſuch patrons of profanity,

Members in any tolerably reformed Church? Are
they the militant Church, who triumph in their ſilks and
velvets, rideing with foot mantels in Parliaments, ſitting in
Councils and Seſſions? I fear many, of them shall never

betwixt two milſtones, where is the profeſſedly profane,
and atheiſtical world which trouble them? Sure, ſeing theſe
are the only members of their Church, they muſt be nothing

of God finde them the upper milſtone too: for by them and at

death, ſcattered into corners; and banished to other nations.
And as he cannot give us the profeſſedly prophane and athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical

It ſeemeth then that prelacy can comply better
vvith Anabaptiſme, then presbytery; and ſo it will indeed:
For they being tvvo of Satan's devices muſt not diſcorde. It
vvould appear that neither <hi>Whitgift</hi> nor <hi>Hooker</hi> have been ſo

ſuch vile things iſſueing from <hi>Naphtaly</hi> (when what he ſayes

               <p>3. This meek man tells us next, <hi>That it is not his deſigne to
offend the generation of the humble, meek, ſelf denyed ſeekers of God's

obtaine the ſame prize of the inheritance.</hi> O! who can decyphere
unto us theſe perſons; who are theſe humble meek, ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeekers of God's face, whom this man will not grieve? Are
theſe the latitudinarian Atheiſts, the Gallioes, the coldrife
Laôdiceans, who care not what Religion be profeſſed? It is
like men of that principle, will not be much grieved by any
thing which he hath ſaid O! but he meaneth ſome of thoſe
who differ from him in judgment in ſome particulars: but what
are theſe particulars? <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>tuum?</hi> I feare he take not ſuch

as little reaſon to take him for ſuch an one. Are theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
Church Government? And who are theſe who differ
from him in that poynt, whom he accounts humble meek
and ſelf denyed? Poſſibly the few honeſt publick reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.
But I ſuppoſe theſe faithful Men deſire none of his
commendations. Neither will they look upon themſelves
as partakers of the ſame precious faith with him and his fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
who have made shipewrak of their faith. Nor do

&amp; broad curſe, which will enter into the houſe of him that
ſweareth falſly, and the heavy wrath and vengeance
of God due to apoſtates; as they like not to turne Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and ſwallow downe bishopriks which, is all the prize,
and all the inheritance, which ſome run over light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

Is he ignorant of the original of that ſad conteſt? Is he yet
to be informed that the rational feares and foreſight of not a
few of theſe Miniſters and Profeſſors who obtained mercy
to be jealous for the Lord, did impoſe a neceſſity upon them
(in order to the preventing of a re-eſtablishing and re-intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceing

of theſe abjured abhominations) to Diſſent from,
and proteſt againſt, the courſe which was at that time taken,
in public judicatories: And upon the other hand theſe god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men (whom, with much ſorrow of heart, and the greateſt
of reluctancies, they did oppoſe, as knoweing how really
deare the precious intereſts of Chriſt were to them) being
Conſcious of their ovvne integrity and ſtreightneſſe, in the
matters of God, and meaſureing others by themſelves, (or
thinking it hardly poſſible; yea rather morally impoſſible;
that the very ſame men, who had joyned with them in ſo
ſolemne an ingagement to God, and by vvhom, the ſouls of
his People thorovv the Land, had been brought under the
bond of the Covenant, could, vvhile pretending to their
former ſtreightneſſe be ſuch miſcreants and monſters, that
neither any Conſcience toward God, nor shame before the
world, could bind them to the good behaviour, and tye
them up from returneing to their former vomit) did miſtake
their brethren in that oppoſition, and became jealous of
them; and did likewiſe by a ſad overplus of ill grounded
Charity, miſtake the enemies of the work of God for friends;
and becauſe they had once with them ingaged to pluk up that
unhallowed plant of prelacy, as none of Gods planteing,
under an <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> they vvere not ſuſpicious that
this accurſed thing vvas ſtill vvith them, or that after they
had joyned vvith them, in commending the good wayes of
God, and crying <hi>Grace Grace</hi> upon the building, they
should vvith the ſame breath, cry out <hi>Crucify Crucify</hi> all the
friends of the vvork of God; and by an unparalleled diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
onely be vvatching for an opportunity of burſting
his bonds aſunder, and caſting avvay his cords from them:
He cannot be ignorant, I ſay, that this gave the riſe to all
theſe ſad debats; and therefore, I am hopeful and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that vvhen that myſtery of iniquity vvhich vvas then

God?</hi>] Can we think, or can any but this wretch, who
feareth not God, think, that the obſerving of ſacred Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,

but, though he knoweth there is a difference betwixt the
circumſtantialls of Religion, and the weightier matters of
Law and Goſpel, yet, as He will not account every thing
circumſtantial, which this circumſtantially ſubſtantial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,

none but the King, in their account; and to him muſt they be

are theſe cunning leaders which he ſayes had dominion over

But becauſe he hath hung his faith at the King's girdle, and

by learned hands, and nothing now oppoſed, but old ſongs
chanted over and over againe) although like enough to
loſe much of that charity and calme and compoſed temper

was not a well compoſed heart; for it did not ſeem tedious
unto him, to enter into this fire of endleſſe ſtrife and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual

<hi>Sed qui nihil habet, nihil amittit,</hi> a little ſtok is ſoon waſted.
By whom to this day was <hi>Lex Rex</hi> anſwered? And doth
not himſelf ſay that <hi>Naphtaly</hi> out ſtripes his Maſters, even as

that he ſayes there is nothing but old ſongs chanted over and

Why did not this pigmay ſet himſelf upon their shoulders

more on this hand? [<q>What Man is he (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) that
knowing how much more important work he hath upon

opportunity of evil doing, and who having caſt by the

thinketh it is inconſiſtent vvith one to minde the vvork of
his vvne ſalvation, and to defend the King's cauſe, vvhich
is very true, Let the King and his party notice this. But
it is ſtrange, that ſeing he thought the vvork of his oppoſers
Satan's, he should not think it incumbent to a tender ſoul to
do vvhat he can to deſtroy the vvorks of the Devil: vve ſee
alſo that the love of money is the root of all evil, and hath
cauſed him run greedily after the error of <hi>Balaam</hi> for revvard,
for to purchaſe the hire, he hath caſt by the important vvork
of his ſalvation, and laid aſide the honouring of God in his

Men whoſe idleneſſe he talkes of, if he meane Miniſters, he
knoweth who hindereth them from doing the work of the
Lord in building his Church, and they will anſvvere for it,
and he alſo for his share in that, and for this vvork of Satan
vvhich a little money hath prompted him to: and vvhen
they are vvreſtling and pleading for Zion and the cauſe of her

enough (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) to decline this contention and ſtrife,

bring them to abhorre his way; or that the really Religious

forcibly put him to ſilence then words or writings can.]</q>
It had been indeed more advantagious to the King's cauſe,
(and leſſe dishonourable to himſelf) to have been ſilent,
then thus to have letten out waters to the King's great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
and his owne diſcredit. If he had any expectation
that the Man's conſcience would have confuted him in moſt
of his aſſertions, why did he hinder that work, by confirming
him in the truth of his aſſertions by his weak and foolish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes?
<hi>Praeſtat otiari quam nihil agere:</hi> and why did he not
more manfully diſcover theſe unchriſtian dealings, the better
to undeceive ſuch as he ſuppoſeth were deluded? What are
theſe manifeſt unchriſtian dealings of his? Sure the event

it is a lavishing of precious time to maintaine the King's

pleading for untruth, tyranny and vvickedneſſe, vvhich is
neither a product of prudence, nor magnanimity. And

               <p>11. Novv the dye being caſt, and he reſolved to ſay
ſomething, he is as much perplexed anent the way of handling
this buſineſſe. Yea he ſayes, [<q>There is a greater difficulty
in dealing vvith this Man of no forehead (or if he have any,
it is of the hardeſt metal) of little conſcience, but of infinite
loquacity, and of a moſt unbridled tongue, vvhich is a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

                  </q>] <hi>Anſw. Naphtaly,</hi> it is true, is no baſe
ſycophant nor ſlatterer; nor is he, becauſe of free and faithful
holding forth of the wicked and ſinful carriage of theſe in

accounted a writter of Satyrs or of invectives, elſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

baſe flattering of dignities, and ſpeaking evil of them. Yet
in the following part of that Paragraph, he ſayes he deſerveth

think that Either King or Nobles are in hazard to be diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed

truely and eſpecially afrayed of the miniſtry; and mainly of

and the burnt Childe feareth the fire, And his fear
blindeth his eyes, ſo that he cannot ſee to read <hi>Naphtaly</hi> a

their hands in their blood, who are far below the wrath of a
man, far more, the indignation of an Heroik perſon,
though they shall never be found innocent, be purſued when
they will. He but lyeth when he ſayeth in the following
words [<hi>That</hi> Naphtaly <hi>with his</hi> tragical oh's <hi>awakeneth the rage of
the rudest multitude (which becals Zeal of God</hi>) <hi>to execute judgement

warrand, and there they would read it, and repent in time,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:105606:249"/>
leſt they ſinde it verified. He is but like himſelf a falſe lyar
when he ſayes that <hi>Naphtaly</hi> [<hi>Diſcovereth the malicious cruel and
bloody deſignes of his party.</hi>] For they have no malicious cruel
nor bloody deſignes, their only deſignes being to maintaine
their integrity and their reformed Religion, which Enemies
combined againſt Chriſt are ſeeking to deſtory. This man
imagineth a ſnare where there is none; but ſeeth not the ſnare
which Satan and his owne hands are ſetting for his ſoul, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will he and the reſt take warning, though the word of the

and whether then they be worthy of a faire hood and bells,
Let any judge: but ſure I am, they shall one day ſee their folly

But we wish them rather repentance and to be wiſe in time,
not againſt their will, but willingly.</p>
               <p>12. And furder ibid <hi>Pag. 13.</hi> he tells us [<hi>It were irkſome
and unſuteable to one who deſireth to keep the conſtant compſure of a

<hi>at a great diſadvant age, becauſe it almost tranſcends</hi> (in his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion)

O! Who would not pity this man who is put off the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

And who can think that he hath been of any compoſure of a

Apology for them to put forth ſome ſting?</hi>] But good Sir I fear
your ſting be gone long ſince, becauſe you are become a
drone: We have ſeen your good will to shoot your ſting
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:105606:250"/>
but it wanted its poynt, as for your ſting in your taile it will
not hurt much, and we know who is King over ſuch locuſts,
even the angel of the bottomeleſſe pit, <hi>Rev. 9: ver. 11.</hi> Now
this ſtinging locuſt comes to compare <hi>Naphtaly</hi> to <hi>Hecuba,</hi>
but any who reads <hi>Naphtaly</hi> finde him not barking as a mad
bitch, but ſpeaking the words of truth and ſoberneſſe, with
ſuch ſtrengh of reaſon as tranſcendeth this diſtempered man's
capacity to underſtand, otherwiſe he had never made ſuch a
compariſon. Then he tells us that [<hi>A toothleſſe defence might
poſſibly tend to harden him and his complices, and breed ſuſpicion of
ſome ſignes of diffedence, diſtrust and timorouſneſſe in owning of the
cauſe againſt him.</hi>] I beleeve this defence hath as many teeth
as he could put in it; but for all that, it can be called noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
elſe then a toothleſſe defence, becauſe it is nothing but a
bundle of sharp tooth'd words without any reaſon; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we ſee now all that he and his party can ſay, againſt the
truth which we maintaine, we are indeed thereby, the
more confirmed therein; and we do not ſuſpect him of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
diſtruſt and timorouſneſſe, that his cauſe is not better
defended, knowing how bold and audacious he is: but we
know that an ill cauſe cannot be well defended, though never
man hath defended it worſe then he hath done, though better
rewarded then many.</p>
               <p>13. The good man turns <hi>Neptune</hi> at length ſaying, <hi>Sed
motos praeſtat componere fluctiu;</hi> and then ſayes, <hi>[It will be fitter to
conſider what becomes us to utter then what he is worthy to hear.]</hi>
Then it ſeemeth we should exſpect a very calme ſea; but the
waves of his paſſions have not been ſetled for all his <hi>Neptun</hi>
authority. [<hi>Therelyes (ſayes he) a tentation in theſe name leſse
writtings (which therefore it is to be wished, were not in uſe</hi>) <hi>to exceed
in paſſions, and to utter words</hi> (incognito) <hi>that will not be ſtood to.</hi>]
The iniquity of the times, and the rage of princes vvho vvill
not hear the truth, is a juſt, cauſe why ſome should ſpeak and
write agaiſt them <hi>incognito,</hi> which likewiſe was the cauſe
moveing <hi>Elisha</hi> to ſuſpende the ſending of his free &amp; faithful
letter to <hi>Iehoram</hi> a bloody Tyrant, till after his own death:
but why this man should ſend out a nameleſſe writting, none
can tell, unleſſe becauſe either he was ashamed of the cauſe,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:105606:250"/>
or of his weak managing of it; or elſe becauſe he hath a
minde to exceed in paſſion, and nonſ-ſenſe, and none should
know that it was, A. H. P. O. who ſpoke ſo. But he tels us
that he <hi>hath not ſo learned Chriſt, as to render revileing for revileing
knowing</hi> that mans wrath works not the righteouſneſſe of God.
The contrary whereof every reader of his pamphlet vvill ſee,
&amp; therefore he doth well, to adde [<hi>ſome times it is for peoples edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
to ſee the due characters of ſuch as lead them out of the way.</hi>]
But vvhy should he then be offended, if any should shew his
characters, vvho is a manifeſt perverter of the right vvayes
of the Lord, and laboureth vvhat he can to lead people out
of the good old way, wherein our fathers and we have
formerly walked with peace comfort and joy? But this is
our advantage that he and his fraternity are already ſo vvell
known, and their characters ſo legible, that few or none are
in great hazard to be led away with them. Then he tells us
that [<hi>ſo farr as kumane infirmity permits, the truth shall be ſearched
after &amp; ſpoken to in love; all bitterneſſe, wrath, anger &amp; clam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nr with
all malice being put away.</hi>] But ſure we are then, his humane
infirmity is very great and ſtrong, which carryeth him to
ſearch rather after error, and to ſpeak it in hatred; all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
wrath, anger, clamour, with all malice, being
returned and that in their ſtrength; of which, the man's
conſcience was in part convinced, when he addeth. [<hi>But if any
thing</hi> (he should have ſaid <hi>a moſt every thing</hi>) <hi>aculeat &amp; pungent</hi>
(he should have ſaid bitter and invective) <hi>do eſcape</hi> (or rather
of choiſe be affirmed) <hi>It not being uſed in any privat cauſe or
quarrel, but in the publick concerns of truth,</hi> (rather errour)
<hi>of the Church of God,</hi> (really of the coetus Malignantium,
the apoſtate crue of the popish prelatical and malignant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
<hi>and of the sate of the commonwealth</hi> (rather againſt the
commonwealth, and for tyranny the bane of all common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths)
<hi>nor proceeding from any private revenge</hi> (if not from
this, which many will doubt of, yet certanely from the love
of gold or <hi>Balaam's</hi> reward) <hi>it will at least be excuſed by the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
and wiſe.</hi>] Sure we are, excuſe it who will, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
judge, will call him to an account for it, and we are
perſwaded that none either truely judicious or wiſe, will
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:105606:251"/>
think him excuſe worthy. But to shew that he hath no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
reveinge, he addeth in a parentheſis, [<hi>That there is room
enough in his fraternal affection for any who will leave their unchriſtian
ſanguinary and inhumane wayes.</hi>] But his affection is like the
devils, who would have all damned with himſelf; and we are
ſure come to his way who will, they shall leave their Chriſtian
peacable &amp; humane wayes, and choiſe unchriſtian, ſanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and inhumane vvayes. Then the falleth a vvishing that
<hi>his aculeat ſayings may prick the libeller to repentance for theſe things.</hi>
But he should knovv that charity beginneth at home, and he
should rather vvish that himſelf were brought to repentance
for him shameful apoſtaſy and perjury, and his thus ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to maintaine a corrupt courſe, whereby he hath indeed
expoſed himſelf to shame, though the hardneſſe of his
heart be ſuch as that the knoweth not what it is to blush.</p>
               <p>14. In his following diſcourſe he laboureth to shew how
palpably and cloſely <hi>Naphtaly</hi> trades in the footſteps of the old
<hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> though [<hi>He will not ſay that he and his complices are
arrived to the owneing of the higheſt myſieries of that ſect in the poynt of</hi>
Enthuſiaſme, <hi>and</hi> Libertiniſme, <hi>nor that they are ſo cruel as
to exclude Chriſtian infants from their birthright privilege of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.]</hi>
Yet he ſayes <hi>[It is worthy to be conſidered how far the
common demand of expreſſe command or example in Scripture for
Epiſcopacy, may reach the Anabaptiſts concluſion concerning infants.</hi>]
And ſo with him, all who require either command or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
for any new ordinance of Chriſt ſo alleged, muſt be
Anabaptiſts. This man is of very lax principles certanely, and
more then a latitudinarian, that will not ſuffer us to enquire
after a command or example of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> when he and his
party alledge that it is an ordinance of Chriſt: muſt we take
all things for ordinances of Chriſt, which he and his old
father the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſay are ordinances of Chriſt? But
why doth he call from us for any expreſſe command or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in Scripture for reſiſtence of Magiſtrates? Doth not
this alſo reach the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> concluſion? But his eyes ſeeth
not it ſelf. Furder he tells us That <hi>Naphtaly [Doth let fall ſuch
tenets as ſmell too rankly of the foul ſcum of the high flown</hi> Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
<hi>and</hi> Enthuſiaſtical <hi>way, while he ſayes,</hi> Pag. 21. &amp;c.
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:105606:251"/>
                  <hi>That meer privat men may now a dayes take their impulſes of Zeal, as
a ſufficient call to pull downe all Magiſtrates from their ſeats, which
they abuſe; to execure judgment upon them, and to place themſelves
in their roomes.]</hi> But of what ſpirit this man, who is of his
father the devil who was a lyar from the beginning, is, vve
have ſeen; And this particular will abundantly diſcover to
ſuch as look the place and conſider what we have ſaid. And
no better is the next particular which he citeth out of <hi>Pag. 105.</hi>
Where the author is oppoſeing, that notion of an external
call, not unto lawful ordination, which preſuppoſeth it;
but unto ſuch a mock ordination, whereby ſuch are put into
the miniſtry, who have no viſible evidence of the call of
Jeſus Chriſt, as in reaſon or charity can oblige any to receive
ſuch as truely ſent. Thereafter he draweth the parallel in five
particulars. The firſt is this, <hi>That the</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>laboured
to overthrow Magiſtracy, and deny them to have any power in Church
matters.</hi> But can he, or dar he, ſay that we do ſo? do we ſay,
with them, that the office of the Magiſtrate is not neceſſary
among Chriſtians? Do we ſay that Magiſtracy is not the
ordinance of God? Do we ſay that Kingly government is
unlawful, as they ſaid, abuſeing that place, <hi>1 Sam. 8:7.</hi> Do
we ſay that a Chriſtian may not exerce the office of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate?
Do we ſay that a heathen may not be a Magiſtrate? Do
we ſay that an ungodly Magiſtrate is no Magiſtrate? Do
we preſſe that place <hi>Luk. 22. The Kings of the gentiles, &amp;c.</hi>
Any otherwayes then againſt ſuperiority among Church
men? With what face then can be draw a parallel here?
The next is <hi>That they ſtudyed to overthrow the ordinance of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
declaiming moſt bitterly againſt all in that function as Hirelings
Thieves Wolves, &amp;c.</hi> But can he ſay that we cry dovvne a
miniſtery, as no ordinance of Chriſt, or as not neceſſary?
can he ſay that we affirme an external call to the miniſtery
needleſſe? Is it our work to exclude faithful miniſters from
the eſteem of Gods people? Hovv can the impudent man
alledge this of us? Be like becauſe we cry out againſt him
and his fraternity and their <hi>reptilia,</hi> profane wretches of the
ſecond-order, as no lawful miniſters of Chriiſt, being
perjured profane apoſtates, never called of God to that funct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:105606:252"/>
nor duely and orderly called of Man? But in this he
and his party come nearer to the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> then we,
The. 3. Is <hi>that they work diviſion in the Church of God;
and move people to forſake Church meetings, and to follow them in
private conventicles?</hi> But then it ſeemeth all proteſtants Who
preſſe Papiſts to forſake their <hi>Maſſe Aſſemblies</hi> and <hi>Maſſe Prieſts,</hi>
and rather meet with the Orthodox and that in conventicles
are <hi>Anabaptists:</hi> And it ſeemeth this man would not preſſe
Heathens to leave their publick idol worshipe, and ſerve God
in ſecret conventicles, ſuch a publik and peacable Man is
he, leſt he should be accounted an <hi>Anabaptiſt.</hi> But wee ſee
no connexion betwixt our being <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and preſſing
People to forſake Their aſſemblies, and to hear the true and
faithful ſervants of Chriſt in private, who cannot have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to preach in publick. The 4 is <hi>That they were above all men
arrogant and proud, diſpiſers of ſuch as were not of their way, as being
men without God in the world, reprobate and wicked denying to them
even common civilities.</hi> But doth not he and his party, the moſt
proud and arrogant perſones imaginable, deal with us all,
as curſed <hi>fanaticks knipperdolians? &amp;c.</hi> What is the 5. <hi>When
any of theirs were punished for errors, fellony or rebellion, they cryed
them up for martyres, and complained tragically that truth and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
was oppreſſed, and that men who would have all things done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods Word were perſecuted?</hi> But might not Heathens
and Papiſts have objected ſo againſt the true Chriſtians and
proteſtants, who ſaid and did all this, when they were perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
and ſome of them murthered &amp; maſſacred? And were,
or are, all who call &amp; account ſuch as die for the Teſtimony of
Jeſus, martyres perſecuted to the death. <hi>Anabaptiſts?</hi> I feare that
in ſo ſaying he shall be found to befriend the <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> more
then we deſire to do: If he hath no more to ſay, He shall
never make it appeare that either <hi>Naphtaly</hi> or the <hi>Apology,</hi> do
approach unto the manners of that odious ſect, in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
peculiar to that Sect, or wherein that Sect deviateth
from truth.</p>
               <p>Then he addeth <hi>Pag. 17. When the Spirit that ſtirreth in theſe
furious writtings, (eſpecialy in</hi> Naphtaly) <hi>is conſidered, how
much confuſion may be ſeen to be portended to Church and State, if
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:105606:252"/>
hearts be infected with the doctrines therein held forth?</hi> By whom
I pray, shall theſe evils be ſeen to be portended, by any thing
that is ſaid in theſe writtings? Sure by no rational ſober under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
perſon, but only by ſuch who conſult the oracle at
<hi>delphos,</hi> and minde their belly and worm-eaten carcaſes,
more then they conſult the oracle God and of ſound reaſon,
and minde the reall good of either Church or State. For
there are no doctrines there of any malignant quality, but
all of them anti-Malignant, Solide, Plaine, Sure
and immoveable truthes, having a direct tendency unto,
and neceſſary influence upon, the ſolide and ſure eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of Church and State, upon a firme and laſting ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.
And therefore, if it were right applyed, his following
wish were good. <hi>viz. That the Lord would give his people ſuch
understanding, that they be not ignorant of the wiles of Satan, who
driveth a deeper deſigne againſt this poor Church and Land, then the
ſubverſion of this or that exteriour forme of Church government,</hi>
For indeed the deſigne that <hi>Satan</hi> hath now on foot, reacheth
furder, even to the utter overturneing of all the precious
intereſts of Chriſt in the Land; of deſtroying not only the
outward Libertyes and Privileges of the People, which have
coſt them no ſmall expenſe of blood; to the end they may
be made perfect ſlaves: But to the overturning of the whole
work of God, of banishing the Goſpel, and of introduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Atheiſme and all ſort of profanity and wickedneſſe,
that we should no more become the People of the Lord,
but a viſible Kingdome of <hi>Satan;</hi> And all the People, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and Slaves to him. But we know what his meaning
is, and therefore he addeth. <hi>The controverſy reſts not in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
touching a Bishope or a Presbytery:</hi> But what thinks he of
this controverſy? He ſayes, <hi>If mens paſſions or prejudices
might permit, it might be, for the advantage of the goſpel, well
conſolidated by their mutual paying of due reſpects one to another; the
Epiſcopal inſpection not abrogating, but ſtrengthening the due right of
preſbyters, and presbyters not deſpiſeing that lawfull inſpection; but
all concurring together in a kindely mutuall aſſiſtence, and amicable
conjuction, for carrying on the real interests of Chriſts Kingdome,
without imperiouſneſſe one the oneſide, and without ſrowardly diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlyneſſe
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:105606:253"/>
on the other.</hi> Now he turneth a peace maker, and ſuch a
notable reconciler is he that would cauſe fire and water
agree: But he hath ſold his Zeal and Conſcience, for, he
knoweth, what. He hath forgote, that there is no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
betwixt light and darkneſſe, nor betwixt Chriſt and
<hi>Belial.</hi> But he muſt know that we will neither pack nor peel
with him, nor his accurſed fraternity, but will come out from
among them, and be ſeparated from them, and touch none
of their uncleane things, that God may receive us according to
his promiſe; <hi>2 cor. 6: ver. 17.</hi> If the Men of that accuſed
Hierarchy were not led away with intolerable paſſion &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
and acted by a fury of hell, to deſtroy the goſpel, they
would conſolidare this controverſy by extirpating themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves;
For as long as they ſtand in that accurſed order, they
shall never carry on the real intereſts of Chriſts Kingdome,
but effectually, ſo farr as lyeth in them, deſtroy the ſame; (as
former and dayly experience proveth) what by their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
antichriſtian dominion, over the Church of God and

what by their laying out of themſelves, according to their

true ſeekers of God under the ſame guilt of manifeſt perjury
and apoſtaſy with themſelves. If it were a lawful inſpection,
presbyters would neither deſpiſe it, nor carry themſelves
frowardly or diſorderly under it; but it being an unlawful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
ſo deſtructive to the Kingdome and intereſts of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it can neither alone nor in conjunction
with any other, promove the intereſt of Chriſts Kingdome,
and therefore muſt be abhorred as an antichriſtian brate, and
never ſubmitted unto.</p>
               <p>But whither now doth the matter goe? <hi>The deſigne</hi> (ſayes
he) <hi>this libel runs upon is to open a gap to endleſſe rebellions, under

we have oftentime met with in his firſt part, and have
shewed how groundleſſe, it is, and therefore we need ſay no

Kingdomes, and to keep the true Divine Authority which
God hath cloathed his owne civil officers with, from con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tempt
and diſgrace, which Magiſtrates degenerating into
Tyrants expoſe themſelves unto, by changeing the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God into the ordinance of Satan, and in ſtead of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and carrying as Miniſters of God for the good of the
People, walk and act as Miniſters of Satan, laying out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the utmoſt for the deſtruction of the People both in
ſoul and body. Who ſeeth not then that when they thus
forget themſelves, and forget what they are both bound,
and have promiſed, to be, they do expoſe themſelves to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
and to the contempt of theſe who otherwiſe would
moſt willingly honour them as God's vicegerents. But when
they carry as avowed Servants of Satan, as Tygers, and
deſtroy the inheritance of the Lord, which they were to
nourish and protect, can they expect to be looked upon as
God's Deputyes while they do ſo? And ſure, who ever
maintaineth that ſuch who have caſt behinde their back all
Vowes, Promiſes, Compacts, Subſcriptions, Oathes,
and ſolemne Engadgments; and break overall bonds of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
and Chriſtianity, that they may ſatisfy their owne
cruel and baſe luſts; and ſo carry towards Subjects, as if
they were ſo many Slaves or Brutes, or Worſe, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be reſiſted, is very far from opening a gap to endleſſe
rebellions, under any Church government; that he rather
layeth downe a courſe to prevent rebellions: For if Kings
remembered that their Subjects might lawfully and would
oppoſe them, when they turned Tyrants, they would walk
more ſoberly, and forbeare to vent their tyrannicall cruelty,
and ſo give leſſe occaſion to Subjects to think of oppoſeing
them. And However this Pamphleter may look upon himſelf
as one who hath deſerved well at the hands of the King: Yet
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:105606:254"/>
the judicious who conſider the matter right, will finde him
really a greater Enemy to the throne, then either <hi>Lex Rex</hi>
the <hi>Apology</hi> or yet <hi>Naphtali</hi> were, or are. Seing they muſt be
greater Enemies to the real welbeing of Kings, and to the
Eſtablishing of thrones, who would have them ſetled upon
the alone baſis of blood, tyranny, opproſſion, or proclaime
an impunity unto Tyrants to do what they will, which is but
to blow at a fire which burneth faſt enough of it's own accord;
then ſuch as would have them ſetled on equity and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and not ſuffered to goe without their due bounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a great noiſe</hi> (ſayes he) (<hi>it may be it is not cauſeleſse,
and it were to be wished Rulers looked to it) of the increaſe of Popery.</hi>
Doth he think there is a noiſe made about this matter, and a
great noiſe, and that without ground? Or can he arrive at
no more certanety, but of a <hi>may be</hi> that it is not cauſeleſs?
Sure the Repreſentatives (as he calleth them) ſeveral yeers
ago were beyond <hi>a may be,</hi> that it was increaſed above what
ever it had been, either in the dayes of King <hi>Iames,</hi> or of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the firſt: And hath their mock-act never executed,
affrighted it ſo out of ſight, that this Man who poſſibly
would be accounted no meane Father, and over ſeer in the
Church, cannot perceive it, at leaſt ſo clearly, as poſitively
to ſay that there is juſt ground for that noiſe? But where
dwelleth this Man? or what way doth he ſtope his eares?
Is he one of thoſe who ſee and perceive not, who know
and yet carry as if they knew not? What is he and his fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
doing to day? What are the men with the Epiſcopal
inſpection doing? Are they ſo occupyed in perſecuteing
the truely godly, the faithful Miniſters and People of the
Land, and in ſtirring up the Council to be more cruel then
they are, and ſeverely to execute the unjuſt and moſt iniquous
Lawes made to banish all piety and fear of God out of the
Land, that they have no Leaſure to look about them to marke
what Papiſts, Seminary Prieſts and Jeſuits (who are ſwarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up and downe the Land) are doing? When did He or
They adviſe the Council to take ſuch an effectual courſe for
ſuppreſſing maſſe meetings, as they have done for ſuppreſſing
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:105606:254"/>
of conventicles, or meetings of better reformed and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Proteſtants then ever he or they were? Was there any
maſſe monger fined to this day? Yet we know that precious
&amp; worthy Chriſtians, have been rigidly &amp; inhumanely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and mulcted, for hearing an honeſt and worthy Miniſter of
the Goſpel preaching the Goſpel in a privat place. Ay, but
now he thinks, he hath exonered himself, and diſcharged a
piece of duty both for himſelf and all his fraternity, by ſaying,
<hi>It were to be wished Rulers looked to it.</hi> And is this all the remedy
he preſcribeth? What will He do? May he not, dar he
not, grieve or vex his Elder Brethren? What shall we then
ſay of his inſpection? Is it lawful, or is it of Gold, which
is wholly imployed and exerciſed in perſecuteing of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſeekers of God's face, and countenanceth and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth
Papiſts? No certanely, That power whoſe proper
work is, to root out piety, as haveing that only in commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and which foſtereth and incourageth profanity and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
is a power of Satan, tending to advance his work
and intereſt in the Earth, and to eſtablish and enlarge his
Kingdome. What further? <hi>But truely</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>when
she Spirit of ſuch writeings as this, is conſidered, it will be found
there is cauſe to feare (unleſſe the wiſdome and goodneſſe of Cod; and
the prudence of the King and Governours under him prevent it,)
That as one way the Roman Antichriſt may come in; So ſome furious
Succeſſour of</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Leyden, <hi>under pretence of a</hi> Phineas—like
Spirit, come in another way, upon our Church and Land to lay it
waſte, and to make it a field of confuſion and blood. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Were
there no Papiſts in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or was there no appearance
of the approaching of the Roman Antichriſt before theſe
books came abroad? What a Spirit, I pray, is that which
is in theſe books, which can give any cauſe of feare, that
the Roman Antichriſt may come in upon that account?
What tendency, I pray, hath any thing that is aſſerted in
theſe books, to the introduceing of Popery? His needle
head shall never be able to poynt this forth. Yea let the
true deſigne of theſe books be once obtained, and I promiſe
him, that ere few weeks paſſe, there shall be few or none in
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:105606:255"/>
all <hi>Scotland,</hi> who shall be ſo bold as to profeſſe either Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
or Prelacy. Theſe muſt be ſtrange books which open
two contrary doors at once, upon the one hand a door for
the <hi>Roman Antichriſt,</hi> and upon the other hand, a door for
ſome furious Succeſſour of <hi>Iohn of Leyden,</hi> but both are alike
true, that is, both are manifeſtly falſe Though his fear
for the coming in of the <hi>Roman Antichriſt</hi> be firſt named, yet
it is the leaſt of the two with him; for the thing which moſt
affrighteth him, is this laſt; but he needeth not fear it, let
King and inferiour Governours joyne piety; and true divine
Zeal for God &amp; his glory, with their prudence, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to eſtablish the covenanted Religion, as it was reformed
in Doctrine, Worshipe, Diſcipline &amp; Government &amp; purge out
ſuch things as offend, eſpecially that bitter root of Prelacy,
which we abjured, and proſecute the ends of the Covenants,
and the vviſdome and goodneſs of God shall preſerve both
Church and State. But ſo long as there is no repentance of
the horrible Apoſtaſy and defection, vvhereof King and all
ranks are guilty: And particularly that Apoſtate pack which
care neither for Church or State, King or Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vvithall their adherents, vve have no ground to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that God shall preſerve either Church or State from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and ruine: Becauſe vve have forſaken the Lord
God of our Fathers, vve can not but fear that he shall forſake
us, and <hi>caſt our carcaſes upon the carcaſes of our idols, and his ſoul
shall abhorre us, and he shall lay our cityes waſte, bring our Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
into deſolation, and shall not ſmell the Savour of our ſweet odours,
yea and shall ſcatter us among the heathen, and draw out a ſword after
us, and our Land shall be deſolate, and our Cityes waſte &amp;c.</hi>
Though we had all the ſecurity imaginable that never one of
the furious brood of <hi>Iohn of Leyde,</hi> should ariſe to lay the
Land waſte; as indeed nothing aſſerted in theſe books, may
put rational Men in feares thereof, from that hand, though
his lieing mouth addeth, that <hi>the ſeeds of future miſeries, being
too viſibly ſowne, by this Man and his Complices, whose mouths are
full of blasphemies, as their hearts and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and in ſo ſaying is like the whore in the common proverbe,
who calleth her honeſt Neighbour whoſe firſt whole mouths
are more full of blaſphemies, their or ours, all may judge
who either read their writeings, or heare their ſpeaches in
publick or in private: And whoſe hearts and hands are
more full of blood, theirs or ours, dayly experience will
ſuffer no Man of common ſenſe who marketh both, once to
put it to a queſtion.</p>
               <p>At length he apologizeth for his ſlowenſſe in comeing
forth with his <hi>Survey,</hi> telling us, <hi>That this libel and like are
not more quickly followed, with meet animad vertſions, is not to be
marvelled at by any, who knowes they are like the peſtilence, that walks
in darkenſſe, and that hardly do they come to the hands of any, but
ſuch as are willing to be deceived by them, being intended for the
blinding of theſe, not for the opening of the eyes of others.</hi> But
truly, He might have for borne to have made ſuch an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy:
For it may be, ſome who have moſt imployed him, and
rewarded him too, for his paines, will think that he hath but
too quickly followed with his animadverſions, and poſſibly
shall wish, that they had never ſeen the light, ſince he
hath done ſo little good by them to the cauſe, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
a Patrone unto, both in ſtarting needleſſe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
debates, for the Kings Throne and Kingdomes, yea
&amp; for his Life; &amp; in managing theſe debates ſo poorly as he
hath done, to ſpeak nothing of his weake defending of the
maine cauſe controverted, which is abundantly diſcovered
by this vindication: Whereby alſo he hath occaſioned the
more accurate ripeing up of that debate touching defenſive
armes, and laying it open and naked unto the judgment and
capacity of the meaneſt, ſo that the truthes which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to shake, and overturne, are now more firmly then
ever, riveted in the hearts of all vvho ſearch after truth: Yet

by this ſolemne fiery Proclamation, the curioſity of ſome was
kindled to enquire after the book, who othewiſe vvould
have uſed no great diligence, to have obtained one of
them, yea poſſibly would never have learned that there
was ſuch a book in the World, and ſo could have been
in no hazard to have been infected thereby: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

there vvas not (as is ſufficiently knovvn) many of

of ſuch as put that honour on it, which vvas expected, and
thereby helped forvvard the Authors deſigne. Is it, any

they were intended for the blinding of theſe into whoſe hands
they come, not for the opening of the eyes of others. But
he ſpeaks like himſelf. They were really intended for the
opening of the eyes of all who would but read and ſeriouſly
conſider what is ſaid, and would not willingly shote out
their owne eyes. And as for his Pamphlet, I verily beleeve
what ever was his intention, it shall deceive none, but ſuch
as are already deceived, or very willing to be deceived, &amp; shall
open the eyes of none, unleſſe <hi>per accidens,</hi> by making them
to apprehend more clearly, then formerly they would, truth
