            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat upon a Petition exhibited by the Juſtices of Peace of the ſaid County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> in purſuance of a former, from the Inhabitants and Free-holders of the ſame County to the late Parliament, upon a full debate before a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the late Parliament, for regulating Markets, the 18. day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1652. the ſaid Committee did declare, that they conceived it would conduce very much to the Publique good, to have a Market in <hi>Clements</hi> Inne Fields, where Buildings uſefull are erected for that purpoſe; And did therefore order, that an Act ſhould be drawne for the keeping of an open Market in the ſaid place in <hi>Clements-</hi>Inne fields on every Tueſday, Thurſday and Saturday in every week, and Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> and Mr. <hi>Letchmore,</hi> two of the ſaid Committee, were deſired to prepare the ſame, and preſent it to the Committee, to the end the ſaid Act might be reported to the Parliament: And the Parliament did on the 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1652. order, that the ſaid Committee for Markets ſhould bring in their Report, and the Act prepared by them for the ſaid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.</p>
            <p>That a Bill being drawn and agreed on by Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Letchmore,</hi> the 17. day of the ſaid <hi>February,</hi> 1652. a Draught thereof was preſented to the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee (a Copy whereof is hereunto annexed) and was read and ordered by them to be reported to the Parliament with all convenient ſpeed by one of the ſaid Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee: But by reaſon of other buſineſſe, the ſame was not done ſitting the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now, although the ſaid Market having continued divers yeares, and found not prejudiciall to <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Westminſter,</hi> yet for want of eſtabliſhment, the countrey people ſuffer much, and many abuſes creep in.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioners therefore humbly beſeech this High Court, That the ſaid Market may be eſtabliſhed and ſetled, according to the ſaid intended Act, as this High Court, in their great wiſdomes, ſhall think fit for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Good.</p>
            <closer>And your Petitioners ſhall pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
