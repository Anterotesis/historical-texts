            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>O holy and blessed Spirit, who satest in the likenesse of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery tongues upon the Apostles to inspire, thy Church, and of whose gift it is, that a succession

of Ministers is continued among us even to this day.</p>
                     <p>O holy, blessed, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Trinity, let me never but be thankfull to thee for all these thy Gifts.</p>
                     <p>Preserve me by thy Grace, that I may never be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those who love to strive with the Priest. And that I may at no time deserve to be struck blind with the dust from a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples feet.</p>

                     <p>But grant, Lord, that I may readily hear and embrace the Message that thou art pleased to send by him, be it of mercy or of judgement, alwayes saying with old <hi>Eli,</hi> It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth best in his own eyes.</p>

And here among many other thy servants who wait upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>O never let him sooth and flatter it, but (as I give him oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) let him discipline and correct it.</p>
                     <p>Give him Grace and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to speak boldly in the name of Jesu.</p>
                     <p>And since thou art delighted with those that tremble at thy Word, Lord, make me one of their number that thou mayst delight in me.</p>
                     <p>Let me never stop mine ears, nor withdraw my self from hearing thy servant, who speaks home to my conscience.</p>
                     <p>But when he shall have wounded mine heart with the sword of thy Spirit, O give him power and wisdom to pour as well oyle as vinegar into those happy wounds.</p>

                     <head>A Prayer for the ending of the present Troubles.</head>
                     <p>O Most just and powerfull Lord God, to whom ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance belongeth, we cannot but acknowledge, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold miseries which have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen us, are the due reward of our deeds, and that we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our Peace should still be hid from our eyes. For when of thy own free mercy thou wert pleased to grant us a long time of plenty and prosperity, more then thou gavest to any the Nations that are about us, we became weary of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and by our ingratitude pulled down upon us those judgements which now threaten desolation to this late flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:31129:181"/>
kingdom. And since the time of our affliction, thou hast given us space to repeat, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not; Iniquity hath still more and more abounded. As heretofore thy mercies did not allure us, so now thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have not humbled us to a serious consideration of our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deservings. Now, O Lord, we finde our selves intangled, and wearied by our own Counsells; The troubles of our heart are in larged; Our iniquities and the punishments which attend upon them, are a burden too heavy for us to bear. And therefore in the anguish and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of our souls, we return unto thee, humbly beseeching thee, in whom alone is our help, to have respect unto the Prayers of thy servants. O shut not up thy loving kindnesse in displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, let not thine anger burn against the sheep of thy pasture: But bind up the breach of this
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:31129:181"/>
People Let the sighing of the Prisoners come before thee, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the tears of the distressed Orphans and Widdows, and of all such as are oppressed and have no comforter. How long, O Lord, holy and true, doest thou forbear to command de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances? Remember thy tender mercies which have been ever of old, and save us as thou hast done heretofore. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy promise of deliverance to those who call upon thee in the day of trouble. And when the blood that hath been shed calls aloud for verigeance, O then hearken unto the voice of thy Sons blood, which speaks better things; behold the Lamb of God, who was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. And to this end, regard the sincerity of thine Anointed, maintain thine own cause, and preserve
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:31129:182"/>
unto him that power which thou hast given him: bind his soul in the bundle of life, let mercy and truth preserve him, and let his Throne be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever before thee. Blesse them that are peaceable and faithfull in the Land: And as for those that have risen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, we beseech thee, melt and mollifie their hearts to the entertainment of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and love; reclaim them to obedience, lay not their sin to their charge, but guide their feet into the way of Peace. Give to those that have done wrong, the grace to repent, and to those that have suffered wrong, minds ready to forgive. And if any shall be averse from Peace, O thou that art the wonderfull Counsellor, turn their wisdome into foolishness, confound their practises, and let their mischief return upon their own heads.

Draw my heart, I beseech thee, from all relying upon my own valour, or upon the strength of the battail in which I stand: and teach me to look upward, and to wait and trust only upon thee.</p>
                        <p>Thou givest conquest, and thou givest courage: thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverest from the perill of the Sword, or else makest death a means of happinesse to thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Forgive my sins, I pray thee, and assure me of pardon
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:31129:188"/>
by the witnesse of thy Spirit, that the guilt thereof make not my heart to tremble within me, and to behold death as a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger to convey me into hell. If thou (O Lord) bee on my side, peace being made betwixt thee and my soul through Christ, what can be against me, what hazard can befall my soul? Nothing shall be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of thy love.</p>
                        <p>Let not spoil, or blood, or mine own advancement, be the ends of mine attempts, but make me to aim only at thy glory in the defence of thy truth, and in the good and safety: of the Kingdome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I live.</p>
                        <p>The issue of all things to thee (O Lord) is known, but to man it is hidden: Prepare me therefore indifferently to whatsoever shall befall me. If I die give me comfort in my last breathing, and take my soul

into thy gracious hand: If I be taken captive, give me patience, give me wisdom and godly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to do nothing contrary to the honour of my Country, or prejudicial to the profession of a faithfull Christian, If I return with life and victory, make me thankfull: Keep me from taking from thee any part of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Preserve me from those riotous, lascivious, and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming courses, which are the usuall fruits of good successe: let me not think devotion to be an enemy to resolution, or that a religious fear of thy Majesty, doth abate the spirit that should be in a Souldier: but settle me in this, that the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a lawfull cause, the hope and confidence of a better life, by the merits of Christ, the care to please thee, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon thy power, are the only true grounds of valour, which can give a man boldnesse

                        <p>O Most great, most wise, and most powerfull Lord God, in whose hands are the hearts of all men, and turned them as thou doest the rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                        <p>Shew thy power and come among us, and be present at this great meeting, when after so many years of confusion, there's once more a consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had to settle this distracted Church and Nation; and as there is nothing hid from thee, who seest the very thoughts and ends, and divided interests of them that meet together; so there is nothing so impossible to thee, but that thou canst by
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:31129:192"/>
the hidden workings of thy Providence unite what thou findest divided, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sway every counsell and design, and every imagination that shall set it self against thee.</p>
                        <p>Let there be no root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse among them which are intrusted in this great work, no thoughts of revenge; No Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of making themselves great; no particular or separate interest of their own; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of these, give them bowels of, compassion towards their bleeding and expiring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; strike a sense into them of the blood already shed, and the desolation yet to come, if they prevent it not.</p>
                        <p>And let thy fear run through all their consultations, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the sad account, which in the last great day will be required of them, they may unanimously set themselves to find out those blessed expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients

as may restore the voice of joy and peace into our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, in such a way as may be most for the glory of thy great Name, the righting of those that are opprest, and the setling of the happinesse of this Church and Nation, upon the right <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> of that former government, from which it hath stood so long, so unhappily divided.

banishment, to appear now so terrible unto his enemies, both at home and abroad, that thou hast blessed him through the sole strength of thine own arme, by thine own way, and at thine own time, so much beyond the hopes and expectation of Man, with so signal, and with so dry &amp; bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse a victory.</p>
