         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I May justly expect that by your Approbation or Censure the
Reputation of these <hi>Scriptural Mapps</hi> must stand or

The Originals of these had their Original from an Assembly
of Dutch Ministers, who selected from among themselves two
such Persons as they thought apt and able to correct all the
foregoing Authours that have set forth Mapps of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
viz. <hi>Ortelius, Christiaen Adrichom, Arnold</hi> and
<hi>Nicholas Geilkerck,</hi> &amp;c. which being finisht they exposed
to Publick view: designing thereby the more profitable and
pleasant reading of the Holy Scriptures. Among other Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators
their Work fell under my Ey: but it was all in the Dutch
Tongue, and scarce to be understood but by those that understood
it: Wherefore I judging it as profitable and pleasant for us
as them, took both the task of Translation upon my self, and the
Charge of Engraving and Printing the Plates and Book.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35055:4"/>
If therefore by your good Readings any of you find faults
in any of these Mapps, and let me know where they be, I shall be
both thank fal to you, and carefull to get the Plates corrected
and amended against the next Impression.</p>

therefore exposed these Mapps in their Vulgar Language,
together with Explanations on each particular Mapp: And
I for the same Reasons render you the same Mapps in the
English Tongue, with apt Explanations on each of them.</p>
            <p>I have examined every word in each Mapp particularly,
and altered their spelling the names of Citties and Towns
&amp;c. to the spelling of our English Bibles, and Geographical
Tables: and in some few Cases (where I saw positive Reason
for it from the Bible) corrected the scituation of Places.</p>

I have also examined all the proofs of Scripture relative to
this Discourse; which (I suppose by oft re-printing of later
Impressions from former) were become exceeding falsly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But I have corrected them.</p>
            <p>I confess some grave Eys or tender sighted Persons may
wish the Letters in some of these Mapps had been bigger,
which in regard of the fulness of those Mapps could not be:
But if such Persons will use a Magnifying Glasse of smal
price, they shall find the smalest letters appear large enough.</p>
            <p>I chose this Volume for this little Book, that it might
more conveniently ly open on the Maps while you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using
them, to avoid the trouble of turning them to and fro.</p>
            <p>Where you find any Literal faults have escaped either in
Engraving the Mapps, or Printing this Book, Pray mend
them with your Pen, and consider how difficult it is to do
any thing of this nature without some fault. Farewell.</p>

            <head>An Explanatory Discourse upon the Mapp of all the
EARTH.</head>
            <head type="sub">Shewing the Scituation of all the following Mapps
in respect of the whole: And also how it was since the
Flood devided and inhabited by the Posterity of Noah.</head>
            <p>THE Eternal and Almighty God having on the first Day created the Heavens,
the Earth, and the Light, by his Word, out of nothing; On the second Day
the Firmament, and the Waters above and beneath the same; On the
third Day parted the Dry Land from the Waters, and created Grass, Herbs,
and fruitful Trees; On the fourth the Sun, Moon, and Stars; On the fifth the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
great and smal, and the Fowls of the Air; On the sixth the Beasts of the Earth;
At last he created Man and Woman in his own likeness; giving him power over the
Fish of the Sea, the Fowls of the Air, and the Beasts of the Earth, and every creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35055:7"/>
thing, and blessed him, placing him in Paradice, and promising him upon his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
eternal life, (of which the Free of Life was to be a visible signe.) giving them
leave to eat of all the Trees in the Garden, except only of the Tree of Good and
Evil; Telling them that in the day they eat thereof they should dy the death.</p>
            <p>The Devil seeing Man placed in this happy and Imperial condition, stirs up the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
to tempt the Woman to taste the fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil; telling
her that they should not dy, but that their eyes should be opened, and they should
be as Gods. With these sly and impudent lyes of the Serpent the Woman was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to eat of the forbidden Fruit; and gave unto her Husband to eat also. So
that they both strayed from the Commands of God their Creator, and fell by their
disobedience into sin, and consequently into destruction.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Adam</hi> in this fallen condition is produced the whole race of Mankind, who
dayly as they increase fall into all manner of Pleasure, Sin, and Wickedness. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as through their sinfull lusts and abhominable lives they brought upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the sad and heavy Judgement of an Universal Deludge: So that in this Flood
perished all the Generations of <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; all other Creatures living upon the Face of
the Earth, except Faithful <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, and two of kind Male and Female
of all Beasts and Fowls and all Creeping things, preserved an Ark built by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>When the Waters retired into the compass of the Seas, <hi>Noah</hi> devided the dry Land
among his Sons <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet:</hi> and they again devided it among their Sons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35055:7"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Shem</hi> spread himself over the South part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> And <hi>Ham</hi> possessed
the Land of <hi>Canaan, Arabia,</hi> and all <hi>Africa.</hi> Yet the Posterity of <hi>Shem</hi> drove out the

            <p>Now in regard that the Posterity of <hi>Noah</hi> are thus placed in <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and
<hi>Africa,</hi> a question may arise how <hi>America</hi> being so great a part of the world became
first populated, and from whence: and because the answer cannot be found either
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35055:11"/>
in Holy writ or prophane Authours, the most we can do is but to offer at arguments,
and leave them to be accepted or rejected according as they may seem most
probable or improbable to the judgement of the Reader. Yet certain it is, that the
People of <hi>America</hi> had their Original from <hi>Noah:</hi> For in the Flood God destroyed
every thing that was upon the Earth from Man to Beast; and <hi>Noah</hi> only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
and they that were with him in the Ark. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 23. But from which of
<hi>Noahs</hi> sons is the task to find out; in regard we have had so little knowledge
of that part of the world till of (comparatively) late years.</p>
            <p>It seems neerest the truth that those People that inhabite the Northern parts
of <hi>America</hi> are descended from <hi>laphet;</hi> for towards the North is but a small Sea
both on the Western and Eastern side. On the Eastern side of <hi>America</hi> between the
Western parts of <hi>Norway</hi> and the Eastern parts of <hi>Island</hi> are not contained above
170 Leagues: from whence by the providence of God <hi>Norway</hi>-Men Fishing at
Sea in smal vessels might easily by stress of weather be forced over with a
strong Easterly wind in less than three dayes time. And afterwards either they
or their Successors by the same Providencial cause might in less than one daies
time be driven from the Western Shoars of <hi>Island</hi> upon the Shoars of <hi>Groenland;</hi>
which though it be not accounted a part of <hi>America,</hi> yet in my Judgement it ought
to be rather part of it than of any of the other three parts of the World; and that
because it borders so very near upon it, that to this day it is unknown whether
it be a part of that Continent or no. For several of our Country men and others
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35055:11"/>
have attempted to find a Sea Passage between them, and yet cannot. But if there
be a passage it is a very small one, and therefore we may probably conjecture
would not longly hid; since the necessities that that cold Climate is Subject to
would compel rational Creatures (as men are) to seek Southerly for a warmer
Scituation.</p>
            <p>But here to shew the possibility of such an accident I mentioned only three
daies time wherein men might be forced over from the Western parts of <hi>Norway</hi>
to the Eastern parts of <hi>Groenland,</hi> though we need not from hence conclude it was
so: but we may also think, that <hi>America</hi> might as well be populated from any
other part of <hi>Europe,</hi> if we but allow that Navigations have designedly been
made thither both by our own Country men and several others: as <hi>Hacklute</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
in his English Voyages. Pag. 506. from the Records themselves, how several
Navigations have been made by the <hi>Brittish</hi> Nation above 500 years ago into
<hi>America.</hi> And withall, for the probability of the truth of those Records proves
how that in <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Hispaniola</hi> (two famous Islands in the Bay of <hi>Mexico)</hi> the
Natives retain several <hi>Brittish</hi> words signifying the same thing to this day: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
some marks of Christianity among them. Yet by the same propability
<hi>America</hi> might be populated either from <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> who also are descended
from <hi>Japhet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far may be offered in favour of the sons of <hi>Japhets</hi> populating <hi>America,</hi>
and from whence. But if this be not accepted, we may consider the sons of <hi>Cham,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35055:12"/>
who Inhabited the western Shoars of <hi>Africk,</hi> which in some places are not above
480 Leagues from the Main land of <hi>Brasil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If neither <hi>Jophet</hi> or <hi>Cham</hi> can be allowed in the Readers opinion to Populate
<hi>America,</hi> then must it of necessity be the sons of <hi>Shem</hi> who populated it: yet here
we find almost 600 leagues distance from <hi>America</hi> in the neerest place, <hi>viz.</hi> between
<hi>Yedso</hi> the most Easternly Iland of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>California</hi> the most Westernly Iland
of <hi>America:</hi> therefore as far as the likeliest probability backs this argument, we
ought to conclude that <hi>America</hi> was populated by the sons of <hi>Japhet.</hi>

            <head>A Discourse upon the Geographical Description of PARADICE:
And the several Countries bordering thereon. Together with a short
discourse of the perigrination of the Patriarchs, from
Adam to Jacob.</head>
            <p>AFter God had created the Heavens, the Earth, the Sea, and all that in them
is out of Nothing, for the compleating of his great work he set himself
to make Man; and so dignified and honoured him that he made him
Lord over all Creatures, and gave him for his dwelling a most pleasant
Garden in <hi>Eden,</hi> called <hi>Paradice;</hi> excelling in Stateliness Beauty and Delightful
Pleasantness all the Countries upon the face of the Earth: and therefore is rightly
called the Garden of Pleasure. It is Scituate in the Land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> a part of <hi>Asia,</hi>
upon the River now called <hi>Tigris,</hi> which is called in the Holy Scripture the River
of <hi>Pison.</hi> This River devides it self into four branches, each of a several name.
Therefore to shew the true Scituation of this Garden, and to describe it perfectly,
we must consider what the Prophet <hi>Moses</hi> saies in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 8. And the Lord God
planted a Garden Eastward in <hi>Eden;</hi> As also at the 10 verse. And a River went
out of <hi>Eden</hi> to water the Garden; and from thence it was parted and became
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35055:13"/>
into four heads: to wit four heads of Water. This Text clearly shews that this
Garden of Pleasure was Scituate on the East side of <hi>Pison,</hi> where the River waters
it with a single stream; as you may see in the Mapp: And though we should
suppose that some part of this Garden should ly on the West side of the River of
<hi>Pison,</hi> yet it is plain by <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24. that the dwelling place of <hi>Adom</hi> was on the
East side: where it saies, So he drove out the Man, and he placed at the East of the
Garden Cherubims &amp;c. Because he should not enter in again where he went out.
Also from <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 16. And <hi>Cain</hi> went out from the presence of the Lord and
dwelt in the land of <hi>Nod,</hi> in the East of <hi>Eden.</hi> And it is the more likely to be
beleeved, because this River aswel in length and breadth as in strength of its
stream may compare with the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> or <hi>Donau;</hi> and therefore it may consequently
be conjectured that it must hinder our first parents from flying Eastward from the
presence of the Lord had they inhabited to the Westwards of this River: for we
cannot rationally conjecture they had either Boats or Ferries to pass over it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
nor does Gods holy word make any mention of Building any till <hi>Noahs</hi> time.
Thus therefore have many Ancient Geographers committed an eminent errour
in this particular, placing this Garden of Pleasure on the West side of the
River of <hi>Pison.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This River (as aforesaid) is devided into four heads of water; to wit, two to the
Northward or above the Garden, and two to the Southward or below the Garden;
and were called <hi>Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel,</hi> and <hi>Euphrates;</hi> and are thus described in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35055:13"/>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 11. The name of the first is <hi>Pison.</hi> That is it which compasseth the whole
Land of <hi>Havilah,</hi> where there is Gold. <hi>v.</hi> 13. And the name of the second River
is <hi>Gihon.</hi> The same is it that compasseth the whole Land of <hi>Ethiopia. v.</hi> 14. And
the name of the third River is <hi>Hiddekel:</hi> That is it which goeth towards the East
of <hi>Assyria.</hi> And the fourth River is <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This River of <hi>Euphrates</hi> hath its original source from the mountains of <hi>Moschi</hi>
and <hi>Caspy</hi> in <hi>Armenia</hi> the Great: And the River of <hi>Hiddekel</hi> hath its original from
a certain Lake or dead Sea Scituate neer the beginnings of the Mountains of
<hi>Ararat.</hi> These two streams run downwards into the aforesaid River <hi>Pison</hi> at the
North of the Garden, and so run Southwards to the Southmost part of the
Garden, where the most Easterly of these streams retains still the name of <hi>Pison,</hi>
and the Westernly takes the name of <hi>Gihon</hi> upon it, both emptying themselves into
the <hi>Persian Gulph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our first Parents being thus placed in this Garden of Pleasure (as aforesaid) had
all things therein given them to their use and behoof, except the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good and evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. Which was expressly Forbidden them by God.
But being deluded by the Subtleties of Satan to break Gods Command, they were
driven out of <hi>Paradice,</hi> and condemned to get their Living in the sweat of their
brows; and for their sakes the Earth was accurst and over-run with Thistles
and Thorns.</p>
            <p>Having (as we have touched before) their dwelling in the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35055:14"/>
the Eastwards of the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> (which Countrey was formerly called
<hi>Susiane,</hi> and now <hi>Susan)</hi> where they fell to Tilling the Ground. They had two Sons,
the eldest named <hi>Cain</hi> a Tiller of the Ground, and the youngest named <hi>Abel</hi> a
keeper of Sheep; who through the Spite and Mallice of his brother <hi>Cain</hi> was in
his fury muthered by him. <hi>Cain</hi> being accurst of God for this fact, falls into great
dispair and perplexity of mind, fearing least every one that meets him should kill
him: goes therefore forth from the face of the Lord into the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> and
builds there a Citty and calls the name of it <hi>Enoch,</hi> after his Sons name. It may be
conjectured that the Citty now called <hi>Susan</hi> is the remains of this Citty <hi>Enoch,</hi> as
bordering neerest to <hi>Eden,</hi> and Scituate to the Westwards of the Mountains of
<hi>Ararat</hi> upon the River <hi>Euleus,</hi> where it is probable <hi>Cain</hi> stopt his flight from the
face of the Lord, being not able to pass over this River.</p>
            <p>The sins of Mankind growing from time to time more and more, are at last
punisht by God almighty with an universal deludge; wherein was drowned all the
race of Mankind, all the Beasts of the field, all the Fowls of the Air, and all creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things, except <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, and two of a sort of all Creatures that lived
on the face of the Earth, and of the fowls of the Air: preserved by <hi>Noah</hi> upon
the Waters in an <hi>Ark</hi> built by him according to the directions of God himself,
after the World had been created 1656 years. This Ark having driven to and fro
upon the Waters above the highest tops of the Mountains for the space of about
five moneths time, it pleased God to let it rest at last upon the Mountains of <hi>Ararat;</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:35055:14"/>
And after the waters were retired again into their place the beleeving <hi>Noah</hi> and
his Family and all the living Creatures that were inclosed in the Ark went again out
of the <hi>Ark:</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family setled themselves about the Eastern borders
of the River of <hi>Hiddekel:</hi> from whence afterwards the Generations of <hi>Noah</hi> spread
themselves both Eastwards and Westwards; naming the several Lands and Countries
wherein they lived after their several Names: Which hath moved us to insert this
Geneological Table, that the Reader may the easier learn to know the Lands in the
Map, and their several Original Possessors; as more at large you may collect them
out of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and the marginal Notes there on.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Let the Genelogical Table come in here.</hi>]</p>
            <p>All the people of the Earth had then one Language and one Speech. And that
they might the better unite themselves, and perpetrate a Name, they consulted
to build a Citty, and a Tower therein whose top thereof should reach up unto
Heaven; which the Lord being offended with confounded their Language, scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
them, and made them leave off building their intended Citty. And the name
of that place was called <hi>Babel:</hi> as you may see at <hi>Fig</hi> 1. in the Map, because
the Lord did here confound their Language, and from hence desperse them into all
parts of the Earth. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 9.</p>
            <p>Not far from this Citty is <hi>Ur,</hi> the dwelling place of <hi>Terah;</hi> as at <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. in the
Mapp. This <hi>Terah</hi> was the Father of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Grandfather of <hi>Lot.</hi> And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35055:15"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> being forewarned of God to depart from thence, according both he
and his Father <hi>Terah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> departed to <hi>Haran,</hi> as at <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. in the Mapp: where
<hi>Terah</hi> dyed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 32. And <hi>Abraham</hi> at Gods command left his Native place,
and his Kindred, and took with him all his family, and his Nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> and all their
substance, and travelled towards the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> unto <hi>Sichem</hi> in the Plain of
<hi>Moreh,</hi> as at <hi>Fig.</hi> 4. in the Mapp. From whence he removed again unto a mountain
between <hi>Beth-el</hi> and <hi>Hai</hi> (as at <hi>Fig.</hi> 5. in the Mapp) and pitched his tent there;
where he built an <hi>Altar</hi> and called upon the Lord. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 8. From hence they
depart Southwards; and by reason of a famine in the Land are driven to go down
into <hi>Egypt;</hi> from whence after some time of stay they again depart (richly blessed
with Cattle, Silver, and Gold, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and again took up
their dwelling place between <hi>Beth-el</hi> and <hi>Hai.</hi> at <hi>Fig. 5. Gen.</hi> 13. 3. Here <hi>Lot</hi> and
<hi>Abraham</hi> parts, because the Land was too little for them. And <hi>Lot</hi> chose the Plain
of <hi>Jordan.</hi> at <hi>Fig.</hi> 6. in the Mapp; and pitched his Tent towards <hi>Sodom. Gen.</hi> 13. 12.
And <hi>Abram</hi> went and dwelt in the Plain of <hi>Mamre,</hi> which is in <hi>Hebron, Gen.</hi> 13. 18.
as at <hi>Fig.</hi> 7. in the Mapp. Here it was that <hi>Ishmael</hi> was born, <hi>Isaac</hi> is promised,
And <hi>Abrams</hi> name was changed to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 16. and 17. From hence <hi>Abraham</hi>
journeyed towards the South Countrey, and dwelt between <hi>Kadesh</hi> and <hi>Shur,</hi> and
sojourned as a stranger in <hi>Gerar;</hi> at <hi>Fig.</hi> 8. in the Mapp. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 1. Here <hi>Abraham</hi>
was commanded to offer up his Son <hi>Isaac</hi> upon one of the Mountains of <hi>Moriah;</hi>
at <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. in the Mapp. But God finding his obedience forbids him to lay hands
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35055:15"/>
on the Lad, and provides a Ram for a burnt offering in <hi>Isaacs</hi> steed, and promises
him his blessings. From hence <hi>Abraham</hi> goes and dwells in <hi>Beersheba,</hi> at <hi>Fig.</hi> 10.
in the Mapp. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 19. And at <hi>Kirjath-arba</hi> which is <hi>Hebron, Sarah</hi> dies, and is

his Mothers brother. But being benighted at <hi>Luz,</hi> he took of the stones of the
Place for his Pillows, and lay down to sleep on them; and then dreamed that he saw
a Ladder whose top reached into Heaven, and the Angels of God ascending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending.
Here he received the promise of God: and here he took the stone he had
for his Pillow, and set it up for a Pillar, and poured oyl on it, and named the Citty
<hi>Bethel,</hi> at <hi>Fig</hi> 17 in the Mapp. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 11 to 20. In the morning he travelled towards
the people of the East, where he met <hi>Rachel,</hi> the daughter of his Uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> about
<hi>Haran</hi> at <hi>Fig</hi> 3 in the Mapp: and makes himself known to her, who straight runs and
tells her father, who also came out to meet him: and received him kindly. <hi>Gen. 29

with such Cattle of the Flock as he barganied for: which the Lord blesses, and
increases mightily. Whereat <hi>Laban</hi> and his Sons grow displeased, and murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Jacob.</hi> which caused <hi>Jacob</hi> to depart from thence with his Wives and Childeren
and Cattle to the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> over the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> at <hi>Fig.</hi> 18 in the Mapp.
Turning towards the Hills of <hi>Gillead</hi> at <hi>Fig.</hi> 19 in the Mapp. After 7 days persuit of
his Father in law and Uncle <hi>Laban</hi> and a great power he brought with him, he was
overtaken. Yet nevertheless, <hi>Laban</hi> being warned of God not to hurt <hi>Jacob,</hi> made
a convenant with him. <hi>Gen</hi> 31. 48, 49. not to hurt each other. Here they made a heap
of stones in memorial of the covenant, and called the name of it <hi>Gilead</hi> and <hi>Mizpah:</hi>

               <hi>Jacob</hi> travelling a little further meets the Angels of God, and called the name of

an Altar unto God that appeared unto him when he fled from his brother <hi>Esau. Gen.

            <p>THe land of Promise is by some old Writers called <hi>Palestine,</hi> (as is conjectured)

called the <hi>Land of Promise;</hi> in regard of the promise God made to <hi>Abraham, Gen.
12.</hi> 7. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 15. It takes the name of <hi>Canaan</hi> from <hi>Canaan,</hi> one of the sons
of <hi>Ham:)</hi> and is devided into particular Provinces, according to the several names of
<hi>Chams</hi> sons, who were the first possessors of those Provinces: as you may more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
see in the Mapp of <hi>Paradice.</hi> And lastly, this Land is called the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> alluding
to what God said unto <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Deut. 3. 5. Draw not nigh hither; Put off thy shoes
from thy feet; for the Place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground.</hi> Notwithstanding this
was not spoken by God in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but in the Wilderness of <hi>Sin</hi> by mount
<hi>Horeb.</hi> Yet however we may account this a very proper name for this Land, because
the holiness of the Lord was there preserved; The Holy Citty of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> stood in
it; and the most Holy and true Son of God had both his birth and conversation in it.</p>

the Wilderness of <hi>Paran, Edom,</hi> and <hi>Kadesh.</hi> Its length between <hi>Labanon</hi> and <hi>Paran</hi> is
about 150 English Miles: The bredth between the <hi>Great Sea</hi> and the River of <hi>Jordan</hi>
is various; for in some Places, it is about 50. in others about 60. Miles over.</p>
            <p>This Land is watered with several smal Rivolets or Brooks; some emptying
themselves into the <hi>Great Sea</hi> and others running into the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> a
famous River taking its original from two smal Lakes by the Woods of <hi>Labanon,</hi>
called <hi>Jor,</hi> and <hi>Dan;</hi> who running a little way, unite both their streams and names:
and from thence is called <hi>Jordan.</hi> This River <hi>Jordan</hi> runs from thence into the
Lake <hi>Merom,</hi> and from <hi>Merom</hi> into the Sea of <hi>Galilee;</hi> otherwise called the Sea of <hi>Chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;</hi>
And lastly, running from the Sea of <hi>Chinereth</hi> it looses its self and name in the
<hi>Dead Sea</hi> or Vale of <hi>Siddim.</hi> In this Valestood formerly those wicked Citties <hi>Sodom</hi>

Vale is also watered with the Brooks <hi>Zered,</hi> and <hi>Arnon,</hi> and is nevertheless (as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
writes) a salt and unfruitful Lake. <hi>Tacitus, Egysippus, Pausanius,</hi> and others,
write wonderful things of this Lake; which for brevity we shall here omit. Yet
this we ought to remark, that herein is found driving upon the waters a species of
Pitch called <hi>Asphaltum:</hi> from whence this Lake hath also obtained the name of <hi>Mare

            <p>This Description of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> may be thought unproper in this place,
since we pretend to shew you the children of <hi>Israels</hi> forty years wandering through
the Wilderness: But because you may know what Land it was God had ordained
for them after their Trials and Travels; and because we intend in our Discourse
upon the Mapp of <hi>Canaan</hi> to treat mostly upon the Actions and Passages of our
Saviour <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ in this Land, therefore we thought fit to insert this Discourse
here, and to omit it in the next Mapp. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>Having thus given you an account of the Land of Promise, we come next to shew
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35055:19"/>
the Perigrination of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> towards it through the Wildernesses of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,
Zin, Kadesh,</hi> &amp;c. where (for your information) take notice that the double
prickt line in the Map shews the passage they made; and where you find six little
round <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
               </gap> thus, besides the prickt line, it shews where they pitched their Tents:
Each Station is marked with numerical figures, to which the numerical figures in
the Mapp and Book bear particular referrences. But to the purpose.</p>
            <p>God having purposed that the posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> should remain as strangers
in a strange Land 430 years: And this time being expired, he took notice of their
miserable bondage, and how they were supprest and tasked of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he
heard the sighs and complaints of his People; and therefore sent his servants <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> to lead them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Promised land.</p>
            <p>And because King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> opposed them, therefore God sent all sorts of plagues
upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> so that at last <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people were not only willing to let them
go, but even in a manner drove them out of the land.</p>
            <p>The children of <hi>Israel</hi> therefore gathered themselves together from all parts of
the land to <hi>Rameses,</hi> and ate the Paschal Lamb on the 14. day of the moneth <hi>Ibib.
Exod.</hi> 13. 4. (which with us is part of the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> and by them accounted
the first moneth of the Year, (2583. years after the Creation of the World) The
next day (to wit the 15 day of the first moneth they journeyed from thence to <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth.</hi>
(at fig. 1. in the Mapp.) and from thence to <hi>Etham</hi> (at fig. 2.) on the edge of the
Wilderness, and there encamped themselves. From thence they turned to <hi>Pi-hahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:35055:20"/>
(at fig. 3.) between <hi>Migdal</hi> and the Sea, where they were overtaken by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gytians.</hi>
But God set his Angel behind the camp to guard it: And having provided
a Pillar of Cloud and a Pillar of Light, the one to guide them in the Day, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to light them in the Night, placed the Pillar of (loud behind the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and it
became a Light to them, but Darkness to the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> so as they could not come
at them. <hi>Israel</hi> being thus beset on each side with high mountains, behind with an
Enemy, and before with the Red Sea, cryed unto the Lord, who by the hands of
his servant <hi>Moses</hi> caused the Waters to part, and they went over on dry Ground:
But when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> persued them, the Waters returned again, and covered
them and their Chariots, so that they were all drowned in the Sea; and not one of
them escaped.</p>
            <p>Hereat the People rejoyce, and <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> sing praises to the Lord for
their deliverance. But journeying farther, come to the bitter Waters of <hi>Marah,</hi>
(at fig. 4.) where they encamped, and murmurred against <hi>Moses,</hi> who by the Lords
direction threw a Tree into the Waters, and they became sweet. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 25. From
hence they journeyed to <hi>Elim.</hi> (at fig. 5.) and encamped there, where they found
twelve Fountains of Water, and seventy Palm Trees. From thence they came to
the coasts of the Red Sea. (at fig. 6.) And from thence to the Wilderness of <hi>Sin,</hi> (at
fig. 7.) and encamped there on the 15 day of the second Moneth after they came
out of the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Here they again murmurred against <hi>Moses</hi> for want of
Flesh; calling for the Flesh pots and Bread of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Wherefore the Lord pittying
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35055:20"/>
them sent them their dayly bread from Heaven; which they called <hi>Mannah,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a great number of Qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

wherefore the People again murmur at <hi>Moses,</hi> and tempred the Lord: and therefore

               <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 7. Nevertheless the
Lord commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to smite the Rock, and there came forth Water for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to drink.</p>
            <p>Here also <hi>Amalek</hi> came forth against <hi>Israel;</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaren</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> went
up to the top of the Hill, where <hi>Moses</hi> lined up his hand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<hi>Amalek</hi> prevailed against <hi>Israel:</hi> therefore <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>

on and held up his hands steddy, till <hi>Amlek</hi> was quite discomfited.</p>
            <p>Afterwards came <hi>Jethro</hi> the Father in law of <hi>Moses</hi> and Priest of <hi>Midian,</hi> whom
<hi>Moses</hi> received with reverence and love: And <hi>Jethra</hi> brought with him his daughter
<hi>Zioporah Moses</hi> wife, and her two sons <hi>Gerskon</hi> and <hi>Eliezer. Jethro</hi> seeing the great
paine and trouble <hi>Moses</hi> had in judging the People, concels him to seek out Wise,
Couragious, and Jastmen, fearing God; and set them as Rulers over thousands over
hundreds and over tens: and what causes were too great for them they should bring
before <hi>Moses.</hi> This pleased <hi>Moses</hi> well, and he did so. And his Father in law depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into his own Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:35055:21"/>
The same day the <hi>Israelites</hi> departed out of <hi>Riphidim,</hi> and encamped in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Sinai,</hi> (at fig. 11.) against the Mountains which are also in part called <hi>Horeb:</hi>
Here God came down upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in the sight of all the People, and gave

<hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 16. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 9, 10, 11. But <hi>Moses</hi> coming down, and seeing the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
of the People towards the Golden Calf, waxed so wrath with them that in holy
zeal he threw the two Tables out of his hands and brake them in peeces; and took
the Golden Calf and burned it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and shewed it
upon Water, and made the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> to drink of it. Then <hi>Moses</hi> prayed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and obtained mercy for them: And God caused <hi>Moses</hi> to hew two other
Tables, and with his own finger he wrote on them the words that were in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Tables. In the Mount <hi>Sinai Moses</hi> receives a command from God to make the
Tabernacle, with all its appertainces according to his directions; and to require of
all the People a Free will Offering, besides a Tax of half a Shekel upon every male of
20 years old and upwards. In this Tax were numbred 603550. men. <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 26.
and in the former vers. it saies it brought up in Silver 100. Tal and 1775 Shek. of Silver:
Besides 100. Talents of Siverto cast Sockets; which makes 200 Talents 1775.
Shekels: amounting to (in our English Coin at 2. sh. 5. d. the Shekel) the sum of
72565. lb. 6. sh. 3. d. Besides was freely offered in Gold 29 Tallents, 730 Shekels;
which if we reckon to be worth twelve times its weight in Silver (as according to the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35055:21"/>
most usual received value it is) it amounts to the sum of 127208. lb. 10. sh. o. d.
To which added the Silver aforesaid 72562. 6. 3.
makes the exact sum of 199773. 16. 3.
English money. This sum is for the Gold and Silver only The Brass imployed
at out the Tabernacle and its appertainances was 70. Talents and 2400 Shekels,
which of our weight at 16 ounces to the pound weighs 6526. lb. 14. ounces; which
reckoned at 8. d. the pound (the usual price of Bras; with us) comes to 217. lb.
11. sh. 3. which added to the former sum, makes 199991. lb. 7. sh. 6. the just
value of the mettal imployed about the Tabernacle. Besides the Offerings of Blew
Silk, Purple, Scarlet, Fine Linnen, Goats hair, Ram skins dyed Red, Badger skins,
Shittim wood, Oyl, Spices, Sweet Incense, and precious Stones; which must needs
amount to a very great price. Nor is there in Scripture any mention made what
the workmanship of all these materials cost: but surely it would come to much, were
into be paid for. The Women (doubtless) spun their blew Silk and Goats hair free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
And we may conjecture that many men that had nothing else, offered their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
gratis to the building of this Tabernacle to the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Tabernacle being finisht was reared up <hi>(Exod. 40. 2.)</hi> the first day of the first
moneth, in the second year after they departed out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> It and all its Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
was annointed and hallowed by <hi>Moses:</hi> And then a Cloud covered it, and the
glory of the Lord filled it. All the day time the Cloud remained over it, and Fire
was in it in the night time, and became a Light to all the Camp.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:35055:22"/>
Now follows another Offering, <hi>(Numb. 7. 2, 3.)</hi> of all the Princes and Elders of
the Tribes; And they send six covered Chariots, and twelve Oxen; two Princes
joyned for a Chariot, and each Prince sent his Ox to do service in the Tabernacle.
Each Prince offered also in the first Dedication of the Altar a Charger of 130. Shekels
of Silver, and a Bowl of Silver weighing 30 Shekels, and an Incense Cup of Gold
weighing 10 Shekels, which was in all 2400. Shekels of Silver, amounting to 590 lb.
Sterling, and 120 Shekels of Gold amounting to 358 lb. Sterling: together 948 lb.
Sterling. They also offered 60 young Bullocks, 72 Rams, 72 Lambs, and 72 He
Goats, for Burnt Offerings, and for Sin Offerings, and for Peace Offerings. Thus
was the Altar dedicated.</p>
            <p>We have before found the People numbred from 20 years old and upwards; but
till now the <hi>Levites</hi> are not numbred: Therefore God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them from a moneth old and upwards, and they were found to be 2.000. Every
first born male is now also numbred; and they are found to amount to 22273
Souls: which with the <hi>Levites</hi> make 44273. which with the foregoing 603550 makes
647823 males. Besides Women, and Maidens, and Youths under 20 years of age.</p>
            <p>On the 20 day of the second moneth of the second Year the Cloud was taken up
from the Tabernacle. <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 11. and the Camp removed from the Wilderness of
<hi>Sinai,</hi> and rested in the Wilderness of <hi>Paran,</hi> (at fig. 12.) in such order as you may
read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 14. to 29. Here the People murmur against <hi>Moses:</hi> wherefore the
fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed the outmost part of the Host; and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35055:22"/>
therefore the name of the Place was called <hi>Taberah.</hi> And here the People again
lusted, and wept for the Flesh, the Fish, the Onnions, and other fare of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and
loath Mannah: wherefore the Lord sent them such numbers of Quailes out of
the Sea, that they even surfeited with them; and so kindled the Lords anger against
them, that he sent an exceeding great Plague amongst them: wherefore the name
of the Place was called <hi>Kibi oth. Hattaavah;</hi> that is <hi>Graves of Lust. Numb.</hi> 11. 34.</p>
            <p>From hence they took their journey to <hi>Hareroth</hi> (at Fig. 13) here <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
for speaking against <hi>Moses</hi> were punnished; <hi>Aaron</hi> by words from the Lord,
and <hi>Miriam</hi> with Leprosie, so that she was shut out of the Host seven days. And
then the Host removed thence to <hi>Rithma,</hi> in the Wilderness of <hi>Paran.</hi> (at <hi>Fig. 14.)</hi>
From hence the Lord commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to send forth 12 men to search the Land
of <hi>Canaan:</hi> who returned again in forty days; bringing with them a Cluster of
Grapes on a Bar between two of them, and Pomgranates, and Figgs; and related
it to be a Land flowing wihh Milk and Honey. But yet that the People were
strong, and the Citties walled, and that there were Gyants among them: which so
discouraged the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that they again fell a murmuring, wishing they had dyed
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or that they were dead in the Wilderness: And were conspring to chuse
themselves another Captain to lead them again into <hi>Egypt.</hi> But <hi>Joshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi>
(two of the twelve that were sent to search the Land) strove to appease and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the People: For which the multitude were about to stone them: which so
provoked Gods anger against them, that he threatned to destroy them all: yet by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35055:23"/>
Prayers of <hi>Moses</hi> the Lord forgave them, but swore that none of them that had
seen the miracles he did in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had so oft tempted him in the Wilderness
should ever enter into the land of Promise, only <hi>Joshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> for their obedience
should: but all the rest should dy in the Wilderness, as they had wished. Wherefore
the People were sorry for what they done, and as in dispair offered to go up to the
place the Lord had promised them. But <hi>Moses</hi> would not consent to it, but councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them to the contrary: yet they presumed obstinately to go up, though <hi>Moses</hi>

of their partakers, that offered falfe Incense were consumed by fire that came out

from the Lord. Where at on the morrow all the People murmurred against <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> telling them that they had killed the People of the Lord. At which the
anger of the Lord was so kindled that he sent a Plague among them that destroyed:
14700 Souls.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord to put an end to the grudgings of the People commanded <hi>Moses</hi>
to cause all the Princes of each Tribe to bring every one his Rod, and write thereon
his Name, and put them before the Tabernacle of the Congregation; and to write
<hi>Aarons</hi> name on his Rod, and put it there also; and the mans Rod whom the Lord
should chuse to be chief Priest should bud. So on the morrow <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod was bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and brought forth blossoms, and bare ripe Almonds. <hi>Numh.</hi> chap. 16. and ch 17.</p>
            <p>By this time God had led them 39 years through several Wildernesses; and in
the first moneth they removed from <hi>Esiongeber</hi> into the Wilderness of <hi>Zin</hi> to <hi>Kadesh,</hi>
(at fig. 32.) Here <hi>Mariam</hi> dyed, and was burieed. And here the People again mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for want of Water: whereupon <hi>Moses</hi> prays unto the
Lord, who directs him to assemble the Congregation, and to take his Rod, and speak
unto the Rock before them: which he did, but smote the Rock twice; and there
came forth Water abundantly for them and their Cattle: For which twice striking
upon the Rock, the Lord reprehends <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> of unbeleef; (since he only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to speak to the Rock); and tells them they shall not bring the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

of them to death. But upon their confession of their sins, and <hi>Moses</hi> praying to the

fornication with the Women of <hi>Moab,</hi> and Idolatry with <hi>Baal-Peor:</hi> which so

            <p>After which God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> again to number the People, and he found

            <p>Here <hi>Moses</hi> received command of the Lord to go up into the top of this Mount

the Inhabitants were because of them. Whereupon the Camp removed to

the Officers went through the Camp, commanding the People to be in readiness
against the Ark removed to pass over <hi>Jordan;</hi> And so soon as the feet of the Priests
that bare the Ark touched the brinks of the Water the Water parted, but the Priests
with the Ark went into the middle of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and there stood till all the children of
<hi>Israel</hi> went over on dry Land. And for a perpetual memorial of this miracle, God
commanded <hi>Joshuah</hi> to cause one man out of every Tribe to take a Stone out of
the midst of the River where the Priests feet stood, and leave it at the place where
they should encamp that night, which was at <hi>Gilgal</hi> towards <hi>Jericho. Joshuah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them also to pitch twelve Stones in the middle of <hi>Jordan,</hi> where the Priests
feet stood, to remain there for a memorial for ever.</p>
            <p>The Lord of Hosts having thus brought the children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> through

on the ground, some seeds also (whether by Land or Sea, or both) fell into
<hi>Cilicia,</hi> (at e in the Mapp) and particularly into the City of <hi>Tarsus,</hi> (at 7 in the Mapp)
Among others of this Nation was a certain <hi>Benjamite,</hi> a person of good quality, who
inhabited here, and from whom descended that Heroick Father of the Gospel
called <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>Paul, Act. 22. 3. Phil.</hi> 3. 5. for such was the custom of those dayes, that
most Persons of any note or eminency had more names than one. Hence this Holy
Father, was by his Father called <hi>Saul,</hi> in evidence that he was a <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews;</hi>
and <hi>Paulus</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> in token that he was born a free man of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now as
this Son grew up, the good old man was not wanting for care sufficient in his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And first, the better to grace his priviledge of a Romane Citizen, he bred him
up a Schollar in the Academy of <hi>Tharsus,</hi> (7) and here was it, that he became so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
in the Philosophical Sayings of the Heathen Sages, such as were <hi>Aratus, Epime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,
Menander</hi> and others. <hi>Act. 17. 28. Tit.</hi> 1. 12. But as he grew in years to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
himself, the Wisdom of Man not amounting to enough to make him a
Child of God, He was therefore sent away from <hi>Tharsus</hi> unto <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (1) to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the Sacred knowledge of the Book of God. Here was famous at that
time one <hi>Gamaliel</hi> a Doctor of the Law, and Provost of the Schools in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at
whose feet this <hi>Tarsian</hi> Jew being set, he studyed the Holy Scriptures, and greatly
profited in Divine learning, beyond all his Equals and fellow-Studients. <hi>Act. 22. 3. Gal.
1.</hi> 14. Here was it that whilest he was eager of his way of Learning and Religion,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35055:32"/>
he drew into his head and heart the Doctrine of the Pharisees, who were in those
dayes though the most respected with the Popularity, yet the most Hypocritical and
Malicious of all the Jewish Sects. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>During these Times the Messiah appeared, as was spoken of by the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
(Dan. 9. 25, 26, 27.) and one half <hi>of a week of years,</hi> or 3 years and odd, he confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Covenant with many of the Jewish Nation, until in the midst of the <hi>Week</hi> he
was crucified and slain: and Sacrifice and Oblation ceased. All this while was <hi>Saul</hi> at
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but so intent at <hi>Gam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>liels</hi> feet, that this news of the Messias found no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
from his ears. Christ was crucified at the great Paschal Feast; and at Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost
came the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles, and enabled them to speak all Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and to work miracles. Now it hapned, that by vertue of these Languages they
spake, and the miracles they wrought, so many became their Converts, that by the
Feast of Tabernacles a necessity appeared to ordain Deacons to assist them in their
Ministery. Of these were appointed first 7 in company, whereof were <hi>Stephen</hi> and
<hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Nicanor</hi> and others: and after these were made still more and more Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
and Evangelists, such as were <hi>Ananias</hi> of <hi>Damascus, (5) Lucius, Barnabas</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<hi>Act.</hi> 6 ch. 9. ch. 13. But as these were zealous in preaching the Gospel, the Jews
were as envious in opposing it, and of those opposers <hi>Saul</hi> of <hi>Tarsus</hi> was none of the
meanest. The first quarrel that brake out into blood, was that of the Synagogue of
the <hi>Liberrines</hi> against <hi>Stephen,</hi> and this seems to have been at the very next Feast after
that of the Tabernacles, at what time <hi>Stephen</hi> was ordained; and was therefore at lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

end of the Feast of Dedication: at what time <hi>Stephen</hi> being apprehended by those
Libertines, was haled before the Councel, and tumultuously condemned, and stoned
to death. This was (as it seems by course of Story) much about (and as Tradition
tells us, upon) the morrow after the Anniversary Festival of our Saviours Nativity, or
on the 26 of <hi>Decemb.</hi> Thus dyed this <hi>Proto-Martyr,</hi> and thus was this first Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
of the Nativity next following his Assension turned into mourning, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 54, 55.
&amp;c. But devout men in honour of this noble Martyr, would not suffer his body to ly
among the bones of malefactors, to be devoured of Dogs, but exposed themselves
to the hazzard of the Jews displeasure, by carrying him to buryal with solemne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
<hi>Act.</hi> 8. 2. The Persecuters thus exasperated, made great havoke of these
sacred Mourners; and some 2000 faithfull Christians slew they in this heat, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Nicanor</hi> S. <hi>Stephens</hi> fellow Deacon, besides great multitudes of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
whom they carryed to prison. <hi>Dor. Syn.</hi> of the 70 Disciples. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 1. 3. ch. 22. 4.
ch. 26. 10. Under the Councel who condemned this S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> was this our <hi>Saul</hi> it
seems a principal Officer, who was present at his examination, and gave his vote to
have him put to death, and was especially imployed to see it done: and more than
this, being in a zealous fury in a wrong way, was the death of many a good Christian
at this time, besides what he imprisoned while he rashly imagined he did God good
service by it. 1. <hi>Tim. 1. 13. Act.</hi> 26. 9, 10. 11. At this time was <hi>Saul</hi> but a young
man; and yet not so young, but he was trusted it seems with some place of Authority,
which was not usually bestowed until a man was 30 current, and so by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35055:33"/>
at what time our Saviour was 33 compleat, this <hi>Saul</hi> was 30 current, and
therefore some 4 years younger than Christ.</p>
            <p>For 4 weeks lasted this persecution very hot, until most part of the poor Christians
being fled from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (except the Apostles) were scattered abroad here and there
as they could get with safety for refuge of their lives and liberties. But this was so
far from hindrance, as it rather proved an advantage to the Gospel, by reason of the
scattered Evangelists who preaching as they fled, scattered the news of the Gospel
in all parts, as they flew away. <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon taught the <hi>Samaritans (2) Simon</hi>
went out towards <hi>Tyre</hi> (43) and <hi>Zidon</hi> (48) preaching; <hi>Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lucius</hi> towards <hi>Cyrene,</hi> (x) and <hi>Ananias</hi> made many Converts at <hi>Damascus.</hi> (5. Now
when the news of these things came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (1) the Jews were madded at it:
And the furious <hi>Saul</hi> in his fiery zeal, not satisfied in that he had spoiled the growth
of Christianity in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> unless he might chace it out of the World also, got Letters
from <hi>Caiphas</hi> the high Priest directed unto the Synagogues in <hi>Damascus</hi> in order to
bind and bring away to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> all whom he found, both men and women who any
waies feared not to own the name of Christ. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 1, 2. But as many times it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
where the more hast is, there is the less speed, so it was here; for on the 25, day
of <hi>January,</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi> was going to <hi>Damascus,</hi> and almost there, Lo a wonderfull bright
light appeared round about him, and cast him upon the ground utterly astonished;
and a voice was heard speaking unto him as he lay, saying, <hi>Saul, Saul, Why persecutest
thou me?</hi> Now such was the force of this miracle and the voice withal, together with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35055:33"/>
other discourse accompanying; that <hi>Sauls</hi> heat of persecution was quite cooled, and
trembling as he lay, his heart turned within him, and he became obedient immedia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly
to all as was commanded him. And being led into the City (for he was struck blind
with the light) after three daies fasting and prayer, <hi>Ananias</hi> the Evangelist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> came to
him by Divine appointment, and baptized him, and also constituted him to be a
Preacher of the Gospel. And <hi>Saul</hi> immediately entred into the Jewish Synagogue, and
began to preach up that Doctrine he had afore cryed down so much; and justified those
Christians which ere while he had so much condemned. And though the Jews opposed
his Doctrine and himself, yet he stood to it, and confounded them by Scripture argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
proving out of the Law and Prophets that that very <hi>Jesus</hi> whom they had
so lately crucified was the very Christ. But all notwithstanding, the Jews would not
be convinced, but rather going about to kill him in revenge of his conversion from
their way, after certain daies stay he left <hi>Damascus,</hi> and went into <hi>Arabia,</hi> (c) where
he continued three years, preaching the Gospel in the Dominions of King <hi>Aretas. Act.

            <p>During these years of <hi>Saul</hi> in <hi>Arabia, Philip</hi> the Deacon was very successfull in his
preaching at <hi>Samaria.</hi> Hither also came <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Apostles from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
to confirm and settle the Church which <hi>Philip</hi> had first founded. Here was one <hi>Simon</hi>
a notable Sorcerer first converted by <hi>Philip,</hi> and then detected by <hi>Peter</hi> in his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
and publiquely shamed, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 5, 6. &amp;c. This was about the Passeover Feast
next after <hi>Sauls</hi> conversion, which coming on, called <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> back again to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:35055:34"/>
but <hi>Philip</hi> went on preaching along the Countrey in the way towards <hi>Gaza,</hi>
(3) and was in the same road, at what time the Feast being ended, a certain Eunuch
called <hi>Indion,</hi> a person of great quality under <hi>Candace</hi> Queen of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> but a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Proselite, who was returning from the Feast, by an happy providence fell into <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi>
way, and that so as to become his convert; and being baptized, carryed away
with him into his own Countrey the great tydings of the Gospel. But <hi>Philip</hi> went on
to <hi>Azotus,</hi> (4) and so to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> (10) preaching every where as he went. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 26, 27,
&amp;c. By this time the Church began to enjoy peace and rest, by means of <hi>Sauls</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version:
The greatest enemy it seems was taken off, and the rest were dampt, <hi>Act. 9.
31.</hi> And besides, the civil affairs of <hi>Judea</hi> (a) were not a little disturbed, whereby
the Spiritual enjoyed the more leisure. For <hi>Philip</hi> the Tetrarch being dead, King <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi>
with a great Army invaded <hi>Herod,</hi> in order to be revenged for the matter of <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
Herods</hi> Concubine, with whom he lived in Incest and Adultery; and by reason of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reta</hi>
the daughter of this <hi>Aretas,</hi> and <hi>Herods</hi> lawfull Wife, whom he had put away.
This came to a battel about the Paschal time, in the 21 year of <hi>Tiherius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
and <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch was greatly foyled and routed, and had been utterly
lost, but for the Authority Imperial interposing: <hi>Jos. Ant.</hi> B. 18. ch. 17. <hi>Suet.</hi> During
these things the holy Apostles minded their business, and as it shall seem devided the
Toparchies of <hi>Judea</hi> amongst them, for the better order in their proceedings. Untill
the Church increasing more and more, the Apostles also extended their Walks farther
and farther; and ten of them going forth into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> (see the Mapp

<hi>Act.</hi> 11. 19. During these times did the Apostles and their Disciples appoint and
celebrate those sacred Festivals of the Gospel, which we still observe.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> was at the Feast of Pentecost, at a private Church where S, <hi>James</hi> and the
Elders were assembled. <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 18, 19. During this time also sent <hi>Pilat</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> (46)
to give notice unto <hi>Tiberius</hi> and the Senate, of the marvellous works of Christ, and
how he was reported to berisen from the dead, and was esteemed of his Disciples as
a God. <hi>Eus. Eccl. Hist.</hi> B. 2. ch. 2. Also during these years while <hi>Saul</hi> remained in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,
Caiphas</hi> was laid by from being High Priest, in the 21. year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and in the
next year <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was displaced from his Prefecture. <hi>Jos. Ant.</hi> B. 18. ch. 6.</p>
            <p>Three years were now ended since the Assension of our Saviour, and the 4th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was

Christs birth about 3 parts run out. But here again finding himself in great danger
of his life, by reason of the Jews implacable malice, he was fain to be let down in a
basket over the Town wall, and narrowly escaped away with his life, and came to
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> about the Feast of Tabernacles, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 32. 33. Act.</hi> 9. 25. All this while
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35055:35"/>
had he seen none of the Apostles, but here (as he came on purpose to find him so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly)
he met S. <hi>Peter. Gal.</hi> 1. 16. 17. They at first shunned him at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> till
<hi>Barnabas</hi> wrought his introduction among them. Here tarryed he 15 daies during
the Feast, and before and after. But after a great deal of labour in vain beslowed upon
the stubborn Jews, in order to convince them that <hi>Jesus</hi> was the Christ, at length <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Saul</hi> both left <hi>Jerusalem</hi> together: <hi>Saul</hi> went down to <hi>Cesarea,</hi> (6) and from
thence all along by Land through <hi>Phoenicia</hi> (f) <hi>Syria,</hi> (d) and <hi>Cylicia</hi> (c) until he came
to <hi>Tarsus,</hi> his native place <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 26, 27. &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 18. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> in the mean time went about from Town to Town over all the quarters and
Toparchies of <hi>Judea,</hi> untill he came to <hi>Lydda,</hi> (8) where he cured one <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who had
been 8 years sick of a Palsie, by a miracle: and after some stay there, he was sent for
to <hi>Joppa,</hi> (9) where by a greater miracle he raised one <hi>Dorcas</hi> an holy and a singular
good woman from the dead. These miracles were no smal furtherance to the fame
of the Gospel. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 32, &amp;c. 36. &amp;c. But such as were yet stubborn would be stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born;
Wherefore now at length, after that <hi>Peter</hi> had abode many dayes at this <hi>Jop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi>
the other half of the week of years of confirming the Covenant with the Jews
being utterly expired, and the Iewish converts dropping in but slowly, until at length
there appeared not one more; Then pleased it Almighty God to give warning unto
his Apostles hence forwards to leave the Iews, and to turn in unto the Gentiles. This
warning by the vision of a <hi>strange sheet</hi> let down from Heaven, wherein were all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Beasts and Fowls, and that as well of the unclean sorts, as of the clean, was first
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35055:35"/>
made known to <hi>Peter;</hi> whereby he was given to understand, that hence forwards he
might eat of all sorts without distinction. And in the mean time messengers being
come from <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Gentile man, he was warned also to go in unto him, without
any more scruple what Countrey man he was, and whether he were Iew or Proselite.
And accordingly <hi>Peter</hi> being obedient unto the vision, went with them: and finding
<hi>Cornelius</hi> and many more Gentiles gathered together, he preached unto them, and
they were converted, and the Holy Ghost fell upon them miraculously, and they
were baptized, <hi>Act. 10:</hi> At the same time <hi>Barnabas</hi> of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> (x)
and others, being in far Countries, and moved by the same Spirit preached unto the
Gentiles where ever they were, and they came in, and converted to the Faith. <hi>Act. 11.
19,</hi> &amp;c. Now when the news of these things came first unto <hi>Jerusalem, Peter</hi> was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
for what he had done, until having given satisfaction of his Divine Warrant,
they gave glory to God. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After this the Apostles deviding the World into 12 parts, each of them took his
Walk, together with certain Evangelists their assistants, into all parts of the World. S.
<hi>James</hi> the brother of <hi>John</hi> seems to have gon into <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Marmorica,</hi> where he spent

that by reason of the multitudes the Disciples began to be first called Christians at

<hi>Act.</hi> 11. 26. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now by that time <hi>Peter. Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> had been one whole year at <hi>Antioch,,</hi>
came <hi>Agabus</hi> the Prophet thither from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and foretold of a great death, which
was to follow over all the World. But with this <hi>Agabus</hi> came certain weak brethren
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35055:36"/>
of the Jews, who either out of tender Conscience or faction, were offended at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
of the Gentiles: as if it had not been lawfull. This weakness S. <hi>Peter</hi> thought
fit to comply with: but <hi>Saul</hi> was therefore angry. 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 20, 21. Gal.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14.
Thus hapned this first quarrel amongst these great Fathers; but it was only in matters
of discretion, not of Doctrine. And however he found fault at this time, yet at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, <hi>Saul</hi> also himself acted S. <hi>Peters</hi> part. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20, 21. After these things
was a Collection made at <hi>Antioch</hi> for the poor Saints at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and
<hi>Saul</hi> carryed it. Act. 29. 30.</p>
            <p>It was now Anno 39. at what time <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> continued preaching at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
At this time came forth S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel in the Hebrew Tongue, and was
published for the use of all good Christians. But <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> tarryed at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
till Anno. 40. And now was it at what time was assembled a great concourse of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from all parts: Here was S. <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>Antioch,</hi> and S. <hi>James</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others the plausible King <hi>Agrippa</hi> failed not to beat the Feast too: This <hi>Agrippa</hi>
being a very ambitious man, and apt to take over much upon him, had been most
shamefully mocked and abused by the Romanes and Aegyptians in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and
all the Jews there fared the worse for him. And because they could not be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
revenged of the Romanes and Aegyptians who did them the wrong, it seems
therefore they threw the more spite upon the Christians, who were more apt to fall
into their hands; not that those Christians had any wayes offended, but meerly for
that inhabiting in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> they also had not been abused as themselves were. And
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35055:37"/>
now having found S. <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (who seems to be the Father of those Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian
Christians) they told <hi>Agrippa</hi> of him, who by vertue of his interest both with
<hi>Marullus</hi> the Prefect, and the Officers of the Iews, easily laid hands on him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more adoe sent him away to execution. But such was the magnanimity of this
braveman, that death was but a sport with him: and with so much gallantry did he
bear it, that the very Soldier that guarded him to the place of execution, was conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Prisoner, and that unto such pitch of admiration, as the man was ambitious
to dy with him, in the same cause, and so he did; and thus dyed they nobly together.
S. <hi>Peter</hi> after this, was taken also, and imprisoned, but escaped by a miracle. <hi>Act. 12.

over the Island, unto <hi>Paphos</hi> (13) where <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> the Governour held his seat, and
who was by these converted to the Faith, having first by miracle conquered one <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesus</hi>
a Sorcerer, who opposed them; for they smote him with sudden blindness, so
that he could not see at all.</p>
            <p>Anno 42. in the Spring they crost the Sea again to <hi>Perga</hi> (14) in <hi>Pamphilia.</hi> But here
<hi>Iohn Mark</hi> being tyred with the Voyage broke up their company, and returned to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
Yet <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> went on as far as <hi>Antioch</hi> (15) in <hi>Psidia.</hi> (i) Here in

were quickly accomodated with crowds of Converts, and that not only of the City,

Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> about this time were finally driven away from <hi>Iconia,</hi> by a ryotous
tumult of envyous Iews, and went on preaching to <hi>Lystra,</hi> (17) where they got great
credit by a lame man they cured miraculously. And here also tarryed they some
time; until from <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Iconia</hi> the Iews pursuing them with mallice and envy rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>Anno 46. Having ordained Elders at <hi>Lystra</hi> (among which was <hi>Timothy</hi> for one)
they returned to <hi>Ieonium:</hi> and doing the like there, finally they came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> in

            <p>Anno 47. <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> came back again to <hi>Perga,</hi> and from thence went to

            <p>Anno 49 <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> still remain at <hi>Antioch:</hi> But in the mean time certain
falacious Iews from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> disturbed the Church, teaching that without Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

great disputes; and finally, <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were sent to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the controversie. Here at this time were assembled S. <hi>Iames,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
besides who ever else un-named, by whom it was ordained, as in Acts 15. With this
Decree <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> together with one <hi>Iudas</hi> the brother of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi>
returned unto <hi>Antioch,</hi> to the great satisfaction of the Churches. Acts 15. 30, 31.</p>

70 years lay this city desolate, and all the countrey ruinate, the walls were pulled
down, and the houses became meer ashes and rubbish: the Owl lodged there, and
the grass grew in the streets for want of Passengers to tread it down: the Trees bore
all manner of fruit, and yet rotted the Apples Pears and Plumbs for want of hands
to pluck them: the Ground brought forth plenty of Herbs and Grass, which wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Earth again for want of mouths to eat it up: and Weeds grew every where in
