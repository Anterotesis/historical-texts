            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Reason of publishing these Papers.</head>
            <p>I had purposed once to have laid by these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, esteeming them like such which menscrible in a Common-place-book, especially when I heard there was an Answer to the <hi>Rehearsal Transpros'd</hi> in Booksellers hands. The Answer is now known by the Title of <hi>Rosemary.</hi> A grave and serious Piece,
<pb facs="tcp:59362:3"/>
that's the greatest oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it maintains against the <hi>Transproser,</hi> except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that once he ventures at <hi>Wit</hi> like an <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie,</hi> as far as his Herbal can furnish him with the qualities of <hi>Nettles</hi> and <hi>Archangel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may lay a Wager on his Name at once rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if you observe how he prides himself in squirting at the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> like <hi>Culpeper</hi> against the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of Physitians: How he strikes at all in his
<pb facs="tcp:59362:3"/>
reach, how he nips <hi>Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> with the long nails of his left hand, and tears <hi>Bays</hi> with his right hand and teeth. But to give him his due commendation, he and one more, who hath Natural wit, though no Reading parts, would make a good Writer. It may (I think) serve as an account why this is published, that upon considering the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the Common Enemy to both, I did not perceive my Labour was saved, or that this small Trifle was forestalled.</p>

            <head>A Common-Place-Book Out of the REHEARSAL TRANSPROS'D.</head>
            <head>Concerning his Title-Page.</head>
            <p>THe Worthy Author, that he might not seem a Plagiary, doth with much modesty call his Book, <hi>The Rehearsal,</hi> willing to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that, what-ever may be accounted any thing in it, was taken from others; and that he may more particularly own whence he receiv'd all his Flowers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59362:5"/>
(excepting what he calls the Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-flower) he lets it still keep the old name of the Farce. So that a <hi>Rehearsal</hi> it is, and more than so, <hi>Transpros'd.</hi> If you ask why Transpros'd? I say in his behalf he did it like a Prince, to shew the Authority he had to mint words, and with an <hi>Or,</hi> to shew what this must pass for. But you will say, why doth he then discourage Kings from the like Sovereignty? If you know not that, you are not fit to talk with a Senator. It was that he might enjoy the whole peculiar Jurisdiction to himself; just as the man disswaded his rich neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours from the Sin of <hi>Vsury,</hi> that he might have the sole Trade of <hi>Extortion.</hi> He is so kind, as to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59362:5"/>
bestow the Impression on the Assigns of <hi>Iohn Calvin</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Beza.</hi> It is a valuable Gift, and will bring good profit, as other Books which are written against Government, or printed in a Corner. I hope the Assigns of these first Fathers of the Church are not Ministers, if they be, <hi>Happy had it been for the Nation, happy for themselves</hi> if they had never been so enriched, seeing he observes so many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that happen by reason of the flourishing condition of Church-men. But he meant it kindly, and has thanks due for his bounty, the more because he is not wholly of their Church: yet is he not at all of that Church which was Mother to <hi>Sibthorp</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59362:6"/>
and <hi>Mainwaring.</hi> Now that the Assigns may have sale for the Book, these are to give notice that you may buy it at the Sign of the <hi>Kings Indulgence.</hi> What! do you not understand him? you look as strange and simply, as if he had told you of the sign of the <hi>Counter-Tenor-Voice,</hi> or of the <hi>Noise in the Air</hi>: whereas the Sign is a fair double Sign: The <hi>Indulgence</hi> is a sign of the <hi>Kings Goodness,</hi> more than their deserts. It was a conjectural Sign too, of what would follow, to wit, Preaching and Praying against the established Church, though this was strictly forbidden. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Sign-post is drawn the Posture of a Garrison almost forced to a surrendry; at last ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>training
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59362:6"/>
a Cessation of Arms, and in that time fitting it self to repel the Besiegers. The sign is large, and hath more than that in the <hi>Strand</hi> containing the several Coats of the 13 Cantons of <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland.</hi> But still you are never the better, except you know at what Market Town this new Sign is hung up. It is on the South side of the <hi>Lake Lemane</hi>: the Town is better known by the Name of <hi>Pure Geneva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now I have told you, it is ten to one against you, that you find it not. It is like <hi>Delos,</hi> a pretty spot of floating Ground, only it is not so bold as that, to lanch out into the Deep; but like a little sneaking <hi>By-lander,</hi> it creeps
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59362:7"/>
and coasts about the Shore of the <hi>Lake</hi>; now it is South, but by then as you can read about 50 Pages of the Rehearsal, Whip, it's got to the West side of the <hi>Lemane</hi>; but the next time we take it there, we will get an <hi>Archimedes,</hi> or some Cunning Man, to remove and fix it on the South. Still I am glad to hear the <hi>Kings Indulgence</hi> is at <hi>Geneva,</hi> for then his <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> must be in the same place: and who knows but his best Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may do what the rest can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and prevail with their <hi>Dear Brethren</hi>: but the Project is not worth pursuing, 'tis a bad Air for Kings, and would kill them sooner than the <hi>infamous Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,</hi> or <hi>Sheerness.</hi> But if Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie cannot have health, yet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59362:7"/>
Indulgence surely will make a good shift among them, 'tis not to be doubted. They will indulge themselves, and all others who profess the single and onely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their City; but no other can be suffered to be believed and discoursed; for they look upon themselves as the <hi>True Protestant Dominicans,</hi> and as the <hi>Popish</hi> part of that Order have by an old Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription the principal Power of the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> by the same right doth the other exercise this Authority over all within their reach, who believe not that <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> is the Government, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is the Antichrist, and that a Man is almost no Man.</p>
            <p>They can further justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by their own great Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59362:8"/>
and affirm that they ought not to shew any favour to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Opinions, no though the doubting Persons should come both to their Churches and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. This <hi>befitting Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness</hi> is called a <hi>halting</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Baal</hi>; a cursed Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a Laodicean Luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and far from an <hi>Ardent Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Cause</hi> of God. The Reason upon which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed so, is this; <hi>Religion,</hi> which is an imitation of <hi>Him</hi> whom they profess to worship, requires that they should make their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees against men in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>they</hi> do (much what alike,) believe that God enacts in the Case of <hi>Absolute Reprobation</hi>: which <hi>Sanction</hi> is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59362:8"/>
so farr from any <hi>Tenderness</hi> or <hi>Indulgence,</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi> himself calls his own Doctrine in this Article, <hi>The Horrid Decree.</hi> But I had almost forgot one Piece of <hi>Toleration,</hi> which the <hi>Rehearser</hi> and others report; <hi>Though there is no Toleration in the Genevian Church, yet after Church time on Sundays, they tolerate Sports.</hi> This Liberty is not (I suppose) desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Indulged; no, they have more Loyalty sure; they have heard it Preached, that it was the <hi>Wicked Book of Sports</hi> (not a word of <hi>Rump</hi> and <hi>Army</hi>) that brought the <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>Block.</hi> As for <hi>Geneva,</hi> had it not been that <hi>Democracie</hi> both in Church and State had made some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, you had been told ere
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59362:9"/>
now that it tumbled into the <hi>Lemane Lake,</hi> or that it had been destroyed like <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah.</hi> By this time, without doubt, you have enough for a <hi>Title Page,</hi> now make room for the <hi>Rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> or <hi>Animadversions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Book begins like a Course of <hi>University-Studies,</hi> with Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and before he hath done, you will find him as Universally learned as the <hi>Renowned Knight</hi> in our <hi>English Poet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have <hi>Page</hi> 1. a <hi>Dilemma</hi> against the <hi>Preface</hi> for being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after Declaration that he would write no more. Now a <hi>Dilemma</hi> is otherwise called, <hi>A two-horned Argument</hi>; whereas most men would have believed

that he could have made neither two horns nor one, since he left the Colledge, but here they are; <hi>Beware of a cu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Some pretending Wits are so lazy that they will take no pains with a Joke, except it will come easily they let it alone; they, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Carvers of a Calfs head, cannot find the best bits; but our Author rather than miss any, will break his own brain.

            <p>Another Piece of the same Wit, is <hi>Page</hi> 10. where he tells us of <hi>contrary Assignations, where the Phansie is up and Breeches down</hi>; with the rest, of which Modesty forbids to make a Rehearsal, his excuse must be that of <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the <hi>Quaker</hi> for his plain Song of <hi>Window-woing, He said it when the vain Spirit was upon him.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he says ill now, he recants <hi>Page</hi> 65. He declares that <hi>he does not hear for all this, that he practised upon the Honour of Ladies.</hi> This is very charitable and true: but if this accusation had been just, the candor of the Vindication had been wonderful. The jealous

Fellow in <hi>Green-street</hi> was not so favourable to the <hi>Blew-Gown,</hi> whom he caught in that Posture with his Wife; for like an ill-bred Clown he used him unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and so that it is a shame to tell. Thus far my Author hath shewed a kind of Apotheg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical short Wit; now to shew that he can offer somewhat more stately and large, he performs the fear of <hi>Aristotle's Rarefaction,</hi> that is, he gives you much of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon a little of matter. He takes but two letters <hi>I. O.</hi> and with these alone he writes from <hi>Page</hi> 80. to 91. Never did <hi>Bow-Bells</hi> ring more Changes than these well tuned two.

Further, If this Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet should joyn its whole stock and lay it out to most advantage, it can only give words, which is the same as to deceive: besides
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59362:14"/>
that, at the best, bare words are but slender pay for a Suburb-Justice. When all is done, it is (methinks) a dishonourable and cowardly trick for four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to swear the Peace against one, and to desire to have a man bound who wears no Sword. The Letters, I am sure, had more courage in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: A few of them is <hi>those days put Augustus to flight,</hi> though he was one of the most victorious Emperours that the World ever saw. It shews a strange degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie, and is of ill consequence; for if the Letters are so timorous, they may in time shun the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of my worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; but they have not served him so yet; for in stead hereof
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59362:14"/>
they have furnished him with some words which are so much his Propriety, that no man hath been acquainted with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himself; they are great ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities every where but with him: I will give you some of them, <hi>Super-inducing Ornaments,</hi> Page 40. <hi>Vnhoopable Iurisdiction,</hi> 246. <hi>Pick-thankness of the Clergy,</hi> 284.</p>

He who is now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearser of the Farce, anon of the Close Committee, and, for length-sake of himself again, is as tough and lasting as a Stone-horse in a race; yet I have heard those who use the <hi>Newmarket</hi>-Course say that the <hi>Colingwood-Gelding</hi> would hold it out to the end as true as the best.

to be a Bramble, and brings in this Bramble making a Speech; now that he was an indefatigable Bramble, will appear if you can but meet with the Book.

There shall be no Conjuring Shows (fear not) at the Play-house, if the Devil can hinder; lest one of the Poets should be perswaded that there are Spirits. But still Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> will be a <hi>Ferret,</hi> for he bites keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: what will you then make of your self, one that mumps with a pretty seeming Innocence, yet scratches and undermines the Ground on which we tread? Well, now you had best carry the War into the Enemies Country, and assault the Town at the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lake.</hi> This Town surely
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59362:17"/>
was design'd for more Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, besides those in Religion and Government: it is strange that it should set men together by th' ears about its scituation; that this Contention, like the Leprosie' crept into the Walls, should infect the very Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical <hi>Charts,</hi> you may see them divided like Hostile Sails, some standing Southerly, and others West and by North. But if the old Report of <hi>Atlas</hi> be true, that he holds the World to rights, this <hi>Geneva</hi> stands to the South of the Lake.</p>
            <p>If you ask who this <hi>Atlas</hi> is, know that he speaks <hi>English,</hi> and discourses particularly of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lake,</hi> and taught <hi>Heylin</hi> his skill; he hath been shewn

other mens, he being an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary production of Nature, who, as appears by his Book, smiles and frowns in such quick interchanges, that for more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the same instruments were made on purpose for him to serve both uses: but he seems to say it of the Adversary, who, <hi>notwithstanding the strange Bill of Fare brought in for him,</hi> has a Face like other men, and (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) just such Muscles. In short then the mistake is this. He had read of the Muscles of the temples descending down to the lower Jaw, and there giving motion. He had likewise read in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Poets the two words for Temples and Fore-head us'd often promiscuously, as <hi>Raphe</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59362:18"/>
and <hi>Ralpho</hi> for the Verse sake; but he never consider'd that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy</hi> was more distinct than <hi>Poetry</hi>; and that the fore-head had Muscles of its own, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we frown at pleasure, and that these end in the eye-brows. For all this the Gentleman is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanc'd, but he gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial of Anatomical knowledge, <hi>Page</hi> 67. his <hi>Cerebellum was so dried up, that there was more brains in a Wallnut, and both their shells were thin and brittle</hi>; here the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellum</hi> and the <hi>shell</hi> of the Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut are compar'd: it is likely he means it of a <hi>Wallnut</hi> not yet fit to gather, then it is green and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe, and such, as he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, is the head of his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but it had been more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59362:19"/>
to Art, to have made the resemblance betwixt the <hi>Cerebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> and the <hi>Kernel,</hi> save only that the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> is much the softer substance, but agrees in this, that it is covered like the Kernel; but since he is displeased with the <hi>thin shell</hi> about the Brain, which I thought had been a sign of a good Head, as it is of a good Nut; I with him much joy of a <hi>thick Scull.</hi> The Author, being aware that the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> was empty, raises the <hi>Hypochondria Page</hi> 50. into the Region of the Brain. Beware, Sir, left some <hi>Quibler</hi> and <hi>Anatomist,</hi> like one you know, shall say, <hi>that he has then guts in his Brains</hi>: a Proverb ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing a Man of Wit and Parts.

Lay-Clerk in a Cathedral. The business of Preaching was scarce permitted to Priests in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church; for though we find that the Readers at <hi>Alexandria</hi> did Interpret, that is, Translate to them the Scripture; yet the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian who relates this, to wit, <hi>Socrates,</hi> adds that <hi>Arius</hi> was the first Priest who did ever in that City preach to the Assemblies of Christians: but it may be <hi>Iulian</hi> did it in the <hi>Independent</hi> way, as a <hi>Gifted-Brother,</hi> and that would please your Client <hi>I.

O brave <hi>Merry Andrew!</hi> this i'le warrant it pleases you. But what pity it is, in that Age of the Church there were neither Vicaridges,

nor Impropriations.

of Grace, or a Divine Institution: So that it is not the <hi>Church</hi> but <hi>he</hi> that makes them Sacraments; and on such terms he needs not quarrel with the 7 Sacraments, but may multiply them to 77. He wou'd have it be in the <hi>Church</hi> as of late in the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> that those who are placed in subjection might chuse whether they will obey or not.

Let me advise him as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did the Petitioner for <hi>Democracy</hi> in <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> to practise it first in his own

Family.

both imploy'd and approv'd by the wisest Princes in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at their Council-Boards, and in weighty Embassies; and at this day it cannot be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Order, either by Natural Endowments, or Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is more uncapable than their Predecessors. But now he is making his approaches to fall upon the Government of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and according to old Custom, the Guard of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men must feel the first blows. How unfortunate on Earth still is this blessed ROYAL MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TYR? that when his Enemies are forgiven, he cannot from them obtain a <hi>pardon for his Innocence,</hi> though he sought and di'd for <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty of his Subjects,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59362:26"/>
yet to <hi>depose</hi> and <hi>murder</hi> him again his Rebells deprive him of this glory of his present Crown. Now, Sir, you shall excuse me, if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so smoothly pass over your want of due Loyaly, as I have your <hi>mistaken</hi> well wishes to Learning.</p>
            <p>Before he comes to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Rebellion, he begins to throw dirt at the most resolute opposer of its contrivance, the <hi>truly Great</hi> and <hi>Worthy</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop LAUD: <hi>Pag</hi> 301 <hi>Though so learned, so pious, so wise a Man, he seemed to know nothing beyond Ceremonies, Arminianism, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring.</hi> Dull and unmannerly! Does it (think you) become the Son of Vicar to prate thus of an Archbishop? 'tis done like a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59362:26"/>
               <hi>Ianizary,</hi> who though he be the Son of a Christian, is the worst Enemy to the Profession. Is this your Complement, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, that you may <hi>stab</hi> him? Is it your Protection for railing whole Pages, that you Preface the Libel with his just Titles of <hi>Pious, Learned,</hi> and <hi>Wise?</hi> Do you think the World so dim-sighted, that they cannot discern what is under so thin a Veil? Such as you, have need of a good memory; for your little <hi>cunning</hi> and pernicious <hi>malice</hi> put you upon flat contradictions in the same period. Though he was <hi>Pious, Learned,</hi> and <hi>Wise,</hi> yet he seem'd to <hi>understand nothing beyond Ceremonies, &amp;c.</hi> What, nothing more! seemed he to

He knew too the dangerous Correspondence between the seditious Projectors of a War at home, and in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: to this Design he put a stop, and had, if others would have done their parts, put a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py end.</p>
            <p>Another of your Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is, <hi>Page</hi> 301. <hi>I am confident the Bishop studied to do both God and his Majesty good service</hi>: yet <hi>p.</hi> 302. <hi>resolv'd what ever came on't to make the best of him.</hi> Though you change the number, yet the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59362:27"/>
whole process of the Discourse convinces, that the Archbishop is not excepted. How do these agree? to study to do his Majesty good service, and to resolve what e're came on't, whether to his advantage or not, to be gainers, and make the best of him. No such matter. He was assur'd that the advice which he and the Noblest Temporal Lords gave the King, was for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of Religion and Peace. And he was in like manner sensible, that thereby he did expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a storm, foretelling his Friends that he saw it hanging over his head. You know not what it is to serve your Prince for <hi>Conscience-sake,</hi> nor what unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing Generosity lodg'd in his

brest, who could propound no greater reward to himself, than the satisfaction of doing his duty aright. To make the best of a Master, is a Character better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting a little Fellow, who had formerly been a whissling Clerk to a <hi>Vsurper,</hi> and afterwards turn'd <hi>Broker</hi> for all <hi>Phanatick Ware.</hi> Now you come closer to the Point, and begin the War again with a Declaration of the Causes drawn with as much <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi> as if it had been penn'd by a <hi>Committee of the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; having first imposed silence on those who renew the <hi>memory</hi> of what hath been done against the Old King, you will have the Case argu'd only in behalf of his Enemies. What is this but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59362:28"/>
to <hi>muzzle the Dogs while the Wolfs do range?</hi> Would you have the <hi>Indictment</hi> confessed by standing MUTE, when as the <hi>Witnesses</hi> are the only <hi>Malefactours?</hi> Your account of the Original of the War which was lately, is (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by) known to be untrue: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you deserve a salary from the <hi>Impenitent Rout</hi> of <hi>Sequestrators</hi> and <hi>Army-Officers.</hi> Alack, Dear Hearts! Harmless Good men! they wou'd not háve wrong'd a Worm with their good will! they had never lift up a hand against the King, or injur'd any of his Friends to the value of an <hi>English</hi> Penny, but that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to do what they did, or else lose their Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty! So that henceforth they

ought not to be troubl'd, for the <hi>Act of Indemnity</hi> has acquit them from punishment, and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsal,</hi> has absolv'd them from suspition of Guilt: This is the certain meaning of that slie insinuation, <hi>Page</hi> 303. <hi>Whether it were a War of Religion or of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, is not worth the labour to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, which soever was at the top, the other was at the bottom.</hi> Now let his Party get this Clause with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Book, and by Authority hereof, boldly to the very teeth call all the Old Royalists Figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against God, Plotters against Publick Wellfare, and undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of that which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to overthrow; but if they will please in this accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pass by the Chief person

that ever appeared in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, they expect to have the Civility acknowledg'd by his Heir. But it may be thought perhaps that I am too severe and uncharitable to the Author, and put too harsh a sense upon his words: as if he were an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, when he only plays the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian; that he only tells us their pretences, not as if they were just grounds: or that he defends these things as a good Cause of War. 'Tis true indeed, he says only, <hi>that it was too good a Cause to be fought for.</hi> Now, according to Natural Logick, whatsoever is too good, is good enough, and more to spare. As if I should say of the <hi>Transproser,</hi> in the course way of speaking
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59362:30"/>
wherein he treats others, that <hi>he was too much a Knave to be trusted with any Office in the Kingdom</hi>; this would include that he was Knave enough.</p>
            <p>Now we speak of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Commonwealth, he is sure to be excluded from many places, for refusing to declare <hi>that it is not lawful upon any cause what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever</hi> (yea, though it be <hi>too good</hi> a cause) <hi>to take up Arms against the King.</hi> But to sweeten the harshness of what he last gave, he adds, <hi>the Arms of the Church are Prayers and Tears</hi>; It is true indeed, but the Adversaries of the Church have other <hi>Arms,</hi> yet they use the saying to good purpose, and sing this in mens ears till they have lull'd them asleep;

where they intend to make an an onset. It hath been observ'd that this very sentence was the subject of a Papist's Book in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign, to make the Governours more secure, whilst they were restless. Yet this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor pretends so much respect to Government, that he fairly warns Princes of the danger which may ensue again, if they invade Religion and Liberty. <hi>Page</hi> 304. <hi>The fatal Consequences of that Rebellion can only serve as Sea-marks unto wise Princes to avoid the Causes.</hi> It only serves for Princes, he was not sensible that the People were losers. For his own part he does not find that he had cause <hi>then</hi> to complain, but as for Princes, to them they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59362:31"/>
stand as Sea-marks, they shew that if they touch there abouts. they shall be split as sure as if they dasht upon a Rock: as they love themselves, let them avoid giving the People these Causes of a War. What if they will not take fair warning? why then they must take what comes. How much better might he have assign'd, as the cause of the War, A <hi>wanton Pride</hi> of the People, bred out of <hi>Prosperity</hi> and <hi>long ease,</hi> infected with a touch of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling</hi> Principles, deriv'd over to their Politicks from the New Models of Church Government. He might farther have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, that these materials were wrought by <hi>Aemulation</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness.</hi> Not forgetting that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59362:31"/>
some Grandees ordered the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Lecturers,</hi> like Apothecaries, to make up, according to their prescriptions, a <hi>Bolus</hi> with some counterfeit drops of <hi>Gods Glory,</hi> that the <hi>Well-meaning</hi> multitude might more glibly swallow the Poison.</p>
            <p>I have now upon the matter done with you: Let me only advise you as a Friend, suddenly to clap up a Peace with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon this single Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>that neither might suffer by the other.</hi> As to what you have wrote against the Author of the Preface, the most part has either been answered to your Principal <hi>I. O.</hi> or else needs none. Or if it seem so to require, it carries a solution near the difficulty. What
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59362:32"/>
you object against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is <hi>Rehearsal</hi>; and as it hath been repeated oft by several, so has it been oftner confuted.</p>
            <p>Let me leave you with a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in History, and the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in how many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances this is, and may be your case. The short of it is thus; <hi>Eutropius</hi> the Eunuch was a busie Solicitor with the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy, to have a Law made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Priviledges and Power of the Church, not long after it happen'd that he was utterly ruin'd by the very same contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, which his malice against Ecclesiastical Politie had framed.</p>
