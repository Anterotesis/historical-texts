            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An Anſwer to the Pretended Caſe, Printed concerning the Navigation of the <hi>River Wye</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> by ſhewing the true ſtate thereof.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> many years deſigned to make the ſaid River Navigable, and cut part of the ſame through his own Mannor of <hi>Sutton</hi> as hath been proved before a Committee of this Parliament; where, above 40 Members were preſent, as by their Reſolves hereunder mentioned doth appear; but he being Sequeſtred for his fidelity to the late King, agreed in 1651. with one Mr. <hi>Pitſon</hi> a Captain in the Uſerpers Army, to ſolicit the diſcharge of his Sequeſtration, and the paſſing an Act of that pretended Parliament, to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the making the ſaid River Navigable, and to cover Sir <hi>Richards</hi> name, agreed to make uſe of the name of the Corporation of <hi>Guildford, Pitſon, Scotchier. Pitſon</hi> having ſolicited and obtained the pretended Act, agreements were made that Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> ſhould finiſh his own deſign to cut the River: <hi>Pitſon</hi> and the reſt being wholly ignorant in things of that Nature, and that he alone ſhould undertake the work, and give ſecurity by his Eſtate to do it within a year, unto ſuch as would adventure any moneys for a ſhare in the benefits of the Navigation.</p>
            <p>The profits were agreed to be divided into 24 ſhares, 12 thereof to be to Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> and 12 to ſuch as would adventure 250 l. for a ſhare to raiſe 3000 l. which was done principally by <hi>Scotchier</hi> and one <hi>Darnelly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> cut above two parts in three of the ſaid River, but yed 2000 ls. worth of his own Timber, and expended 4000 l. in money, and dyed within the year, having agreed that 1000 l. more ſhould be raiſed by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers for 4 ſhares more, but he never ſold his Moyety to <hi>Pitſon</hi> or any others, as is untruly alledged in the ſaid Caſe.</p>
            <p>After Sir <hi>Richard's</hi> death <hi>Scotchier</hi> and one of Sir <hi>Richards</hi> younger ſons finiſhed the ſaid cut.</p>
            <p>The Heir of Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Weſton</hi> being never concerned in any of the Contracts nor Receipts of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and unable to appear, his Eſtate being ſold by the Uſerpers, and very often a Priſoner for his Loyalty.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>Anno</hi> 1654. being after the River was totally finiſhed, Accounts being ſtated, it did appear that <hi>Pitſon</hi> had received in his ſoliciting and tranſacting amongſt adventurers in the ſaid work above 2000 l. more then he had disburſed towards it, which appears by exhibits p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oved in the Exchequer.</p>
            <p>But the ſaid whole undertaking was without pretence of Authority, the ſaid pretended Act, providing that it ſhall not be lawful to cut or dig the Lands of any perſon or perſons until agreement made with them reſpectively, which was never done, in the year 1660, ſome that had adventured for ſhares of the hoped for profits of the ſaid River finding themſelves to have no Intreſt in Law or Equity, without agreement with the Land Proprietors, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to bring them all to agree that the River might be maintained, and moſt of them joyned to veſt their intereſt legally in Mr. <hi>Dickenſon,</hi> who as Truſtee have mannaged their cauſe, and its proved in the Exchequer, that all thoſe joyned with the Land owners have expended about their intreſts in the ſaid River above twenty thouſand pounds were in quiet poſſeſſion of the Navigation in <hi>Anno</hi> 1666.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Sandys</hi> that was never concerned in the River, having contracted with <hi>Pitſon</hi> for the ſhares of profits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Adventurers, with promiſes to get an Act of Parliament, and one <hi>Radclife</hi> haveing got a Pattent from his Majeſty to be conſervator of the ſaid River; thence many differences aroſe, and they procured an Order from the King to ſuſpend the Land-owners receipt of any profits until the Lord Chief Barron ſhould ſettle an Iſſue to be tryed in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 1666. to determine the intreſts of the ſeveral pretenders.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dickenſon,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Atkins</hi> as Councel for the Land-owners, and thoſe joyned with them, attended the Lord Cheif Barron many times to ſettle the ſaid iſſue, which could not be done: But his Lordſhip was afterwards pleaſed to declare ſome opinion, that it was fit to be brought into the Exchequer Chamber by information by the Kings Attorney General againſt all the pretenders, which was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>Some of the Land-owners and thoſe joyned with them, anſwered to the ſaid Information, and moſt of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants never anſwered, nor never were ſubpenaed; thoſe that anſwered ſet forth their intereſts both in Law and Equity, and have attended his Lordſhip above theſe three years, at above 1000 l. expence, and the allegations and proofs offered by Mr. <hi>Sandys</hi> under Mr. <hi>Pitſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Radcliffe</hi> were heard, but a great part of the proofs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits on the behalf of the Land-owners that anſwered have not been heard, and his Lordſhip declared that he could make no decree herein, neither indeed did the cauſe come before him as between party and party, as Plantiffs and Defendants.</p>
            <p>The Land proprietor with Mr. <hi>Weston,</hi> eldeſt ſon of the ſaid Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> humbly offer that the Navigation may be preſerved for the publick good, by ſetling the ſaid River, upon ſome Gentlemen of the ſaid County, as Truſtees to diſpoſe the firſt profits of the ſame to maintayn the ſame Navigable, and the reſidue to the reſpective perſons, who have any right or intreſt thereunto, either in Law or Equity.</p>
            <p>And if the wiſdome of Parliament ſhall think fit, that a competent number of the Gentlemen of the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who have the advantage of all others by being on the place, may be empowered to give any competent ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to any that have adventured moneys about the ſaid River, and are not relieveable in any of the ordinary Courts of Law or Equity, tis humbly ſubmitted.</p>
