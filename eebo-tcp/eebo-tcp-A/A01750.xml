            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Chriſtians cannot looke to be ſo nice and tenderly brought up as not to endure the ſight of their heavenly Fathers rod; they muſt looke to fall into ſickneſſe, to ſit in Darkneſſe, to be chaſtened ſore: and becauſe the bitter cup of trembling cannot paſſe, but firſt or laſt, we muſt all drinke it, 'twas <hi>Davids</hi> diet-drinke, and <hi>Iob</hi> took it all off, we are not better then they, and who is too good to pledge his Saviour?

            </p>
            <p>Glance but upon the Coherence yee ſhall quickly perceive this Conſolatory Exhortation of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to be very opportune and moſt ſeaſonable, which may produce this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. That the ſeaſonable opportunity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting one another is to be taken. Stale Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is unacceptable to the palate of the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, 'tis the freſhneſſe of the occaſion that ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates Comfort to the Appetite of the longing ſoule. Comfort may come too late, and although it be never ſo good of it ſelfe, the tarditie and lateneſſe will argue the Meſſenger of no little indiſcretion. Juſtly in this did <hi>Tiberius</hi>

Time eates away griefe, which otherwiſe would eate out the Heart, griefe for loſſes is commonly worne away in time; this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the late Comforter is a Comforter both Miſerable, and Ridiculous. Miſerable, by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a good Remedy to a very ill purpoſe even to force healed wounds to bleed a freſh. Ridiculous for a man out of Time to doe that which Time it ſelfe hath done before him: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Phyſicke exaſperates the Diſeaſe, when as give it but Time and Patience, 'twill doe well enough, elſe apply a timely Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Were he not to be laughed at that brings a Handkerchiefe to wipe away teares already dryed? But better late, then never: nay, in the Caſe of Conſolation, better never then too late: better not doe that which is good, then to do it, when 'twill doe hurt.

               </gap> in the Text is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing, encouraging, and ſtrengthning of our fainting and languiſhing ſpirits.

But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that ſtudy the right Art of true Comfort have another language, our ſpirituall Comfort is left us, when our life is about to leave us. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Comfort is raiſed from the Creator by the Mediation of the Creature, or from the Creature by the working of the Creator in the Apprehenſion of the Regenerate Man. Thus the Holy Ghoſt is the firſt Mover of ſpirituall Comfort, as the Promiſes of Gods Word are the grounds of this Comfort, and our Beleeving

               </gap>, there is often mention made of the Comforter in Scripture, becauſe of the calamities and afflictions imminent to the Diſciples, but the bleſſed Eſtate of Heaven cannot admit any ſuch Miſery and Diſtreſſe: we ſhall joy in one another in Heaven, but not Comfort one another there, no ſuch Comfort in Heaven, all joy, all Reſt; I finde a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it in <hi>Aquinas,</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">2a. 2ae. q. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Gaudium ſie habet ad Deſiderium, ut quies ad motum.</hi> The ſoule is reſtleſſe in her Deſire, but quieted in her Joy; now Comfort on Earth brings ſome Reſt for the ſoule, but Joy in Heaven is the only abſolute Reſt. Comfort is Reſt to the weary for a time, and a way to enable them for further tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile: but Joy is Reſt for Eternitie: even to ſit down, and reſt for ever, that is Joy in Heaven; to ſtand and take a draught by the way, not to ſit by it, that is Comfort on Earth; true Joy frees from all ſorrowes, wipes all teares from our Eyes: but it may be true Comfort which only upholds us in our ſorrow; and dryes up our teares as they fall. Yet fall they will, and ſorrow we ſhall, elſe we need no Comfort, for it muſt be a neceſſitous eſtate that ſtands in need of Comfort; thus is Comfort differenced from Eternall Joy that needs nothing. Yea and thus 'tis in this life as Nature neceſsitates the ſpark to flye upward: ſo ſinne carries us downeward to the Center, Miſery. This Center is every where below the Moone; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature is the Circumference, no man without ſome lines drawne from, or drawing him to Miſery; <hi>Nulla Dies ſine linea.</hi> Every Day in this life, line upon line, line upon line, miſery upon miſery, miſery upon miſery; 'tis well too, when it is here a little, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3301:14"/>
there a little. But this may ſuffice to put a Difference 'twixt ſpirituall Comfort in this life and eternall Joy in the life to come, and by this ye eaſily perceive my paſſage from the firſt generall Part to the Second, which is the Neceſsity of this Building in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Common-wealth, elſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> would not have uſed ſo ſerious an Exhortation as this in my Text; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Comfort one another with theſe words.</hi>

            <p>

thunder commonly brings raine, your ſonnes of thunder ſhould doe well alwayes to conclude with a comfortable ſhower to refreſh the Heart: though Miniſters may not be too curious to ſpeake to the Eare, yet they cannot be too carefull to ſpeak to the Heart of the People, that is to ſpeak comfortably to the people; Spirituall Bees muſt draw Honey, out of what flower ſoever they light to preach upon.

Thoſe that are afflicted, but in hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Wherefore either for feare, or hope, be well provided with comforts before hand; the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had not been left ſo compleatly furniſhed with Comforts after her Sonnes death, had She not laid in her heart thoſe ſayings that She heard from her living Saviour: imitate the bleſſed Virgin, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſaying yee heare commit it to ſafe cuſtody in your hearts, for yee know not what need any of you, or any of your friends may have of it in the day of ſickneſſe; or at the houre of death at furtheſt.

the tongue of comforting; then yee own the Pearles, when they are yours to give to one another. Why to heare one who hath the tongue of comforting, (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had in the words before my text) enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the minde, rectifying the will, moderating the deſires, quieting the affections, and filling the ſoule with unſpeakable joy is or would be a great delight to you; yet nothing to that ye wil find, when by the wils, grace of God working upon your underſtandings and yee ſhall be able to produce all theſe divine effects (upon occaſion) both in your ſelves and in others, wherefore 'tis needfull <hi>to comfort one another with theſe words.</hi> 4.

Againe beloved in the Lord of Heaven, are we not fellow-travellers to heaven? why then as good travellers cheere up <hi>one another</hi> both by word and by example; eſpecially in the red Sea of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the wheeles of the ſoule are taken off, like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariot wheeles, they drive heavily; they want this oyle to put them on comfortably. Whence is it that ſo many droope under the burden of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cares, and are ſore battered with ſo many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? 'tis becauſe they are left comfortleſſe, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their owne ſpirits. Dead ſtones in an Arch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold one another, and ſhall not the living?

and a healing tongue of Comfort; the very leafes, the words of the tree of Righteouſneſſe have a curing vertue in them, ſtrengthning and corroborating the heart, there are words (even thoſe words in my text) that are Cordialls againſt all faintings of ſpirit, they will beget new ſpirits in a man, <hi>Wherefore comfort one another with ſuch words.</hi> Every relation wherein we ſtand towards others are ſo many bonds and ſinewes, whereby one member of Chriſt is fitted to derive comfort to another through love the bond of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 14. we can attaine to no perfection of comforting without love, if ye love one another, ye will comfort one another, yee are of relation neere enough, that is the chiefe enforcement of this duty from our Chriſtian Sympathy.

We receive comfort <note place="margin">4.</note> from God to this very end that we might be able to comfort one another, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 4. Let us give to others as we receive from God.</hi> 5.

Now 'twill be our comfort here, and crowne hereafter, a double recompence, God and man ſhall bleſſe us if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one another; thus bleſſed is the man that gives comfort to them that need; and if I cannot perſwade you to be happy, give me leave to paſſe from the Perſwaſives to the Diſſwaſives.</p>

            <p>1. The Habituall Abilitie to make good uſe of <note place="margin">6. Generall Part.</note> this Art of comforting, that is the ſixt generall Part. Now the ſpring head of comfort infuſing into this habituall ability, either we muſt goe out of the world for that, or that muſt come from another world for us: but we cannot ſtir one foote of the ſoule, the leaſt affection: or ſo much as one winged thought to goe to that, that muſt come to us, to raiſe our flight, with the wings of that Dove, whoſe wings are ſilver, and her feathers like gold, I meane the Holy Ghoſt. The Eternall Breath of the Father and the Sonne muſt breath into us the breath of Life, a Life of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: the Love of the Father and the Sonne deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the Sonne in the likeneſſe of a Dove with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gall, muſt purge out of us all gall of malice and bitterneſſe that we may <hi>comfort one another</hi> in all meekneſſe of ſpirit: the inviſible ſpirit deſcending viſibly upon the ſonnes of men in the likneſſe of fiery tongues muſt enable us to give light and warmth of comfort to one another. If it be urged, <hi>that Faith is</hi>

               <hi>the only ſtrong Conveyance and true Receiver of ſpirituall Comfort.</hi> 'Tis quickly ſatisfied, <hi>that even Faith alſo is</hi>

               <hi>the gift of the Spirit.</hi> The Comforter gives us Faith to take Comfort from him, elſe we can take none at all, ſo that in the concluſion, 'tis the Comforter that workes all in all in us. For as it was ſaid of the Maſſe and Chaos <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note>, <hi>Tohu, vavohu,</hi> an emptie, vaſt, ſolitary, ſolitude; <hi>'Twas without forme and voyde, darkneſſe</hi>

(that is a Privation of Light) <hi>was upon the Face of the Earth, before the Spirit of God moved upon the Face of the Waters.</hi> The ſoule of a naturall man is like the earth, lumpiſh, ſad, without forme and voyde of comfort, darkneſſe of diſcontent is upon the face of the man inward and outward; a vacuity, a vaſt ſolitary Privation of comfort; untill the Spirit of God move upon the face of the waters (that is) the ſwelling, tumultuous, reſtleſſe thoughts, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe apprehenſions. The Hebrew is an apt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, <hi>Rachaph, Incubare;</hi> from birds that ſit brood on their Egges to ſuſtaine and cheriſh them: the Spirit of God doth not only forme and ſuſtaine the thoughts of man from vaniſhing into nothing; but alſo nouriſh, and cheriſh, and foſter them, to ſupport a regenerate man in the comfortable eſtate of well being, a Chriſtian. Not a thought of comfort can riſe in the heart, but firſt hatched by the Spirit of God: we are quite voyde and empty, not the leaſt Motion of Comfort, before the Spirit of God move upon our thoughts. Beloved, at the firſt coming of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 2. a ruſhing mighty winde <note place="margin">Acts 2. 2.</note> filled all the houſe; the winde hath one property to cleanſe and purge the Aire, to make it comfortable and refreſhing: nor is there any true refreſhing or comfort, untill we are filled with the Spirit of God, as the ſaile of a Ship is filled with winde. For let a ſhip be never ſo well tackled and provided, yet all is in vaine without a winde: and let never ſo eloquent Sermons ſpread their ſailes in the ſhip of the Church, unleſſe the good winde of Gods Spirit blowes where it liſt, when it liſt, how it liſt, and upon whom it liſt; I ſay Gods Spirit muſt be both winde to drive us, and Pilot to direct us to the Port of Comfort. Now if

               <hi>Caeſar</hi> did encourage that Ship-Maſter, who feared Ship-wrack, with a <hi>Caeſarem vehis;</hi> feare not thou carrieſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Worlds Conquerour; yet by his leave, as great as he was, he was not the Seas Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, nor the obeyed rebuker of the Winds, and Waves, as he is whom we carry in our toſſed breaſts; cheere thy thy ſelf with a <hi>Paracletum vehis;</hi> thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt the Comforter in thy heart, the rebuker of heart-riſings, the Lord controller of Troubles, the commander of ſtormy ſwelling afflictions, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of temptations. Whoſe very conqueſt is a mighty comfort to the conquered Soule, becauſe his Conqueſt is atchieved by Love, for as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father and the Sonne per modum Amoris,</hi> as the Schoole ſpeakes, ſo the Spirit workes in us by way of Love; ſweetly S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            <p>The Building of Comfort not only ſtands by the benefit of the Foundation that ſuſtaines and ſupports it: but the ſtrength of the Building is much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and encreaſed by the benefit of the contig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that knit and unite the Parts together; and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3301:28"/>
alſo of the buttereſſes that comprehend and embrace them without. The Foundation being ſurely laid will not ſuffer the Building of Comfort to ſinke: the contignation and knitting will not ſuffer it to cleave: the Buttereſſes will not ſuffer it to ſwerve: all theſe together by a joynt force (which is the ſtronger) make greatly for the ſtrength and duration of the building of Comfort. Yee ſee the Foundation laid before in it proper place: briefly here of the contig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and the Buttereſſes as they are neceſſary for the ſtrength and duration of Comfort. 1. Gods <note place="margin">The Contig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Building of Comfort.</note> Wiſedome, Power, Juſtice, Mercy, Truth will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly doe all the Offices of the Contignation of this Building. 2.

            <p>The ſecond needs little Probation, for all ſtrength <note place="margin">2.

power with us then againſt us, this is that other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Argument urged by the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. <note place="margin">Iſai. 40 12.</note> 12. <hi>Who hath meaſured the waters in the hollow of his hand? and meted out Heaven with the ſpanne? and comprehended the Duſt of the Earth in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? and weighed the mountaines in ſcales, and the hils in a ballance?</hi> therefore for our infinite comfort, God (maugre all the adverſe power) can doe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will, as having his Name, <hi>the mighty God, Iſaiah</hi> 9. 6. <note place="margin">

            <p>The third Contignation of the building of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Gods Juſtice, is ſo abſolute, He can doe us no wrong, that's our comfort, doe what he pleaſe: the ſoreſt chaſtiſement that ever childe of God ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was but his juſt Anger againſt him, even the way of his diſpleaſure was not unequall, to puniſh our ſinnes ſo ſeverely in his own Sonne. What more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable then this, that all affliction is but Gods juſt purſuit of ſinne in us, to drive ſinne out of us, and us out of ourſelves, to flye wholly to our God? <hi>Davids</hi> meate may be aſhes, and his teares mingled with his drink, yet this proves a comfortable repaſt, a ſweet refreſhing, by reaſon that out of the Eater comes meat, out of the ſtrong comes hony, out of Gods Juſtice againſt ſinne iſſues true Comfort.</p>
            <p>Fourth Contignation, Gods Mercy; God hath not <note place="margin">4.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3301:29"/>
conſumed, but tryed, not for his pleaſure, but for our profit: as a Father ſcourgeth his ſonne, yet pities his ſonne, ſo there is mercy with God that he may be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a Father, and that we may be comforted as his children. Thus <hi>the Father of mercies</hi> cannot but <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 3.</note> ſhew himſelfe <hi>a God of all Conſolation,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> joynes them together; ſo the childe of God findes by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> is alwayes <hi>the God of all Comfort,</hi> that is the fourth knitting and uniting of the Building of Comfort.</p>
            <p>5. Contignation, Gods Truth; it is no ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <note place="margin">5. Gods Truth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2.</note> that we are ſure (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.) that the Judgement of God is according to Truth; Truth it ſelfe muſt needs according to Truth in the inward parts judge all things, but the height of Comfort is that Truth it ſelf cannot but keep promiſe, all the promiſes of Comfort in the Goſpell, the Word of truth, ye may take Gods Word, were it for a thouſand Comforts, why the world propoſeth a thouſand coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfait Comforts, but our God in his Word doth furniſh us with tenne thouſand true reall Comforts.

The Wiſdome of his Father to know how and when to comfort us. 2. From the Father all power is given him and authority of comforting us. 3. His Fathers Juſtice is ſatisfied in him, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a man of ſorrowes, to comfort us; a curſe, that we ſhould not be accurſed; curſed be that man, who accounts not this the greateſt Comfort. 4. and 5. for I finde them joyned together, <hi>Heb. 2. 17. Chriſt made like to his brethren, that he might be a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and faithfull high Priest,</hi> the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are comfortable words, not only to compaſſionate us,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3301:30"/>
but to be true and Faithfull to us, not to faile, Chriſt will never faile us in the knitting and uniting of our Comfort within, if we doe not faile our ſelves in ſetting up the Buttereſſes from without; Chriſt is faithfull, if we be not faithleſſe.</p>
            <p>There are three ſpeciall Buttereſſes of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Buttereſſes of the Building of Comfort. 1. Submiſſion to Gods Will.</note> of Comfort. 1. Submiſſion to Gods Will: a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of our ſelves to doe what he will with us is the main Fulciment, Buttereſſe or ſpirituall ſhoare of true Comfort. For in all croſſes, and loſſes of wife, children, friends, &amp;c. the whole buſineſſe is not to expreſſe ſorrow; but a ſubmiſſive ſubjection to Gods good pleaſure and will. <hi>Eli</hi> failed much in the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his ſonnes, yet he himſelf was a moſt duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full childe to God his heavenly Father, even when he heard that heavy judgement, able to make both the eares of the hearer to tingle, he did then ſubject himſelf unto God, with that excellent in comparable Speech of Submiſſion, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>ſeemeth him good. 1. Sam.</hi> 3. Though the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him and his ſo nigh, yet the good man thought that he had nothing more to doe then to ſet to the ſeale of his approbation of Gods Will, which was a willing Submiſſion to it. <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth not man to reaſon with him, why he doth thus and thus, there is no good to be got by ſuch contention, all the Comfort lyes in this, out of the abundance of the heart the mouth muſt ſpeak after this admirable manner; <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemeth him good.</hi> Nay, a greater then <hi>Eli,</hi> the firſt High Prieſt that ever was, <hi>Aaron</hi> who was appointed by God to be a mouth to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he could ſpeak ſo well; yet when God burnt his ſonnes for offering ſtrange fire, he had not a word to ſay, but as the Text
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3301:30"/>
ſaith, <hi>Aaron held his Peace;</hi> by holding his peace in this caſe, <hi>Aaron</hi> did glorifie God more then if he had ſpoken with the tongues of men and Angels; <hi>Aaron</hi> ſilencing his ſorrow by ſubjecting his will to Gods Will, did ſhew forth his inward Comfort. Once more, for 'tis a greater then <hi>Aaron,</hi> our <hi>High Prieſt</hi> according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was never without Comfort, becauſe never without Submiſſion to his heavenly Father: when he was alone, and none to comfort him indeed, he prayed (bearing our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities) <hi>Let this cup paſſe from me,</hi> but with a pull back of reſtraint, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done. Ipſe erat voluntas &amp; Poteſtas Patris, &amp; tamen ad Demonſtratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſufferentiae debitae, voluntati ſe Patris tradidit, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tertull. in Orat. Domin.</note> laſt words on the third Petition; Chriſt was both the Will and the Power of his Father, yet to demonſtrate to us that Submiſſion is alwayes due to Gods Will, He ſubjects himſelf in all things, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done.</hi> This is a ſtrong ſupporter of true comfort, to lay our hands upon our mouthes, and not to open them except with <hi>Iobs</hi> thankfull <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord,</hi> O happy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort! and well upheld, to bleſſe God in all things by freely ſubmitting our wills to His Will; let the Lord doe what he will, and let us be ſure to bleſſe His Name for it, that is the firſt Buttereſſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>2. Buttereſſe, and a very ſtrong one too, is Right <note place="margin">2. Buttereſſe of Comfort. Right Reaſon.</note> Reaſon, rectified, ſanctified Reaſon. What is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedneſſe, and uncomfortableneſſe, but the confuſion, diſtemper, and diſorder of our affections and actions? but when they are well ordered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the commands of rectified Reaſon, then riſeth comfort and contentedneſſe of minde: when
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3301:31"/>
our Paſſions and Actions are ſubject to the ſtraight Rule of Reaſon, then is the ſoule at comfort; a man of Right Reaſon is a man rich in Comfort, a happy <hi>Dives,</hi> he may ſay, Soule, ſoule, take thy reſt, for thou haſt comfort, much riches of comfort, laid up for as long, as thy Reaſon is rectified and is guided by the Word of God, and the whole courſe of thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ordered by that rectified Reaſon. When a man ſmothers himſelf under ſorrow, and diſcontent, let him ſee what reaſon he hath for it out of Gods Word: when a man rejoyceth and comforteth himſelf with anything, let him ſee what good reaſon he can finde for it: beleeve me, this is a ſtrong bridle and curbe to ſtop the courſe of all diſcontentedneſſe and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortableneſſe in our Chriſtian journey: and withall a very ſtrong keen-metled Spur to put us forward in the free courſe of true Comfort: even this is the ready way, to try all things that we doe by ſound Right Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Now that the two former Buttereſſes may ſtand faſt, and the whole Building continue durable, we muſt not faile to put up the third Buttereſſe, that is <note place="margin">3. Buttereſſe. Prayer for ſtrength of Comfort.</note> to put up Prayer for ſtrength of Comfort. <hi>If any of you lack wiſedome (Iames 1. 5.) let him aske God, and he will give it him.

O then knock ſtrongly, that thou <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 7.</note> mayſt have ſtrength of comfort. Why but Prayer is only of things poſſible, becauſe Prayer is an Act of Hope; and Hope is ſtill fixed upon a poſſibility of enjoying the object: now if there muſt be hope of embracing what we pray for, and a likely poſſibility of what we hope for, what (I pray) encouragement doe they give us, to put up our Prayers for ſtrength of Comfort, who make a queſtion, whether it be poſſible for a man in this life to have abſolute firme ſtrength of comfort againſt all evill? True it is, here is a queſtion ſtarted by the Caſuiſts, let us perſue it a <note place="margin">Queſtion.</note> little, for it is about the ſtrength of this Building.

The Affirmative is thus <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> eſtabliſhed, that though there may ſometime be a mixture of griefe or feare with comfort, yet that comfort is a repreſſion, mitigation and lenition of that grief or feare, and will in time get the victory. 1.
