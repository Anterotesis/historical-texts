            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>He had a very searching and diving gift: whereby he was able to <hi>anatomize</hi> and lay open the severall parts and nerves of the points which he handled, and to set out pertinent signes, rules, meanes, and motives thereabout.</p>
            <p>His expression of his mind by fit words and phrases

this man of GOD the Authour of this Work, now a Saint in heaven.

afterward became a learned Divine and godly Preacher at <hi>London.</hi> In that Colledge he fell close to the studies of Logick and Philosophie, and by reason of that ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of learning he got at schoole, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of yeares, he quickly got the start of those of his owne time, and grew into fame in that House. In the middest of these his studies his father died, and then his meanes failed, for all his fathers lands fell to his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother now living: but this crosse by GODS providence prooved a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him for his growth in learning, though it put him to monstrous paines of body and mind: for now wanting meanes to buy him bookes, he borrowed of his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and others the best writers on Naturall and Morall Philosophy, and the Politicks, and read them all over, and abridged them all in his note-bookes, which are now to be seene, and then returned the bookes to their owners.

exactnesse in it, he did with intolerable pains write out with his owne hand all <hi>Homer,</hi> (or <hi>Hesiod</hi> I am sure) for I have seene it in a faire Greeke character; for he wrote that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage better than he did either English or Latine; and asking him the reason of his paines, he told me, it was onely that he might accent perfectly. This brought him to such a readinesse, that he could with as much facility <hi>course</hi> in the publike Schooles (for he was a famous disputant) in the Greeke tongue, as in the Latine or English: and in them all he wrote and spake <hi>Stilo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratorio,</hi> as <hi>Lipsius</hi> calls it, <hi>viz.</hi> a high and lofty stile, which was so familiar to him, as that he could not avoid it in ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>

which he ever performed with such readinesse and acutenesse of speech and wit, and such profoundnesse of learning, that when he was a Master of Arts but of small standing, he was chosen by the now <hi>Lord Arch-Bishop of Canterburie, Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> at King IAMES His first comming to that Vniversity, to be one of the disputants before the King, and to read in Naturall Philosophy in the publike Schooles.

            <p>About the fortieth yeare of his age, for<note place="margin">11</note> the better setting of himselfe in house-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vpon his Personage, he resolued vpon marriage, and tooke to wife M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Anne Boyse</hi> a Gentle woman of an ancient house and worshipfull family in <hi>Kent,</hi> to whose care he committed the ordering of his outward estate, he himselfe onely minding the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and weighty affaires of his heauenly calling, in the which for the space of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares and more, he was so diligent and laborious, that twice every Lords day hee preached, and Catechized in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, in which Catechisme he expounded the Creed and ten Commandements in a very exact manner; And vpon every holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and on euery friday before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:7155:17"/>
he expounded some Chapter, by which meanes he went over the greater portion of the Historicall part of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.

farre and neare, and divers from beyond the seas desired his resolution in divers cases of Conscience, which was the onely cause that made him put forth that last learned and godly Treatise of his, which he stiled; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions for a right comforting afflicted consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>

            <p>And though in his manner of preaching<note place="margin">12</note> he was a <hi>Sonne of thunder,</hi> yet unto bruised reeds and those that mourned in spirit, hee was as sweete a sonne of Consolation as ever I heard, and with a very tender and pitifull heart powred the oyle of mercy into their bleeding wounds. He (as was said of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>) was a mighty opposite to the Divels kingdome, and had a singular skill to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his sleights and that cunning crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse whereby hee lies in wait to deceive. He ever thought that there was no such way to cast downe the strong holds of Sathan and to batter his kingdome, then after the steps of <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> to lay the axe close to the roote of sinne, and to set it on with such power, as that the Divell and all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents were not able to resist it. By this meanes
<pb facs="tcp:7155:18"/>
he got ground of Satan and wasted his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and <hi>there were daily added to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery such whose hearts were softned thereby.</hi> And in all his Sermons he ever used to discover the filthinesse of sinne, and to presse very powerfully upon the conscience the duties of Sanctification, in expression whereof three things were remarkeable in him.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Such courage and resolution of spirit as is scarcely to be found in any.

<pb facs="tcp:7155:19"/>
all his denunciations against sinne, he never personated any man whereby to put him to shame, unlesse his owne inward guiltinesse caused him to apply it to himselfe. 2. Hee would never presse upon the conscience the guiltinesse of sinne, but he would for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When he had searcht the conscience to the very quicke (as he would doe) he ever offred CHRIST in all his beauty and sweetnesse, and powred it forth upon the conscience with such a torrent of Eloquence as would haue melted the hearts of any, but those which obstinately refused the voice of that powerfull charmer. 4. He would alwaies protest unto his people, that it was a trouble and griefe to him to preach against their sinnes, hee delighted not to vexe any of their consciences, he should be glad the case was so with them, that hee might only preach the riches of the mercies

in CHRIST all his dayes; But he knew no other way to pull them out of the snare of Satan and state of darkenesse then the way he tooke, without drawing the horrible sin of Bloud-guiltinesse upon his soule.</item>

               <p>In the first Part we may take notice, and into our consideration these three Points.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Provision of a comfortable <hi>Song</hi> for the people to carie with them, as it were into Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the fiery Triall; that in the midst of their pressures they might be eased and refresht with a conceit, that the Day would come, wherein they should joyfully sing the song of enlargement, and salvation, Ver. 1. Though when they <hi>sate downe by the rivers of Babylon,</hi> their hearts would not serve them to sing any <hi>Song of Zion,</hi> but fell asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their brests like drops of water, yet assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all GODS faithfull Ones, who believed His Prophet and Promises, would in the meane time secretly sweeten their sorrowes and sufferings, with a patient expectation of this happy Day, and heavenly mirth.</item>
                  <item>2. The Song it selfe, Ver. 1, 2, 3. Wherein we may consider, 1. The Time, when the Song shall be sung: <hi>In that Day</hi>] which we may vnderstand, 1. Historically, literally, typically, of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites deliverance out of Babylon, and the miserable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7155:30"/>
slavery thereof. 2. Anti-typically, of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed enlargement of GODS Elect out of the snares and bondage of the Devill. 3. And mystically also, as some Divines thinke, of the joyfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christians out of spirituall Babylon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5. and from under the tyrannie of Antichrist. 4. Complementally, of gathering the Saints out of this vale of teares, and from the eager pursuit of that great red Dragon, and the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, into <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which is above, where they shall joyfully sing triumphant Halelujahs in the highest heaven for ever and ever, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 26. 2. The Matter of the Song; which is, <hi>Salvation,</hi> Ver. 1. <hi>Peace;</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>Holy company,</hi> Ver. 2. Pure pleasure, comfort, sound contentment, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>3. An Exhortation, or exhortatory apostro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe, to trust in <hi>Iehovah.</hi> And there is added, for <hi>ever;</hi> lest upon Gods delay, and respiting reliefe, we should despaire, or have recourse unto the <hi>arme of flesh.</hi> Reasons to enforce this exhortation are three. 1. In Him is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>rupes saeculorum,</hi> ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting strength, Ver. 3. A <hi>rocke of eternity,</hi> upon which we may for ever sweetly and safely rest and repose our selves, amidst the many furious storms and boisterous waves of this troublesome world. 2. He is able to tame, take downe, and trample in the mire, the insolency and pride of the most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging persecutors, Ver. 5. And to raise His, though never so low and languishing, to set them upon a Rocke of safety and salvation for ever, and to give them the neckes of their enemies to tread upon, Verse 6. 3. Hee <hi>weighes</hi> and watches over

               <p>Now whereas the Prophet in the first place doth furnish the people of GOD before hand with a strong counter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>comfort and cordiall against their faintings in the furnace of affliction, we may thence be instructed; that,</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>DOCT.</hi> It is an holy wisdome, and happy thing to treasure up comfortable provision against the Day of calamity.</q>
               <q>It is good counsell, and a blessed course, to store up comfort against the evill Day.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that gathereth in Summer,</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon) is a sonne of understanding: But he that sleepeth in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, is a sonne of confusion, Prov.</hi> 10. 5. If not by an immediate sense, yet by a warrantable analogy and good consequent this Place will beare this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase.</p>
               <p>That man which now in this faire and seasonable Sun-shine of his gracious visitation is lull'd asleepe with the Syren-songs of these sensuall times upon the lap of pleasure; swims downe the tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing torrent of these last and lewdest daies with full saile of prosperity and ease, against the secret wasts and counter-blasts (as it were) of a reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conscience, as thousands do, to their utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing for ever; mis-spends his golden time, and many goodly opportunities of gathering spirituall <hi>Manna,</hi> in grasping gold, gathering wealth, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, greatning his posterity, clasping about the arme of flesh, satisfying the appetite, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himselfe: In a word, he that while it is called <hi>To day,</hi> turnes not on Gods side, and by forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7155:31"/>
and fruitfulnesse in His blessed waies, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures up comfort and grace against his ending houre, shall most certainly upon his bed of death, and illumination of conscience, find nothing but horrible confusion and feare, extremest horrour, and insupportable heauinesse of heart: his soule must presently downe into the kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and bottome of the burning lake, there to lie everlastingly in tempestuous and fiery tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the sting and strength whereof doth not onely surpasse the pens and tongues of Men and Angels, but the very conceipt of those that suffer them, which if a man knew, he would not endure one houre for all the pleasures of ten thousand worlds: His body (the pleasing and pampering whereof hath plunged him into such a sea of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and woe) must descend into the house of death, an habitation of blacknesse and cruelty: lie downe in a bed of <hi>dust</hi> and rottennesse <hi>covered with wormes,</hi> guarded and kept full sure by the Prince and powers of darknesse <hi>unto the judgement of the great Day:</hi> and then the whole man must become the woful object, of the extremity and everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that fiercest and unquenchable wrath, which, like infinite rivers of brimstone, will feed upon his soule and flesh, without remedie, ease, or end.</p>
               <p>But that happy man, which in the short sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers day of his miserable and mortall life, gathers grace with an holy greedinesse, plies the noble trade of Christianity with resolution and vndaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse of spirit, against the boisterous current and

corruptions of the times; growes in godlinesse, GODS favour, and fruits of good life; purchases and preserves (though with the losse of all earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights) peace of conscience, one of the richest trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and rarest jewels that euer illightened and made lightsome the heart of man in this world: I say that man, though never so contemptible in the eyes of the worldly wise; though never so scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully trod upon and overslowne by the tyranny and swelling pride of those ambitious selfe-flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Giants, who, like mighty winds, when they have blustered a while, breathe out into naught, shall most certainly upon his dying-bed meet with a glorious troupe of blessed Angels, ready and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to guard and conduct his departing Soule into his <hi>Masters joy.</hi> His body shalbe preserved in the grave by the all-powerfull providence, as in a Cabinet of rest and sweetest sleepe, perfumed by the buriall of our blessed SAVIOVR, untill the <hi>glorious appearing of the great</hi> GOD. And then, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their joyfullest re-union, they shall both be filled, and shine thorow all eternity, with such glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and blisse, which in sweetnesse and excellency doth infinitely exceed the possibility of all humane or Angelicall<note n="*" place="margin">Quae lingua, vel quis intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus cape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the span of his transitory life after the waies of his owne heart: and how truly he is a sonne of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, who in the few and evill daies of short abode upon earth, treasures up grace and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall riches against the dreadfull winter night of death.</p>

There is no darknesse so desolate, no crosse so cutting, but the splendor of these is able to illighten, their sweetnesse to mollifie.</p>
               <p>So that the blessed counsell of CHRIST, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 19, 20. doth concurre with, and confirme this Point: <hi>Lay not up for your selves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt; and where theeves breake thorow and steale.

Where did that man dwell, or of what cloth was his coat made, that was ever comforted by his goods, greatnesse, or great men, in that last and sorest conflict? In his wrastlings with the accusations of conscience, terrours of death, and oppositions of hell? No, no: It is matter of a more heavenly metall, treasures of an higher temper, riches of a nobler nature, that must hold out, and helpe in the distresses of soule, in the anguish of conscience, in the houre of death, against the stings of sinne, wrath of GOD, and last Tribunall. Do you think that ever any glorified soule did gaze with delight upon the wedge of gold, that tramples under foot the Sun, and lookes All-mighty GOD in the face? No, no: It is the society of holy Angels, and blessed Saints, the sweet Communion with its dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Spouse, that unapproachable light which crownes GODS sacred Throne, the beauty and brightnesse of that most glorious Place, the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Body of the SONNE of GOD, the beatificall fruition of the Deity it selfe, the depth of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the like everlasting Fountaines of spirituall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7155:35"/>
ravishment and joy, which onely can feed and fill the restlesse and infinite appetite of that immortall Thing with fulnesse of contentment, and fresh pleasures, world without end.</p>
               <p>Thrice blessed and sweet then is the advice of our Lord and Master IESVS CHRIST, who would have us to turne the eye of our delight, and eagernesse of affection from the fading glosse, and painted glory of earthly treasures; wherein natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the worme of corruption and vanity ever breeds, and many times the worme of an evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science attends; the one of which eats out their heart when we expect an harvest; The other seizes upon the Soule in the time of sorrow, and sinks it into the lowest hell: And as Men of GOD, and Sonnes of Wisdome, to mount our thoughts, and raise our spirits, and bend our affections to <hi>things above;</hi> which are as farre from diminution and decay, as the Soule from death; and can be no more corrupted or shaken, than the Seat and Omnipotency of GOD surprised. For, besides that, they infinitely surpasse in eminency of worth and sweetnesse of pleasure, the comprehension of the largest heart, and expression of any Angels tongue; they also out-last the dayes of heaven, and run parallell with the life of GOD, and line of Eternity. As we see the Fountaine of all materiall light to powre out his beames, and shining abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly every day upon the world without weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, emptinesse, or end; so, and incomparably more doth joy and peace, glory and blisse, spring and plentifully flow every moment with fresh
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7155:36"/>
streames from the face of the <hi>Father of Lights</hi> upon all His holy ones in heaven, and that everlastingly. O blessed then shall we be upon our beds of death, if (following the counsell of our dearest LORD, who shed the most precious and warmest bloud in His heart to bring our soules out of hell) we treasure ap now in the meane time, heavenly hoards which will ever happily hold out, a stocke of grace, which never shrinks in the wetting, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides the triall of the spirit, and touch-stone of the Word in all times of danger, and Day of the LORD: even that accurate, circumspect, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise walking, pressed upon us by the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15.

So much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and bitterly opprest by the world; and yet, without which none of us shall ever see the face of GOD with comfort. If while it is called <hi>To Day,</hi> we make our peace with His heavenly Highnesse, by an humble continued exercise of repentance; by standing valiantly on His side; by holding an holy acquaintance at His mercifull Throne with a mighty importunity of prayer, and godly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation above; by ever offering up unto Him in the armes of our Faith (when he is angry) the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body of His owne crucified SONNE, never giving Him over, or any rest, untill He bepleased to register and enroll the remission of our sinnes in the Booke of Life, with the bloudy lines of CHRISTS Soule-saving sufferings, and golden
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7155:36"/>
characters of His owne eternall love. If now, before we appeare at the dreadfull Tribunall of the euer-living GOD, (and little know we whose turne is next) we make our friends in the Court of Heaven: the <hi>blessed Angels,</hi> in procuring their joy and love, by a visible constancy in the fruits, teares, and truth of a sound conversion. The <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of comfort</hi> by a ready and reverent entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His holy <hi>Motions</hi> and inspirations of grace: the <hi>Sonne and Heire</hi> of the King of glory, the Foundation and Fountaine of all our Blisse, in this world and the world to come: from whose meritorious bloud shed and blessed mediation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise all those flouds of mercy and favour, which refresh our Soules in this vale of teares; and also those unknown bottomlesse seas of pleasure, peace and all unspeakable delights, which will super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound, and overflow with new and fresh sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for ever and ever in the Paradise of GOD. Blessed are they, that ever they were borne, who have already got Him their Advocate at the right hand of His Father. For, besides many other glorious priviledges thereby, in all their exigents and extremities, they may be ever welcome to the <hi>Seat of mercy,</hi> and be sure to speed. If a man had a suit unto the King, it were a comfortable and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py thing to find a friend in Court. But if the Kings speciall and choisest Favourite; nay, His own only Son were his Intercessour; how confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent would he be to prevaile and prosper, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his opposites, and crowne his desires? Why then should any poore Christian be discomforted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7155:37"/>
and cast downe: nay, why should he not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily raised and ravished in spirit with much joyfull hope, and sweet assurance, when he throwes himselfe downe at the Throne of grace; sith the dearest Sonne of the eternall GOD, the Heire of heaven and earth, the Mediator of the great Covenant of endlesse salvation is his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate at the hand of His All-mighty Father in the most high and glorious Court of Heaven? Wherefore when an humbled soule, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling spirit is sore troubled, and almost turned backe from his purpose of prayer, and prostration at the foot of heavenly Majesty, by entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before hand a feeling apprehension of his owne abhorred vilenesse, and the holy purity of GODS all-seeing and searching eye, <hi>which cannot looke on iniquity;</hi> let this consideration comfort and breed confidence, that IESVS CHRIST the <hi>Son of</hi> GODS <hi>love</hi> doth sollicite and tender the suit, who out of His owne sense and sympathy of such like troubles and temptations, doth deale for us with a true, a naturall, and a sensible touch of compassionatenesse and mercy.

I have knowne some, the first occasion of whose conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, was, the observation of their stoutnesse and patience under oppressions and wrongs, whom they have purposely persecuted with extremest malice and hate. So blessed many times is the brave, resolute, and undaunted behaviour of GODS people in the time of triall, and amidst their forest sufferings, that it breeds in the hearts of beholders, thoughts even of admiration and love, nay a desire of imitation, and turning on the other side. When they represent to the eye of the world their ability to passe thorow the raging flames of fiery tongues untouched, to possesse their soules in peace, amidst scorpions, thornes, and rebels, to passe by basest indignities from basest men without wound or passion, to hold up their heads above water in the most boisterous tempests, and deepest seas of danger, to triumph over all adversary power in the evill day; I say, by GODS blessing, this may make many come in and glorifie GOD, marvelling and enquiring,

swift tide of mans life, after it once turneth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth, ever runneth with a perpetuall ebbe and falling streame, but never floweth againe: Our leafe once fallen, springeth no more; neither doth the Sun or the Summer beautifie us againe with the garments of new leaves and flowers, or ever after revive or renew us with freshnesse of youth, and former strength. Not onely <hi>Salomon</hi> (<hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.) makes us in this respect more miserable than the Sun and other soule-lesse creatures; but even the Poet also by the light of naturall reason (whom I urge onely to make Christians, mindlesse of their owne mortality, athamed, who have thoughts of heaven and earth, as though eternity were upon earth, and time onely in heaven) tels us that, <hi>Soles occidere &amp; redire possunt:</hi> Thus in English;</p>

               </lg>
               <p>Which we must onely understand of returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more to life and light in this world. Nay, in a word, lay thy selfe loaden with the utmost of all earthly excellencies and felicities in the one scale of the ballance, and vanity in the other, and vanity will weigh thee downe. Take heed therefore of trusting to the world in the meane time, lest it torture thee extremely in the time of trouble.</p>
               <p>3. Take heed of weakening in the meane time, and unnecessarily over-wearying thy spirit:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:7155:51"/>1. By carking fore-thought of future evils, which forty to one may never fall out. Many men I am perswaded, (such is the naturall vanity of our minds) do more vexe themselves with feare and fore-conceipt of imaginary evils, which never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall; then they have just cause, to take on and trouble their hearts for all other true, reall, actuall troubles, which fall upon them. Thus many times do men torture themselves vainly with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate feare of forreine invasion, home-bred confusion, change of religion, the fiery triall, burning at a stake, distraction of mind, surprize by the Plague, Small Poxe, Purples, Spotted Fever, distresse and going backward in their outward state, losse of some child they love best, destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their goods by fire, robbery, ship-wracke, the frownes of greatnesse, hurt and revenge from those that hate them, hardnesse of heart, failing of their faith, spirituall desertion, overthrow by temptation, despaire of GODS mercies, sudden death, discomfortable cariage in their last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the <hi>king of feare</hi> himselfe; what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of their children, when they are gone, &amp;c. By these and millions moe of such causelesse and carking fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>imaginations, the very flower and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of mens spirits may be much emasculated, and wasted wofully. A godly care to prevent them by repentance and prayer; and a carefull preparation by mortifying meditations, and Christian magnanimity to beare them patiently, if we be put unto it, is commendable and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but in the meane time to unspirit and mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7155:52"/>
our selves with much distrustfull misery and needlesse torture about them, to our hindrance, distraction and discomfort in any businesses of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our callings, or any waies, unchearefull walking; by slavish pre-conceipts to double and multiply their stings, and to suffer them so often before they seize upon us, is both un-noble and un-necessary: most unworthy the morall resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a meere naturall man, and the generous spirit of an honest Heathen; much more the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible fortitude of any of CHRISTS favourites, and heires of heaven.</p>
               <p>Or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>2. Selfe-created crosses, that I may so call them. For so it often is, that many maried cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, governours of families (to instance there) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the world at will (as they say) and wanting nothing that heart can wish from GODS hand for outward things: and yet (I know not how) by reason of passion, covetousnesse, pride, waiward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, frowardnesse, or something, they mutually embitter their lives one unto another with much uncomfortablenesse, discontentment and jarring. I would advise all such (and there are many and many such abroad in the world) punctually and impartially to examine their consciences; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such secret sinnes as these, of which they take no notice, may not be the causes of it.</p>
               <p>1. Matching, as being not mooved principally and predominantly with portion, parentage, perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, beauty, lust, riches, lands, slattery, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, greatnesse of family, forced perswasions, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7155:52"/>
covetous importunity, or some base and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellgious by-respect and gracelesse ground. This the Apostle calleth <hi>marrying in the</hi> LORD: that is, for no by respect, but in the feare of GOD, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39. Without which all matches are miserable, though they should be made up with hoards of wealth and heapes of gold as high as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, crowned with honours transcendent to the starres. The basenesse, folly and iniquity of these times is not more visible and eminent in any thing, than in making, or rather marring of marriages. How often may we see by ordinary observation a little golden glue to joyne fast in the dearest bonds, pearles and clay? And silken fooles to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie away sufficiencies above their worthlesse weight in richest jewels? The world is stark mad in this Point. But they are rightly served; noble miseries and golden fetters are fit enough for such couples. For from this bitter root of a covetous, carnall, ambitious, or any wayes unconscionable choice, springs a world of misery and mischiefe; overthrow and ruine of great houses, scandalous divorces, unlawfull separations, dishonour, distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, jealousies, adulteries, bastardies, braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, mutuall exprobration of each others infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, deformity, portion, parentage, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cutting and netling matter of discontent; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full disorders in families, ill education of children, &amp;c. And, without repentance, after a few and wretched dayes tediously worne out with much irksomnesse and hearts-breake, lying together e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingly in the lake of fire, there banning each
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7155:53"/>
other with much desperate horrour, and many bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter despairefull gnashings of teeth, that ever they entered into that estate.</p>
               <p>2. Predominancy of carnall love. Which may be justly punished with many fits of frowardnesse and falling out, from such small occasions and light grounds; that the Parties may well perceive, that the correcting hand of GOD is in it leading them thereby to the sight and notice, to remorse and reformation of the brutish sensuality and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of their matrimoniall affection; which should ever be rectified by reason, and spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd with grace. Mariage is rather a fellowship of dearest amity, then disordered love. And love and amity are as different as the burning sicke heat of a fever from the naturall kindly heat of a healthfull body.</p>
               <p>3. Immodest or immoderate abuse of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Which, though it lie without the walk of humane lawes, yet divine justice doth many times deservedly chastise it with variety of visitations upon themselves, families, outward state, good name: with miscariages, barrennesse, bad chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, giving them over to unnecessary distempers and strangenesse in their cariage one unto another, and other such like discomforts and crosses. Which (though they may also befall GODS chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for other ends, yet) let all guilty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in such cases conceive, that they fall upon them for such secret sensuall exorbitancies and excesse.</p>
               <p>4. Want of a comfortable communion in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7155:53"/>
prayer, godly conference, mutuall communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their spirituall estate, and how they stand to GOD-ward, daies of humiliation, helping one another towards heaven, and that joyfull fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of most certaine meeting together in the ever lasting mansions of glory, joy and blisse above. Such divine fellowship would incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly sweeten that dearest indissoluble knot, and make that state a very earthly Paradise to those few black Swannes, that love so sweetly and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously together.</p>
               <p>5. Ignorance, or negligence in the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and practising both of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and severall duties pertinent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that estate. In all other Arts, Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Trades of life, the Practitioners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and endeavour to be ready in, and ruled by the precepts and directions thereof: but as concerning this great mysterie of managing the mariage-state with wisdome, conscience and comfort, the most are as ignorant in those Treatises which teach their Duties (of which there are many excellent ones extant) as they are basely insolent in clownish frowardnesse or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tyranny, to create a great deale of needlesse discontent and misery, both to themselves and their yoke-fellowes.</p>
               <p>4. Helpe also we may have for the Point in hand, even from the wiser Heathen. Who out of the very light of nature and grounds of reason, did learne and labour to mollifie and asswage the stinging fore-thoughts of ills to come;

Spirituall joy is many times much enlarged in times of tribulation: But the heart of the wicked is sorrowfull in laughter, and troubled with melancholy amidst their greatest mirth. 7. Spirituall joy is ordinarily most free, full, and at the highest in solitarinesse, soliloquies, and the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7155:59"/>
most retired exercises of the soule: but carnall joy and want of company are for the most part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible. And it is kept in that poore little dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life it hath, by good-fellowship, and sensuall imployments. 8. Carnall joy ever ends in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse, spirituall in blessednesse. As the rivers of fresh water run their course with an hasty current to fall into the salt Sea; so the Posting Sun of all worldly pleasures after a short gleame, and vaine glistering, sets in the Ocean of endlesse sorrow.</p>

Fourthly, aske them, How they prize the object they apprehend imaginarily; for it is no better: and it is but thus: If you were able to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them of wallowing in all worldly pleasures with constant health, and immortality upon earth: they would with all their hearts, part with all their hope of heaven hereafter: For they are yet but carnall, though selfe-confident.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7155:64"/>
ravish the heart of the true Believer; that well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, in cold bloud, and out of temptation, he holds all the corporall felicities of ten thousand worlds, even world without end, in comparison of them, but as drosse, and dung, and dust in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. Our part in the person of CHRIST, with the purchases of His dearest bloud, and possession of the Deity blessed for ever by His meanes, do more than infinitely transcend the utmost of all earthly contentments, rais'd above the highest possibility, by the most inventive and strongest i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, and to be enjoyed thorow a thousand eternities.</p>

                     </note> Fathers, that the torments and miseries of many hels, come farre short, are nothing, to the shutting out everlastingly from the kingdome heaven, and unhappy banishment from the beatificall vision of the most soveraigne, onely, and chiefest Good, the thrice-glorious <hi>Iehovah,</hi> blessed for ever. For, by how much the degrees of infinite good and happinesse in GOD, exceed the finite wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and misery of men: by so much greater is the sorrow and griefe, (being rightly conceived) for the losse of that, than for the sense of this. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure then thy selfe before-hand, though thou little thinke so in the meane time, the losse but of the least raye of that Sun-like resplendent Body, we should have in heaven; but of a taste of those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-flowing rivers of pleasure, and un-utterable blisse of that happy soule which should dwell in such a Body; but of one foot-breadth of the pavement of the Empyrean Heaven, to which the Starry Firmament is but a Porch, or out-house; but one houres company with all the crowned Saints, and glorious inhabitants of that happy Place; but of one glaunce upon the glorified Body of IESVS CHRIST; but of one glimpse of that unapproachable Light, and <hi>Iehovahs</hi> face in glory;

I say, the losse but of any one of these would be a far dearer and more unvaluable losse, than that of ten thousand worlds, were they all compos'd of purest gold, and brim-full with richest jewels. What will it be then (think you) to loose all these, nay, the full and absolute fruition of all heavenly excellencies, beauties, glories, pleasures and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and that eternally: I know full well that carnall conceipts and worldly-wise men will wonder at this; For having no sight but by sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eyes, they cannot possibly apprehend, or will by any meanes acknowledge any such thing. Eagle-ey'd they are, and sharpe-sighted enough into things of earth; yet blinder than a mole (as they say) in beholding any spirituall or celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all beauty. But had we but the eyes of <hi>Austin, Basill, Chrysostome,</hi> and some other holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (and why should not ours be clearer and brighter, considering the greater splendour and illustriousnesse of divine knowledge in these times?) we should easily confesse that the farre greatest, and (indeed) most unconceiveable griefe would be, to be severed for ever from the highest and supreme Good: And that a thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand rentings of the soule from the body, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely lesse than one of the soule from GOD. <hi>Nicostratus</hi> in <hi>Aelian,</hi> himselfe being a cunning ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisan, finding a curious peece of worke, and being wondred at by one, and ask'd, what pleasure he could take, to stand as he did, still gazing on the picture, answered: Hadst thou mine eyes, my friend, thou wouldest not wonder, but rather be

                  <p>Mans heart can imagine miraculous admirabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, rarest peeces, worlds of comforts and strange felicities. In conceipt it can convert all the stones upon earth into pearles, every grasse pile into an unvaluable jewell, the dust into silver,

the sea into liquid gold, the aire into crystall. It can clothe the earth with farre more beauty and sweetnesse, than ever the Sun saw it. It can make every Starre a Sun, and all those Suns ten thousand times bigger and brighter than it is, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And yet the height and happinesse of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call wisdome doth farre surpasse the utmost which the eare, eye, or heart of man hath heard, seene, or can possibly apprehend.

In respect of the beauty and brightnesse whereof, all sydereall light is but a darksome mote, and blackest mid-night. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 2.</p>
                  <p>3. Adde hereunto the incredible and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble splendour of many millions of glorified Saints, whose bodies also will out-shine the Sun.

O what fooles are they, who deprive themselves willingly of this endlesse glory for a few stinking lusts! O what mad men are they, who bereave themselves of a roome in this Citie of Pearle, for a few carnall pleasures!

                  <p>I do not here curiously enquire with the Schoole-men; whether the glory of the body doth spring originally out of the blessednesse and beautifull excellency of the soule, and so redounds upon the body, by a continued constant influence, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> thinks. Or, (which I rather follow) that those excellent endowments and heavenly splendours are originally and dispositively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by GODS hand in the reformed body, onely perfected and actuated (as it were) by the glorious soule, as <hi>Bonaventure</hi> supposeth.

                  <p>And here by your good leaves, I will be bold to make benefit of the instant occasion, because it is very seasonably coincident with the Point. And presse from that the practice of this last mortifying motive. These artificiall Formes of sadnesse, and complementall representations of sorrow in blacks and mourning weeds, are nothing for my purpose: neither do I desire to stirre up or renew in any man thoughts of heavinesse, or griefe of heart, which he might conceive and nourish by reason of some particular interest in the bounty, love, person, and worthy parts of the departed: many times men are too forward and overflowing in those tender offices, and last demonstrations of natural affection. And therfore my counsel in such cases is; that we would shew our selves Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and by the sacred rules of Religion ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that unseasonablenesse and excesse, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times with a fruitlesse torture doth tyrannise over the hopelesse hearts of meere naturall men.</p>
                  <p>The Point that I would principally presse, and perswade unto, is a Christian, and compassionate taking to heart, the publike losse, that every one of us may upon that occasion be truly humbled in himselfe, and bettered in his owne soule. And I tell you true, especially in these times, this losse is great.</p>
                  <p>He was a revexend and learned Iudge, a Prince,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7155:106"/>
and a great Man in Israel: nay a God upon earth,<note place="margin">All I say, is cuber from my owne certaine knowledge; or concurrent testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. I would not speake a word, which I think not in my conscience to be true, to be heire of his possessions. It may be affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may make me deliver things something passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and more unto the life.</note> for so are Iudges stiled by the Spirit of GOD, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 6. Though he be departed this life like a man, and fallen as one of the Princes.</p>
                  <p>But these are nothing; they are but bare titles, in respect of any true worth.</p>
                  <p>He was really remarkable, and renowned for very speciall judiciary endowments, and sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and those aided and attended with many worthy additions of morality, and subordinate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. As first,</p>
                  <p>1. Such calmnesse in his affections, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his passions (as I never saw) even in his ordinary cariage. He might have been a mirrour (me thinks) in this point even amongst the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actest Moralists. And they say, that appeared most eminently in his publike passages and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of justice. And how needfull a vertue this is to a Iudiciall Place, those may best conceive, who either feele, or but consider what a cruell and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable thing it is for an ingenuous man to stand before a Iudge, who is prejudicately and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately transported with anger, malice, or hatred against the party to be sentenced.</p>
                  <p>2. Patience to heare the basest, both parties, all they could say. And unwillingnesse to lend his eare to the one, without the others presence.</p>
                  <p>3. A great and happy memory.</p>
                  <p>4. Singular sagacity in searching and diving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the secretest and utmost circumstances (so farre as was possible) of the causes that came before him, that he might give the more righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:7155:107"/>5. A marvellous tendernesse, and pitifull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acttnesse in his inquisitions after bloud. Holding, on the one side, the life of a man very precious: and yet, on the other side, perswaded of the truth and terrour of that place, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 33. <hi>For bloud, that defileth the land, and the land cannot be cleansed of the bloud that is shed therein, but by the bloud of him that shed it.</hi> But yet all these, whatsoever you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, in my conceipt had not beene much worth, though good in their owne nature; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (to tell you true) should I have so much as nam'd them, had they not been aided, (as it were) and managed with three other most noble and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary vertues, especially in these times, which actuated them (as it were) and gave them their life and lustre.</p>
                  <p>1. A love to integrity, the right and truth in all his judiciall courses, which (for any thing I know, or could ever heare) no man living upon just ground can or will contradict.</p>
                  <p>2. With a constant and resolute heart-rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst bribery and corruption; the cursed bane of all goodnesse, honesty, and good conscience, wheresoe'er it comes. And to this, that high place he worthily held about the Prince, can give royall attestation: where he qualified fees to his owne losse; and protested his resolution, and all possible opposition to all offers for offices, with this reason: he would have them come in cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed, that they might deale honestly in their places. And his owne followers, to whom he gave a charge at his first entrance to a judiciall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7155:107"/>
place, that they should not meddle, nor make any motions to him, that he might be secur'd from all appearance of corruption. And, as I am credibly inform'd, his ordinary reading of great letters, and rejection of gratuities after judgement given.</p>
                  <p>3. With a noble and unshaken resolution, and mighty opposition of Popery: and that without respect or feare of any greatnesse, as we have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstration. Now of this we need no further testimony (though there be very pregnant and plentifull besides) than the present triumph of the Papists; and barbarous insultations of that bloudy and murdrous generation. And especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in yonder Country of Lancashire, and those Northerne Parts; where he shooke the pillars of Popery more valiantly and succesfully, than any these many yeares. Officers in those Parts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, that in his two or three yeares, he convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, confin'd, and conform'd moe Papists than were in twenty yeares before. And that last charge he gave at <hi>Lancaster</hi> in his last Circuit but one, for I meddle not with the last of all, for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learning, earnestnesse and excellency against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, prophanenesse, non-residency, and other corruptions of the times, and for the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heartning and encouraging all good men and godly Ministers was such, that I am perswaded, it wilbe remembred with dearenesse and love, while any honest man that heard it or heard of it, is alive in those Parts. To go no further then: and this I now say, I speake of him as he was growne in his latter time; and out of hope he would have
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7155:108"/>
continued: and I speake it also in compassion of mine owne countrey; which I know by too good experience how pitifully it lies bleeding under the insolency of Papists, and multitude of Priests: and then I say, the redemption of the life of such a Iudge, in such times as we live, for the good of such a country, if we go no further, if that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted with GODS pleasure, had beene worth a Kings ransome.</p>
                  <p>I lay these things thus together upon purpose to aggravate the losse, that a compassionate consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the greatnesse thereof in those respects I have told you, may be as powerfull in begetting a godly and profitable sorrow and taking it to heart in all truly religious and loyall hearts: as I know rejoycing in his fall will create in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent spirits of the enemies to GOD and the King, (I meane the Papists) barbarous insultations and triumph. I am perswaded, if we get as much humiliation out of the sense of a true losse, as the Papists hardning and obduration by apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their imaginary gaine, we shall make a good use of his death. I am a little more earnest, because I perceive the Papists begin already to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate and slander.</p>
                  <p>Here is yet another Point of profitable conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the present occasion. When any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man in a State, especially who takes a faithfull discharge of his place, and the publike good to heart, is cut off by the hand of GOD; it is in a Christian jealousie, and out of spirituall wisdome to be holden as a presage of some more fearefull
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7155:108"/>
generall judgement to succeed. I have my ground, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. And therefore my counsell is, and in the present case for one: when any good Patriote which in some high place like a strong Pillar opposes the corruptions and Popery of the times: or any faithfull Pastor, which by his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (like a <hi>Moses</hi>) stands in the gap against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of GOD, is taken away; that we take it to heart, as a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>mento,</hi> to make our selves rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against an evill day. And to tell you my mind, I am much afraid some heavy thing is preparing for us, our sinnes are growne unto such a height. I am no Prophet, nor the sonne of a Prophet; yet out of a comparative contemplation of GODS proceeding with His owne people in all former ages, I cannot but concurre with the judgement of a great Doctor delivered in an high place: The<note place="margin">
                        <hi>White,</hi> pag. 80. at Spittle.</note> sinnes of this Land are come to that elevation, that there is scarce left any roome for the mercy of GOD to helpe us. They are even full ripe for His revenging Hand. To his foure reasons I add two more: his are taken, 1. From the greatnesse and crying of the sinnes, which are very horrible; Atheisme, whoredome, Sodomy, bloud-shed, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, sayes he; I add pride, drunkennesse, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, &amp;c. 2. From the generality of them. All sorts are wrapt in them. 3. From their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: with brazen browes, and whorish fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads they out-face the Sun. 4. From their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency of admonition and reformation: they grow so upon us, that all the Pulpits in ENGLAND cannot beat them downe. Adda 5<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:7155:109"/>
36. 16. And a 6<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. from <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi> I meane the dropping away of many worthy men; and few take it to heart, or consider that they are taken away from the evill to come. We have lost many a godly man within this few yeares. The Princes Court was not many yeares since dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rob'd and bereft of one of the noblest men that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trod upon English mould, besides other noble ornaments, his eminency of grace made him so. For, Christian Nobility is best and truest, where GOD Himselfe is top of the kin, and Religion the root; in regard whereof all the rest (I meane that of riches, birth, learning or morality) are but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and shapes of noblenesse. And the other yeare, a very worthy Doctor, and triumphant Champion against the Giants of <hi>Rome.</hi> Against whom they have since sent out an illiterate libell, cal'd, White dy'd Black; fit for the foule and black mouthes of such railing <hi>Rabshekaes.</hi> And now of late, to say no more, of a Chancellour of rare and remarkable integrity in his Place. I have not yet done, and yet the time is done: onely a word or two therefore, and so I'le make an end.</p>
                  <p>And yet let no man thinke, that I am come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Either to smooth and mollifie any faults or frailties; any falls or infirmities; any personall sinnes or imperfections that might be in this great Man. I dare not go about to cover them; that's not my office; I leave that to the precious bloud of the Son of GOD, and tender-hearted mercies of our gracious Father. I would rather in this point
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7155:109"/>
advise great men to walke warily. For, their greatnesse makes their sinnes greater, and their mightinesse will make them mightily tormented, except they stand constantly on GODS side. Height of Place ever adds two wings unto sinne: Example and Scandall; whereby it soares higher, and flies much further. If the Sun be ecclips'd and obscur'd; a thousand eyes gaze upon it: a lesser Starre may be darkned, and no man take notice.</item>
                     <item>2. Or to fasten upon him any false praises in a flattering funerall Panegyrick. I dare not dawbe for a world of gold. Himselfe abhor'd that. And not long before his last sicknesse complain'd much against slattery, as a grievous iniquity of the times.</item>
                     <item>3. Or to make a solemne and formall narration of all his noble commendable parts. When I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke this businesse first, I studied onely, and bethought my selfe, how I might speake most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, and make the best use of the present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to my living Auditors. And had I not found pregnant matter for that purpose, I had not beene here this day. And therefore for conclusion, and as the last and best service I can now do unto him, to whom I owed as much as any man alive: I will labour from the occasion to work some heavenly good (if GOD so please) upon the hearts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented here this day as a selected and choice num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his worthiest and dearest friends.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7155:110"/>
his, and onely those which I conceive may be most seasonable and suitable to the exigency of my Auditory. And I must also crave the aid of your loves unto him, and those softned thoughts of mortality which are wont to attend these times; that I may conveigh and commend them to your liking, and practise with more successe and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er impression.</item>

                  <p>And the first I shall commend unto you, is,</p>

                     <item>1. His singular integrity and honorable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in disposing those Ecclesiasticall Livings he had in his power. And in this Point I my selfe can say more than any, who tasted deepliest of his worthy dealing this way. When I never sought after, as it is famously knowne, nor thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any such thing, he sent for me, and bestowed that which I presently enjoy most freely. Which, though every Patron ought proportionably to do, yet the horrible corruptions abroad in the world in such cases do (as it were) by a kind of Antiperistasis make a duty a transcendent vertue. And this was not all. Though incrochments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church be like the breaches of the sea; a thousand to one never returne: yet did he restore to a farthing all that which had a long time beene detain'd from the Church; and parted with it most freely; though he had as much wit and power as any other to have continued it so, if he had pleas'd. And I said Ecclesiasticall Livings, though I instance but in one; because I partly knew his purpose for the rest. For, he gave me himselfe this message to as worthy and reverend a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7155:110"/>
man, as I know unprefer'd in this Land; that if he would come unto him, he would give him the first that fell; and for no other reason in the world, but because he heard he was a reverend and worthy man. Now lay these things to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the times, wherein there is such sinfull and Simoniacall packing together, compacting, secret covenanting with the party or friends for present money, or after-gratifications: some part of the tithes, or his owne must be reserv'd to the Patron; or he must be the Farmer at his owne price; or pin a wife upon the sleeve of the parson, as they contemptuously speake, (a base also and unworthy respect) or the like such wretched combinations to helpe one another towards hell: my disac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance must excuse my ignorance in the termes: and then tell me if this was not a noble part in him worthy the imitation of the best. I am perswaded in this Point, he might be a patterne not only to all here present whom it might concerne, (though I looke upon the faces of some who have dealt also very nobly this way) but to all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons in ENGLAND. Be pleas'd then, you that lov'd him to tread in his steps herein; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because your unconscionablenesse in so high and important a point for the glory of GOD, and the good of the Church, may not only bring upon your owne heads, your houses and posterity, the curse of GOD in the meane time: but also a company of poore soules cast away by reason of your corruption, against you at that last and great day: who will then cry out upon you before the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7155:111"/>
face of GOD, Angels, and men; that you were the men who for a little bloudy gaine put upon them an ignorant, idle, dissolute, non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> resident, or some way unfaithfull Minister; (For, it is too common, that those who enter corruptly, deale unconscionably in their places) whereby they must now perish everlastingly; whereas if you had been honest and uncorrupt, there had beene hope they might have liv'd in the endlesse joyes of heaven. And what a vexing cry in the eares of all sacrilegious Church-robbers will that be of a damned wretch in hell; when he shall complaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingly, that his soule had been sav'd, if such a man had not been Symoniacall.</item>
                     <item>2. His forbearing travell upon the Sabbath in his Circuit. Whereby he wan a great deale of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his name over all this Kingdome; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the same with others of his owne reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend ranke; and by his example (as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd) wan much encouragement, increase and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to religion in those Countries thorow which he past. I would I might so much prevaile with you, as that upon this occasion you would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take nearer to heart a more holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly spending of the LORDS Day. Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in forbearing sin, the workes of your calling, idlenesse, vaine sports; this is but onely flying e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and privative good: but also to ply with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and reverence all GODS holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; prayer, reading, singing of Psalmes publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and privately; the Word preached specially, conference, meditation, and the like: and to feed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7155:111"/>
and satisfie your prepared and hungry soules with all that sweetnesse, comfort, and spirituall strength; which they are wont to conveigh into humble hearts upon GODS holy Day; this also is doing of good and positive piety. For, a thousand to one, a constant keeper of the Sabbath is sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted towards GOD: and as great odds, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sabbath breaker (howsoever he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his owne heart) is in truth and triall a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the power of grace, and life of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</item>
                     <item>3. His patient yeelding, and submission to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate admonition. A vertue, ordinarily as farre out with great men, as flattery is familiar. Yet in him so as I tell you. Something there was, to which his private affection was very much endear'd; and his reputation thereabout in the respect of the world was also entangled in some more publike engagement. And yet when I in zeale and love to his soule and salvation, prest upon him in private as a Minister of GOD, and in the humblest manner I could, tendering my reasons against his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; after he had well thought upon't, it never went further, all was dasht for ever. Yet let me tell you, he had formerly given me encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereunto; intreating me once in private, to deale plainly with him. And now I am griev'd at heart, I did not more in this kind. Now I would to GOD, you would imitate him in this also; especially you that are great ones. Alas! You'le give the Physitian leave to tell you the diseases of your body: the Lawyer to shew you any flaw
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7155:112"/>
that is in your state: your Horse-keeper to tell you the surfets of your horse: nay, your Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the surrances of your dogs: and shall onely the Minister of GOD not tell you your soules are bleeding to everlasting death? Now GOD forbid.</item>
                     <item>4. His taking his high place to heart. I meane his extraordinary industry and indefatigablenesse in his judiciary imployments. His painefulnesse this way was wonderfull even after his last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse had seaz'd upon him. If I should report un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the particulars from eye-witnesses, you would marvell. And I rather name and commend this unto you, because the contrary is cause of great misery in a Common-wealth. Oh it is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, when men mount into high roomes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a bravery, and vanity, and desire to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or'd above others; or follow the execution of their places, and administration of justice, onely as a Trade, with an unquenchable and unconscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thirst of gaine; which justifies the common resemblance of the Courts of Iustice to the Bush; whereunto, while the sheepe flies for defence in weather, he is sure to lose part of his fleece: when cunning heads hunt after greatnesse and promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, purposely to execute the lusts of their owne hearts, and attaine their owne ends. Oh! this is the curse and cut-throat of worthy States; the bane and breake-necke of all honest government. Formalities of justice without a reall care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to search the truth, and deale uprightly, do but serve to smother innocency and right: and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7155:112"/>
that which was necessarily ordain'd for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, is through shamefull abuse made the cause of common misery. I would all the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in the Country were my hearers in this Point; I would hence intreat them with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse and contention of Spirit, as they love ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther GOD or their Country; that they would with all noblenesse of a free spirit, and clearenesse of a good conscience, take their Places of Iustice to heart; be active, conscionable, resolute; not onely formall and cyphers; hunters after praise and plausiblenesse; that they would abominate even all appearance of bribery and partiality to the pit of hell: that they would not be angry with us when we presse and perswade them to round courses against the Papists, and dejection of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses; upon which point His royall Majesty, and the worthy Iudges so much beat; and when all's said, are the sinkes and sources of all villany, &amp;c. otherwise, howsoever they may please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the common applause: it were better the Common-wealth had never knowne them.</item>
                     <item>5. His resolutenesse against rising by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and bribery. Whereupon (as I have heard) when he was first presented to that place of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour about the Prince, it pleased our gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne to stile him the Iudge which would give no money. A blessed thing it were, were this heart in all. Then should we not have vines, olive trees, and figge trees wither away in obscurity, and brambles brave it abroad in the world. We
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7155:113"/>
should not have servants by insinuation and bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clime on Horse-backe, when Princes like ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants walke upon the ground. And this worthy Part in Him, was a very convenient Companion, and necessary Consequent as that was of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

The illumination of Nature taught the Heathens so, and therefore they condemne it by a law <hi>de ambitu.</hi> Hunting after one hie roome even morally is most unworthy a Man of honour and worth, and He cannot better expresse His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency, and weakenesse of Spirit, who is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with an impotent and impatient Humour this way. But now if to this ambitious basenesse there be an addition of bribery, it makes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great deale more vile, and dishonourable. Of this hatefull Merchandizing, besides other infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and iniquities, which mingle with it, it is commonly said, That He which liueth in grosse, selleth by retaile. And therefore if a Man would continue truly Noble, and Worthy, comfortable in His conscience, and faithfull in His Place, if He be advanc't, let him either rise fairely, or els thanke GOD, and be content with His present station.</item>
                     <item>6. An easinesse of accesse, affablenesse of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: A faire, loving, kind deportment towards all. I never saw a Man of such worth and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse looke more mildly upon a meane Man in my life. And yet with so grave a presence, that neither the authority of his Person, nor due attributions

                     <item>7. His happinesse in having religious Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Follow Him also in this. He tasted the fruit of it in his last extremities. For being cast by Gods Providence upon that Place in the Country where He had not such meanes, and Opportunities for those last comfortable Spirituall Assistances, which a dying Man would desire; They were both able, and did pray with Him to the Occasion, and present necessities, where with He seemed to be

And he so farre acquaints them with the counsell of GOD in the point: that he gives them to understand that upon the matter, whereas <hi>the noble, the mighty, and wise after the flesh,</hi> with all the bravery and selfe-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vanish and perish: Meaner men of lower ranke, and more contemptible are converted.

But the foolish, and weake things of the world carrie all away in matter of salvation, and entertainement of CHRIST. He renders two Reasons in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses following: 1.

               <p>Heere by the way from our Sauiours words wee may extract a soveraigne Antidote against those temptations, and discontented reasonings which are wont to arise in our hearts sometimes, when we see those great ones of the world, who looke so big, and carrie their heads so high, not onely to carrie all before them, to wallow, and tumble themselves with all bravery and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause in the glory, wealth, and pleasure of the world, to swimme downe the current of the times with full saile, and prosperous winde, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times against the secret murmure, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blasts even of their own Consciences. In a word, in these worst times to have what they list, and do what they will: but also lay about them with the fist of wickednesse, and scourge of tongues, to trample if it were possible the lambes of CHRIST even into the dust, with the feete of malice and pride, by a plausible tyranny, and aide of the times iniquity to keepe them downe still, and still in disgrace: hunting them continually with cruelty and hate like a Partridge in the mountaines, as the Pharisees did CHRIST: I say when we see this, let us never be troubled and take offence: let us never be grieved or grow dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content or out of heart.

Upon their returne, these great men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in counsell against him; like so many morning Wolves thirsting eagerly for his bloud, calls hastily, and impatiently unto them, before their officers could say any thing: <hi>Why have yee not brought him?</hi> They doe not examine them about his doctrine, or inquire whether he be guilty or no: but like unjust, and tyrannicall wretches they labour to lay hold upon him, though most innocent, to stop his mouth, and make him sure. <hi>But the Officers answered: Never man spake like this man.</hi> Whereupon the spirit of prophane malice being yet further enraged in them, they reply: <hi>Are yee also deceived?</hi> What?

               <p>And thus it is in all ages of the Church: There is a Lecture I will suppose; To which many of the meaner sort especially, resort for spirituall foode, as to the Market for corporall. Some of which happily wrought upon by the saving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of that Ministery, begins to blesse GOD for the benefit, and magnifie his mercy for such meanes: but some By-standers, like pestilent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites interpose: yea but which of the great men of the Countrey come to it, when doe you see any of the Nobles, Knights, or Gentlemen there? No, alas! They are afraid of hearing of their sins, being made Melancholicke, and to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented before their time: and therfore they most wretchedly <hi>neglect so great salvation,</hi> forsake their owne mercies, and judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bowling-greenes, gaming-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, horse-races, hunting-matches: Their curs, and their Kites: their cock-pits, and their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, or something doe too often eate up and devoure that blessed fat, and marrow of time, those golden, and goodly opportunities, which GOD in great mercy affords them in the Ministry, to make their peace with him before they goe into the pit, and bee seene no more. For one houre whereof, to heare but one Sermon after the irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable day of visitation is past and expired, they

Others (as you may see in that place) were industriously busie in building up the wals, and repairing the holy City, for the wonted worship and service of their GOD, but the Nobles would do just nothing. And thus it hath beene in all times, and is just so in our dayes. Meane men many times contribute very liberally, and farre above their ability to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement and maintenance of a profitable and powerfull Ministery: but the rich, worldly-wise, and gentlemen thereabouts, will not part with a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7155:119"/>
penny for any such holy purpose. Such great men as these will by no meanes put their neckes, their power, and their purses to any such blessed worke of the LORD: though it be for the erecting of the Kingdome of IESVS CHRIST amongst them: for the illumination and refreshing of a darke and barren place with the light of the Gospell, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life, where both their owne soules, and many more about them are starving and bleeding to eternall death for want of heavenly food and ministeriall helpe. Nay, too many of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Churches Patrimony, will neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it to the proper native use and end: nor (which is very lamentable) part with a little porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a large revenew in that kind towards a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency. Before you receive encouragement to go on in this course with comfort, I pray you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us (from your partakers, if there be any such) Answers to those many learned Treatises extant upon this argument, and (for any thing I know) ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unanswered: especially, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bernards,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Sclaters,</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fields.</hi> I know well some excellent spirits of late meerely out of the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous freenesse of their truly noble dispositions, to their great honour, and adorning profession, have given backe to the Church for ever (I meane no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about buying in Impropriations, one of the most glorious works in that kinde (for any thing I know) that ever was undertaken in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) diverse Church-livings, some an hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> some sixe or seven score, some threescore, some one; so many as amount to the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7155:119"/>
value of above seven hundred pounds yearely. But I must tell you also, they are onely such as you mis-call Puritan-gentlemen (for I neither heare nor know of any other that stirs this way) and how few such are to be found in a Countrey, every eye spiritually illightened may clearely see, and heartily bewaile. For, I meane none but such as are (in true search and censure) GODS best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the Kings best subjects.</p>
               <p>I come in a second place to make the point ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare yet further by reasons. And first, such as are peculiar to the severall sorts of greatnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> (once for all) I understand such <hi>secundum mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, secundum bominem, secundum carnem, according to the world, according to man, according to the flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And first for excellency of learning understood still after the flesh, implyed also by the Apostle in this place: as appeares by the former words: <hi>Where is the Scribe? Where is the Disputer of this world?</hi> Where are the learned Rabbins of the Iewes? Where are the profound Philosophers of the Gentiles? Let us take notice that learning of it selfe is a very lovely and illustrious thing, which made <hi>Aeneas Silvius</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> Duke of Austria, say, <hi>If the face</hi> even <hi>of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning could be seene, it is fairer and more beautifull than the morning or the evening-starre.</hi> But notwithstanding bent the wrong way, and spent upon private and pernicious ends, it becomes the fowlest fiend the Devill hath upon earth, and his<note place="margin">Degeneratio optimi pessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> mightiest agent to do a world of mischiefe. No corruption is worse than of that which is best
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7155:120"/>
mis-imployed: it is of wofull consequence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to its native worth. And the longer and more prosperously it is imployed as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all, and in the service of Satan ever the more pestilently, which is for my purpose, doth it harden and enrage the heart against all means of grace, the power of godlinesse, and possibility of conversion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, men of this world for the most part in the attainement and exercise of learning and knowledge propose to themselves, and finally rest upon many bastard, base, and degenerate ends: as, pleasure of curiosity, quiet of resolution, refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and raising the spirit, ability of discourse, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of wit, gaine of profession, ornament, and reputation, inablement for imployment and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Thus whereas variety and depth of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge should properly and principally serve to prepare, fit, and furnish the soule wherein it is seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: First, for a higher degree, and agreater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of sanctification in it selfe: secondly, to do GOD more excellent and glorious service: Thirdly, to do more nobly in <hi>Ephratha,</hi> and be more famous in <hi>Bethlehem:</hi> I meane, by an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and charitable influence to illuminate and better all about them: The most learned men have these worthy ends, and comply exactly with the world: hunting onely after by their knowledge, and aspiring towards (as their utmost aimes) certaine second prizes: as though they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured onely by their learning to find (as one sayes well:) <hi>a cowch whereupon to rest, a searching</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:7155:120"/>
                  <hi>and a restlesse spirit: or a tarrasse for a wandring and variable mind, to walke up and downe with a faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: or a tower of state, for a proud mind to raise it selfe upon: or a fort or commanding ground for strife and contention: or a shop for profit or sale: and not a rich store-house for the glory of the Creator, and the reliefe of mans estate.</hi> And so by the abuse and misapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, they put their great engine, very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full either for excellency of good, or excesse of ill, as it takes, into the Devils hands for the enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and advancement of his kingdome: and turne the edge of it to the dangerous hurt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and so by consequent and by accident, it prooves a mighty barre to keepe CHRIST and His kingdome out of their hearts.</p>
               <p>Let me in a word by an instance intimate unto you the traines and temptations to which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves, the snares and curses which they incurre, who bend their abilities of learning, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with the corruptions of the time, to raise and enrich themselves; the two maine ends of the most in these covetous and ambitious dayes.</p>
               <p>First, there is a plant in the nurceries of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of great expectation and hope: which being watered, and warmed at the well-heads of Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall learning, and with the fruitfull heat of Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall exercises and agitations in the Schooles, wherein the true worth and excellency of a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler consists, growes ripe and becomes remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; so that he heares after him in the streets a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret murmuring: <hi>This is the man: Dignum est mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strarier &amp; dicier Hic est:</hi> Now by this time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7155:121"/>
to reflect with the eye of selfe-love, and many vaine-glorious glaunces upon his personall worth and publike applause: and then casts about what course to take. GODS principle and path is: It is better to be good, than great; religious, than rich: And therefore He would have him imploy and improove all his naturall and acquired en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, all the powers and possibilities of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soule upon His glory and service that gave them, and where they are more than infinitely due. And that when the good hand of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence shall bring him to any place for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his gifts and ministeriall imployment, he would there spend himselfe (like a shining and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lampe) in the illumination and salvation of GODS people: and so hereafter <hi>shine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the firmament</hi> in the highest heavens, and <hi>as the starres forever and ever.</hi> Nay, (saies the Devill) that's a sowre, strict, precise way: It is not meet, that such admired eminency of learned parts should be confined to such obscurity, that such rare gifts and depth of knowledge should be lost upon high shoes, and amongst a number of rude, ignorant, and uncapable clownes: and therefore he labours to raise his spirit to higher hopes: and would have him plunge presently into the current of the times, and become somebody in the world. Hereupon (his heart already ravisht with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing apprehension of worldly glory and humane greatnesse, represented by Satan in the most allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring formes to his ambitious imagination) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves fearfully against his owne soule, to follow
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7155:121"/>
the streame, to ply the present, and plot all meanes and wayes of preferment: after which ordinarily every step towards an high roome, or to be hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich, is a snare and curse unto him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the height, he must needs be holden fast in the clutches of Satan. He now begins upon all occasions to disclaime all things that tend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenesse, and in his deportment drawes nearer to good fellowship: he remits and interrupts his care and constancy in study, and studies how to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the world, negotiate for advancement, and humour the times: He merrily derides <hi>Doctrine and Vse,</hi> as they scoffingly call it: all edifying plainnesse and <hi>foolishnesse</hi> of preaching: and now he digs with much adoe perhaps a whole quarter of a yeare into the rotten dunghils of Popish Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillers, and phantasticall Friers, and from thence patches together many gayish and gaudy shreds of painted bables, and frothy conceipts and tricks of wit; and at length comes out with a selfe-seeking Sermon: just like that discourse which King IAMES compares to a corne-field in harvest, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered with red and blew flowers; which choake and eat up all the good graine. For, he well knowes this is the way to ingratiate himselfe into the times, and gratifie those great ones who desire farre more to have their eares tickled, than their consciences toucht; and would rather have pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes sowed under their arme-holes by such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving dawbers, that they may lie more softly upon the bed of security; than the keene arrowes of righteousnesse and truth fastned in their sides

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cerity: and yet after this, he must serve his time in serving the times: and through many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of secular martyrdome, as <hi>Peter Blesensis</hi> cals it, and many shipwracks of a good conscience, by basenesse, flattering, attending, depending, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing his soule. At last (if he die not in the pursuit, as many have done) besides all these precedent miserable meanes, by present simony, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vile services: he comes into some high place, or at least becomes a negligent, non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or insatiable pluralist. Which wicked en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance being accompanied with GODS curse, his heart already so hardened, his ministeriall strength and veine of learning so wasted and dried up by discontinuance, desuetude, and worldly dealings: having now attained his ends, he drownes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe over head and eares either in secular busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, or sensuall pleasures to muffle up the mouth of his horribly guilty conscience: cries downe preaching, opposeth the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse: and so becomes rather a wolfe than a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</p>
               <p>In a second place. The rich worldling also is in a wofull case this way, as appeares by CHRISTS owne words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 23, 24. which is further confirmed by casting our eyes upon <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 14. and 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 9. Luke 16. 19. And the Pharises which were covetous heard all these things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided him.</hi> And what heard they from CHRIST? That it was impossible to serve GOD and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. So that there are some passages ever in a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7155:122"/>
and searching ministry, which covetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings deride, and will not downe with by any meanes, but resolutely reject in their carnall wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as very foolish, unnecessary, precise, and no waies to be given way unto. Especially such as these. 1. That they must restore whatsoever they have any waies gotten, or detaine wrongfully and wickedly. 2. That they must rather themselves starve, and leave their children in beggery, than put their hands to any unlawfull waies or meanes of getting: so much as to tell a lie, &amp;c. 3. That <hi>godlinesse is great gaine,</hi> and that it is incomparably better to be religious than rich, good than great. 4. That there is a life of faith which will keepe a man in sweet contentment in any estate, should he be never so poore. 5. That <hi>Iob</hi> was truly richer with CHRIST alone, than when before he was loaden with abundance of thicke clay. 6. That riches are nothing, <hi>Proverbes 23. 5. Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not?</hi> 7. That they must leave all for CHRIST. 8. That if they part with all for Him, they shalbe recompenced an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold in this life. 9. That if they had no recompence at all in this world, yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that they shall have in the world to come, wilbe a super-abundant recompence.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding these satisfactory and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable principles, they <hi>will be rich</hi> in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles sense; after they have gotten a golden heape, will be more rich still: and therefore are easily tempted unto, and taken in the snare of that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable

and most abhorred trade of usury. In the exercise whereof they still negotiate with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and receive all their increase at the Devils hands: and therefore how is it possible they should turne on GODS side?

For, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected sowrenesse of a vaine fellow doth many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the gravity of one that is wise: and the feare wherein they live which are subject to oppression, caries a shew of reverence to him that does the wrong, at least it serves to dazle the eyes of underlings, keeping them from prying into the weakenesse of such as have jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over them,</hi> &amp;c. Beside all this, men in great place are liable, and expos'd daily to moe and stronger temptations, than men of lower ranks. Honour, wealth, worldly reputation, earthly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, &amp;c. are Satans snares to entangle and tie them faster to their fooles paradise and admired folly; and as golden fetters, to chaine them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooveably to their noble slavery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, great men are for the most part (and it is one of their greatest miseries) so enclosed and beleager'd with flatterers, the basest of slaves, with sycophants, false-hearted followers, selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seekers, &amp;c. that very hardly (if at all) can any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man or faithfull <hi>Micaiah</hi> have accesse, come neare them, or at any time be heard with patience, especially either to tell them the truth, or wisely and humbly reprove them for their faults.</p>

first, they so delight in domineering, and dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their high roome as their dearest Idoll: And withall they know full well, that as in naturall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation there is no returne to habit, so it is very rarely seene in the privation politique, and point of preferment; that they would even rather die, than be dejected.</p>
               <p>Lay now these two points together: and count all the snares from which poorer and private men by reason of their meaner condition are happily exempted: And no marvell though <hi>not many mighty,</hi> either in heapes of wealth, or height of places, be converted, or go to heaven.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place: what a strong hold for the powers of hell, and mighty barre to keepe out grace, worldly wisdome is; may appeare by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of the nature of it, and so of its noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously pestilent properties. This wisdome of the flesh springing from the principles of carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and precepts of humane policie, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving continuall influence and instigation from that old wily serpent to go on still in his and the worlds waies, doth with a proud disdainfulnesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious contempt scorne the great mysteries of godlinesse, foolishnesse of preaching, simplicity of the Saints, and society of the brotherhood: crosseth directly, and contradicts the counsell and commands of GODS Spirit, in all motions to good, and matters of salvation: accounts in good earnest holinesse hypocrisie, sanctification singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, profession and practice of sincerity precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the great things of GODS Law as a strange

                  <hi>Devillish:</hi> for, it imitateth the Devill in plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and contriving mischiefe and ruine against the glory of GODS Majesty, and Ministry of His Word. It tasts of his hellish wilinesse in close conveyances and secret infidiations, for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, supplanting, and confounding of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the Gospell, and plantation of grace in the hearts of men. Satan (you know) is ever fierce and furious, when he spies but the least glimpse of GODS truth, or sparke of grace to peepe our and breake forth at any time, or in any place. When the glorious sun-shine of the Gospell did in these latter times of the world (according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie in the <hi>Revelations</hi>) arise out of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

night, and dangerou fogs of Popery, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun graciously to inlighten many thousand soules which lay in darknesse, and under the shadow of death, with what strange and prodigious rage did the great Dragon presently ascend out of his bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse pit.</p>
               <p>Since that time what furious martyring of the Saints, what horrible murthering of Kings, what bloudy massacres, what invincible <hi>Armadoes,</hi> what hellish powder-plots, what devouring of Martyrs, by that bloud-thirsty monster the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Inquisition, what hatefull imprisonings, what desperate conspiracies, what a deale of hell hath vext and rent the face of Europe, and shaken the pillars of this part of the world: as though all the fiends in hell, and whole armies of those damned spirits were broke loose, to cast the Christian world into a new Chaos of darknesse, combustion and confusion. And all this hath beene the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils doings of pure spite and malice against the light of the Gospell, and power of the Word. The Pope, Iesuites, and their wicked adherents have beene indeed the instruments and executioners of all these bloudy miseries, but Satan himselfe was the principall agent. The cursed influence of all this wrath and rage was inspir'd from him, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular and circumstance of all these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes was first plotted in hell, before they were acted upon earth.</p>
               <p>2. In our owne kingdome also his spite and malice against the light of the Gospell hath beene notorious and transcendent since the Word of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7155:126"/>
truth hath growne powerfull amongst us. With what strange fury and malice hath Satan bestirred himselfe? What a deale of deare and innocent bloud did that red Dragon drinke up in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time? For five yeares space the fire of persecution did flame in this land, and the sacred bodies of our glorious blessed Martyrs were sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed amids the mercilesse fury thereof: Afterward what a blacke and bloudy catalogue of most hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and prodigious conspiracies did run parallell with that golden time of Queene ELIZABETHS life, that (now) glorious Saint of dearest memory? But in all this hellish rage the Devill never played the Devill indeed, untill he came to the gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot; that was such a piece of service against the light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospell, as the Sun never saw before; the sons of men never heard of, hel it self never hatcht. Since Satan fel from heaven, and a Church was first planted upon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> earth, there was never any thing in that kind which made the Devils Malice more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, GODS mercies more glorious, that Priest of <hi>Rome</hi> and his bloudy superstition more odious; or that cast such a shame and obloquy upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of Christian Religion. And all this was the Devils doing of pure spite and malice against the glory of the Gospell, the power of the Word, and the Saints of GOD. I say he was the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotter and first moover of all these mischiefes. The Pope, and Iesuites, and their cursed confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were indeed his instruments, executioners and agents, as we well know, and some of the Priests themselves confesse. <hi>See Quodl.</hi> 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 199.</p>
               <p>

They sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit the two traiterous Earles of the North, <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland,</hi> to be the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this bloudy Bull, which indeed was the fountaine and foundation of all the succeeding horrible plots and barbarous treacheries. <hi>See Bells Anatomy of Popish tyrannie, in his Epist. Dedic.</hi> a little booke called <hi>The executioner of justice in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> &amp;c. I pray GOD now at length turne these Popish murderous hearts from whetting any moe swords to shed the bloud of the LORDS an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed: or returne the sharpe swords from the point with a cutting edge on both sides, even up to the very hilts into their owne hearts bloud. O LORD, let the King flourish with a crowne of glory upon his head, and a Scepter of triumph in his hand, and still wash his Princely feet in the bloud of his enemies.</p>
               <p>3. This spitefull rage and furious oposition of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan against the power of the word, appears also by daily experience in those towns &amp; parishes; where by the mercies of GOD, a conscionable Ministry is planted; before, while Satan ruled and raigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, by his wicked deputies, ignorance, prophanenes, Popish superstitions, sinful vanities,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7155:127"/>
lewd sports, prophanation of the Saboth, filthines, drunkennes, and such other accursed Pursevants for Hell: Why then all was well, all was in quiet and in peace. O then that was a merry world, and as good a Towne for good-fellowship, as was in all the Country. And no marvaile: when a strong armed man keepeth his Pallace, the things that he possesseth are in peace. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 21. While Sathan sits in their hearts, and rules in their Consciences; he suffers them to have their swings in their furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vanities and wicked pleasures, without any great disturbance or contradiction. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he never sets prophane people together by the eares and at odds, but when his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may be more strengthened, and their soules more endanger'd by dissention, than by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in prophanenesse, and brotherhood in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Let it not seeme strange then, when townes and parishes where conscionable meanes are wanting, live merrily and pleasantly; for, they walke together in the knot of good-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, through the broad way, they follow the course of their owne corruptions, and swing of their corrupt affection, and swim downe the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the times, and are at Satans beck to do him any desperate and notorious service at all assaies, in all passages of prophanenesse, and offices of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and rebellion: but bring amongst such a powerfull Ministerie, which takes a right course for the plantation of grace, and salvation of their soules: and then marke how spitefully and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Satan begins to bestirre himselfe; besides
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7155:128"/>
his owne malice and machinations, he presently sets on foot and on fire too all that belong unto him in his instigation. They band and combine themselves with great rage and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the power of the Word, and the faithfull messengers of GOD. They fret, and fume, picke unnecessary quarrels, raile, slander, and indeed foame out filthily their owne shame, in disgracing the truth of GOD without all truth or conscience: and il Satan spies any poore soule amongst them to be pulled out of his clutches and kingdome of darknesse by the preaching of the Word, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sets all the rest upon him as so many dogged curres, or rather furious wolves (for so our blessed Saviour makes the comparison) upon a harmelesse lambe; he whets (like sharpe razors) all the lying and lewd tongues in the towne, and tips them with the very fire of hell; so that they plead for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse, prophaning the Sabbath, and many sinfull fooleries and vanities in all places where they come. He makes those who have a little more wit, his close factors and under-hand-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: for that stands not with Satans policy, and the reputation of the worldly-wise, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should be open actors in childish vanities, and profes'd enemies to the Law of GOD: they do him sufficient service by being secret patrons and protectors of impiety, counsellers and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancers of the works of darknesse: he fils the mouthes of the ignorant with slanderous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and cries, that there was neuer good world since there was so much knowledge: that there
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7155:128"/>
was never more preaching, but never lesse work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: whereas (poore soules) they never yet knew what grace or good work meant, or scarce good word: but their naughty tongues, and hatred to be reformed, are true causes why both the world and places where they live, are farre worse. Those that are desperately and notoriously naught, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces and inrages like mad dogs; so that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently and openly barke at, and with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poysoned fangs furiously snatch at that hurtlesse hand which would heale and bind up their bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing soules: they are like dogs barking at the moone; for, GODS Ministers are starres in the right hand of CHRIST, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 16. If they would do them any deadly harme, they must plucke them thence; but let them take heed how they be bold and busie that way, lest at last they take a beare by the tooth, and awake a sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lion.</p>
               <p>Thus you see what a stirre the Devill keepes when he is like to be driven from his hold by the power of the Word: and how he playes the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill indeed, when the light of the Gospell begins to shine in a place which himselfe hath long kept in darknesse and errour by those twofold fiends, ignorance and prophanenesse. Perhaps at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry first rising of that glorious sun of the Word of life unto a people that hath sit in darknesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shadow of death, it breeds onely astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and amazement, they are for a while onely dazelled with the glory and beauty of so rare and extraordinary a light, but when after some little

space they be thorowly heated, and it begin to burne up their noy some lusts, to gall their guilty consciences, to sting their carnall hearts, to vexe and disquiet their covetous affections, then begins all the stirre, and Satan to play his part: the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den infliction of a wound is not so very painefull, and while it is greene it is not so grievous, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it comes to be searched in cold bloud, to have tents put into it, and corrasives applied, then it goeth to the heart: When the sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit first strikes the carnall heart, it may perhaps beare away the blow reasonable well; but if the Chirurgion of the soule, I meane the Minister of the Word follow his cure faithfully, and open the wound wider, as he sees need, apply spirituall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>osives to eat away the ranknesse of the flesh, and the poyson of sinne, then begins the prophane man (if the LORD give him not grace to suffer his soule to be saved) to rage and rave with the smart of it, and perhaps with malice and fury to fly into the face of his soules Physitian.</p>
               <p>See the humour of prophane men against the power of a conscionable Ministery, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44. 15, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 8. and Cap. 14. 2, &amp;c. and Ver. 19. and Cap. 16. 19. and Cap. 17. 5. and Ver. 32. and Cap. 19. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This spite and malice of Satan against sincerity and grace is to be seene also in private families: if the governours of the house, the children and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be all prophane (as it is very true of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in most places) then they are passing well met for matter of Religion, and were there nothing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7155:129"/>
amongst them to breed difference and dissention, but GODS service, they would never fall out: for they are all content to heare no more, or more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the affaires of heaven, judgements for sin, the wayes of GOD, and reformation of their life, than they must needs: they are all willing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to prophane the Sabbath, in one kind or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; some by absenting themselves from the house of GOD, some by worldly talke all the day long, some by idlenesse, some by sinfull sports, &amp;c. They are well content to lie downe at night, like wild beasts in their dens, without lifting up their hearts together unto that mercifull GOD which hath preserved and prospered them all the day: to rise up also in the morning, prayerlesse, or onely with formall prayers. They all joyne in malice against the Ministry of the Word, in slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous lies against the messengers of GOD, in base and reviling speeches against the professours of Christianity. The reason is, they are all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with the same spirit of prophanenesse, love of pleasures, hatred to be reformed, and carnality of heart. But if it once please the LORD to plant grace in the heart of the Master of the family; so that he begin to plant in his house reformation, houshold instruction, prayer, sanctification of the Sabbath, and other holy orders, and godly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises; then presently begins the Devill to stir in the hearts and tongues of their prophane servants: they begin to be furiously impatient of such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenesse, strictnesse, and restraints (for so they wickedly and wrongfully call the pleasures of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7155:130"/>
grace and way to heaven) they can by no meanes digest such new fashions: they'l not be troubled with giving account of Sermons they heare: they'l have their recreation on the Sabbath, that they will: they'l not be mew'd up at home, when other mens servants are at their sports abroad, &amp;c. Nay perhaps even their owne children (except the LORD season them with the same grace) may grow stubborne and refractory, and very rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and disobedient to the best things: so that in a holy sense, CHRISTS words may be there truly verified, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 34, 35. Thus was zealous <hi>David</hi> troubled with the vanity of a scornefull, proud, and prophane wife, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Abel</hi> with a bloudy brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Iacob</hi> with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Esau, Gen.</hi> 27. 41. <hi>Isaac</hi> with a mocking <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael:</hi> And many a gracious heart in families where grace beares not sway, with the lewdnesse, malice, and ungodly oppositions of those among whom they live.</p>
               <p>Or if it so fall out that the power of grace seaze on the heart of a servant or sonne, so that he begin to be sensible of the ignorance, disorders, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse, and sinfull confusions of the house where he dwels: desires to spend the Sabbath as Christians use to do: then presently begins Satan to put rage into the heart, and frownings into the face of the father or master of the family: he then takes on, tels him, that such precisenesse is not for his profit, hee'l have no such inferiour fellow to be a reformer of his family: hee'l not be control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and contradicted in his owne house, hee'l go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7155:130"/>
his people in the old fashion as his father did before him, &amp;c. so that there is no longer biding for that new convert under such a crabbed master, without a very great deale of patience. All this, and a thousand more mischiefes are the blacke broods and bloudy effects of Satans malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the power of the Word, and the plantation of grace.</p>
               <p>GOD Himselfe is the GOD of peace, CHRIST IESVS the Prince of peace, and the blessed Spirit is the fountaine of peace, that passeth all understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the holy Word is the Gospell of peace, the faithfull Ministers are the Messengers of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and peace, the Saints of GOD are the children of peace: The Divell and the rebellious corruptions of prophane men are indeed and truth the true causes of all these stirs and strong opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are raised any where, at any time, any waies in the case and cause of Religion. The fault I confesse, and imputation of troublesomenesse is lai'd upon GODS children by the lewd tongues of gracelesse men. See <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 10. utterly without cause. 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 3 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but these and the like are lies hatch't in Hell, and managed by the malice of carnall men. And that was most true, which the blessed Prophet of GOD <hi>Elijah,</hi> and the holy Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> answered in such cases, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 13, 14. and so proportionably may all Christians answer all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane wretches amongst whom they liue: It is you and your prophane families, your proud ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, hatred to be reformed, malice against the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7155:131"/>
Ministery, &amp;c. which trouble <hi>Israel,</hi> are the true causes of all Dissentions and disquietnesse, and bring upon us all these plagues and judgements which any way afflict us. A godly Minister stands at staves end with all the world, and hath the most enemies of any man. He must warre not onely with desperate swaggerers and notorious sinners, but also with civill honest men, formall Professors, counterfeit Christians, unsound converts, relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed creatures, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. Lastly, That particular person, whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the LORD to sanctifie and set apart for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, hath good experience of Satans fury and rage against sincerity and grace: there is not a man that passeth out of the powers of darkenesse and Satans bondage, by the power of the word, but he presently pursues him farre more furiously, then ever <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the Israelites, to recover and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine him into his kingdome. <hi>See my discourse of Happinesse, pag.</hi> 60.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you a taste of the Divells malice and machinations against the light of the Gospell, the power of GODS truth, and the Ministery of the Word: now you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that worldly wisdome is his very righthand, nearest counsellor and chiefest champion in all these mischievous plots and furious outrages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst GOD and goodnesse. This hath beene more then manifest in all ages of the Church: In those great Politicians, the Scribes and Pharisees; in the States-men of <hi>Rome;</hi> in our times, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us daily: worldly-wise men, that are only
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7155:131"/>
guided by carnall reason, they imploy their wit, their power, their malice, their friends, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand dealings, their policy and their purses too, unlesse they be too covetous; to hinder, stop, disgrace, and slander the passage of a conscionable Ministery and the Messengers of Almighty GOD, of whom the LORD hath said, <hi>Touch not mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, and doe my Prophets no harme, Psal.</hi> 105. 15. They ever imitate and follow to a haires bredth their Father the Divell in malice and practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst grace and good men; except sometimes they forbeare for a time for advantage, for reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or such other by-respects and private ends: except naturally they be extraordinarily ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of very loving and kinde naturall disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or bee restrained by feare of some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable judgement, from persecution of the Ministers.</p>
               <p>2. As worldly wisdome is divelish, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> calls it, and ever mixed with a spice of Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish malice and virulency against the Kingdome of CHRIST: so it is also earthly, for it mindes onely earthly things, and though that casts beyond the Moone for matters of the world, yet it hath not an inch of forecast for the world to come: But though a man be to passe, perhaps the next day, nay the next houre, nay the next moment, to that dreadfull Tribunall of GOD, and to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoideable everlasting estate in another world, either in the joyes of heaven, or in the paines of hell, yet it so glues and nailes his hopes, desires, projects, and resolutions to transitory pelfe, and

things of this life, as though both body and soule at their dissolution, should be wholly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingly resolved, and turned into earth, dust, or nothing.</p>
               <p>To give you a taste of this earthlinesse of worldly wisdome, give me a worldly-wise man, and,</p>
               <p>1. Put him into discourse of the affaires of the world, and the businesse of his calling, and you shall find him profound and deepe in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, able to speake well and to the purpose, if it were a whole day, and that with dexterity and cheerfulnesse: But divert his discourse a little, and turne him into talke of matters of heaven, of the great mystery of godlinesse, the secrets of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, cases of conscience, and such like holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and you shall find him to be a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, an ideot: it may be, he may say something of the generall points of Religion, of matters in controversie, of the meaning of some places in Scripture: but come to conferre of practicall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, experimentall knowledge, passages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and practices of grace, and you shall find him, and he shall shew himselfe to be able to say just nothing with feeling and comfort: many a poore neglected Christian, which in the spirit of disdainfulnesse, and out of the pride of his carnall wisdome, he tramples upon with contempt, and would scorne to be matcht with in other matters: yet would infinitely surpasse him in this case; quite put him downe, that he would have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:7155:132"/>2. Let him come to some great personage with a suit, to intreat his favour and countenance, or to give him thanks for some former good turn: and he will be able to speake well, plausibly, pleasingly, persuasively, and seasonably: but put him to pray in his family unto Almighty GOD for the pardon of his sins, and a crowne of life, for the remoovall of damnation and an everlasting curse; to powre out his soule in thankfulnesse for every good thing he enjoyeth (for he holds all from Him) and such a wise man (which is strange and fearefull) in a businesse of so great weight, will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to speake scarce one wise word without a booke.</p>
               <p>3. Come into his family, examine the estate of his house, you shall find all things in good order, every affaire marshalled and disposed for the best advantage, a provident fore-cast, and present provision of things necessary for their bodies: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one busie in their severall imployments, and carefull in the workes of their calling: but search also into the estate of their soules, what heavenly food is ministred for their spirituall life, how the Sabbath is sanctified among them, how it stands with them for houshold-instructions and family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exercises, &amp;c. And (GOD knowes) in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that way there is no providence at all, no care, no conscience about any such matters.</p>
               <p>Walke also amongst his husbandry: you shall find his arable carefully dunged, tilled and sowne: his pastures well mounded, bankt and trencht; his trees pruned, his gardens weeded, his cattell
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7155:133"/>
watchfully tended: but inquire into the spirituall husbandry at home in his owne conscience, and you shall find his heart over-growne with sinne, as the wildest wast with thistles and briars: no fence to keepe the Devill out of his soule, many noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some lusts growing thick and ranke, like so many nettles and brambles to be cut downe and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire; so that his silliest lambe and poorest pig is in a thousand times more happie ease, then himselfe the owner, and well were he if his last end might be like theirs, that is, that his immortall soule might dye with his body: but that cannot be; except in the meane time he repent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his carnall reason, hee must be destroyed with an everlasting perdition, from the presence of GOD, and from the glory of His power.</p>
               <p>4. Consider His care and affection towards His children; you shall finde that to be all earth: for whereas perhaps with farrelesse toyle and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, by the mercies of GOD, by teaching them the feare of GOD, instructing them in the wayes of godlinesse, restraining them from prophanenesse, and prophaning the Sabbath, by his owne exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of piety and godly conversation, he might plant grace in their hearts, and provide a crowne of glory for their heads hereafter: yet (wretched man) he doth not onely wickedly neglect these meanes of everlasting comfort: but with too much worldlinesse, variety of vexations (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for his very wickednesse that way, if there were nothing else) with the great danger of his owne soule; he heapes up for them those hoards,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7155:133"/>
that will hereafter heape coales of vengeance on their heads; and purchases and provides for them those greene pastures of a prosperous state in this world wherein they are fatted for the same slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thorow which they prophanely passe into the pit of the same endlesse destruction with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>5. Aske his judgement about the Sabbath, and ordinarily you shall find his resolution to be this; that he sees no reason but mens servants and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may enjoy some houres of recreation and sport even upon the Sabbath, especially with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of times of Divine Service: what would they have us to do, (will he say) or what would they make of us? I hope they doe not looke we should be Angels upon earth: they know, we are but flesh and bloud. It is too true indeed, this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing against the keeping of the Sabbath savours full rankly of flesh and bloud.</p>
               <p>GOD out of the abundance of His owne goodnesse, and compassionate consideration of our weakenesse hath allotted and allowed unto us six dayes for our owne businesse, and reserved but one to be consecrated in speciall manner, as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto Him; and yet wretched men, they must needs clip the LORDS coyne, encroach upon His sanctified time, and unthankfully and accursedly spend those holy houres in which they should treasure up knowledge and comfort against that fearefull day, in idlenesse, worldinesse, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane pastimes, whereby besides the particular curse upon their owne soules, they many times
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7155:134"/>
draw many miseries and plagues upon the place where they live. This reason is carnall indeed, this wisdome is earthly with a witnesse.</p>
               <p>6. Add another out of <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 39, 40.</p>
               <p>Thus you see worldly wisdome in all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation and cariages inclines unto the earth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides ever with greatest care for the world, and savours rankly of flesh and bloud.</p>
               <p>3. It is also <hi>sensuall:</hi> for, it doth senslesly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the pleasures of sense and pleasing the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, before the peace of conscience and sense of GODS favour. It provides a thousand times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a body of earth, which must shortly upon an unavoidable necessity, feed the wormes, and turne to dust; than for a precious immortall foule, the immediate issue of GODS almightinesse, and which can never possibly die: It doth with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sweetnesse and hold-fast, relish, apprehend and enjoy the furious delights of some bosome-sinne, which it hath in present pursuit, taste and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than spirituall graces, GODS favour, joy in that blessed Spirit, and a crowne of life hereafter; for which it hath GODS Word and Promise, if it would be wise to salvation. In a word: it doth so highly preferre a few bitter-sweet pleasures for an inch of time in this vale of teares, before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed and immeasurable joyes thorow all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the glorious mansions of heaven: Is not this wisdome strangely nailed and glued unto sense, and stupidly senslesse in spirituall things, that though many times fore-told and fore-warned by the Ministry of the Word, yet will needs for the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7155:134"/>
temporary satisfaction of its carnall, covetous, or ambitious humour, with filthy vexing, transitory pelfe, with vanity, dung, nothing, run wilfully and headlong upon easelesse, endlesse, and remedilesse torments in the world to come? And that which is the just curse and plague of worldly wisdome, (this spirituall madnesse commonly called) it is confident that it doth wisely, and takes the best way, and thereupon becomes incorrigible and obstinate: <hi>For there is more hope of a foole, than of him that is wise in his owne conceipt, Prov.</hi> 26. 22. And, <hi>Though thou shouldest bray a foole in a morter, yet will not his foolishnesse depart from him, Prov.</hi> 27. 22. How fearefull then is his case, that to his worldly wisdome joynes confidence in his wayes? But the day will come that hee'l see and bewaile the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his wisdome, and the truth of his folly, and that with bitter griefe and horrible anguish even in hell fire, as it is notably set downe in the booke of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> Cap. 5.</p>
               <p>But the word which here in <hi>Iames</hi> is rendred <hi>sensuall,</hi> is the same which is used, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>The naturall man receiveth not the things,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>So that worldly wisdome is in that sense natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: that it can neither relish nor receive the things of the spirit: it cannot possibly conceive and comprehend the immediate meanes and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of salvation: let a man otherwise be never so faire and comely in body, never so proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, personable, or goodly to look upon, and in the eye of others, yet if himselfe want eyes (the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7155:135"/>
instruments of light, he cannot possibly behold and gaze upon with delight the goodlinesse and glory of this great frame of the world about him: he cannot see the brightnesse of the Sun, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the earth, and the delightsome variety of the creatures: so a worldly-wise man, though he be never so gracefull for his other parts, never so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable to carnall eyes, or mightily magnifi dby his flatterers or favourites: yet wanting the saving sight of GODs sanctifying Spirit, and the eye of spirituall understanding, is starke blind in spirituall matters, and cannot possibly behold the rich pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise of the kingdome of grace, the secrets of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and the incomparable glory and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Christianity. This wisdome of the flesh serves the worldling (like the Ostrich wings) to make him to out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> run others upon the earth and in earthly things; but can helpe him never a whit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven: nay, is rather like a heavy mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone about his necke, to make him sinke deeper into the bottomlesse pit of hell.</p>
               <p>The reason why these great politicians and jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise men of the world (as they are called) for all their depths and devices, with all their wit and windings, cannot understand one tittle of the things of GOD, is, because this spirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is hid from them, for so saith our Saviour CHRIST, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>I give thee thankes O Father,</hi> LORD <hi>of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and men of understanding, and hast revealed them unto babes.</hi> And this reason our Saviour rendreth why he spake to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7155:135"/>
in parables, and to his Disciples plainely, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to these it was given to know the secrets of the kingdome of heaven, but to them it was not given.</hi> And indeed it is just with GOD, that,</p>
               <p>1. Sith they (when the glorious sun of the Word of life shines surely upon their faces, do wilfully shut their eyes against it, that He should strike them starke blind, so that for matters of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation they should grope even at noone-day, as the blind gropeth in darknesse, and stumbleth in the darkest night.</p>
               <p>2. Sith they depend on their owne policy, depths, and turning devices, GOD justly turnes them loose to follow the swing of their carnall reason; and suffers them to lie and delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the sensualmists, and self-conceipted foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries and vanities of their own naturall wisdome: while the Moone lookes directly upon the Sun, from whom she borrowes her light, she is bright and beautifull, but if she once turne aside, and be left to her selfe, she loses all her glory, and enjoyes but onely a shadow of light which is her owne: so while men with humility and teachablenesse turne their faces toward the Sun of righteousnesse, CHRIST IESVS, and those Starres which he holds in his right hand, the faithfull Ministers, to receive from them illumination in heavenly things, and instruction in the wayes of GOD, GOD doth graciously vouchsafe unto them the glorious light of saving knowledge: but when they turne their backs upon Him, betake themselves to their owne plots and projects, devices and policies, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7155:136"/>
seeke deepe to hide their counsell from the LORD: then they are justly left to the darksome giddinesse of their carnall reason, and walke towards feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and horrour, thorough the windings and turnings of their worldly wisdome.</p>
               <p>3. Because they are proud of their earthly poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the LORD will not give them prudence in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly matters: because they are wise in their own conceipts, they are justly given over to follow the deceitfulnesse of their owne hearts: with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious disdainfulnesse, they scorne the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Saints, and therefore they are just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blinded, to thinke the wayes of their salvation foolishnesse.</p>
               <p>4. Worldly men make an Idoll of their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: both in respect that they wholly repose themselves upon it, for their provision and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and because they secretly desire to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and adored for it, as men of extraordinary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, and oracles of discretion and policy: and it may be, that they are so by their favourites and flatterers: but they must give GOD His Word, and good men leave to censure them truly and justly to be the notoriousest fooles upon earth, because they are infants and ideots in the matters and mysteries of salvation. Now I say, because they make an idoll of their wisdome, GOD and this earthly Dagon cannot possibly dwell together in one soule, but in his just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment suffers them with such doting devotion, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceipt to sacrifice unto it, that they want both understanding and hearts to do him any accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:7155:136"/>This naturall and sensuall wisdome being thus hoodwinked from al heavenly light by GODs just judgement, and by the pride, prejudice, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, selfenesse of the owner doth proportion and measure all its conceipts and considerations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and religious men by the unsound and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall principles of our corrupt nature, and by the false scantling of carnall reason.</p>
               <p>We may see this carnality of worldly wisdome in censuring spirituall things in <hi>Nicodemus, Ioh.</hi> 3. See also a carnall conceipt of worldly wisdome in my <hi>Discourse of true happinesse,</hi> pag. 58, 59.</p>
               <p>Hence it is also that we find it to be a constant property of a worldly-wise man to conceive or censure a zealous profession of GODs truth, and sound practice of sincerity, to be nothing but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and humour: an affectation of singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, precisenesse, and a kind of odnesse from other men. The reason is, when he lookes upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the flattering glasse of selfe-conceipt, he judges himselfe to be a very jolly fellow: thinkes he within his owne heart; I go for a sufficient man in the world: the best make good account of me:<note place="margin">Quis<expan>

               <p>It is the ripened and actuated strength and rage<note place="margin">Corrupt affection defined.</note> of originall corruption that furiously executes the rebellious dictates of the Devill, and desperate projects of mens sensuall hearts: stands at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, professes open hostility against grace, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, good men, good causes, and all courses of sanctification: seeds upon so long, and fils it selfe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7155:139"/>
so full with worldly vanities and pleasures, that growing by little and little incorrigible, and hating to be reform'd, it breeds, and brings forth (as its naturall issue) despaire, horrour, and the worme which never dies.</p>
               <p>And this corrupt affection is of it selfe, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, First, untameable; Secondly, insatiable; Thirdly, desperate.</p>

The stubborne Israelites were heavily laden, with an extraordinary variety of most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous crosses and afflictions: there was nothing wanting to make them outwardly miserable; and no misery inflicted upon them, but upon purpose to humble and take downe their rebellious hearts. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. How the Prophet paints out to the life the rufull and distresfull state of their fresh-bleeding desolations: <hi>The whole head</hi> (saith he) <hi>is sicke, and the whole heart is heavy, &amp;c.</hi> for the

place is meant, not (as some take it) of their sins, but of their sorrowes. But all the blowes and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures were so farre from softning their hearts, that they hardned and emmarbled more and more. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>should ye be smitten any more, for ye fall away more and more?</hi> What created power can possibly have more power upon the soules of men, than the sacred Sermons of the Son of GOD, who <hi>spake as never man spake?</hi> And yet these deare intreaties and melting invitations which sweetly &amp; tenderly flow'd from that heart, which was resolved to spill that warmest and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most blood for their sakes moved those stiffe-nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Iewes never a jot: <hi>Ierusalem, Ierusalem,</hi> saith he, <hi>which killest the Prophets, &amp;c.

The LORD (as He saies Himselfe) made His mouth as a sharpe sword,<note place="margin">Cap. 49. 4.</note> and Himselfe as a chosen shaft; and yet that two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged sword was full often blunted upon their hardest hearts; and his keene arrowes discharged
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7155:140"/>
by a skilfull hand, rebounded from their flinty bosomes, as shafts shot against a stone wall. And that made that Seraphicall Oratour, the unmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Paragon of sacred eloquence, thus to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, <hi>Isa.</hi> 47. 4. <hi>I have laboured in vaine, I have spent my strength in vaine, and for nothing:</hi> A course of extraordinary severity and terrour was taken with <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> he was not onely chastised with rods, but even scourged with Scorpions: and yet all the plagues of Egypt were so farre from pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and softening his hard heart, as that every particular plague added a severall iron sinew, and more slintinesse to his already stony heart. And as the heart is naturally thus hardened towards godlinesse, so also hollow towards the godly: See <hi>Sauls</hi> cariage towards <hi>David.</hi> No materiall waight can more crush the heart of man, than braying in a morter; and yet saith <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi> 27. 22. <hi>Though thou shouldest bray a foole,</hi> a desperate sinner, a rebellious wretch <hi>in a morter amongst wheat brayed with a pestill; yet will not his foolishnesse,</hi> his sinfulnesse, which is the greatest, <hi>depart from him, no more than the skin from the Blacke-moore, or the spots from the Leopard by washing him.</hi> Shame an old obstinate beaten sinner with his horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude; show him the ugly face of his hainous sinnes, tell him of the losse of the happinesse of heaven; affright him with the feare of hell and damnation: in all this he is like a Smiths anvill, that growes harder and harder for all his hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Lastly, a damned spirit, though he lie in the lowest dungeon of utter darknesse, laden with that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7155:141"/>
burden of sinne, which prest downe a glorious Angell of light and all his followers from the top of heaven into that lowest pit, with the full weight of the unquenchable and everlasting wrath of GOD; with all the heavy chaines of that infernall lake; and with that which (me thinkes) is farre worse and more cutting than many hels, than ten thousand damnations, even with despaire of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver having ease, end, or remedy of those most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, everlasting, intolerable hellish torments: I say, though a damned soule be thus laden, and thus heavily prest downe with all this cursed waight, and hainousnesse of hell; yet he is still as hard as a stone. So certaine it is, that no curse, or created power, not the softest eloquence or severest course, not the waight of the whole world or the heavines of hell; if all were prest and laid upon the heart of a man; could possibly breake that stubbornesse, or tame that rebellion. This is onely the worke of the blessed Spirit with the hammer of the Word.</p>
               <p>This hardnesse of heart had attained a strange height even in the worlds infancy: into what a prodigious rocke is that growne now then by length of time, in so many ages, sith every gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration since, by invention of new sinnes, and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hainousnesse unto the old, have every one added thereunto a severall iron sinew, and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of flintinesse.

               <p>What a strange stony heart lodged in the breast of the tyrant <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> When the Prophet (1 <hi>Kin.</hi>

13.) cried to the altar of <hi>Ieroboam, O altar, altar,</hi> the altar clave presently asunder at the Word of GOD in the mouth of the Prophet; but this mighty hammer of the Word, (<hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 29.) with ten mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles gave ten mighty strokes at <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart; and yet could find no entrance, could not pierce it; but rebounded backe as an arrow shot against a stone wall. Let no man then thinke it strange to see many stubborne and rebellious wretches run on in their courses, and rage against the waies of GOD, though they have both the Ministry of the Word of GOD to reclaime them, and be many times singled out particularly by the hand of GOD with some speciall judgement, for the abatement of their fury. For, the rebelliousnesse of mans nature can never possibly be tamed, corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can never be conquered, untill the heart wherein it sits inthron'd, be crusht and broke in peeces: and this hardnesse of heart can never be mortified, no created power can possibly pierce it, untill the Almighty Spirit take the hammer of the Word into His owne hand; that by His spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, unresistable power He may first breake and bruise it, and after by sprinkling it with the bloud of CHRIST, dissolve it into teares of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that so it may be softened, sanctified, and sav'd. And let no man marvell, that the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest Ministry doth produce by accident the most pestilent scorners, cruellest persecutors, and men of most raging cariage against the meanes of their salvation; for these reasons.</p>
               <p>1. From the nature of the glorious Gospell
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7155:142"/>
of IESVS CHRIST, the sunn of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which shining upon one that hath spirituall life, will more reuiue and quicken him: but in one dead in sinnes and trespasses, causes him to stinke more hatefully before the face of GOD and man.</p>
               <p>2. From the cruelty of Satan: who laies more burdens and heavier chaines upon him; that the Ministers labour to pull out of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>2. <hi>Vnsatiable.</hi> Corrupt affection is unsatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all it sensuall pursuits for the empoyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</p>
               <p>1. Fountaine of originall pollution is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse, restlesse, and ever working; it sends out uncessantly fresh desires, new longings, and more greedinesse, for the grasping, engrossing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of earthly delights and carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
               <p>2. When the heart of man forsakes the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and boundlesse <hi>Fountaine of living waters;</hi> of which if it should <hi>drinke</hi> heartily and sincerely, and every drop should be in it <hi>a well of water springing up to everlasting life;</hi> and digs unto it earthly pits; wherout to suck the muddy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and troubled streams of vanity and sensuall delights; then GOD in his just Iudgement makes those pits bottomlesse, that they'le hold no water; so that it shall seeke and never bee satisfied: it shall toile and tire out it selfe in waies of wickednes and destruction, and shall never find end and rest; but in endlesse woe and restlesse torments.</p>
               <p>3. Never was jaylor so jealous over his priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as Satan is watchfull over every wicked man.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7155:143"/>
And therefore least he should waxe weary of his way to hell, he failes not by a secret accursed influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to fill his sinfull heart, with an unquenchable thirst after pleasures of the earth. And he doth not onely put this insatiable thirst into the soule of a carnall man; but also by his jugling and art of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture, he gilds over sensuall objects, with lying glory, and a deceitfull lustre, and puts a violent, strong inticing power into wordly vanities, that they may continually feed his greedy appetite with fresh succession, and an endlesse variety of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall sweetnesses. Satan himselfe is infinite in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice against the majesty of GOD. Hee drinkes up sinne, and devoures iniquity with as insatiable greedinesse, as Behemoth the river <hi>Iordan.</hi> Of all those huge mountaines, the numberlesse number, and purple seas of sinnes and transgressions, which have at any time, any where, by any creature been committed since himself first fell from heaven unto this hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e, or shall be from thence untill the day of doome, or from thence everlastingly in hell, by bannings, cursings and despaires amongst those damned fiends: I say, of all these sinnes Satan is guilty one way or other: and if he might have his will, he hath malice enough to make an infinite addition both in number and hainousnesse. Where one sinne is committed, he wisheth there were ten thousand. Hee would have every sinfull thought be a sin of Sodomy: every idle word a desperate blasphemy: every angry looke, a bloody murther: every frailty, a crying sinne: every default, a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable rebellion. Now as Satan himselfe is thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7155:143"/>
and insatiable in the waies of darknesse; so doth hee inspire every limbe of his with a spice of this sinfull greedinesse, and restlesse pursuit of their owne wicked waies. To give an instance of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and terrour in this kind, and of Satans merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse malice that way. I knew a man which in his life time was given to that fearefull blasphemous sinne of swearing, who comming to his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, Satan so fild his heart with a madded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged greedinesse after that, most gainelesse and pleasurelesse sinne) that though himselfe swore as fast and furiously as he could; yet (as though hee had beene already amongst the bannings and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies of hell) he desperatly desir'd the standers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to helpe him with oathes, and to sweare for him. Incredible rage, prodigious fury! Now if Satan be able to beget such insatiablenesse after sin wherein there is no profit or delight at all; how fiercely &amp; fearefully will he enrage carnall men in the pursuit of gainfull, pleasure full and advancing sinnes?</p>
               <p>You see then how the insatiablenesse of corrupt affection springs out of the fountaine of originall naughtinesse, from the just curse of GOD and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Satan.</p>
               <p>It is cleare and evident by ordinary experience, and observation in the world, with what insatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able desire and greedinesse, corrupt affection doth feed upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that sensuall object, and earthly pleasure, upon which with speciall apprehension, and delightfull taste, it seazes and sets it selfe.</p>
               <p>1. If it fall in love with honour and high
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7155:144"/>
roomes; it begets ambition, which is an unsatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thirst after glory, and a gluttonous excessive desire after greatnesse. Of all other vicious passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which doe possesse the heart of man, it is the most powerfull and unconquerable. As it is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative and transcendent in it object and aspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and seated in the highest, and haughtiest spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; so is it resolute and desperate in it undertakings furious and head-strong in it pursuits and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is ventrous to remove any let, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for all meanes; many times without remorse or teares, it takes out of the way by some cruell contriuance, their dearest friends, and tramples the neerest blood, as we see ordinarily in the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Emperours, to get up into an high place, and grasp an Imperiall Crowne. It is victorious over all other affections, and maisters even the sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of lustfull pleasures, as we may see in many great men of the Heathens, <hi>Alexander, Scipio, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> and many others; who being tempted with the exquisitenes and varieties of choisest beauties, yet forbare that villanie, not for conscience sake, or for feare of GOD, whome they knew not; but least thereby they should stop the current of their uictorious atchieuements, and obscure the glory of their remarkable valour. It preferres a high roome in the world before a temporall life; yea, and eternall life too. How many great mens hearts have burst, at the displeased and frouning counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a King? how many either by desperate practices or their own violent hands have brought themselves to untimely ends, because they were
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7155:144"/>
impatient of the lower places they had formerly enjoyed. <hi>Achitophel,</hi> when hee was like to loose the reputation and ranke of a Privy Councellour, sadled his Asse, went home, put his house in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and hanged himselfe. How many daily runne great hazards, to domineere for a while in their undeserved dignities? And prepare against the day of wrath, by an unconscionable purchasing of highest roomes amongst the sonnes of men?</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is uncapable of society, and sharpned by the enjoyment of that it desireth. Give roome to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and heele ambitiously pursue the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of the whole world: Let <hi>Alexander</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the whole world, heele aske for moe; let those be subdued; he would climbe towards the starres, if he could aspire thither, he would peep beyond y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heavens. For the proud and ambitious man enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his desire like hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, &amp;c. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 5. Who can fill the bottomlesse gulfe of hell, or stop the insatiable jawes of death? neither can the greedy humour of a haughty spirit be satisfied. Let a considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that crowne of endlesse joy and glory, which the Christian hath in pursuit; be unto him a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyson to uphold his heart in comfort and contentment against the vanity and venome of such endlesse ambitions; and if men be so infinitly ventrous for an earthly crowne, which (as one sayes) if wee well weighed with what feares, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, cares, insidiations, &amp;c. it is thick set, if we found it before us in the way, we would not take it up. I say then, how eager should wee bee

               <p>2. If corrupt affection fall in love with riches, and the wedge of gold, it begets covetousnesse, the vilest and basest of all the infection of the soule: as ambition haunteth the haughtiest spirits, so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse lodgeth in the most dunghill disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it turnes the soule of man, that noble and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall spirit into earth and mud: whereas it might live in heaven upon earth, and by holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, by a sweet familiarity and acquaintance (as it were) with GOD, and conversing above, and in that everlasting heaven of endlesse happinesse hereafter: It lies in hell upon earth, and by rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse torture of unsatiable greedinesse, makes way by it rooting to descend into the hell of wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in the world to come. This devouring gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene of greedinesse to get riches, doth not onely by a most incompatible antipathy, keepe out grace and GODS feare; but also by it venomous heat wast and consume all honest and naturall affection, both to man, and beasts, to parents, kindred, friends and acquaintance. Nay, it makes a man contemne himselfe body and soule, wilfully to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon both the comfortable enjoyment of this short time of this present mortality, and all hope of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Besides, covetousnesse pierceth thorow the soule with a thousand torments, and the riches of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7155:146"/>
iniquity ingender in the heart of man many tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, envies and molestations, as their proper thunderbolt and blasting. And of all other vile affections it is most sottishly and senslesly unsatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 8. For, how is it possible that earth should feed or fill the immateriall and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne spirit of a man? It cannot be: and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD hath said it shall not be; <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver,</hi> &amp;c. Hence it is, that the deeplier the drowsie heart of this covetous man doth drinke of this golden streame, the more furiously it is inflam'd with spirituall thirst. Nay, it is most certaine, that if the covetous man could purchase a monopoly of all the wealth in the world; were he able to empty the Westerne parts of gold and silver; and the East of pearles and jewels; should he enclose the whole face of the earth from one end of heaven to the other; and heape his hoards unto the starres: yet his heart would be as hungry after more riches, as if he had never a penny, and much more: Such is GODS curse upon that man which makes his gold his god. And this insatiablenesse in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man begets cruelty and oppression of others, and perpetual want of contentment and comfort in that he hath already. Sweetnes of gaine makes him many times drinke the bloud &amp; eat the flesh of the oppressed. He begins first (if he be of power and place) to grind the faces of the poore; then to pluck of their skins, then to tear their flesh, then to break their bones, and chop them in peeces as flesh for the pot, and at last even to eat the flesh of GODS

people. That is; first to weary them out with petty wrongs and extraordinary occasions, to vexe them with new conditions, and unconscionable encroachments: and at last to wring their pensive soules from their wasted and hunger-starv'd bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with extremity of oppression, and cruelty of covetousnesse. And that which is a just curse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the covetous man; he is ever infinitely more tormented with the want of that which he doth immoderately and unnecessarily desire, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and comforted with the enjoyment of those things he doth presently possesse. The ambitious man, if he be disgrac'd and over-top'd by any grand opposite and counterfactionist, or derided and revil'd with baser and inferiour contempt, or neglected by omission of some due observance and ceremony of state: he (I say) is more griev'd, if he want grace, for some such little default in the attributions of his place, and want of complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall respect in that measure, and of such men as he desires; than he hath glory and pompe in his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est place. This is cleare in <hi>Haman;</hi> though he was compassed and crown'd with such undeserved and extraordinary precedency and pompe; yet this one little thing, because <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not bow the knee and do reverence to him at the Kings gate, did utterly marre and dissweeten all the other excellencies of his new advancement, and extraordinarinesse of the Kings favour: See <hi>Hester</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>And Haman told his wife and friends of all his glory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But all this</hi> (saith he) <hi>doth nothing availe me as long as I see Mordecai the</hi>

                  <hi>Iew sitting at the Kings gate.</hi> As it is thus in ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in great men that are gracelesse; they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times take more to heart (out of the pride of their hearts) the want of some one circumstantiall observance, and of reverence from some one man; than they heartily enjoy all the other glory of their place: so it is also with the covetous man; though already he hath more than enough; yet some greedy wish of a new addition doth more torture his heart, than the rowing amongst al his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wealth can rejoyce it. <hi>Ahab,</hi> though he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready<note place="margin">1 King. 21. 4.</note> in his hand the riches, glory, pleasures, &amp; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of a kingdome, yet after he had cast his covetous eye upon poor <hi>Naboths</hi> vinyard w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was near his palace, his heart did more afflict and vex it self with greedy longing for that bit of earth; than the vast and spacious compasse of a kingdome could counter-comfort. He could take no joy in the beauty of a crowne, and largenesse of his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all command, because his poore neighbour would not deprive himselfe and all his posterity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of his fathers, which his ancestors had enjoyed time out of mind.</p>
               <p>For a counterpoyson against the greedy gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene of hoarding up riches; consider in what stead thy riches will stand thee upon thy bed of death; consider that speech of a poore distressed woman afflicted in conscience, whom I heard thus say in the agony of her grieved spirit, I have husband, goods, and children, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; I would give them all the treasures of the earth if I had them, and all the good I shall have in

this world or in the world to come, to feele but the least taste of the favour of GOD in the pardon of my sinne: she would in this case with all her heart haue giuen the warmest and dearest bloud of her heart for one drop of CHRISTS bloud to do away her sinnes.</p>
               <p>If corrupt affections fall in love with worldly pleasure, such as are surfeiting and drunkennesse, chambering and wantonnesse, lust and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, unlawfull sports and recreations, it begets a strange furious thirst and heat in the carnall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, which cannot be satisfied, but like the two daughters of the horsleech, which cry still, give, give; which is set on fire by hell: and therefore it is as unsatiable as that bottomlesse infernall pit; every taste of sensuality serves as fewell to increase the flame and fury of concupiscence: We see it in drunkards, who by drinking do not quench their thirst, and satisfie their appetite, but by their immoderate swilling both increase the burning thirst of their bodies and inraged intemperance of their minds. We heare it of wantons, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 2. <hi>Come let us enjoy the pleasures that are present,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let us crowne our selves with roses before they wither, let there be no pleasant meadow which our luxurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth not passe over; let us leave some token of our pleasure in every place, for that is our portion, and this is our lot.</hi> Every Carnalist feeles it in himselfe after once he hath given the reins to his concupiscence: he is like a strong man running headlong downe a steepe hill, though he would never so faine, he cannot stay himselfe, but run still faster and faster,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7155:148"/>
till he breake his neck at the bottome: If once he suffers the fountaine of originall pollution which naturally flowes out of his rocky heart, to have that free and full course: it will shortly gather in its passage many strong and heady streames of stub bornenesse and rebellion, untill by growing by little and little in strength and swiftnesse, it swell into a mighty and furious torrent, so at last fall with fearefull noyse and horrour into the gulfe of irrecoverable misery. In a word, after the heart of a man be set upon any sensuall delight, it feeds upon it as greedily as the horsleech upon corrupt bloud, it will burst before it give over. It will by no meanes part with its hold untill it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be broken with the hammer of the Word, or burst with the horrour of despaire. It drinkes so deepe and long of the empoysoned cup of carnall pleasures, untill the LORD fill it unto its brim, full of the cup of wine of his indignation, and bid it drinke, be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 27.</p>

Above all others, the true Christian which is onely of a true noble spirit, contemnes, scornes, and disdaines to be revenged upon any, though his undeservedly basest and greatest enemy: For,</p>

               <p>3.

               <p>4.

               <p>5.

                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:7155:151"/>Lord it is prodigiously strange and lamentably fearefull, that so noble and excellent a creature as man, prince of all other earthly creatures, by the priviledge of reason and enlightned with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beame of understanding, nature should be so furiously madded with its owne malice, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchedly blindfolded by the Prince which rules in the Aire; as, for the momentany enjoyment of some fewglorious miseries, bitter-sweet pleasures, heart-vexing riches, or some other worldly vanity at the best, desperatly and wilfully to abandon and cast himselfe from the unconceivable pleasures of its joyfull place where GOD dwels, into an infinite world of everlasting woefulnesse. For let a carnall man consider in a word his prodigious madnesse in this point. He might not onely in this vale of teares bee possest with a peacefull heart, which is an incomparable pretiousnesse surpassing all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated understandings: For I dare say this, I know it to bee true: One little glimpse of Heaven shed sometimes into the heart of a sanctified man, by the saving illumination of the comforting spirit, whereby he sees and feeles, that in despight of the rage of divels, &amp; malice of men; let sin and death, the grave and hell doe their worst, his soule is most certainely bound by the hand of GOD in the bundle of the living, and that hee shall hereafter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingly inhabite the joyes of eternity: I say this one conceit being the immediate certificate of the spirit of truth doth infinitely more refresh his affections, and affect his heart with more true sweetnesse and tastfull pleasure, then all carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,

and sensuall delicacies can possibly produce, though they were as exquisite and numberlesse, as nature, art, and pleasure it selfe could devise, and to be enjoyed securely as long as the world lasts. Besides this heaven upon earth, and glorious hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse even in this world, he might hereafter go in arme with Angels, sit downe by the side of the blessed Trinity amongst Saints and Angels, and all the truly worthy men that ever lived, with the highest perfection of blisse, endlesse peace, and blessed immortality: all the joyes, all the glory, all the blisse, which lies within the compasse of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, should be powred upon him everlastingly: and yet for all this he doth not onely in a spirituall phrensie desperately deprive himselfe, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under foot this heaven upon earth, and that joyfull rest in heaven, world without end: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so throwes himselfe into a hell of ill conscience here, and hereafter into that hell of Devils, which is a place of flames, and perpetuall darknesse, where there is torment without end, and past ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>The day will come, and the LORD knowes how soone, when he will clearely see and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with horrible anguish of heart, his strange and desperate madnesse. See <hi>Wisd.</hi> 5. 2, &amp;c. For, after the moment of a few miserable pleasures in this life be ended, he is presently plunged into the fiery lake; and ere he be aware, the pit of destruction shutteth upon him everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly: and if once he find himselfe in hell, he knowes there is no redemption out of that infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

What is it then (think you) to lie in fire and brimstone, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the unquenchable wrath of GOD world without end? Where they shall have nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them but darknesse and discomforts, yellings and gnashings of teeth: their companions in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse and vanity to ban and curse them: the damned fiends of hell to scourge them and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               </p>
               <p>Let no man deceive himselfe; such caveats as this are wont to be premised when men out of their carnall conceipts are peremptory to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and would venture their salvation (as they say) that it is not so.

And did not most of your hearts rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these words of mine (you must become fooles, or never be saved) untill I brought Scripture? Give me here leave (I pray you) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate in a few instances the meaning of the place, and the truth of your false and selfe-couzening hearts in obnoxiousnesse to the point. Suppose a messenger of GOD should deale faithfully with you, and tell you, that upon the LORDS Day you must not serve yourselves, and your owne turnes, in idlenesse, travailing, sports, gaming: in any earthly businesse, or mis-imployment whatsoever: but spend that whole blessed Day wholly and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in spirituall refreshing, heavenly businesses, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship, and holy duties: in meditation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creatures spiritually, upon the great worke

And here (were it incident and seasonable) I were able to procure Councels, and Fathers, and other authorities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currently to testifie and take my part, that upon the LORDS Day, <hi>we are to recreate our selves onely with spirituall delights:</hi> onely then to ply divine businesses, and to do those things alone which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our soules salvation.

               <p>Secondly, suppose a Minister should counsell you when you come home from the house of GOD, to take your Bibles, and call both your wives and children to the comparing together, and conferring upon those things which were taught: That the husband should exact of the wife, and the wife aske of the husband those things that were there spoken and read, or at least some of them: That you should set this law to your selves to be kept inviolably, and not onely to your selves, but also to your wives and children: that you would spend that one whole Day of the whole weeke, whereon you meet to heare the Word, in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7155:156"/>
of those things which are delivered: I say now in this case your carnall wisedome would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely condemne such counsells, as contrary to the counsell of great houses, as a way to become a By-word to the whole Country, and as savoring too rankly of a foolish strictnesse, and needlesse singularity. And yet this was <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> wise, holy advise above twelve hundred yeares agoe: For it giving the counsell, I have but rendred <hi>Chrysostome</hi> word for word in diverse places. <hi>Hom. 5. in Matth.

Would not your wisedomes thinke this more then need: And that it would bee a foolish thing, and much against your profit, to rob your selves, and servants of so much time from your worldly affaires? And yet here I could produce foure or five Fathers above a thousand yeares ago, pressing this point, and punctuall for my purpose.

               <p>Fourthly, If you were moved by the Ministery, to restore every halfe penny that you have any waies, at any time got wrongfully, or by any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked meanes, or that you detaine unjustly from any man: And then casting your eye backe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, How you are growne <hi>hastily rich,</hi> and by what waies you are come to a great deale of wealth, should finde very foule workes: would you not force your selves by a strong counter-plea of carnall reason, not to beleeve the point, and thinke it extreame madnesse at the instance, and prating of a precise companion, which understands not the world (for so or in the like manner would you speake) to part perhaps with a good part of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7155:157"/>
your estate? And yet <hi>Austins</hi> Rule of above twelve hundreth yeares standing, and confirmed concurrently by all Divines to this day, is, That <hi>Non tollitur peccatum nisirestituatur ablatum;</hi> No re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, no remission. And our owne Church tels us in the second exhortation before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: That <hi>without readinesse to make restitution, and satisfaction for wrongs done,</hi> the Sacrament as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as you come, <hi>doth nothing else but increase your damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus might I passe through all the points of Sanctification, and passages of holy life: And all the great men of the world, either in Learning, Wealth, Nobility, or Wisedome <hi>according to the flesh,</hi> would passe these censures upon them, and entertaine conceits of them proportionable to that of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> about the New-birth. They will not become fooles in the Apostles sense: And therefore they are soakt, and fast fettered in the gall of bitternesse, and bond of iniquity; and that above ordinary.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All ye great ones of the world in the sense I have said, As yee are very wise in your own conceits, and it may be truly so <hi>according to the flesh,</hi> so you are selfe-conceited, and soule-couseners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your spirituall state. For you thinke all bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then you, too precise, and all worse then you too prophane; and your selves onely to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily hit upon the golden meane; and pitch upon that well-tempered moderation in Religion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may enjoy temporall happinesse here, and eternall hereafter. Sleepe in a whole skin (as they
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:7155:157"/>
say) and with a good conscience: Live the life of pleasures, and die the death of the righteous. Whereas to be so conceited, is the very comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perfection of folly: And the very same attempt as to make two parallel lines to meet. You thinke yee have a reach beyond the Moone: To lie in some sweete sinne, and yet to nourish in your selves some hope of salvation. To have two hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, one in this world, and another in the world to come, which was never heard of: to weare two crownes of joyes: whereas IESVS CHRIST himselfe had the first of thornes. But alas! Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if you be saved in this condition, you must have a new Scripture, and there must bee found out another way to heaven, then any of the Saints ever went since the Creation or shall doe to the end of the world. And therefore we may say of you as <hi>Quintilian</hi> some where, of some deluded with an overweening conceit of themselves. <hi>That they might have prooved excellent Schollers if they had not beene so perswaded already:</hi> So if you did not thinke falsly, your selves safe already, you might be saved. But while you thus hugge the golden dreame of your mistaken states to GOD-ward like the Pharisees, the very Publicans and Harlots <hi>shall goe into the Kingdome of heaven before you, Matth.</hi> 21. 31.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, you that are great in the world in the foure forenamed respects, and meant in the Text; cannot possibly downe with, and digest downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right dealing and the <hi>foolishnesse of preaching</hi> as it is called, <hi>vers.</hi> 21. And that vtterly undoes you.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7155:158"/>
You like well enough, nay and much approve, and applaud such Sermons as King IAMES censures, in <hi>the reasons of his directions for preaching,</hi> &amp;c. which he there cals a light, affected, and unprofitable kind of preaching, which hath beene of late years (saith he) taken up in Court, University, City, and Countrey,—whereby the people are filled onely with ayrie nourishment, &amp;c. and I warrant you, not especially hating to be reformed or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, for these are not wont to discover your consciences, nor disturbe you in your present courses, they never terrifie you with any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of the evill day, neither torment you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time: but now let a man come with the <hi>foolishnesse of preaching,</hi> by which it pleaseth GOD (saith the Apostle) <hi>to save them that believe,</hi> with demonstration of the Spirit, and of power, and come home to the conscience: if he suffer not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to revell in the bloud of your soules without resistance, nor see you post furiously towards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall fire, but will tell you that the pit of hell is a little before you: In a word, if he take the right course to convert you, and shew you therefore onely your spirituall misery, that you may be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for mercy, &amp;c.

when such men preach, (and it may be you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine some intelligence for that purpose to prevent the torture) you will not, you dare not heare them for your hearts, except you cannot decline it for starke shame; or for a time or two to satisfie your curiosities, but as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, you become their enemies, because they tell you the truth: to which truth not to have listened in this day of your visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will herafter (when it is too late) torment you more than ten thousand fiery Scorpions stings, and gnaw upon your consciences with unknowne and everlasting horrour.

               <p>Upon which before I enter, give me leave to give you an account, why at this time I labour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to work upon your consciences for your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall conversion, than as heretofore to tender un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you counsels and considerations, for a more conscionable deportment in your severall publike places. When I well weighed with my selfe, the truth of that principle and position in <hi>Hooker, That it is no peculiar conceipt, but a matter of sound conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that all duties are by so much the better perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by how much the men are more religious, from whose abilities the same proceed.</hi> And finding by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all ages, and most of all in these worst and wofull times, that men of publike imployment and in high places, untill there be infused into their soules by the Spirit of grace an internall superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall principle and divine habit to worke by, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>aliquid</hi> CHRISTI (as they say) be planted in them by the power of the Ministry, they cannot possibly be universally thorow, and unshaken. Some strong affection, feare, favour, or some thing, will make them flie out and faile in some particular very fowly. Upon extraordinary temptation they will serve the times, and their

I say, upon this ground I have advisedly chosen to assay and follow this way at this time: for, if once you turne on the LORDS side in truth, you are won for ever to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible constancy, and conscionablenesse in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, regular and religious discharge of your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like duties: and will ever hold fast without partiality, cowardlinesse, or feare of mans face, that brave and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble resolution, <hi>Vt fiat justitia, ruat coelum,</hi> let heaven and earth be blundred together with horrible confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, before I make shipwracke of a good conscience, or be any waies drawne to do basely. Being incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the rock of eternity IESVS CHRIST bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for ever, you will stand (like unmooveable rocks) against the corruptions of the times, and all ungodly oppositions; and never before. For, in the meane time (say Ministers what they will) you will not be moved; but you heare our discourses of a faithfull discharge of your places, as ye would heare a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice; they leave no more impression upon your consciences, than a sweet lesson upon the Lute in the eare, when it is ended; for, then both the vocall and instrumentall sweetnesse dissolve into the aire, and vanish into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: It is too truly so with our Sermons upon your soules.

                  </gap>ry-men. I have seene (I speake of that which was long since, and at a Sessions) some of the choicest drunkards in a Country chosen for that service. Now is it not a pitifull thing, that Country businesses should be put into the hands of such as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour industriously, and with equall cunning, to plague an honest man, and deliver a drunkard? I say now, all this while, we thus discourse unto you, earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, and with a thirsty desire to do you good, and direct you aright, and by a divine rule in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duties proper to your places: we do but plow in the sea, and sow in the aire (as they say) except the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall seed of the Word hath first moulded you anew, and ye be brought by the <hi>foolishnesse of preaching</hi> out of the warme sun into GODS blessing, and from the fooles paradise of worldly wisdome, into the holy path of sincere professours; and thereupon prize and preferre the peace of a good conscience before all the gold in the West, and preferments in the world; which blessed change from nature to grace, is wrought by such stirrings of the soule, and footsteps of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as these: lend me, I beseech you, (while I passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long them) something more than ordinary attention: for, I know they will seeme strange things to all such great ones as are intended in my Text, and those who live at rest in their possessions, and have nothing to vex them. The naturall stoutnesse of their spirits will disdaine and scorne to stoupe to such uncouth humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7155:161"/>
and this mighty change. And the more they are men of the world, and wise according to the flesh, the greater repugnancy and reluctation shall they find in their affections against these spirituall workings, which makes the point good which was proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But yet without them in truth and effect (I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine not the measure and degree, GOD is a most free agent) they can never become either gracious men, or good Magistrates. They must upon necessity become such fooles, or they can never be wise unto salvation.</p>
               <p>1. If any of you then would come out of Satans clutches into the armes of CHRIST, he must be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, convinced, and cast downe with sight, sense, and trouble for sinne, as in my art of comforting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted consciences I have shewed.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, the point may teach us not to be gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of greatnesse, nor hunt ambitiously after high roomes.</p>
               <p>3. The point may serve as a soveraigne antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all discontent or fretting, when we see men of the world carrie all before them, &amp;c. We may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an holy indignation to see folly set in great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, so many servants on horse-backe, and Princes walking as servants upon the ground. But I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the time from prosecuting these two latter Uses. Let me briefly say two things more, and I have done.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first concerning what I have said: I have spoken much (as you have heard, my Text naturally and directly leading me thereunto) of the true misery, and spirituall madnesse of all great men in learning, wealth, nobility, wisdome according to the flesh. Least any be unjustly angry, and mistake, or caussesly grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:7155:163"/>
and gainsay, let me take up the words of that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent holy Father <hi>Salvianus</hi> about a thousand yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go in the like case. He having impartially discovered the horrible impieties of the noble and rich men in those corrupt times, tels them by the way, and it is my just apologie at this time. <hi>I do not</hi> (saith he) <hi>speake thus of any, but onely such as know these things to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. If their consciences be free, nothing that I say tends to their disparagement and disgrace: but if they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be guilty, let them know also, that they are not my words, but their owne consciences which vexe them.</hi> And in another place thus. <hi>Sith I speake not these things of all, but those who are such, none of you ought to be angry at all, which findeth not himselfe to be obnoxious; least thereby he make himselfe seeme, and be suspected to be of the number of those that are naught. Rather let so many as being guiltlesse and truly noble, abhorre such unworthy courses, be angry with them who disgrace the name of Nobility by their base and wicked behaviour: because although others be much worse, and scandaliz'd by them, yet especially they bring a great deale of shame and dishonour upon those who are of the same noble ranke.</hi> Take notice by the way, that by the Fathers words, those men are much too blame, who go about to dawbe over the disorders, and smother up the scandalous exorbitancies of delinquents in their owne profession, or to be concurrents for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from deserved shame and punishment. To give instance in the highest calling: A Minister which fals to drunkennesse, and ale-house-haunting, should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be publikely sham'd and censured, than a fellow of an inferiour calling. We do not honour the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry by having our hands in helping out such, but by disclaiming, and not owning them; well may we by
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7155:163"/>
so medling incurre suspicion of obnoxiousnesse: but never bring credit to our so holy a calling. I knew a Knight did penance at <hi>Pauls-Crosse,</hi> but at the same time I heard that many of his ranke in the City la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd to have him dis-knighted first, before he so publikely disgraced their order. Me thinks all well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded should be so minded.</item>
                  <item>2. The other is to my Lords the Iudges. My reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and noble Lords, give me leave to cloth the thoughts of the Countrey in a word or two. We much rejoyce in you, and blesse GOD for you, as men of singular and knowne integrity, speciall friends to the Gospell of IESVS CHRIST, and a great honour, and happinesse to these parts, and heartily pray that we may hold you still: and therefore my intreaty unto your Lordships is, that you would couragiously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance forward, and do like your selves, and nobly still. Draw our your dreadfull swords against the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Belial, as <hi>David</hi> cals them, which even threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a deluge; and be your selves as mighty torrents, armed both with j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>st and holy lawes, and the godly resolutions of your owne noble spirits, to beare backe, and beat downe the common crying, and raigning sins of our Countrey. In a word, be unto the oppressed and innocent as a refuge from the storme, but as a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tempest upon the face of every humane beast, and sonne of Belial. And O that you could helpe us, that GODS people might not perish for want of bread: Is it not a pitifull thing, that in such a deare yeare specially, it should be almost as hard a worke to get downe a wicked ale-house, as to win <hi>Dunkerke?</hi> That Maultsters should snatch (as it were) the graine from the mouthes of the poore in the market place, to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7155:164"/>
uphold these hell-houses, these nurceries of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: that Magistrates should be so unmercifull, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for GODS sake, nor the Kings sake, nor the poores sake, nor their owne soules sake to take the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most penalties for blasphemies, ale house-hauntings, drunkennesse, and prophanations of the LORDS Day? And were it not an honourable course, and worthy to have an universall contribution over the Countrey to pull downe something the excessive prizes in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-townes for the poore thereabouts, during this extremity? But I leave it to your Lordships charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wisdome to do the best you can possibly; that the bloud of the poore this yeare be not added to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready crying sinnes of the Kingdome, to hasten GODS judgements upon us, and our long since deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ruine. And in the meane time you need not feare the face of the proudest Devill, whether incarnate, or in his owne shape. For, while you thus advance GODS glory, and truly honour the King, assure your selves, the hearts, and teares, and prayers of all good men shalbe for you, and yours shalbe the crowne and comfort; when all prophanenesse and prophane op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites to the good way, all the enemies of GOD, and pestilent packings and complotments of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils agents against GODS people, shalbe buried in hell.</item>
