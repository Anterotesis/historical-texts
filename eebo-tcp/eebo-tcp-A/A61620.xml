            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>I. PETER 4. 18.</bibl>
               <q>And if the Righteous scarcely be saved,
where shall the Vngodly and the Sinner
appear.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Epistle was written by S. <hi>Peter</hi>
for the Incouragement of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
under all their Sufferings; but
these Words seem to carry so much
Terrour and Severity in them, as though none
but Martyrs and Confessours could have any
Reason to hope for Salvation, and all others
were to be left in Despair. Although Mankind
be not easily satisfied concerning the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
denounced against <hi>the Vngodly and Sinner,</hi>
yet the Justice of God, the Equity of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
the Freedom of their Choice, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Grace, and their Wilfull and Obstinate
Impenitency take away all just Cause of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint:
But, that <hi>the Righteous should scarcely
be saved,</hi> seems hardly reconcilable with the
Grace, and Design, and Promises, of the Gospel.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97977:4"/>
For the <hi>righteous</hi> here are not vain, proud,
self-conceited Hypocrites, such who <hi>think they
need no Repentance,</hi> but such who by the Grace
of God were brought off from their former
Sins,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18, 19, 20.</note> and were <hi>redeemed from their vain Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
with the pretious bloud of Christ, who had
purisied their Souls in obeying the Truth through
the Spirit;</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 2. v. 9.</note> Who were <hi>a chosen Generation, a
royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People;</hi>
yet of such as these it is said, <hi>If the righteous
scarcely be saved.</hi> But how can this agree with
the Infinite Goodness and Mercy of God decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Gospel, whereby Sinners are courted
and encouraged to repent with the Hopes and
Promise of Salvation? Did not <hi>Christ come to
save Sinners,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> call this <hi>a faithfull
saying and worthy of all acceptation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> and yet after
all, <hi>shall the righteous scarcely be saved?</hi> What
<hi>Ioy in Heaven can there be over one Sinner that
Repents,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 7, 10.</note> if after his Repentance it be so hard to
come to Heaven? Doth not Christ himself
invite those who are <hi>weary, and heavy laden,
to come to him,</hi> with a Promise that <hi>he will
give rest to their Souls?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 11. 28.</note> But what Rest can they
have, who, notwithstanding their coming to
him, do with so much difficulty attain to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rest? How can that be said to be <hi>an easie
yoke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 30.</note> 
               <hi>and a light burthen,</hi> which is of it self
so hard to be born, and the Reward which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97977:4"/>
is to make it easie so hard to be attained?</p>
            <p>If it be said <hi>that this Expression,</hi> that <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
are scarcely saved,</hi> is to be <hi>understood</hi> of some
Sufferings, and Persecutions, <hi>which the Christians
were then to undergo,</hi> and it was very hard <hi>for any,
though never so righteous, to escape; and that to
this v. 17. refers,</hi> I answer, That this doth not
clear the Difficulty; For from whence doth
this Necessity of Suffering arise? Is it not enough
to repent and forsake our Sins, but we must
undergo some Punishment for them in this
Life, although God remits that of the World
to come? But how is this consistent with
the Fulness of Christ's Satisfaction, and the
Freeness of God's Remission of Sins? And if
God's Justice be satisfied and the Sins be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
what need can there be that Persons
must here suffer for their Sins before they can
come to Heaven?</p>
            <p>So that for the clearing this Subject these
thing must be spoken to:</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. In what Sense the <hi>righteous</hi> are said to be
<hi>scarcely saved.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. How this is consistent with the Grace of
the Gospel.</item>
               <item>III. What Incouragement there is for us to
hope for Salvation, when the righteous are said
to be <hi>scarcely saved.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97977:5"/>
I. In what sense the <hi>righteous</hi> are said to <hi>be
scarcely saved.</hi> That may be understood Two
ways;</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) With Respect to Accidental Difficulties
arising from the particular Circumstances of
Times and Seasons.</item>
               <item>(2.) With Respect to the General Terms of
Salvation, which are common to all Persons
and Times.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. With respect to Accidental Difficulties ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from the particular Circumstances of Times
and Persons. For the Difficulties of Religion
are not alike in all Times, nor to all Persons;
for they are not like a Geometrical Measure,
which is always exactly the same; but rather
like a Voyage at Sea, which is to be managed
by the same Compass and to the same Port;
but it sometimes proves Calm and Pleasant,
and at other times Stormy and Tempestuous.
Which chiefly happens, when a Religion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
New, or goes about to Reform the Old;
for then it is sure to meet with all the Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the Passions, and Interests, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
of partial Men can raise against it. Its
true, he that <hi>stills the raging of the Sea, and the
Madness of the People,</hi> can, when he pleases, calm
the most violent Passions of Mankind, and make
way for the Reception of Truth in their Minds;
but he thinks fit by such means to trie and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97977:5"/>
discover what is in Men. Who never shew their
Passions more violently and unreasonably than
when they are mask'd under a pretence of Zeal
against <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Innovation.</hi> For that blinds
their Understandings, corrupts their Wills, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
their Passions, hardens their Hearts,
and shuts up all bowels of Pity and Compassion
towards Brethren. Thus it was among the <hi>Iews</hi>
towards the Christians, both in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and in
the several Places of their Dispersion: For they
looked on them as Apostates and Hereticks, and
treated them, not onely with the utmost Scorn
and Contempt, but with all the Fury and Rage
imaginable, and where their own Power fell
short, they called in the Assistence of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Governours, representing the Christians to them,
as an Upstart and Pernicious Sect, Seditious and
Turbulent, and therefore ought by all means to
be supprest: By such Insinuations the poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Provinces of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion,
were miserably harassed and proceeded
against as Malefactours. Thus it was at that
time when S. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote his Epistle to the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
Christians, who were scattered throughout
<hi>Pontus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi>
where there were abundance of <hi>Iews,</hi> and many
Converts, but very hardly used among them.
St. <hi>Peter</hi> having been imployed much among
them,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>(the Apostleship of the Circumcision being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97977:6"/>
to him)</hi> and being withdrawn into the
Kingdom of <hi>Parthia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Although <hi>Babylon</hi> were very much exhausted, by the Neighbourhood of <hi>Seleucia</hi> first, and afterwards of <hi>Ctesiphon;</hi> yet I see no Reason to conclude that <hi>Babylon</hi> was not then capable of having a Church in it, when S. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote this <hi>Epistle.</hi> For <hi>Iosephus,</hi> lib. 18. owns, that there was in <hi>Babylon</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the time when <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> was sent thither; and out of such <hi>a multitude of Iews</hi> a Church might easily be gathered. The Calamities which befell the <hi>Iews</hi> of those parts afterwards rather reach to the <hi>Country</hi> than the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And when such Numbers of <hi>Iews</hi> are allowed to have been after them in <hi>Ctesiphon, Nearda</hi> and <hi>Nisibis,</hi> which were all Cities in those parts, I see no cause to question that there were great Numbers of <hi>Iews</hi> at that time in <hi>Babylon;</hi> since even in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time, they are confessed to have been very numerous in <hi>Mesopotamia. Strabo,</hi> lib. 16. saith, <hi>that a great part of Babylon was deserted in his time,</hi> and so it might well be, and leave room enough for a Christian Church to be there notwithstanding. So that no reason appears sufficient to me to take <hi>Babylon</hi> in any other sense, than for the City generally known by that name, without flying to any Mystical sense, or a <hi>Strong place</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> bearing that name; there being less probability of a Church in a <hi>Garrison,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> describes it, than in the Remainders of so great a City.</note>
where he had planted
a Church at <hi>Babylon,</hi>
(not so desolate at
that time, as not to
be sufficient for such
a Number, as appears
by <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>)
from thence he
writes this excellent
Epistle for the Advice
and Comfort of the
suffering Christians.
He adviseth them to
behave themselves
with great Prudence
and Care of their Actions, to give no Advantage
against themseves, by doing any ill things; and
then, if it pleased God to call them out to suffer,
they ought not to murmur, or complain, or
mistrust his Gracious Providence towards them,
but <hi>commit themselves to God in well doing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pet. 4. 19.</note> 
               <hi>as unto
a faithfull Creatour.</hi> And if they did think it
hard for them to suffer these things, they ought
to consider, there was a Wise Directour of them
above, who had beforehand appointed such a
Series of Events, that although their Enemies
rejoyced to see them suffer in the first Place,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97977:6"/>
yet their Turn would come not long after, and
then these Enemies of the Gospel would feel
the Severity of God's Wrath and Displeasure
against them. Which is the meaning of the
foregoing Verse,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the time is come that Iudgment must begin
at the House of God; and if it first begin at us,
what shall the end be of them that obey not
the Gospel of God? i. e.</hi> Christ hath foretold
Desolation and Ruine to come upon the
Jewish Nation, for rejecting him when he
came to save them; but he withall saith, that
<hi>before these things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 21. 12.</note> 
               <hi>they shall lay their hands on
you and persecute you, delivering you up to the
Synagogues, and into Prisons, being brought before
Kings and rulers for my name's sake.</hi> Which implies
a severe persecution of the Christian Church,
begun by the <hi>Iews,</hi> but carried on by the
Governours of Kingdoms and Provinces. And
therefore saith the Apostle, although <hi>the time
be now come that Iudgment begins at the House of
God,</hi> yet it will not end there; but that which
is onely a Cup of Trembling and Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to them shall be a Cup of Fury and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to the Obstinate and Impenitent <hi>Iews.</hi>
The case was hard to the poor Christians, but it
would be much more severe towards their cruel
Persecutours; for if the <hi>righteous,</hi> whom God
loves, meet with such sharp usage by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97977:7"/>
for a time, the day will come when
God will avenge the Cause of his suffering
People, and make their <hi>ungodly and perfidious</hi>
Enemies feel the smart of his displeasure in
such manner that they shall not know where to
hide themselves, <hi>Where shall the sinner and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
appear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which I observe from hence is, that
there are some Accidental Circumstances which
depend on Divine Providence, which may make
the condition of some Men, as to Salvation, much
more difficult than that of others: For it is no
such easie matter <hi>to go through many Tribulations
into the Kingdom of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 14. 22.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> to be content to
be contemned and reproached as the worst of
Men; to be torn from Friends and Relations,
and all the Comforts of Life; to be cast into
loathsome Prisons, and more loathsome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in them; to be in continual expectation
of such cruel Usage and Torments, as make
Death be look'd on as their best Friend and
most seasonable Deliverer.</p>
            <p>If Sufferings do not rise so high, yet when
men cannot keep Faith and a good Conscience,
without hazarding the loss of what mankind
are apt to set too great a value upon, their Ease,
and Riches, and Expectations in this World,
even these make it harder for such Persons to
get to Heaven; because Sincerity and Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97977:7"/>
are the necessary Conditions of it, which
may be tryed much more in some than it is in
others. We must all have the same Journey's-end,
if we hope to get to Heaven, but some may
meet with a freer Road, and a calmer Season,
and better Company, in their Journey than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
However it happens we must go through
all, and not be discourag'd at any appearance
of Difficulties upon our way.</p>
            <p>But herein Mankind are apt to be deceived,
as though all the Difficulties lay in a suffering
Condition; whereas a soft, and careless, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
Life is rather more dangerous to their
Souls, because persons are less apt to suspect
their danger. He that is set upon by force and
violence endeavours to defend himself as well
as he can; but he that is betrayed under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Kindness is drawn into his Ruine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is aware, and goes on chearfully to his
own Destruction. Prosperity hath the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of an <hi>Opiate,</hi> for it stupifies and pleases at
the same time. The Temptations of the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Side are apt to allarm, awake, and rouse
up the sleepy Powers of the Soul; whereas the
gentle and easie Condition of Life either lays
them asleep, by a kind of Intoxication, or so
diverts them from all serious things, as puts
them out of the very way to Heaven. For, the
first thing in it is a steady and serious Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97977:8"/>
of Mind to doe what lies in them to go
thither; which can never be done without a
true Consideration of the vanities of this world,
how pleasing soever; and a fixed and settled
Judgment, preferring the Happiness of Heaven
before all the most alluring Pleasures of this
Life.</p>
            <p>So that the different Circumstances of Life
do make the way of Salvation more difficult
to some than to others.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; for there are many things
which make it more difficult to some than to
others, which are of another Nature. Some
Tempers are more flexible and pliable than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
more capable of hearkning to Reason;
and more apt to reflect on their own Actions;
whereas others are naturally Stiff and Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
who stick as fast to an Opinion or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
which they have once taken up, as if
they were fatally determined to it; and such
as these can hardly ever be convinced they are
in an Errour, unless by a Power superiour to
Nature. Some again, are very easily convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of a Fault, but very hardly reclaimed;
for that facility of Temper which makes them
easie to be convinced, lays them open to the
next Temptation, which they are not able to
withstand. These are always repenting and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
and beginning to reform, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97977:8"/>
the Grace of God, not able to go through
with it. Some are modest and bashfull Sinners,
whom Fear and Shame may restrain; others are
so hardned and impudent in their Wickedness,
that they deny even the very first Principles of
Morality as well as Religion, and not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to hearken to Reproof, but reject it with
Scorn and Indignation. And it cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that the Grace of God, working on mens
Minds in a way suitable to them, should have
as easie an Admittance into one as into the
other; for the one are like a House with doors
shut, but easily opened; the other like a House
not onely shut, but bolted and barracadoed.</p>
            <p>Again, some have had the Advantage of a
Pious and Religious Education, by which the
Principles of Piety and Vertue have made an
early Impression on their minds, and have been
a continual Check upon evil Inclinations; and
if they have been too weak to subdue them,
yet they have been strong enough to prevent
their Extravagancies, or to bring them to a
speedy Repentance, and to take up firmer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions;
and such are more easily brought to
themselves and settled in a vertuous course of
Life. But the generality of Mankind, through
a wretched Carelesness, mind not the early
Improvement of their Children in what is good;
and what education they give them tends to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97977:9"/>
any thing more than the Planting the sense of
God, and true Religion, and Vertue, in them.
It were well, if they would but let Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in their Children; but instead of that, they
often place such about them, who humour
them in their worst Inclinations, and give them
an early taste of Profaneness and Irreligion; so
that when they come into the World, they
run into all manner of wickedness, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it with greediness, having so quick a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of it; and then indeed it is a very hard
matter to bring them to Repentance; for that
is to take Shame and Dishonour to themselves,
to say they have been Fools, and have done
wickedly; and rather than doe this, they chuse
to go on in their Impieties, <hi>and treasure up wrath
against the day of wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those who magnify the Freedom of Will in
Mankind in this degenerate State, seem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them onely in Theory and Speculation;
not as they are, but as they ought to have been.
It is like that which they call the Spring in some
Bodies, which are apt to dilate and expand
themselves, but may be easily oppressed with
such a weight as makes it impossible for them
to inlarge themselves till it be removed. There
is no doubt in Mankind, considered in it self, a
Power of acting according to Reason, which
is the truest Freedom, (for a Power of acting
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97977:9"/>
otherwise is Weakdness and Folly,) but what
through the Natural Propensity to Evil; what
through the Power of bad Examples; what
through the violence of some Tempers and
Passions; what through the cloudiness of some
Understandings, from bodily Distempers; what
through the strength of evil Habits, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Dispositions, there is scarce such a thing
as Freedom of Will left, especially as to matters
of Salvation. So that if the Scripture did not so
plainly express the Necessity of Divine Grace for
the Conversion of Sinners (as it doth,) the mere
Consideration of the state of human: Nature
would make me believe it, supposing that any
part of Mankind be designed to be fitted for
Heaven. For although the Difficulties be not
alike in all, yet, of one kind or other, they are
such as cannot be overcome by our selves,
without the Power of Divine Grace <hi>Exciting,
Preventing,</hi> and <hi>Assisting</hi> of us.</p>
            <p>(2.) Having thus shewed what Difficulties
there are which arise from the Different Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of Times and Persons, I am now.
to consider those which arise from the Terms
of Salvation, which are common to all Persons
and Times.</p>
            <p>Here we must suppose Salvation to be the
thing aimed at, as the Chief End or Happiness
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97977:10"/>
of such Men; and here are two kinds of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
to be enquired into;</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) Such as are implied in the general Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of Happiness.</item>
               <item>(2.) Such as immediately relate to this kind
of Happiness.</item>
            </list>
            <p>(1.) Such as are implied in the general Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of Happiness: For Happiness is not a thing
of Chance or Necessity, but a Matter of Choice
and Design. It is a vulgar mistake (and I wish
it were onely among the vulgar) to account
those Happy, who are fortunate: But this
Notion of Happiness was unanimously rejected
by all the Ancient Moralists. Some of them
indeed have thought it repugnant to common
Sense, to call those happy who were under great
Calamities, <hi>i. e.</hi> who were, in the sense of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
miserable: But then they utterly denied,
that the best outward Circumstances could make
a Man happy; for that must depend upon the
Temper of a Man's mind, and his Improvement
in Vertue. These are some things which the
Moralists agreed in, which may be of great
use to us for clearing the Christian Doctrine in
this matter about the Difficulty of attaining
Salvation.</p>
            <p>(1.) That Happiness did consist in one Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Design of Life, <hi>i. e.</hi> that a Man must
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97977:10"/>
chuse one proper and chief End to himself, and
so order his Thoughts and Actions that he may
attain it. And therefore the dissolute and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
liver, that minds or thinks of nothing but
Eating, and Drinking, and Sleeping, and passing
away his time, was no more capable of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
than a Brute, which exceeds him in that
which he accounts the Happiness of Life.</p>
            <p>(2.) That there must be a Carefull and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
Mind to pursue this Design. And that
is by keeping close to those Maxims, which
were laid down as necessary to attain it. For,
according to their different Notions, they had
different Maxims, or Rules of Practice, either as
to Vertue or Pleasure, and as Men did observe
these, they were nearer to their Happiness: But
if they broke their Rules, they must blame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
if they missed of it.</p>
            <p>(3.) That any Man who desired to be happy,
must above all things take Pains about himself;
For without that they concluded it impossible
for a man to be happy, let his outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the World be what it would: For
that was too uncertain a foundation to build
such a Structure upon. Therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for any one that pretended to happiness,
to have a true Notion of what conduced to it
in his Mind; and to bring his Passions into
Order. For all the world cannot make one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97977:11"/>
whose Passions are violent and extravagant, to
be happy; no more than him to be a sound
and healthfull Man, that hath a Fever, and a
Dropsy, and Convulsions, at the same time
upon him. For the violence of Lust is an
inward burning Fever; Covetousness, or an
infatiable Desire of Riches, a perpetual Dropsy,
which encreases the Thirst by an endeavour to
quench it; and Excessive Anger is a Convulsion
of those Powers of the Soul which ought to
be sedate, and composed, in any one who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to Happiness. But when they considered
the force of natural Inclinations, they found it
was no easie matter to make the Unreasonable
part to be governed by the Reasonable. For
the less of Reason, the more wilfulness and
stubbornness; and therefore the harder to be
brought to Reason and to be govern'd by it. And
herein lay the main Difficulty; and after all their
Arguments, and Rules, and Directions, humane
Nature was found too refractory to submit; and
the violence of Man's Passions overthrew all
the plausible Schemes of Happiness which the
Philosophers had set up. To which I add,</p>
            <p>(4.) That those who consulted most the Ease
and Pleasure of Mankind, were forced to put Men
upon some hard and unpleasant things to make
any thing like Happiness to consist in Pleasure.
For they cast off all Riot and Excess, all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97977:11"/>
and Luxury, because the Pain
which followed exceeded the Pleasure; and
therefore they made Temperance and Chastity
necessary to the true Pleasure of Life. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the Happiness of Pleasure to a fixed and
setled State, and so took it off from that which
was onely sensual. They brought Mens Desires
within so narrow a Compass, that the true
Lovers of Pleasure would abhor such Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as they made necessary. And although
they could never conquer the Fears of Invisible
Powers, and of Death, yet they thought no
Happiness was to be had without it. So that
all were agreed, that it was impossible to attain
to any thing that looked like Happiness without
some real Difficulty, which was necessary to be
undergone, although the Success were uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>(2.) Let us now consider the Difficulties
relating to Salvation, or that Happiness which
Christians expect. And here I shall shew,</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) That it is far more Reasonable to go
through Difficulties, for the sake of it.</item>
               <item>(2.) That they are not such, but that we
may reasonably hope to overcome them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>(1.) It is more Reasonable to expect Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the way of Salvation. For the more
excellent and desirable the Happiness is, the
more it is worth the while for us to take pains
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97977:12"/>
about it; especially when there is a Certainty
of attaining it. The Moralists had but very
dark, and confused, and uncertain Notions of
Happiness; something they saw, but with a
very glimmering light: They found that all
Men desired it, and wise Men sought after it;
but wherein it lay, and how to be attained,
they could not agree. The most considering
Men were convinced it must be in the best
part of our selves, and that is our minds, and
in the greatest Perfection of that, <hi>viz.</hi> Vertue
and Goodness. But they met with insuperable
Difficulties in the way to it, and the best among
them sadly lamented the state of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
after all the pains and endeavours they
had used to rectifie their Opinions, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
their Passions. For they found it too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiff
and untractable, too much under the Sway
and Dominion of the sensitive Appetite, for
them ever to hope by the mere Power of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to bring it into such Subjection, as to
pretend to a total Conquest. And those who
refined Pleasure so much, as to make it a
Happiness fit for Mankind to own, did make
a Happiness just as they made their Gods, <hi>viz.</hi> a
Fine, Subtil, Airy, Pleasant No-thing, or that had
no Solidity in it: For the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Happiness,
with all its Refinements, was rather a matter
of Speculation than Practice; and after all was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97977:12"/>
not worth so much pains about it, but like the
Gourd, which after its paring, and cleansing,
and dressing, is fit onely to be cast upon the
Dunghill.</p>
            <p>But it cannot be said that the Happiness
offered to Christians is of such a Nature: For
it is really the best, the most valuable and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Good, not promised to be enjoyed in this
mean, despicable, and uncertain state of Life,
but reserved for a more free, spiritual and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
State.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 4.</note> So our Apostle calls it, <hi>an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
incorruptible and undefiled, and that
fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.</hi> Such
is the Condition of the World without us here,
and of the Passions and Infirmities within us,
that it is a vain thing to expect a true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be enjoyed in this Life; the utmost we
can hope for, is to be prepared for a better;
and God knows there is Difficulty enough in
that. We have Hearts so vain and sensual, so
addicted to the Pleasures and Impertinencies of
this World, so prepossessed with the Objects of
Sense, that it is no easie matter to bring them
so much as in earnest to consider of another
World. But it is yet harder to fix the Thoughts
of it upon our Minds, so as to make a deep
Impression upon them, as they must do, if we
make the Happiness of Heaven our Chief End
and Design. Supposing that Paradise were still
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97977:13"/>
upon Earth in its first Glory, and to be found
by the Description which <hi>Moses</hi> gives of it; a
man may think often concerning it, where it
lies, what the Rivers are by which it is to be
discovered; but all this amounts but to a mere
Speculation: But suppose that he takes up a
Resolution to go thither, what other kind of
thoughts hath he then about it, as to the Truth
and Certainty of the Place, and the Way that
leads thither, and the Difficulties he is like
to meet with? Which make another kind of
Impression than the former dry Speculation did.
If a Man doth not think Heaven worth all
the Pains and Difficulties which lie in our way
to it, he never yet had one serious and beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
thought concerning it. For the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
proposed is really so great and invaluable,
that the more we think of it, the more we shall
esteem it, and the more we shall despise and
triumph over the greatest Difficulties in order
to it; it being no less than the Perfect Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the most Perfect Good, in a most
Perfect State of Life, and nothing can be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by humane Nature greater than this.</p>
            <p>(2.) The Difficulties in our Way to Salvation
are not such, but we may reasonably hope to
overcome them; <hi>i. e.</hi> if we set our selves about
it; otherwise a very mean Difficulty will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
too great for us. Therefore we must
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97977:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
suppose not onely a willing Mind, but a firm
Resolution to doe what lies in us. And there
are two things to shew that we may hope to
overcome them;</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) That the most difficult Duties are in
themselves reasonable to be performed by us.</item>
               <item>(2.) That God offers his Gratious Assistence
for the Performance of them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>(1.) That the most difficult Duties are in
themselves reasonable. I mean such whose Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
doth not arise from accidental outward
Circumstances; but from a respect to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state and condition of humane Nature.
Such as,</p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>True Repentance;</hi> which is one of the
hardest Works of a Man's Life, when he hath
been long engaged in a Course of Sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Conscience. It is not hard for such a
one to be made sensible that he hath done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss;
for he that acts against his Judgment is,

               <hi>apt to Repent, i. e.</hi> to find
fault with himself for his own Actions, and to
resolve to amend. There is a sort of Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against Sin, which is consistent with the
Practice of it, which is called by the Casuists,
<hi>Attritio Impoenitentium;</hi> but they say it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a purpose of forsaking it, if there be such
a purpose that they say is <hi>Attritio Poenitentium;</hi>
but if it be an ineffectual Purpose, the Scripture
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97977:14"/>
no where calls it <hi>Repentance.</hi> For as long as the
habitual Practice continues, it is certain that
man's Love to his Sin exceeds his Hatred of it;
and what Repentance can that be which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with a prevailing Love of Sin? When
persons were first made Christians, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
was easily discerned, whether true or
false, because it was a publick and sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of all their former Sins; but when
men have accustomed themselves to Sin under
a Profession to renounce their Sins, it is a harder
matter to find out the Sincerity of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
as to those Sins. And here a difference
must be made as to the Nature and Kind of
Sins: For there are some Sins which all agree
to be Sins, yet is a hard matter to convince
Persons that they are guilty of them, such as
<hi>Hypocrisie, Schism,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which men will
find something to excuse themselves from, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the clearest Evidence against them.
Some are such Strangers to themselves, that
they do not suspect themselves for those Sins
which others easily discern in them, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the case of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Superstition.</hi> It cannot be supposed
that Persons should so particularly repent of such
Sins which they are not sensible of; but where
Self-love blind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it cannot excuse. And where
such evil habits prevail, persons must repent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:97977:14"/>
and search, and examine themselves in order
to a particular Repentance. There are other
Sins which are really perpetual burthens to a
good Mind, but it knows not how to get rid
of them with the utmost Care; such as inward
Motions to Sin, sudden Heats and Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
mixt Infirmities, Coldness in Devotion,
Distractions in Prayer, and many Omissions
of Personal Duties; in such Cases as these,
if we do not allow Sincerity of Repentance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
through Amendment, we make a General
Repentance insignificant, and make the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many good Men desperate; for none
can be saved without true Repentance. And if
there can be no true Repentance without actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
forsaking all such kinds of Sins, there is no
such thing as true Repentance to be found.
But there are other Sins of a more dangerous
and malignant Nature, which argue a very bad
Mind; such as <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Hatred, a rooted
Aversion to what is Good;</hi> and <hi>a strong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Evil.</hi> There are some Sins that are
gross and notorious, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>The lusts of the Flesh are manifest; i. e.</hi> such Sins
are easily known to be Sins, and Mens Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
condemn them even while they commit
them; such as <hi>Murther, Adultery, Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Injustice, Perjury,</hi> and such like. Of
which the Apostle after declares, <hi>That they who

as implies not merely a dislike and sorrow
for them, but a thorough Change of a Man's
Mind, and the Course of his Life, with respect
to them. And surely it is no easie matter to
new mold the Temper of ones Mind, and to
turn the Tide of our Actions; to break off our
beloved Sins, and to bring forth fruits worthy
of Repentance. This is indeed a hard Work;
but yet it is a most reasonable Work. It is hard,
but it is like the taking violent Physick in some
Diseases, where the humour must be purged
out, or the Party must dye; the Uneasiness is
not to be considered, but the Necessity; and
in such a Case the Mind cannot be at Ease till
it be done. So that the very Difficulty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
lays the Foundation for greater Peace
of Mind afterwards. And who will think much
of such a Difficulty, which is so necessary to
Peace with God and his own Conscience?</p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>The Love of God is above all things.</hi>
This is so Fundamental a Duty, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
place our Happiness in God without it. For
if we do not love God above all things, we
must love somewhat else so; and whatever we
love above all things, that we make our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
But I am affraid the greatest part of the
World love all things above him: For we are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97977:15"/>
to judge of Mens love and esteem by what
they court, and pursue, and desire, and delight in;
it is impossible there should be such a Love of
God, where the Stream of the Affections and
Course of Actions run quite another way; I
mean, to the vanities of this World, of which
the Apostle hath said,<note place="margin">1 Joh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 15.</note> 
               <hi>If any man loves it, the
love of the Father is not in him.</hi> But this is a hard
Point: For some degree of love to this World
is allowable; else how can we thank God for
the Comforts of it? And all Persons who know
God do grant, that his Perfections are far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the World, and therefore they seem
to have a value and esteem for him above it.
We must here distinguish a Notional Esteem
from that which is Practical. A Notional E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
implies no more than a mere Conviction
that God must exceed all the Excellencies which
are scattered in the Creatures; but a Practical
Esteem is, when the Acts of our Souls towards
him are suitable to the Apprehensions we have
in our Minds concerning him. When we adore
his infinite Perfections, and delight in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
of them; when we desire to doe all
things pleasing to him, and avoid what we
know to offend him; when we believe, and
hope, and trust in him, and commit our selves
to his Conduct in this World, in hopes of being
happy with him in another. This is the Love
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97977:16"/>
of God above all things; but alas! Where is
this Love of God to be found? It is no very
hard matter to work up a heated and devout
Imagination to the Fancy of Raptures and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasies
and Mystical Unions;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 3.</note> but after all, <hi>This
is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments.</hi>
As the true Love of a Prince is not to flatter
and admire him, and watch for his Smiles; but
to observe his Directions, and obey his Orders,
and to doe what is most for his Service. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
such a Love of God be hard to those
whose hearts are full of carnal Affections, and
are taken up with the Follies and Vanities of
this World, yet we cannot take one true step
in the way to Heaven without the Love of God.
For even those who have most corrupted the
Doctrine of Repentance do confess, that there
can be no true Contrition of Sin, which is not
founded on the Love of God as the Principle
of it, and however they have dangerously flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and deceived those who are so weak to
believe them, that Attrition with the Sacrament
of Penance is sufficient to put men into the state
of Grace; yet St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys must have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
virtue, if they can change Nature
into Grace, or Fear into Love, or mere Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Conscience into true Repentance.</p>
            <p>But although such a Love of God above all
things be so hard a thing to minds prepossessed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97977:16"/>
with the Love of other things; yet no one can
deny that it is the most reasonable Duty in the
World. The very Thoughts of God, if they
are such as we ought to have, imply, that he
is the Best, the Wisest, the most Perfect Being,
and therefore the most amiable and desirable
Object. And whither then should the most
natural Stream of our Affections run, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him? What do we mean to suffer so
much earth and filthiness to obstruct the free
passage of them in their most proper Course?
What can we meet with in this deceitfull
World, that can bear the least proportion to
such Infinite Goodness? Oh what a difference
is there between our Reason and our Love?
We verily believe that God deserves our Love
above all things, and yet how small a share
hath he in it? We love what we profess to
despise above all things, <hi>viz.</hi> our Sins and
this vain World; and we really too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
what we still profess to love above all
things, <hi>viz.</hi> God and our Eternal Happiness. O
miserable condition of Humanity! Made to be
Happy, and yet fond of Misery; Loving what's
vain, and yet despising Vanity; Hating what's
Good, and yet accounts it best; And therefore
fittest for our Choice and Love. The Love of
God above all things is so just and reasonable,
that those who doe it least approve it as the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97977:17"/>
most excellent Imployment of our Minds;
and those that doe it most, think they fall short
of what God deserves from them. The more we
know of God, the more we know that we ought
to love and delight in him; and all our Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in the Practice of it can never make us
think it is unreasonable to love Him above all
things, without whom nothing can make us
happy, and who alone can doe it.</p>
            <p>(3.) <hi>Vniversal Holiness of Heart and Life.</hi>
If this were not necessary to Salvation, our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
would not have pressed it with so much
earnestness as he doth;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 14, 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>As obedient children, not
fashioning your selves according to the former lusts
in your ignorance, but as he which hath called you
is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
because it is written, <hi>be ye holy, for I am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. 11.</note>
Again, <hi>Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as
Strangers and Pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts
which war against the Soul.</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. 2.</note> And again, <hi>That
he no longer should live the rest of his time in the
flesh, to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</hi>
This is a hard saying to Mankind, who part
with nothing so hardly as with their Sins; yet
these must be parted with, if ever we hope to
get to Heaven. I do not say, that a Perfection
in Holiness is required, (for that were to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Happiness in this World, since there can
be no perfect holiness without it,) but there
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97977:17"/>
must be a constant, uniform, and sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
after it; by avoiding all known and
wilfull Sins, and doing all our Duties to God
in such a manner as our Conscience cannot
charge us with gross Neglect or Insincerity.
There are some things we cannot say are down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Sins; yet if they lead to them; if they
indispose our Minds to God, and his Service;
if they tend to Lightness and Vanity, and
make us more easie to entertain the Devil's
Temptations, we ought to avoid them as the
Snares of the Devil. So, on the other side,
there are some things which we cannot say are
plain, and express, and necessary Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
yet they tend so much to keep up the
Life and Spirit of it, that a general Design of
Holiness is enough to recommend them. As
to positive Duties of Religion, we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
fix the Time, and Measure, and Season
of their Performance, which must vary accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Circumstances; but this we can say,
that the more Persons set themselves to the
Practice of Holiness, and the greater Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they make for another World, the more
they will delight in the performance of God's
Service, and the more ready to embrace any
Opportunities for it. Those who would have
all Religious Duties determined as to the
Circumstances of them, are like Men who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97977:18"/>
would have punctual Rules set down, how
often two Friends should converse with each
other, and how long time they are to stay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
True Friendship will need none of
those things, but will incline them to embrace
the best opportunities for mutual Conversation,
lest too long distance beget a Coldness first,
and then the Friendship dissolves. It is no hard
matter to pray as far as words go; but to
pray with Zeal and Devotion, to attend upon
God with that seriousness of Mind we ought
to doe, will require our utmost Attention.
And it is no easie matter to keep our Minds
composed and fit to converse with God in
Prayer, and other solemn Duties of Religion.
But as hard as this appears to us, it is most fit
and reasonable that we should doe it: For what
an unbecoming thing it is to worship God in a
careless, trifling, perfunctory manner; as
though nothing less deserved the imploying
the Vigour of our Minds about, than the
Service of God. But how can we love him
with all our Hearts, if we do not serve him
with all our Mind and Strength.</p>
            <p>(4.) <hi>Resignation of our selves to God;</hi> This
the Apostle calls <hi>casting all our Care upon him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 7.</note>
This is a very wise Duty if we can attain to it,
because it eases our minds of many Fears and
Perplexities, both as to our selves and others:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97977:18"/>
But it is no easie thing to set our minds free
from solicitous thoughts, about possible Evils.
We cannot mend our Condition, nor prevent
what is determined by our most anxious Care;
but we may enjoy our selves with far greater
Peace and Tranquillity, if we can be content to
commit our selves to the best Conduct, and
that is of him that Governs the World. And
whatever strugglings we may find within our
selves about it, yet the more we search, and
weigh, and consider things, the more we shall
be satisfied, that the Resignation of our selves
to God, as to all our Concernments in this
World, is the best means to calm our Passions,
to abate our Fears, to prevent our Impatience,
and so to attain to that <hi>Ornament of a meek and
quiet Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>which is with God of great Price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if all these Duties be so necessary to
our being saved, and we lie under such
Difficulties as to the Performance of them,
their appearing to be Reasonable makes our
Condition so much worse: For to find it so
hard to doe what we are convinced is most
Reasonable to be done, is one of the worst
Circumstances of our Condition. Its true we
do not want Faculties of Understanding and
Will; but what then, if our Moral Indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
make these useless to our Spiritual Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?
A man that is like to be stifled in a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97977:19"/>
large Vessel full of Downy Feathers, cannot
complain of the hardness of what he lies upon,
for all things feel soft and easie about him, yet
he may be stifled with them; our evil Habits,
and corrupt Inclinations, have nothing that
feels hard or troublesome to us; but if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
overcome them, they will certainly Ruine
and Destroy us. There is therefore a Necessity
of a higher Principle of Divine Grace to enable
us to break thorough all these Difficulties.
Which Grace is so abundantly promised by
the Gospel to those who seek it, that it comes
at last to be our own fault, if we be not
saved.</p>
            <p>II. And this helps us to Reconcile the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Salvation, with the Easiness of the
Terms of the Gospel: For that which is
not onely hard, but impossible to us, in our
own strength, may, by the mighty Power of
Divine Grace, become not onely possible but
easie to us: And withall those things are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
easie which bring ease, and that is a
light burthen which rids one of a far harder.
And thus the Commands of Christ, however
hard in themselves to us, yet being considered
with the Grace of the Gospel, and the blessed
effect of inward Peace, which follows Sincere
Obedience, even <hi>his Yoke,</hi> which keeps us most
in, may be said to be <hi>Easie, and his Burthen,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97977:19"/>
which sits hardest upon us, may be said to be
<hi>light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. And from hence we see what Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
there is still for us to hope to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
if we be <hi>righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is none for the <hi>Vngodly and Sinner;
i. e.</hi> for the profane contemner of God and
Religion, or for the wicked Liver. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may flatter themselves with vain and
presumptuous hopes, there is no more ground
to think that the <hi>righteous shall be saved,</hi> than
that <hi>the ungodly and sinner shall not:</hi> For both
are alike made known by the same Word of
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">But what Comfort is it (may some say)
to hear that <hi>the righteous are scarcely saved,</hi>
when we are so conscious to our selves of
our own unrighteousness? If we could think
our selves <hi>righteous</hi> before God, there were
some hopes, but we are Sinners; and if we
should deny or excuse it, we should be so
much more so; what hope can there be then
for us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I shall answer, and conclude.</p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>The</hi> righteous <hi>here spoken of were once
great Sinners;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>for St.</hi> Peter <hi>mentions</hi> their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
lusts,<note place="margin">4. 3.</note> and working the will of the Gentiles in
lasciviousness, lust, excess of wine, revellings, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetings,
and abominable idolatries. <hi>Yet these are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97977:20"/>
said,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. 18, 19.</note> to be redeemed from their vain conversation
by the precious bloud of Christ;<note place="margin">1. 3, 4.</note> and to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
again to a lively hope of an inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is therefore, not merely a Possibility of
being saved, but a just and grounded Hope, if
we renounce our former Sins, and become righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
according to the Terms of the Gospel;
<hi>i. e.</hi> if we sincerely repent of our Sins, and turn
from them, and live the rest of our time, not
to the Lusts of Men,<note place="margin">4. 2.</note> but to the Will of God.
But if God had declared, that he expected from
Mankind an entire and perfect Righteousness
without any Sin, it were all one, as to publish
a general and irreversible Decree of Damnation
to all,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 23.</note> 
               <hi>for all have sinned and come short of the
glory of God.</hi> From whence the Apostle well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
that Men cannot save themselves: But
God, of his infinite Pity and Mercy towards
the deplorable Condition of Mankind, hath
found out a way to save them, <hi>by the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is in Christ Iesus, whom he hath made a
propitiation for their sins.</hi> Although therefore as
to our selves we have no hopes, yet herein
God hath magnified his abundant Love towards
Sinners, that although they have sinned to a
high degree, yet if they be so far wearied with
the burthen of their Sins, as to take Christ's
Yoke upon them, then he hath promised Ease
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97977:20"/>
and Rest to their Souls, which is the greatest
Blessing in the World, especially to Repenting
Sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">But (some may again say) we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
and sinned, and sinned and repented
again, and can hardly yet tell which will get
the better at last; we cannot say that we
have entirely submitted our Necks to Christ's
Yoke, for that requires a great deal more
than we can perform; how then can we be
thought Righteous?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer therefore,</p>
            <p>(2.) Where there is a sincere and honest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to please God, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
although Persons fail in the manner of
doing it, God will accept of such as Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
But where they please themselves in their
Unrighteousness, and go on in it, hoping that
God will accept some kind of Repentance in
stead of it; or, where there hath been long
struggling, and many Acts of Repentance, and
the Interest of Sin prevails; the Case of such is
very dangerous, but not desperate. For as long
as there is hopes of a true Repentance, there is
of Salvation; and there is still hopes of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
where Mens hearts are not hardned by
an incorrigible Stiffness: For, according to
the best Measures we can take by the Rules of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97977:21"/>
the Gospel, none are effectually excluded
from the hopes of Salvation, but such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
themselves by their own Impenitency.</p>
