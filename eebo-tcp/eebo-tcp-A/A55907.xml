            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Favourers of the <hi>Hind</hi> and <hi>Panther</hi> will be apt to say in its Defence, That the best things are capable of being turn'd to Ridicule; that <hi>Homer</hi> has been Burlesque'd, and <hi>Virgil</hi> Travested without suffering any thing in their Reputation from that Buffoonry; and that in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the <hi>Hind</hi> and the <hi>Panther</hi> may be an exact Poem, though 'tis the Subject of our Raillery: But there is this difference, that those Authors are wrested from their true Sense, and this naturally falls into Ridicule; there is nothing Represented here as monstrous and unnatural, which is not equally so in the Original. First as to the General Design, Is it not as easie to imagine two <hi>Mice</hi> bilking Coachmen, and supping at the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>; as to suppose a <hi>Hind</hi> entertaining the <hi>Panther</hi> at a <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Cell,</hi> discussing the greatest Mysteries of Religion, and telling you her son <hi>Rodriguez</hi> writ very good Spanish? What can be more improbable and contradictory to the Rules and Examples of all Fables, and to the very design and use of them? They were first begun and raised to the highest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries; where they wrote in Signs and spoke in Parables, and delivered the most useful Precepts in delightful stories; which for their Aptness were entertaining to the most Iudicious, and led the vulgar into understanding by surprizing them with their Novelty, and fixing their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All their Fables carry a double meaning; the Story is
<pb facs="tcp:64028:3"/>
one and intire; the Characters the same throughout, not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or chang'd, and always conformable to the Nature of the Creatures they introduce. They never tell you that the Dog which snapt at a shadow, lost his Troop of Horse, that would be unintelligible; a piece of Flesh is proper for him to drop, and the Reader will apply it to mankind; they would not say that the Daw who was so proud of her borrow'd Plumes lookt very ridiculous when <hi>Rodriguez</hi> came and took away all the book but the <hi>17th, 24</hi>th, and <hi>25th</hi> Chapters, which she stole from him: But this is his new way of telling a story, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the <hi>Moral</hi> and the <hi>Fable</hi> together.
<q>
                  <l>Before the Word was written, said the Hind,</l>
                  <l>Our Saviour Preacht the Faith to all Mankind.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What relation has the <hi>Hind</hi> to our Saviour? or what noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have we of a <hi>Panther</hi>'s Bible? If you say he means the Church, how does the Church feed on Lawns, or range in the Forest? Let it be always a Church, or always the cloven-footed Beast, for we cannot bear his shifting the scene every Line. If it is absurd in Comedies to make a Peasant talk in the strain of a <hi>Hero,</hi> or a Country Wench use the language of the Court; how monstrous is it to make a Priest of a Hind, and a Parson of a Panther? To hring 'em in disputing with all the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Terms of the School? Though as to the Arguments themselves, those, we confess, are suited to the Capacity of the Beasts, and if we would suppose a Hind expressing her self about these Matters, she would talk at that Rate.</p>
            <p>As to the Absurdity of his expressions, there is nothing wrested to make 'em ridiculous, the terms are sometimes alter'd to make the Blunder more visible; <hi>Knowledg misunderstood</hi> is not at all better sense than <hi>Undetstanding misunderstood,</hi> though 'tis confest the Author can play with words so well, that this and twenty such will pass off at a slight reading.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64028:3"/>There are other mistakes which could not be brought in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they were too gross for <hi>Bayes</hi> himself to commit. 'Tis hard to conceive how any man could censure the <hi>Turks</hi> for Gluttony, a People that debauch in Coffee, are voluptuous in a mess of Rice, and keep the strictest <hi>Lent,</hi> without the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of a <hi>Carnival</hi> to encourage them. But 'tis almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to think that any man who had not renounced his Senses, should read <hi>Duncomb</hi> for <hi>Allen:</hi> He had been told that Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> had written a Discourse of Humility;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant and</hi> Socinian, <hi>p. 62.</hi>
               </note> to which he wisely answers, That that magnified Piece of <hi>Duncombs</hi> was Translated from the <hi>Spanish</hi> of <hi>Rodriguez,</hi> and to set it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond dispute,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page 92.</hi>
               </note> makes the infallible Guide affirm the same thing. There are few mistakes, but one may imagine how a Man fell into them, and at least what he aim'd at; but what likeness is there between <hi>Duncomb</hi> and <hi>Allen</hi>? do they so much as Rhime?</p>
            <p>We may have this comfort under the severity of his Satyr, to see his Abilities equally lessen'd with his Opinion of us; and that he could not be a fit Champion against the <hi>Panther</hi> till he had laid aside all his Iudgment. But we must applaud his Obedience to his new Mother <hi>Hind</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page 90.</hi>
               </note> she <hi>Disciplin'd</hi> him severely, she commanded him it seems, to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> his <hi>darling Fame,</hi> and to do it effectually he publisht this learned Piece. This is the favourable Construction we would put on his faults, tho he takes care to inform us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pref.</hi>
               </note> that it was done from no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, but out of a natural Propensity he has to Malice, and a particular Inclination of doing Mischief. What else could provoke him to <hi>Libel the Court,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page 87.</hi>
               </note> Blaspheme <hi>Kings,</hi> abuse the whole <hi>Scotch Nation,</hi> rail at the greatest Part of his own, and lay all the Indignities imaginable on the only establish'd Religion? And we must now Congratulate him this Felicity, that there is no Sect or Denomination of Christians, whom he has not abused.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64028:4"/>
               <hi>Thus far his Arms have with Success been crown'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let <hi>Turks, Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> look to themselves, he has already begun the War upon them. When once a Conqueror grows thus dreadful, 'tis the Interest of all his Neighbours to oppose him, for there is no Alliance to be made with one that will face about, and destroy his Friends, and like a second <hi>Almanzor,</hi> change sides meerly to keep his hand in ure. This Heroick temper of his, has created him some Enemies, that did by no means affect Hostility; and he may observe this Candor in the Management, that none of his Works are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in these Papers, but his last Piece; and I believe he is sensible this is a favour. I was not ambitious of Laughing at any Perswasion, or making Religion the Subject of such a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle; so that no man is here concern'd, but the Author himself, and nothing ridicul'd but his way of arguing.</p>
            <p>But, Gentlemen, if you won't take it so, you must grant my Excuse is more reasonable than our Author's to the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

               <p>Ay I'gad, and without <hi>Morals</hi> too; for I tread in no mans steps; and to show you how far I can out-do any thing that ever was writ in this kind, I have taken <hi>Horace</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, but I'gad, have so out-done him, you shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd for your <hi>old friend.</hi> You remember in him the <hi>Story</hi> of the <hi>Country-Mouse,</hi> and the <hi>City-Mouse</hi>; what a plain simple thing it is, it has no more life and spirit in it, I'gad, than a Hobby-horse; and his <hi>Mice</hi> talk so meanly, such common stuff, so like <hi>meer Mice,</hi> that I wonder it has pleas'd the world so long.
