            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my Honoured Friend and School-fellow
Mr. A. OWEN.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE way of <hi>Dedicating</hi> now most in fashion, seems to
me to stand in as great need of a Reformation, as does
our <hi>Poetry.</hi> For, as we take nothing to be True and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
<hi>Poetry,</hi> but what is Light, Frothy, and has a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<hi>Air</hi> throughout it; so the generality seem to stand persuaded, That
an <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> loses its End quite, if not stuff'd up with gross
and open Flattery, sufficient to call a Blush into any modest Reader's
Cheek. But here it is a hard matter to judge, Whether the <hi>Impudence</hi>
of the Author, or the <hi>Vanity</hi> of the Patron (who believes all true that's
said of him) does contribute most to carry on this notorious piece of Folly.</p>
            <p>Now (<hi>Sir</hi>) tho our Early Friendship, and Intimate Acquaintance was
the Reason that prevail'd most upon me in presenting this small <hi>Essay</hi> to
You; yet, to speak truth, there was another Motive too, which made me the
more desirous of it, and that was merely upon the account of running coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the generality of <hi>Dedicating Poets,</hi> to try if a particular Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might have any small Influence in correcting the <hi>Poetical License</hi> they
take upon such like occasions: For here I was satisfied that I might come
off without the least flattering <hi>Glance,</hi> with one who (tho young) has
Experience enough to understand, that Personal Respect is not to be esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by the fine Complements and Flourishes of a Fanciful <hi>Pen.</hi> And
for my part, I think if our Poets go on at their <hi>old Rate</hi> but a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
we shall be apt to interpret Epistles of this sort as we do Dreams,
by the Contrary.</p>
            <p>The great Scandal that Poetry has of late been subject to, together
with the respect I always had for it, gave occasion for the following <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</hi>
For as I was considering how much this <hi>Art</hi> was esteemed
amongst our <hi>Forefathers,</hi> and how Venerable, nay, almost Sacred, the
<hi>Name</hi> of a Poet was then; Surely (thought I) the Former Honour,
and the Present Disgrace the <hi>Muses</hi> lye under, could never depend on
the different <hi>Capricio's</hi> of two divers Ages, but there must be some
more <hi>reasonable</hi> Ground for this matter, which if once discovered, will
give a very fair opportunity of restoring Verse to its <hi>Primitive</hi> Dignity.
Some there are who suspect, That the want of <hi>Genius</hi> in our Age has
<pb facs="tcp:57575:3"/>
given Poetry this <hi>deadly</hi> Wound: But they will soon find their Mistake,
if (laying aside the blind Veneration we have for Antiquity) they compare
the <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Moderns</hi> in any sort of Poetry, excepting the <hi>Epic.</hi>
So that we must seek out for some other Cause more probable than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
And what others may spy, I know not; but I think the great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
lies here, That Poetry is now no longer the <hi>Fountain of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
the <hi>School of Virtue;</hi> it is no longer a fit Trainer up of Youth,
a Bridler of the Passions and exorbitant Desires: But on the contrary,
he is reckoned the Ablest Poet, that is most dextrous at conjuring up these
<hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> to disturb the Calm and Quiet of the Soul. And this (if
I mistake not) is that which hath deform'd so great a <hi>Beauty,</hi> and cast
an Odium on that most Excellent Art, which was once the <hi>Pride of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
and Envy of Philosophers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have transiently remark'd in the following <hi>Verses,</hi> will (I
doubt not) be dislik'd by many of our <hi>Rhiming Sparks,</hi> for take but
the Liberty of Writing <hi>Immodestly</hi> from 'em, aud you have quite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
them off their <hi>Pegasus;</hi> they are quite <hi>Tongue-ty'd;</hi> 'tis
with them, as <hi>Horace</hi> says it was in the Reign of the old Comedy, <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusque,
Turpiter, obticuit, sublato jure nocendi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have said against <hi>Love</hi> upon the Stage, I would not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
so, as if I would have that <hi>Passion</hi> quite exploded; for I think
it one of the fittest Passions for Poetry, and capable of very great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but then I would have it very nicely and delicately handled; and
what might give the least Offence to the severest Modesty always cast in
Shades; for it is then only that this Passion is not to be allow'd, when it
goes beyond its bounds; and that is, when the Poet's Strokes are too
<hi>bold,</hi> and his Colours too glaring.</p>
            <p>I was told (which I my self afterwards found to be true) that a
great Part of my Design was already perform'd in the Preface to <hi>Prince
Arthur.</hi> However, that did not trouble me in the least, for I was very
glad to see so <hi>Eminent</hi> an <hi>Author</hi> of the same Opinion with me; since
I had laid a <hi>Rude Draught</hi> of my <hi>Reflection</hi> the last Summer, which
I then shew'd several of my Acquaintance. However, the <hi>World</hi> may
think this a <hi>Sham,</hi> and I am very willing to be thought indebted to so cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable
a Person for what I have said.</p>
            <p>I shall make no Apology for the <hi>Tediousness</hi> of my Epistle, since you
are too often guilty of the Contrary Vice in writing to your</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Real Friend,
and very Humble Servant.</signed>

REFLECTION
ON OUR
Modern Poesy.</head>
            <l>IF <hi>Poets</hi> be (as they pretend) <hi>inspir'd</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With <hi>Heat</hi> Divine, and Sacred <hi>Fury</hi> fir'd,</l>
            <l>How comes it then, that each Poetick Piece</l>
            <l>Gives now-a-days Encouragement to <hi>Vice?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Each <hi>Line</hi> (or else we think it will not do)</l>
            <l>With wanton <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Flames</hi> unchaste must glow.</l>
            <l>That scribling <hi>Fop</hi> that would a <hi>Poet</hi> be,</l>
            <l>First bids adieu to all his <hi>Modesty:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Invokes not <hi>Phoebus,</hi> but the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Wine;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Crowns his hot <hi>Temples</hi> with th' inspiring <hi>Vine:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The <hi>Glass</hi> (Dull Sot!) must make his Thoughts sublime,</l>
            <l>For in a <hi>Sober Mood</hi> what Bard can <hi>Rhime?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But sure Great <hi>Homer</hi> got not thus a Name;</l>
            <l>Nor Lofty <hi>Maro</hi> his Eternal Fame;</l>
            <l>Their Muses chaste as <hi>Vestal Virgins</hi> were;</l>

The Flame that thro' their Works so bright does shine,</l>
            <l>Was surely kindled by a Breath Divine,</l>

            <l>What anciently <hi>Devotion</hi> did begin,</l>
            <l>We have converted to the use of <hi>Sin;</hi>

            <l>Search'd the grave Precepts of <hi>Philosophy;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Hence 'twas he taught but what he learnt before,</l>
            <l>And practis'd those sound Rules his Writings bore:</l>
            <l>He doubly charm'd his <hi>Modest</hi> Audience,</l>
            <l>By good Example, and wise Eloquence.</l>

            <l>And now what weak Excuse, what vain Pretence,</l>

            <l>Not so did <hi>Orpheus;</hi> but with tuneful Voice,</l>
            <l>Taught <hi>Salvage Men</hi> that follow'd Nature's Choice,</l>
            <l>That wildly stray'd in shrubby Brakes all day,</l>
            <l>And herded with the common Beasts of Prey;</l>
            <l>E'en These he taught their <hi>Passions</hi> to subdue,</l>
            <l>Through <hi>Error</hi>'s Maze to follow <hi>Reason</hi>'s Clue,</l>
            <l>Their Mossy Caves and Grotto's to forsake,</l>
            <l>And fitter <hi>Dwellings</hi> for themselves to make;</l>
            <l>And that in Learning <hi>Greece</hi> did so aspire,</l>
            <l>Was wholly owing to his Sacred Lyre.</l>
            <l>Then let some <hi>Champion</hi> for the Muses rise,</l>
            <l>Who dares be obstinately Good, and Wise;</l>
            <l>Let him but turn the Stream of <hi>Helicon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And make It in its proper Channel run.</l>
            <l>He needs not fear his <hi>Bayes</hi> shall wither'd lye;</l>
            <l>Or that We shall despise his Poetry;</l>
            <l>For <hi>Virtue,</hi> when well dress'd in Comely Grace,</l>
            <l>Has surely Charms so lovely in her Face,</l>
            <l>We all should Vice forsake, and only <hi>Her</hi> embrace.</l>
            <l>But He must then take a peculiar care,</l>
            <l>No <hi>Wanton Scenes</hi> have in his Poem share:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57575:5"/>
A <hi>Plot</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> let him chuse, that's free</l>
            <l>From all Allays of fulsome <hi>Ribaldry,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Which in our <hi>Modern</hi> Plays too oft we see.</l>
            <l>Let not <hi>Immodest Love</hi> come in his Rhimes;</l>
            <l>Which to excuse, our Poets oftentimes</l>
            <l>Reply, They bring such Objects into view,</l>
            <l>To make us loathe those Passions we pursue.</l>
            <l>But this is False; They always move <hi>Desire,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Fan by degrees in us <hi>Unlawful</hi> Fire:</l>
            <l>For here the Poet's Warm Expressions move</l>
            <l>Th' <hi>Unthinking Herd</hi> such Passions to approve.</l>
            <l>Then let 'em be with Care remov'd from sight;</l>
            <l>If we'll be free, we must forget 'em quite.</l>
            <l>The Wiser Ancients did this Fault decline,</l>
            <l>And made their <hi>Tragedies</hi> more <hi>Masculine.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Each nervous Scene some Manlike Virtue taught,</l>
            <l>Untainted with the least Immodest Thought.</l>
            <l>Their <hi>Heroes</hi> were more Stern, and fit for Wars,</l>
            <l>Scorn'd whining Love, and Jealousy's fond Jars:</l>
            <l>But <hi>Ours,</hi> more fit for <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Childish Arms,</l>
            <l>Are <hi>Womens</hi> Fools, and Captives to their Charms.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Stage,</hi> which <hi>Terror</hi> should with <hi>Pity</hi> move,</l>
            <l>With us is wholly taken up in <hi>Love.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In this (as well as other Follies) we</l>
            <l>Too much affect the <hi>Gallick</hi> Levity:</l>
            <l>Thence our <hi>Romantick Heroes</hi> first we drew,</l>
            <l>Unlike our <hi>Arthur,</hi> and our <hi>William</hi> too.</l>
            <l>In vain it is, that Heav'n's Wise Providence</l>
            <l>Has by a Sea divided us from <hi>France,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57575:5"/>
If still their <hi>Fopperies</hi> we Imitate,</l>
            <l>And their vain Customs to our <hi>Isle</hi> Translate.</l>
            <l>We want not <hi>Genius</hi> for the <hi>Buskin</hi> Muse,</l>
            <l>Would <hi>Britain</hi> but all Foreign Aids refuse;</l>
            <l>Nor of our <hi>Language</hi> need we to complain;</l>
            <l>'Tis Pompous, Bold, and fits the Tragick Strain.</l>
            <l>Our Poets too that have wrote <hi>Comedy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Have <hi>Wit</hi> enough, but fail in <hi>Modesty;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They still forget the <hi>End</hi> for which they write,</l>
            <l>And mind not <hi>Profit,</hi> so they can <hi>Delight.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But he that wears the <hi>Sock,</hi> should carefully</l>
            <l>Purge all his Writings from Obscenity:</l>
            <l>And though the Age's <hi>Humour</hi> he expose,</l>
            <l>Yet no <hi>Unseemly</hi> things should he disclose.</l>
            <l>His Plays should be a <hi>Glass,</hi> where All might see</l>
            <l>How to correct their own Deformity.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Terence</hi> in this might justly claim the Bayes,</l>
            <l>Whose Lively Draughts succeeding Ages praise:</l>
            <l>By Him was taught upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage,</l>

            <l>One <hi>Virtuous Character</hi> you cannot see:</l>
            <l>Rather than want for <hi>Vice,</hi> we chuse to draw</l>
            <l>Strange Monsters, contrary to Nature's Law.</l>
            <l>True <hi>Innocence</hi> the Poet ridicules,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Honesty</hi> reserves for none but <hi>Fools.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His <hi>Gentleman</hi> he makes a Wondrous Sage,</l>
            <l>That's deeply read in Vices of the Age:</l>
            <l>His <hi>Mistress</hi> and his <hi>Cloaths</hi> employ his Care;</l>
            <l>Of all his Thoughts his <hi>Countrey</hi> claims no share.</l>

The <hi>Damsel</hi> too, e'er Fifteen Years expire,</l>
            <l>Is all o'er Love, and Wanton with Desire;</l>
            <l>Then strait all Filial Duty's laid aside,</l>

            <l>Her Husband's <hi>Kisses</hi> lose their wonted Taste,</l>
            <l>And stollen Pleasures always Relish best.</l>
