            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>WHereas upon the Petition intended and agreed upon in the Army, in <hi>March</hi> laſt, to have been preſented to the Generall, for the obtaining of our due and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary concernments as Souldiers; the Honourable Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> being unſeaſonably prepoſſeſſed with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py thereof, and (as by the ſequell we ſuppoſe) with ſome ſtrange miſrepreſentations of the carriage and intentions of the ſame, was induced to ſend down an Order for ſuppreſſing the Petition; and within two or three dayes after, upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſinformation, and ſcandalous ſuggeſtions, of the like or worſe nature, and by the indirect practice of ſome malicious and miſchievous perſons (as we ſuppoſe) ſurprizing, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe abuſing the <hi>Parliament</hi>; A Declaration was publiſhed in the name of both Houſes, highly cenſuring the ſaid Petition, and declaring the Petitioners, if they ſhould proceed thereupon, no leſſe then enemies to the State, and diſturbers of the publike peace. And whereas at the ſame time, and ſince, divers eminent Officers of the Army have been brought into queſtion and trouble about the ſaid Petition, whereby both they and the reſt of the Officers were diſabled, or diſcouraged for the time, from further acting or appearing therein on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe; And whereas by the aforeſaid proceedings and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof, the Souldiers of this Army (finding themſelves ſo ſtop't in their due, and regular way of making known their juſt grievances, and deſires to, and by their Officers) were inforced to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an unuſuall (but in that caſe neceſſary) way of correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and agreement amongſt themſelves, to choſe out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Troops and Companies ſeverall men, and thoſe out of their whole number, to choſe two or more for each Regiment, to act in the name and behalfe of the whole Souldiery of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Regiments, Troops, and Companies, in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57396:3"/>
of their rights and deſires in the ſaid Petition, as alſo of their juſt vindication and writing in reference to the aforeſaid proceedings upon and againſt the ſame, who have accordingly acted and done many things to thoſe ends, all which the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did then approve as their own Acts. And whereas after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (upon the ſending down of Field-Marſhall <hi>Skippon,</hi> and thoſe other Officers of the Army that were Members of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> to quiet diſtempers in the Army, freſh hopes being conceived of having our deſires again admitted to be made known and conſidered in a regular way, and without ſuch miſrepreſentations as formerly, the Officers and Souldiers of the Army (except ſome few diſſenting Officers) did again joyn in a repreſentation of their common grievances; and the Officers (except as before) did agree upon a Narrative accompt of the grounds, riſe, and growth of the diſcontents in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and their proceedings in relation thereunto, with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the beſt expedients, to remove or ſatisfie the ſame, both which were preſented to the ſame Members of the Houſe, and by them reported to the Houſe. And whereas the Parliament having thereupon voted, and ordered ſome particulars, onely towards ſatisfaction of our grievances, hath ſince proceeded to certain reſolutions of ſudden disbanding the Army by peeces, which reſolutions being taken, and to be executed before full or equall ſatisfaction given to the whole Army, in any of the grievances, before effectuall performance of that ſatisfaction in part, which the preceeding Votes ſeem'd to promiſe, as to ſome of the grievances, and before any conſideration at all of ſome others moſt materiall, (as by the reſult of a generall Counſell of War on Saturday, <hi>May</hi> 29. was in generall declared, and is now more fully demonſtrated, in particular by a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereupon, agreed unto by us:) We all cannot but look upon the ſame reſolutions of disbanding us in ſuch manner, as proceeding from the ſame malicious and miſchievous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and intentions, and from the like indirect practiſes of the ſame perſons abuſing the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and is as the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt us before mentioned did, and not without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and bloody purpoſes (for ſome of them have not ſtuck to declare or intimate) after the body of the Army ſhould be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded,

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas upon the Report made to the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> on Friday, <hi>May</hi> 21. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the grievances of the <hi>Army,</hi> That Houſe was pleaſed to paſſe ſeverall Votes ſeeming to tend towards the ſatisfaction of the Army in ſome particulars: and on <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> following (<hi>May</hi> 25.) to paſſe divers Reſolutions upon a Report from the Committee at <hi>Darby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57396:6"/>
concerning the disbanding of the Foot of this Army each Regiment apart at ſeverall times and places: We humbly declare, That the ſaid Votes of <hi>Friday</hi> doe come farre ſhort of ſatisfaction (as to the ſaid grievances) or to the deſires propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Officers in the concluſion of their <hi>Narrative.</hi> And that the latter Votes of <hi>Tueſday</hi> importing a reſolution to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the Army in part, before equall ſatisfaction bee given to the whole in the grievances or ſo much as any conſideration had of ſome others that are moſt materiall, and alſo before any effectuall performances of that Satisfaction with the Votes of <hi>Friday</hi> ſeemed to promiſe as to ſome of the Grievances, wee cannot but be much unſatisfied and troubled at it, as in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars following it may apeare we have cauſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The proportion of but eight weeks Arreares to be paid at disbanding, as it is unreaſonably ſhort of what is moſt due, and what we conceive may be paid, or might eaſily have been provided, ſince the Parliament hath ſo long had the whole Kingdome cleared, all trading and commerce opened, vaſt ſummes of money brought in upon Delinquents compoſitions and otherwiſe, and great foundations of ſecurity in their hands (beſides thoſe formerly engaged for the <hi>Scots.</hi>) And as it is but a meane reward for all our labours, hardſhips and hazards in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kingdomes cauſe, and a very ſlender Supply to carry us to our homes in a condition ſutable to the Parliaments honour and our ſucceſſe, and much leſſe to enable thoſe that have left good trades or other wayes of livelihood, and ſuffered much in their trades or ſtocks by ſo doing, to ſet up again in their former cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and conditions; ſo it is but little (if any thing) more then what hath been due to us ſince that time that wee firſt went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to have petitioned for our Arreares, and ſo not to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in Satisfaction towards former Arreares, which the Petition was meant for.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57396:6"/>2. In the Orders given for the ſtating of our Accounts, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Debentures for our Arreares by the Committee of the Army, we find no conſideration or regard had of our Arreares incurred in former Army or Services, which to the moſt of us are much greater then thoſe under the <hi>New Modell,</hi> intended to be ſtated by the Committee for the Army, as the <hi>Narrative</hi> of the Officers, Printed by miſtake under the name of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, did intimate before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We cannot but conſider, That (whatever the Officers expectances upon Debentures may prove) the private Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may well make little account of whatever part of his Arreares he receives not before disbanding, as the Reaſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in the <hi>Narrative</hi> doe ſhew. And whereas we heare of ſome Inſtructions paſt in an Ordinance for ſtating of Arreares, we underſtand that they direct 3 s. a weeke to be abated to Foot-ſouldiers for quarter, which being 6d. or 8d, <hi>per diem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> above the rate they ſhould have paid for themſelves, if they had timely had Pay where withall: It ſeemes very hard the poore Souldiers ſhould allow intereſt for the forbearance of his owne due.</p>
            <p>The like diſproportion we find in the abatements to Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Foot for their Quarters: in the abatement for Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Officers of Horſe and Dragoons, we find one third Part of the whole Pay to them due both for themſelves and their Horſes is to be defalked, though the full Pay for their Horſes is not allowed in the Account, unleſſe they make it appeare by Muſters that they kept their full numbers; and the third part of their full Pay, amounting to the halfe or neere the halfe of their preſent Pay, ſeemes an unreaſonable allowance for Quarters, eſpecially in the caſe of Captaines and Field-Officers. We find alſo no Proviſion made for private Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Horſe, or Foot, or any Officers in Commiſſion or not in Commiſſion, in relation to any Quarters diſcharged by them, but all ſuch are left abſolutely to abate the reſpective Rates for Quarters, during their whole time, whether they have payd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57396:7"/>
Quarters for any part of the time or no, whereas we know aſſuredly, and can make appeare, That all of them, during their Service in this Army (and moſt of them in their Service in the former Armies) have really diſcharged their Quarters for a very great part of the time, and many of them for more time then by the proportion of pay received, they were bound to have done, having without reſpects to that many times payd freely, as farre as their money would hold out, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of deſire not to be burthenſome at all to the Countrey as farre as they could, and partly upon expectation (grounded on the many promiſes and often renewed of conſtant pay for time to come) that money would come in time to pay them up, and re-imburſe them their full pay againe without defal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for quarters; we find it alſo provided. That no Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is capable of allowance or Debenture for Arreares unleſſe he deliver in ſuch Horſe and Armes with which he hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or a Certificate, that ſuch Horſe and Armes did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to the State, or elſe was loſt in actuall Service, which extends to the totall taking away from them thoſe Horſe and Armes of the States which they have uſed and preſerved in the Service, contrary to the favour allowed, and never (that we knew of) denyed in the disbanding of any other Army: And if that being but a matter of favour, the Horſe-men in this Service be thought unworthy of it, and muſt upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their Arreares, rebate for ſuch Horſe and Armes as upon diſbanding they thought to have beene given them, yet it ſeemes hard that ſuch as cannot deliver in thoſe States Horſe and Arms, which at disbanding they ſo underſtood to be their owne, and ſo perhaps have ſold or otherwiſe diſpoſed of, ſhould for that loſe their whole Arreares, or be incapable of account or debenture for any part thereof.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The viſible ſecuritie for what Arreares ſhould not be paid at disbanding (which the Votes of Friday May 21. ſeeme to promiſe) as it ſtands propounded in the Votes of Tueſday May 25. appeares not to be either a ſecuritie ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or to us viſible.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe that ſecurity of the Excize in Courſe (propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the Arreares of private Souldiers and inferiour Officers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57396:7"/>
is knwne to be already pre-ingaged for vaſt Summes amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to above a Million that are to take place before thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reares, nor doe wee know certainly that the Exciſe (which is yet but temporarie) will be continued for ſo long time as till our Arrears ſhall come out in courſe after the preceding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements ſatisfied</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe that ſecurity propoſed for Officers Arreares, <hi>viz.</hi> the profits ariſing out of Delinquents eſtates in the firſt Exception (eſpecially) being limited to ſuch as are not already diſpoſed of, it does not appeare what they will amount unto, or what the pre-ingagemens or pre-diſpoſures by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be, or what incumbrances of Debts, or limitations of Eſtates (as they were in the hands of the owners) may lie upon the ſame, none of which we would be any occaſion to defeat or avoid, ſo as to have the curſes and grudges of defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Creditors or ruined Families to lye upon us or our poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither the one ſecurity nor the other are yet, for ought we finde, or could well before the appointed times of disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, be ſo ſetled by Ordinance to the uſes propoſed (as the other Securities for monies borrowed by the Parliament have been) which we conceive requiſite to render the ſame indeed viſible ſecurity.</p>
            <p>The two firſt of theſe Reaſons we ſhould not urge ſo much, if we did not ſee other matters of ſecurity within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that would be much more cleare, (as Cathedrals and their Revenues, Forreſt-lands, &amp;c.)</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Ordinance voted to exempt from Preſſing, firſt is not, for ought we underſtand, brought in and paſſed before the appointed Disbanding. Next, by the Vote it ſeems not to intend the exempting of Voluntier Horſe-men from being preſt for Foot-ſervice. And laſtly, we underſtand not how it can be effectuall to particular Souldiers (when diſperſt about the Kingdome, and ſo journing or travelling where perhaps their former relation to this Army, or condition as Voluntiers in it may not be knowne, or not credited upon their words) unleſſe the Ordinance intended ſhall provide, That a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57396:8"/>
of their ſervice under the General's or their reſpective Field-Officers or Captaines hands (which they might ever carry about, or keep by them) ſhall be their ſufficient diſcharge from any Preſſe (if they ſhall fall under it.) And whereas ſuch Teſtimonials cannot eaſily be got by them after Disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the ſaid Votes for ſo ſudden Disbanding, and at ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, doe not mention or admit any thing of that kinde more then Paſſes from the Commiſſioners to carry them home.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Ordinance voted to give Apprentiſes the benefit of their time ſpent in the Parliaments ſervice, as alſo that for the maintenance of maimed Souldiers, and the Widowes and Children of men ſlaine in the Service were not brought in and paſſed before the appointed Disbandings, nor doe we yet heare, that they yet are, though we hope they will be.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Ordinance paſſed for Indempnity ſeems to make but ſlender proviſion for our quiet, eaſe, or ſafety, in relation to things done in the War as Souldiers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the things it provides for throughout the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, compriſed only in theſe terms <hi>(viz.) Things done by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of any Ordinance of Parliament, or for the ſervice and benefit of the Parliament</hi>; We conceive, That upon every treſpaſſe, or other thing done in the War (which we may be queſtioned for) it will be very chargeable and difficult, either to derive a clear Authority for the ſame from Ordinance of Parliament, or to bring proofes ſufficient to make up ſuch a conſtructive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, as that it was for the ſervice and benefit of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially to do this ſo fully, as to meet with all the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and eluſions of a ſubtle Lawyer, or to convince the ſences of a Countrey-Jury, whom we know not by what rules or meaſure they may go in judging what was for the ſervice and benefit of the Parliament, or what not, perhaps ſome of them may be of that minde, That it had been for the ſervice and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Parliament, to have had no War at all, or to have had fewer or no ſuch Garriſons or Forces as ſome of us have been engaged in. In ſum, We cannot thinke it ſafe to be left to the fence or conſtruſtion of a Countrey-Jury, concerning the exigencies of War, or duty of a Souldier upon ſo doubtfull an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57396:8"/>
iſſue; we ſhould rather thinke, That the old iſſue, which (as we underſtand) ancient Lawes have provided for in ſuch caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> (Whether the thing were done <hi>tempore &amp; locobelli</hi>) was much more clear and ſure; and an Act or Ordinance of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion for all treſpaſſes or other things ſo done by Souldiers in this War, would be moſt ſafe and ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the proviſion in the ſaid Ordinance now paſt for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, by complaint to a Committee of Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> (which ſeems to be meant for ſaving of charges to poor men) we doubt will prove a very remote help, and far more chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a poore Souldier impriſoned or Arreſted in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, then the former: and though we highly honour that Committee named in the Ordinance (for the major part of it) yet we confeſſe we ſhall be ſorry that our reliefe (if it may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be provided for) ſhould be the occaſion of ſetting up more Arbitrary Courts then there are already, with ſo large a power of impriſoning any Free men of <hi>England,</hi> as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance gives to that Committee, let the perſons intruſted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at preſent never ſo juſt and faithfull, or though all that Committee were as good Patriots as we hold the major Part to be.</p>
            <p n="3">3, In the matter of Accompts, we are wholly left (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to the mercy of the Committee for Accompts, and their Sub-Committees, whoſe conſtitution (in moſt Counties) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a leaſt of Neuters (diſaffected to the Warre, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the Souldiery) and whoſe vaſt and arbitrary power to vex, delay, fine and impriſon at their owne pleaſure or judgement, any that they can bring within the compaſſe of accomptants, and to proceed upon their owne judgement of the default, to ſequeſter, ſell and diſpoſe of his Eſtate; as upon a Commiſſion of Bankrupt (we confeſſe) wee tremble to thinke of more then of any Enemy. And though wee are as jealous as any to have all men brought to an accompt, for what may clearly be accompted for (as Treaſurers, Keepers of ſtores, Sequeſtrators, or ſuch like accomptants) yet wee cannot but thinke it hard for us, or other the Parliament Souldiers, to bee required to ſo ſtrict accompts for all things received, taken, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57396:9"/>
uſed in the War by our ſelves, or any under our command (though but temporally upon a part) for many of which things neither we nor any other that minded the publick ſervice, and have bin ingaged in hazardous ſervices, where many have loſt thoſe accompts they did keep, can give or could keep ſo ſtrict accompt, or for want of ſuch accompt to be ſo cruelly vexed &amp; proſecuted, even to utter undoing, as any man that's accompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for any thing that may be, and divers of the Parliaments moſt faithfull and active Servants in our condition have been before our eyes: And though we would not wiſh that any Souldiers or Officers who have by Plunder, or other Injury to the Countrey, abuſed the name of the Parliaments Service, and converted any thing they have taken or received to their owne private benefit or advantage, (more then for neceſſary ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence or ſupplies) ſhould go away with it, in being exempted from accompt; yet we cannot but think it reaſonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, That for thoſe many others that have not done ſo, but have imployed all faithfully for the publick ſervice, ſuch provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould bee made, as that what Armes, Ammunition, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Furniture, or other things received or taken by them, they could not keep, or cannot give a cleare and diſtinct accompt for, it ſhould bee ſufficient for their diſcharge, if they make Oath, That they have not imbezelled, or wittingly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their private benefit or advantage, any part thereof, more then what things, or to what value they doe or ſhall (for ſaving of their Oath) charge upon themſelves in their accompt.</p>
            <p>We finde another thing mainly neceſſary for our and other mens Indempnity (for which there is no proviſion at all made in this Ordinance) <hi>viz.</hi> That all Acts of Councells or Courts of Warre, either in cenſure or diſcharge of any perſon, for any cauſe ſubject to their Judgement, and the Warrants of the Generall, or chiefe Commander, for execution or remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch cenſures, may be valid and good, both as to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of thoſe that have been imployed in execution of ſuch cenſures, and alſo the full &amp; finall acquittall of the perſons ſo diſcharged or remitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57396:9"/>Eighthly, Though thoſe Officers of the Army at ſeveral times ſent for, or ſent up to attend the Parliament as Delinquents, have been indeed diſcharged (for which we render our thanks &amp; acknowledge the Parliaments Juſtice in the diſcharge) yet for men of ſuch credit and integrity to have their names brought ſo highly into publique queſtion or ſuſpition, and the cauſe not known (which might make it imagined greater) to be kept long in attendance under that notion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not obtaine by their daily ſolicitations to know their Accuſers, or any Charge (and for one of them) to be made a Priſoner, ſearched and ſent up ſo far in a diſgracefull manner, without Authority (againſt the right both of a Souldier and Subject) and at laſt to bee onely diſmiſſed (without any word of Vindication or clearing) ſeems but a ſlender Reparation.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, There hath yet been nothing declared by the Parl. (as in the Narration or Declaration of the Officers was deſired) to cleare us, as to our right of Petitioning, or to cleare the fence and intention of the Parliament in their Order for ſuppreſſing the Petition, or the ground of their cenſure in the Declaration againſt it; Though we think no man can deny the matter of the Petition to be juſt, and Parliament-proceedings, ſince upon the ſeverall heads of it does imply as much: And if our liberty of Petitioning for our due be denyed us now, &amp; the attempting of it rendred ſuch a Crime (as by the ſaid Order and Declaration appeares to be, while the ground or intention of them ſtands not explained otherwiſe) we cannot but expect the ſame or worſe hereafter, not only to our ſelves (when being disbanded and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed, we ſhall have the like occaſion to Petition as private &amp; ſingle men) but alſo to all the free-both people of the land in the like caſe; and ſo this preſident (if it ſtand good) would eextendin the conſequence of it, to render all Souldiers under the Parliament, the worſt of ſlaves, and all Subjects little better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though there have been of late in other mens Caſes too many dangerous Preſidents of ſuppreſſing Petitions, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing or cenſuring the Petitioners, yet (we thinke) few or none ſo full and cleare againſt all juſt Liberties, as this in our caſe whoſe Petition was not, as many (that yet have been
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57396:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
received with large thanks) without any foundation in reall grievances or dues, tending and ſerving meerely to declare the Petitioners opinions and inclinations in relation to matters of State (then in tranſaction, or intended to be put on in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) nor yet ſubject to any of thoſe exceptions, which at other Petitions (ſeeming better grounded, more neceſſary or concerning then the former, and yet rejected) might be; But ours not medling with matters of State, with proceedings of Parliament, or any bodies concernments but our owne, tended but to obtaine particular dues (often promiſed, dearely and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly earned, long forborne) and ſome of which (<hi>viz.</hi> the matter of Indempnity) we could not (without danger of utter ruine) want after disbanding; and theſe but deſired in an humble and ſubmiſſive way, without any language, ſcandalous or offenſive, or any other particular exception (for matter or form) that we have ever yet been told of, or could any way learn; ſo as though we are willing to believe the Parliament was miſ-informed, abuſed or ſurprized in the buſineſſes (as the Narrative does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe) yet we cannot hitherto underſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence ſuch proceedings againſt ſuch a Petition, or againſt us for it, could ariſe, except (in thoſe that moved and drew the Parliament thereunto) from ſome principles of Malignants envy or diſlike againſt us, the Petitioners for the things God hath done by us, carrying them (above all other conſiderations of juſt or unjuſt, dangerous or ſafe) to this end, as the greateſt good, that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my muſt not paſſe with that Reputation God hath given it, but muſt (upon any occaſion that could be catched hold on) have a diſhonour put upon it, and by diſcontents and provocations be put into diſtemper, ſo as to doe ſomething that might render it <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Tenthly, the Declaration yet ſtanding in force, and nothing publiſhed by the Parliament to clear the Army from the cenſure it thereby lies under, there remains a brand of Ignominy upon this Army to Poſterity: And thoſe Souldiers that have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to act any thing in purſuance of their juſt Deſires in that Petition, or in Repreſentation of their juſt Grievances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; as alſo thoſe Officers that have any way concurred with,</p>
