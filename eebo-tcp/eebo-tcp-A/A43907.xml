            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>IN this ſmall Hiſtory, under the Tables or Stories of Birds and Beaſts, you will find things not only pleaſant but advantagious to the Improvement of your Underſtanding, to a degree, that you may read Men as well as Books, by their Actions decipher'd in it: Here you may ſee Policy, Deceit, Wiſdom, Power, Strength, and many other Things lively ſet forth; and by the Events and Succeſs, whether Good or Bad, judge accordingly of thoſe that uſe them, whether they tend to honeſt or evil Purpoſes.</hi>

Winds; the Powerful and Mighty, how weak it is to rely wholly on Strength, when they have a ſubtil Enemy to deal with; and thoſe that truſt fawning Friendſhip, are convinc'd, that in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity but few will ſtand by them: and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Things is contain'd in it, ſuiting the States and Conditions of all ſorts of People.</hi>

               <hi>It is a Book that has been printed in moſt Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean Languages, as,</hi> Dutch, French, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, &amp;c. <hi>and that other Nations, who have given it high Encomiums and Applauſe; it being, originally, written by an Antient Stateſman of the German Empire, to ſhew ſome Men their Follies, and correct the Vices of the Times he liv'd in: Therefore receive it not as a Trifle, but as a Work of Weight and Moment, which coſt much ſound Judgment and Labour in Compiling, and being done into Engliſi, it varies little from the Original: However, as it is, I recommend it to you, in hopes you will find as much Pleaſure and Advantage in Reading and well Weighing it as I did.</hi>

of Winter, and cloathed each Tree and Field in a pleaſant Livery of Green, enamell'd over with fragrant Flowers of various Colours; then it was, the noble Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, King of Beaſts, ſent out his Royal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates to all his Subjects, the Inhabitants of Woods, Foreſts, and Fields, to attend him at his Royal Palace of <hi>Sanden,</hi> there to celebrate the annual Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt:</hi> Which was no ſooner ſignified to 'em, that it was his Pleaſure they ſhould give their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, without any Excuſe or Delay, but they ſtock'd thither in great Numbers, (as well to ſhew their Obedience, as to avoid his Diſpleaſure) at the Time appointed; and being call'd over, none was found wanting but the Fox; who, conſcious of Guilt for the many Injuries he had done, kept cloſe in his Den, as fearing they would make ſuch juſt Complaints againſt him, as might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his Life: Nor were his Fears vain, or ſuggeſted; for the King with the Queen on his right Hand, and the Leopard, his Kinſman, on the left, being feated on the Throne, under the Canopy of a ſpacious Oak, and Silence being commanded, he proceeded to commend them for their ready Obedience, in giving ſuch exact and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Attendance; but miſſing the Fox, he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31557:5"/>
wonder'd how he alone ſhould neglect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there at this ſo ſolemn a Meeting, ſince he had always held him as a Friend, in high Eſteem; which made them enquire about his Welfare, ſuppoſing ſome Sickneſs or Misfortune had befel him: But while his Wonder laſted, Sir <hi>Iſgrim,</hi> the Wolf, ſtood up and accuſed him in this manner:</p>
               <p>My moſt Gracious Sovereign Lord, I well know, that it is neither Sickneſs or any Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, that makes <hi>Reynard</hi> decline appearing before your Majeſty, with the reſt of your Subjects; but his great Guilt for the many Outrages and Violences he has committed againſt a number here preſent, whoſe juſt Complaints he fears will be laid againſt him, to bring him to deſerv'd Puniſhment and Diſgrace, for abuſing not only us, but your Majeſty, in condemning your Orders and Commands, notwithſtanding your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency towards him heretofore, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Favours you've heap'd upon him; and particularly, as to the great Injury he has done me and my Family, I have brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to teſtifie it, and which, being plainly prov'd, I doubt not of your Majeſty's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Redreſs and Revenge my Wrongs. Then thus, Dread Sovereign it was, My Wife and Children being at home, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31557:6"/>
basking at their Eaſe, whilſt I was ranging abroad, <hi>Reynard</hi> coming that way, enter'd my Houſe forcibly, againſt my Wife's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and after many Scofflings and Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings at her, and my young Ones, in a ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful kind of ſporting manner, whisking up his Tail, he ſo bepiſs'd their Eyes, that by the ſtink and ſharpneſs of his Urine, they immediately became blind, and have ever ſince continued ſo, to the great Grief and Sorrow of me and my poor Wife: And altho' a Day was ſet that he ſhould come to anſwer for this Injury, and the Book was tender'd him to ſwear, whether he was Guilty of it, or not; yet he refus'd to do it, in Contempt of your Majeſty's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Royal Authority. Many more Injuries I could reckon up, as divers noble Beaſts here preſent can teſtifie; but they are ſo many, and grievous, that ſhould I tell 'em all, they would tire your Patience, and diſcompoſe your Majeſty with too great an Anger: and therefore expecteing the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Law, for what I have related, and more particularly for the Shame and Villany he offer'd my Wife, which in this Place I am unwilling to mention, I ſhall at this Time ſay no more, leſt I ſhould ſeem too tedious to your Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:31557:6"/>
He had no ſooner ended, but <hi>Curtis</hi> the Hound, (formerly a Lady's Lap-dog, but turn'd off when French Spanels came into Favour) in a pitious Tone, began to yel'p out his Complaint againſt the Fox, ſaying, May it pleaſe your Majeſty, Tho' I was brought up tenderly, lay warm, and far'd ſumptuouſly at my Lady's Table every Day, yet, loſing my Miſtreſs's Favour, to make room for a French Cur, I was thruſt out of Doors in a cold Winter, and forc'd to ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble up and down till almoſt ſtarv'd; but at laſt Fortune turn'd a little favourable, and gave me a good Chance to find a Pudding; which, tho' <hi>Reynard</hi> knew it was all I had to live on, he violently took it from me, ſo that thro' Cold and Hunger, as your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may plainly ſee, I am almoſt ſtarv'd to death; and therefore I demand Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Tibert,</hi> the Cat, hearing this, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing akin to <hi>Reynard,</hi> in a Rage ſtarted out of the Throng, and humbly beſought his Majeſty's Leave to ſpeak; which the King granting, he proceeded in this wiſe:</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe my Sovereign Lord, I own that grievous Complaints are made againſt my Kinſman <hi>Reynard,</hi> in his abſence; yet were their Actions narrowly ſearch'd into,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31557:7"/>
who make the Complaints, they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear worſe to your Majeſty, than what they lay to the Fox's Charge: For tho' I pretend not in every thing to vindicate him, yet thus much I muſt ſay, touching the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of this ſcoundrel Hound, If <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> took the Pudding from him, he only deceiv'd the Deceiver; for this Thief, my Liege, ſtole it from me after I had ventur'd my Life for't in a Mill, by taking it thence whilſt the Miller was tumbling a handſome Wench on the Sacks; and he meeting me before I could convey it to my Store-houſe, by purpoſely croſſing the Way upon me, without a Word ſpeaking, took it by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from me: Beſides, this is long ſince, and ſeeing it was moſt properly mine, and I forgive my Kinſman, there can be no juſt ground of Indictment againſt him upon his Accuſation, ſince according to the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>To deceive the Deceiver, is no Deceit.</hi> And further, if, without offending, I might produce Evidence, I doubt not but to prove the Wolf's Accuſation malicous, and to clear the Fox in all Points.</p>
               <p>At theſe laſt Words, the <hi>Panther</hi> riſing from his Seat with a compos'd Countenance, ſaid; Sir <hi>Tibert,</hi> you are carried too far by the Bonds of Friendſhip, in Vindication of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31557:7"/>
your Kinſman, more than he deſerves, ſince moſt know him to be a Theif and a Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucker, a Dettroyer of the King's peaceable Subjects, and a Hater of them all, making it his Study how to bring them into Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and then his Paſtime to inſult over, and devour ſuch as are too feeble for him, or not wife enough to ſhun his Craftineſs; a Perſon altogether regardleſs of the King's Honour, which he would not only contemn, but ſuffer the utmoſt, for ſo ſmall a thing as the Leg of a fat Hen or Gooſe.</p>
               <p>And to make this more plain, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtance what I was an Eye-witneſs of, in relation to poor <hi>Keyward</hi> the Hare, who now is under the King's Protection, by whoſe Royal Goodneſs he is defended from <hi>Reynard</hi>'s Inſults: This crafty Villian, <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> pretending to be in Orders, and a Chaplain, ſo far inſinuated on the poor Hare's Belief, with a ſhew of Sanctity, cloak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de with Hypocriſie, in hopes of ſatisfying his own End, that the ſilly Creature agreed he ſhould teach him his <hi>Creedo,</hi> and being by that means in his Power, he made him ſit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Legs to ſing; but it had like indeed to have been his laſt Song, for the Fox catch'd him ſo faſt by the Throa, that had I not been paſſing by, and at the Cry
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31557:8"/>
ruſh'd in to his aſſiſtance, he had died there, and ſerv'd <hi>Reynard</hi> and his Family for a Holiday-feaſt. And that this, my Lord the King, is true, you may eaſily perceive by the yet bleeding Wound on <hi>Keyward</hi>'s Throat.</p>
               <p>Therefore, may Liege, if you ſuffer ſuch Outrages to go unpuniſh'd, it will be a Diſhonour to your Royal Dignity, a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Violation of the Laws; and not only reflect on your ſelf, but on your Children, that are now, or ſhall hereafter be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and many Years to come will not be able to blot out the Slander of this Evil.</p>
               <p>This was applauded by moſt, and the King by 'em intreated to execute the Laws in puniſhing of the Fox; but eſpecially the Wolf urg'd it vehemently, ſaying, The Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has ſpoke the Truth, and therefore his Advice and Council ought not to be rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>But whilſt the King was about to give Sentence, his Eyes ſparking like Fire, and groaning within himſelf, ſo that moſt Beaſts trembled, up ſtarted <hi>Grimbard</hi> the Brock, Nephew to <hi>Reynard,</hi> intreating, That in his Uncle's abſence he might plead for him, to the Accuſation laid to his Charge; which, with ſome difficulty, the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31557:8"/>
to; and then he proceeded in this manner:</p>
               <p>As to the Wolf, ſaid he, my Dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, you cannot, I hope, but conceive in your Princely Wiſdom, what he ſays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Uncle proceeds only from Malice; and that, according to the old Proverb, Never ſpeaks well; Kings as well as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Perſons, are not exempted from it.</p>
               <p>Then turning to him, ſaid, Sir <hi>Iſgrim,</hi> notwiſtanding all that you have alledg'd, I wiſh you durſt to venture your Honeſty with my Kinſman's, upon the Tryal of both your Lives, that he, who upon plain Proof and Conviction, ſhould be found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the greateſt Crimes, might die in a Halter. I boldly tell you, here in the Face of the Court, and as much as you ſuppoſe you ſtand in the King's Favour, on ſuch a Tryal your Guilt will appear ſo hanious, that if you were not aſham'd to do it, it wou'd be in vain to ask Mercy: How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, with your venomous Teeth, have you maliciouſly worred and wounded my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, put him in peril of his Life, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded him of what he labour'd and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd hard for, that you might ſatisfie your greedy Maw? Amongſt many of which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and Outrages, I ſhall here, for Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity's
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31557:9"/>
ſake, reckon up but a few: You have perhaps forgot how you cheated him of a large Plaice, which he, at the hazard of his Life, ventur'd into a Cart for, and throwing it down, you immediately took it by Violence from him, and for his ſhare, gave him only the Bones, which you durſt not eat, for fear they ſhou'd ſtick in your Throat, and made you howl, as when you implor'd the Crane's Aid, and prov'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to her, in denying her the promis'd Reward, tho' by putting her long Neck down your Throat, ſhe had eas'd your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and in all probability ſav'd you from being chok'd. At another time you ſerv'd my Kinſman a baſe fraudulent Trick, by taking from him a Flitch of Bacon, which he got out of a Chimney, not without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of breaking his Neck; and tho' he was ſo kind, when he perceiv'd you almoſt ſtarv'd, to offer you Part, nothing would ſerve you but the Whole; tho' till you came to devour the laſt Morſel, you all along promis'd to leave him a ſufficient Share; and finding he was deluded by you, he went only away ſighing, without making any juſt Reproach. Nor was this all, for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him at a diſtance, you perceiv'd he was going in ſearch for Proviſion, you ſoon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31557:9"/>
found he, by his Cunning, had ſung a large Sow aſleep, and gotten from her one of her fatteſt Pigs, which you likewiſe gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſeiz'd, tho' at his return, in hopes to get another, he was not only torn by the inrag'd Sow, but taken by the Owner in a Sack, out of which he gnaw'd his way, whilſt the Peaſant carried him at his Back, to have him worried in the Market-place by Maſtiffs. Theſe, and innumerable other Injuries, have you at ſundry times done my Kinſman <hi>Reynard;</hi> wherefore you, and not he, ought to be puniſh'd.</p>
               <p>And therefore I beſeech his Majeſty to conſider theſe things, and to judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. I confeſs, there is one Accuſation of Sir <hi>Iſgrim</hi>'s of no weight, which is, That my Kinſman has lain with his Wife; it is very true, he has done ſo but it was at her own Intreaty, and ſix Years before ſhe was married; and ſhe was ſo pleas'd with the Kindneſs he did her, that ſhe has ever ſince born a tender Affection to him; and therefore it is a Folly for him to complain, who at that time had no Intereſt in her, as to her Honeſty or Diſhoneſty.</p>
               <p>The Brock had no ſooner ended his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, in Vindication of his Kinſman, but <hi>Keywood</hi> the Hare, in a pitious Tone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31557:10"/>
his Complaint in the manner as the Panther related.</p>
               <p>To which the Brock again replied, That if the Hare would undertake to learn, and prov'd a Dunce, it was not reaſonable, that <hi>Reynard,</hi> as his School-maſter, ſhould correct him; for if Scholars have not due and moderate Correction, it is impoſſible there ſhould be any capable of managing Matters in State and Religion.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Hound, forſooth, makes his Complaint for the loſs of his Pudding; he might have behav'd himſelf better in his Miſtreſs's Service, than to have been turn'd out to a deſperate Fortune; beſides, we hear what Sir <hi>Tibert</hi> ſays, he ſtole it firſt from him; ſo that had my Couſin hang'd him up when he took him, he had offended none but the King, in doing Juſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Leave, which he forbore to do, in regard to your Majeſty, as being Wiſe, and well underſtanding the Laws: Beſides, how can he do amiſs, who does nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Advice of the Prieſt? He is a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and a true Man, and ſince your Majeſty's Proclamation for a Ceſſation of Hoſtilities, he has ſo far complied, that he has injur'd none, keeping his Body under by Abſtinence, eating but once a Day, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31557:10"/>
chaſtiſing it, and wearing a Hair-ſhirt next to his Skin: and, as I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, it is above a Year ſince he eat any Fleſh, by thoſe that came but very lately from him. He has forſaken his Caſtle of <hi>Malepardus</hi> for a poor Hermitage, forſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hunting, and all other Recreations, living by Alms, doing infinite Good, and repenting him of his Sins; ſo that he is grown meager and lean, ſequeſtring himſelf from Company, as one weary of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this tranſitory World.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Brock was thus labouring to excuſe and vindicate <hi>Reynard,</hi> the whole Aſſembly was ſurpriz'd at the approach of <hi>Chanticleer</hi> the Cock, who, with two Hens, in a mournful manner, came down the Hill towards 'em, bringing upon a Bier a dead Hen, with her Head bitten off; as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, he ſmote his Wings againſt his Sides in a melancholy manner, whilſt the two Hens cackled out great and doleful Lamentations, each of them bearing a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, their Names being <hi>Cragant</hi> and <hi>Tantart,</hi> and were found to be the Daughters of <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> the dead Hen. But whilſt the Wonder laſted, after they had made a great Wailing, and were come before the King, the Bier was no ſooner ſet down, but <hi>Chanticleer</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:31557:11"/>
humbled himſelf, and crav'd Audience; which being granted, he thus proceeded:</p>
               <p>Great and juſt Prince, I humbly beſeech you to hear and revenge the Injuries done to me by <hi>Reynard</hi> the Fox, as alſo to my Children: For thus, moſt gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, it happen'd, that when the Spring appear'd in its Glory, I, by reaſon of the great Stock my Wife <hi>Coppel</hi> had brought forth, being in the height of my Pride and Gallantry, having then eight valliant Sons and ſeven beautiful Daughters, which walk'd at pleaſure in a well-fenc'd Yard, guarded by ſeveral fierce Maſtiffs, I thought my ſelf the happieſt of all Creatures; but, alas! my Joy was ſoon turn'd into Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I caſt from the height of my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined Felicity to the depth of Miſery; for whilſt we remain'd there fearleſs of Danger, deceitful <hi>Reynard</hi> came one Day (after he had many times attempted to leap the Walls in vain, and had been hunted away by the Maſtiffs) in a religious Habit, telling over his Beads, and making Signs of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Devotion, he call'd to me thro' the Wicket in a friendly manner, ſhewing me your Majeſty's Letter ſeal'd with your great Seal, wherein I found you had made an Univerſal Peace among Beaſts and Fowls,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31557:11"/>
throughout your whole Empire; yet, knowing him a Diſſembler, and ſuſpecting them to be counterfeit, as I ſince under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand they were, I at firſt but lightly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited him, till with many Oaths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations he avowed it to be truth; and, that for his part he had done with the World, and was become a Monk, intending to take a long Pilgrimage to repent of his Sins; ſhewing me his Books, Beads, Hair-ſhirt, and all other religious Accoutrements; and perſevering to affirm it with ſuch ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sanctity, that I could not any longer miſtruſt; and being willing to walk at large, ſeeing him go away ſighing, ſaying his <hi>Credo,</hi> and telling over his Beads, I call'd my Family about me, and inform'd 'em of the News, who were exceeding glad there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; ſo that by Conſent we flew over the Walls to range in the Fields; tho' I may ever rue that Day; for as we careleſly pick'd about, the Fox, who lay' behind a Buſh, crept on his Belly till he came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wall and us, and ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd one of my Sons, whom he murder'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pack'd up, and bore away, to my unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Grief; and having had ſo ſweet a Bait, neither the Maſtiffs or Hunters cou'd keep him away, till at ſeveral Surprizes,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31557:12"/>
he had ſtoln away thirteen of my Children, leaving me but two; and yeſterday, <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> my dear Wife, was ſurpriz'd by this Traytor, whoſe Head, as your Majeſty may perceive, he bit off, and had born away her Body, but being purſued by the Hounds, he was compell d to let her fall, and fly for his Life.</p>
               <p>And thus your Majeſty, having heard my Wrongs, I implore you, by that Juſtice and Compaſſion that reigns in your Royal Breaſt, to revenge 'em on the bloody-minded <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moral.] <hi>By this we ſee however wicked Men flatter 'emſelves with eſcaping unpuniſh'd by hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding 'emſelves from Juſtice; yet it the more proves their Guilt, by imboldening, in their abſence, their Enemies to complain againſt 'em: Which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by the Wolf, who, as guilty as the Fox, nevertheleſs takes this time to make his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt him; and ſo gives Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to others, who in all likelihood otherwiſe would not have done it. The Brock's pleading for the Fox, denotes, that rich Men and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, tho' never ſo vicious rarely want any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate to excuſe 'em, tho' they ſhame 'emſelves in doing it, as the Brock did, when the Cock appear'd with his freſh Complaint againſt the Fox,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <figure/>
               <p>UPon the Complaint of <hi>Chanticleer,</hi> the King grew exceeding angry, and turning his Eyes on <hi>Grimbard</hi> the Brock, who had thus labour'd to excuſe and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Reynard,</hi> he ſternly ſaid, What think you now, Sir <hi>Grimbard,</hi> of this Recluſe? Where is the Fox's Penitency? See how he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31557:13"/>
has faſted, prayed, and mortified his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to your Shame, that dare to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſuch a Traytor and Murderer. But, by my Crown, I ſwear, if I have Life long remaining in me, he ſhall dearly pay for this. But at preſent, Sir <hi>Chanticleer,</hi> all that we can do for you, is to give <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> your dear Wife honourable Burial, which ſhall be at my Charge. And in the mean time, I will call a Council, to conſider of Ways and Methods to do you Juſtice and Right againſt her Murderer. Whereupon he appointed the Goat and Ram to ſing Maſs at the Interment of <hi>Coppel,</hi> and that great Mourning ſhould be made over her; ſo, upon this the Bier was taken up, and carried before the Cock and his two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who follow'd in Mourning-hoods, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by many other Courtiers, making a doleful Lamentation.</p>

                     <hi>Coppel, Chanticleer's</hi> dear Wife,</l>

                  <l>For her, whoſe unjuſt Death was lamentable.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Whilſt theſe Things paſs'd, the King was at cloſe Council with his Nobles, conſulting how he might bring the Fox to deſerv'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31557:13"/>
Puniſhment; and, after ſome Debates, it was concluded, he ſhould be immediately ſent for, to make his perſonal Appearance before the King, without any Excuſe to Delay, there to anſwer ſuch Matters as he ſtands charg'd with; and that Sir <hi>Bruin</hi> the Bear ſhould deliver him the Summons, ſeal'd with the King's Signet; whereupon the King call'd him in him, ſaying,</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Bruin,</hi> it is our Pleaſure you carry this Mandate to <hi>Reynard;</hi> but, withal, I adviſe you beware of him, for he is full of Policy, being a Craft-maſter at Flattery and Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, leſt he betray you into Snares and Intanglements, and bring you to Scorn or Mockery; therefore let me adviſe you not to rely upon your Strength too much, but uſe Policy and Caution, that you may return in Safety and Honour.</p>
               <p>The Bear hearing this, and that the Truſt of fetching <hi>Reynard</hi> to Court, was repos'd in him, could not refrain laughing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a while, for the hopes he expected of being reveng'd on him; and boldly made this Reply to the King: My Lord, ſaid he, let me alone with the Fox, I have Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to deal with him; I ſhall defeat his Deſigns, and baffle all Pretenſions he can have on me. And ſo the Bear departed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31557:14"/>
that Night, that he might be going early in the Morning on wards of his Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Malepardus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Morning, Sir <hi>Bruin,</hi> taking the King's Letter with him, ſet forward, paſſing over Mountains and thro' many thick For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, till he came to <hi>Reynard</hi>'s chief Caſtle, when ſcorning to go in, but reſolving <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſhould do him the Honour to come and wait on him without, ſitting on his Tail before the Gate, he lifted up his Voice, ſaying, <hi>Reynard,</hi> come forth to me, your Kinſman <hi>Bruin,</hi> who am come with the King's Mandate, to ſummon you to Court, to anſwer the Complaints there laid to your Charge; therefore I adviſe you, in a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, to come forth and go along with me, thereby to ſhun the Danger, that for the Contempt of Royal Authority, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> further befal you.</p>
               <p>The Fox heard this, but made no anſwer, till he had conſulted how to be reveng'd on the Bear, whom he well-knew had no Love for him, but was rather his mortal Enemy; and having caſt ſeveral things in his mind, whilſt the Bear lay clamouring again for him to come out, he immediately threw open the Gates, and embracing him, ſaid,</p>
               <p>Dear Uncle <hi>Bruin,</hi> I am over-joy'd to ſee
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31557:14"/>
you; pardon, I pray you, my ſlowneſs of coming, for when you firſt began to call, I was in the middle of my Evening-ſong; and Devotion, you know, muſt be minded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other Buſineſs. Truly you ſweat, Uncle, and ſeem much tir'd, pray enter in and reſt you; Cou'd the King, in all his Court, ſent no meaner a Servant than your noble Self (who is both Rich, and Wiſe, and Powerful, nearly ally'd to him in Blood) on ſuch an unworthy Errand? I am exceeding ſorry for it; but if he had not ſent, I intended to have been at Court to Morrow; However, dear Uncle, ſince you are come, the hope of good Council I expect from you, much leſſens the Weight of my Dread; only what grieves me is, I fear in accompanying you I ſhall be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to you, my Body is ſo much diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd ſince I have left off eating Fleſh, and be taken me to a new Diet, which has grievouſly ſwell'd me.</p>
               <p>What Meat is that, Nephew? ſaid the Bear.</p>
               <p>Alas, reply'd <hi>Reynard,</hi> it is of ſo poor a ſort, that it ſignifies nothing for me to tell it to you; you eat of the daintieſt and moſt coſtly Fare: However, not with ſtanding this Excuſe, which the Fox purpoſely
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31557:15"/>
made, to make the Bear mere eager to know it; he preſſing him to declare what it was, <hi>Reynard</hi> told him it was Honey, of which he had found ſuch abundance, that it could not, but in a long time, be exhauſted. This made the Bear hug him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Joy, for there is nothing in the World, that that Creature loves more than Honey, ſo that many times they run the hazard of their Eyes being ſtung out in rifling the Treaſure, both of the wild and tame Bees, by unadviſedly thruſting their Heads in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 'em, when the little Creatures, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bears ſhagged Skin impe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rable by their ſhort Weapons, cluſter about their Eyes, Noſe, and Mouth, and ſting them in a furious manner.</p>
               <p>The remembrance of this, however; did not frighten Sir <hi>Bruin,</hi> for without asking whether it was in Hives or Trees, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly imbrac'd the Fox, telling him, if he would help him to as much of that lordly Fare as would ſuffice him, he would be his Friend for ever, and ſtand by him againſt his greateſt Enemies, till he had made them ſilent and aſham'd of their Accuſations.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the Fox having conſider'd how to lay a Trap for the credulous Bear, tho' he had been per-admoniſh'd by his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31557:15"/>
to beware of his Wiles, found an eaſy Advantage herein; for remembering that when he had ſtole a Pullet in <hi>Lanfret,</hi> the Carpenters Yard, the Night before, he perceiv'd two Wedges ſticking in a mighty Oak, which being about the middle, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided one end to a great wideneſs; and, thought he, if I get the Bear to put in his Head, that I might draw out the Wedges and catch him by the Ears, I ſhould make fine Sport.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Reynard</hi> was muſing on this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Bear lay urging him to declare where this Treaſure was; which, he ſaid, were he a King, he would give his Crown and Kingdom to be poſſeſſed of.</p>
               <p>Why, truly Uncle, ſaid <hi>Reynard,</hi> not to keep you much longer from what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, if I thought you were in earneſt, I could conduct you to the Yard, where is no leſs there than ten Tun.</p>
               <p>Aye; but are you in earneſt, dear Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin? ſaid the Bear.</p>
               <p>Why do you think, ſaid <hi>Reynard,</hi> I jeſt in this Matter?</p>
               <p>No, no, dear Nephew; come along; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me in this, and bind me to you for ever.</p>
               <p>So away they went together, the Prior in expectation, and the Fox laughing in his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31557:16"/>
Sleeve, to think how finely he ſhould fool his Great-uncle; travelling together in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Diſcourſes till they came within ſight of the Houſe, which <hi>Reynard</hi> no ſooner ſhew'd to <hi>Bruin,</hi> but he exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd; and as they approach'd it, the Fox ſaid to him in Deriſion, Pray, Uncle, be moderate in eating, for ſcuh luſcious Meat will put you into a Surfeit.</p>
               <p>Let me alone for that, ſaid the Bear; I warrant you I know well enough how to govern my Appetite.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid the Fox, Uncle, I know you are diſcreet; and leave it to you.</p>
               <p>By this Time they were come into the Yard, where the Fox ſhew'd him the Cleft of the Tree, telling him, there were ſome part of the Honey; which, when he had diſpatch'd, he would ſhew him more. The Bear, greedy of the Morſel, not miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Treachery of his Kinſman, thruſt in his Head and Fore-feet; but whilſt he was ſearching about, <hi>Reynard</hi> pull'd out the Wedges, and catch'd him in the Cleft.</p>
               <p>The Bear, finding himſelf thus unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſurpriz'd, thro' Shame and Pain, roar'd out moſt hideouſly, ſo that he rais'd not only the Carpenter's Family, but upon their Cry, the Village; who came running
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31557:16"/>
with Staves, Clubs, and all ſorts of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; and, among the reſt, Dame <hi>Jollock,</hi> the Parſon's Wife, came running with her Diſtaff in her Hand; ſo that poor Sir <hi>Bruin</hi> was extreamly belabour'd, whilſt the Fox ſtood at a Diſtance, fleering and ſcoffing at his Calamity: But finding his Liſe in in danger by the Blows that were laid on him, he put too all his Strength, and with much ſtrugling rent his Head and Feet out of the Cleft; yet with the loſs of his Ears, part of the Skin of his Face, and moſt of that of his Feet: whoſe bloody Face, and furious Teeth, frighting the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, they parted in a Lane, and gave way for him; yet follow'd, as ſoon as he was paſs'd, with might Stroaks, till the Bear making to the River plung'd into it, and by the force of his Body, threw Dame <hi>Jollock</hi> and ſome others into the Water, where they floated like Shittle-cocks; to whoſe Relief the Prieſt, and others came running; the Former offering a full Pardon and Indulgence for ſeven Years to come, to any that would ſave Dame <hi>Jollock;</hi> ſo, at laſt, this occoſion'd the ſaving of them all, and prov'd a Kindneſs to Sir <hi>Bruin;</hi> for whilſt they were buſy about it, he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Current; and then got on Land, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan his unadvis'd truſting the Fox, after he had been forewarn'd about it; but as it happen'd he landed on the ſame ſide the Fox was on, who had juſt then ſtole a Hen out of a Farm-yard, and was going home with great Joy; concluding <hi>Bruin</hi> was dead of the Effuſion of Blood that ſlow'd from him, and the mighty Blows he had receiv'd: but when he ſaw him there, he was extreamly griev'd, yet he reſolv'd to ſcoff him, thereby to encreaſe his Miſery, ſaying, How now, Uncle? it ſeems you would not take my Advice, but have over-eat your ſelf; ſee what comes of Greedineſs; now, perhaps you may fall into a Surfeit, and complain of me at Court; tho' what I did was well meant, and at your earneſt Deſire.</p>
               <p>A Plague take you, reply'd Sir <hi>Bruin,</hi> for your Kindneſs; was I able to catch you, you ſhould dearly pay for this Trick you have put upon me: Fool that I was, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a profeſs'd Villian, eſpecially when I had ſo much Warning before-hand; but I hope to live to revenge this Treachery.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid the Fox, that you muſt plot; and ſo fare you well.</p>
               <p>The Bear was more grieved at theſe Taunts than at his Wounds, tho' the Blood
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31557:17"/>
ran ſuriouſly from his Face and Feet; but finding no Remedy, after many Groanings, he threw himſelf in the River again, and ſwam to the other ſide, where landing, and not being able to uſe his Fore-feet to go, he tumbled over Head and Heels, till he came to the Court.</p>
               <p>The Lyon no ſooner ſaw him in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but he ſuſpected ſome Treachery; and demanded who durſt ſo miſuſe him: Sir <hi>Bruin</hi> having taken Breath, roared out, in a piteous Tone. O my Lord, revenge me of this wicked Villian, <hi>Reynard,</hi> who has done me all this Injury and Diſgrace. Then he proceeded to tell the whole Story of his Misfortune, as it had befel him.</p>
               <p>The Royal Lyon hearing this Relation, groa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'d within him for Anger, ſaying, How durſt that Villian be ſo hardy, as thus to abuſe my Meſſenger, and one of ſo noble a Rank? By my ſelf, I ſwear, it ſhall be reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated with the bloodieſt Revenge that ever Traytor ſuffer'd, as a Warning to all others.</p>
               <p>Then he call'd a Council, to deviſe how to bring his Purpoſes about; and after many Debates, it was concluded he ſhould be ſummoned to appear; elſe to be Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law'd for High Treaſon on his Refuſal, and all his Honours and Eſtate confiſcated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:31557:18"/>
Then they order'd, that Sir <hi>Tybert</hi> the Cat, who was wiſe and judciious, ſhould be ſent to fetch him to Court; who being call'd, and having before pleaded in <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>'s behalf, againſt the Complaint of <hi>Curtis</hi> the Hound, would fain have excus'd this Undertaking; but the King's Injucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being ſtrickly laid on him to perform it, he obey'd; only ſaying, That if the Bear, who was of mighty Strength, had been ſo abus'd by him, it was not likely but his Misfortunes would be greater, as being weak; and that thoſe who adviſed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to ſend him, were his Enemies.</p>
               <p>However, Sir <hi>Tybert</hi> went with his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and being on his way, a Swallow flew towards him, which is one of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Birds, which he intreated to turn on the right Hand, but the Bird turn'd on the left, which he thought an ill Augury; yet went with heavy Cheer, till he came to <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardus,</hi> where he found <hi>Reynard</hi> ſitting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gate, to whom he produced his Summons.</p>
               <p>The Fox hereupon welcom'd him with all the Blandiſhments and Flatteries ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, ſaying, I will obey it: Yet, ſaid he, dear Couſin <hi>Tybert,</hi> after your great Travel; let me intreat you to enter my poor
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31557:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Houſe and refreſh yourſelf with ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions as I have, which are, indeed, but mean; and in the Morning I will go with you, for you I dearly love, and can truſt; the Bear indeed was with me, but uſed ſuch brutiſh Rudeneſs, that I was afraid to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, leſt he ſhould deſtroy me by the way: but as for you, I know you to be wiſe, learned, and good-natur'd; ſo that were I labouring under any Diſeaſe, I would put forth all my Strength to accompany you.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid <hi>Tybert,</hi> I believe you; but I remember a little while ſince, you were talking of Proviſion, I muſt confeſs my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Journey has rais'd an Appetite in me, pray Couſin, what have you got to eat.</p>
               <p>Truly, replied <hi>Reynard,</hi> I am but ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided at this time, my beſt Fare is only a few Honey-combs and to thoſe you ſhall be heartily welcome</p>
               <p>Alas, ſaid Sir <hi>Tybert,</hi> that's Meat too dainty and luſcious for me; beſides, I'm not us'd to eat of it; but if you could help me to half a dozen Mice, you would infinitely oblige me, and make me your Servant for ever,</p>
               <p>Mice, replied <hi>Reynard,</hi> love you them ſo well? ſure you are but in Jeſt, but if in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, take no farther care, for here's a Prieſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31557:19"/>
that has a Barn hard by, where they ſwain in ſuch abundance, that you and all your Kindred are not able to deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid <hi>Tybert,</hi> lead me to the Place where theſe Delicates are, and you ſhall find how faithful I will ever be to you.</p>
               <p>Follow me then, ſaid the Fox; and ſo together they went to the Barn.</p>
               <p>Now it had ſo fallen cut, that the Fox, the Night before, had ſtolen a fat Hen, and the Prieſt, in hopes to take him at his next coming, had placed a Gin at the entrance of the Hole, of this he was aware, and laugh'd to himſelf to think how the Cat would be noos'd in it; ſaying, Hark, Sir <hi>Tybert,</hi> how they ſqueak; here's the Hole, enter in, and you will not fail of having your Belly full in a few Minutes; in the mean while I will ſtay and watch without, that none come to interrupt you. But dear Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, be not too tedious, for I know my Wife will be impatient to ſee and embrace you.</p>
               <p>Aye, but, ſaid the Cat, do you imagine I may ſafely enter at this Hole? Theſe Prieſts are crafty Fellows, and couch Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the moſt ſeeming Places of Security.</p>
               <p>O! ne'er fear it, ſaid the Fox: Why, what will you turn Coward, and be faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted? I ne'er perceiv'd this Timer ouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <p>Upon this the Cat ſprung in, and was immediately taken in the Gin, which Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he no ſooner perceived, but he would a ſprung out again, which drew it ſo cloſe, that he was almoſt ſtrangl'd, ſtruggling and crying out bitterly: All this while, <hi>Reynard</hi> was a Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Cat all this while, making a ſloun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to and fro, to get looſe, awak'd the Parſon; who, ſuppoſing it had been the Fox that had been taken, alarm'd his whole Family, and ordering Dame <hi>Jollock,</hi> his Wife, to light up an Offering-candle, he leap'd out of Bed, and run down Stairs, being follow'd by <hi>Martinet</hi> his Son, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who laid ſo unmercifully on <hi>Tybert,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:31557:20"/>
that they not only wofully bruis'd him, but <hi>Martinet,</hi> thinking at one Blow to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of Life, beat out one of his Eyes, which the Cat perceiving, and finding what danger he was in, taking a deſperate Leap between the naked Prieſt's Legs, with his Claws and Teeth caught hold of his Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and brought 'em clear away, which made him a perfect Eunuch; this Dame <hi>Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> ſeeing, cry'd out moſt pitiouſly, and ſwore ſhe had rather have loſt ten Years Offerings, than one ſmall Morſel of thoſe precious Jewels; curſing her hard Miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the time that ever the Gin was plac'd there, to occaſion this Loſs and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; ſaying to her Son, See <hi>Martinet,</hi> thy Father's Delight, and my Jewel, taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the curſed Cat, ſo that now it is quite ſpoil'd; and tho' he may be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and live long, yet he can never be recover'd to my Satisfaction, or be any ways uſeful to me; but it is ſpoil'd to his Shame, and my utter Loſs; O Woe is me!</p>
               <p>Whilſt ſhe thus lamented, the Parſon fell down in a Swound; while <hi>Reynard</hi> lay fleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a diſtance, ſaying, Dame <hi>Jollock,</hi> be not ſo griev'd, there is many a Chapel has but one Bell in it, and that is ſufficient to call the good Wives together: here is ſomething
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31557:20"/>
yet left, therefore be not ſo diſcontented.</p>
               <p>Now it ſo happen'd, whilſt they were reviving the Prieſt from the Swound his Pain and Anguiſh had put him into, one rubbing his Temples, another running for Holy-water to ſprinkle his Face, and the reſt very buſy about him, that Sir <hi>Tybert</hi> took the opportunity to gawn the Cord in ſunder, and give 'em the ſlip; which the Fox ſeeing, much griev'd that he had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd; he rerurning to <hi>Melapardus,</hi> and the Cat, in that miſerable plight, to the Court, there to complain of <hi>Reynard</hi>'s Treachery.</p>
               <p>The King was exceedingly enrag'd upon hearing and beholding what had happen'd to his ſecond Meſſenger, thro' the Fox's Villany, vowing a cruel Revenge, and call'd a Council how to contrive it, ſo that he might be brought to ſpeedy Juſtice. But, here <hi>Grimbard</hi> the Brock, <hi>Reynard</hi>'s Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, once more perſum'd to interpoſe on his behalf: ſaying, May it pleaſe my Lord, Tho' my Uncle were more Wicked than theſe Complaints make him, yet there are ſufficient Remedies againſt his Miſchiefs: Therefore if you proceed to Juſtice, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your Majeſty it may be done as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to one of his Rank, which is, to give him a third Summons, and then, upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31557:21"/>
his Refuſal to Appear, you may pronounce Judgment and Sentence of Death againſt him.</p>
               <p>Upon this the King ſtornly demanded of the Brock, if he knew any one that world truſt him, ſeeing two of his faithful Servants had been betray'd already to the hazard of their Lives.</p>
               <p>That will I, ſaid <hi>Grimbard,</hi> if your Highneſs pleaſes to command it; and no doubt but I ſhall bring him with me.</p>
               <p>Then the King ordered him to prepare for his Journey; and above all things, to take heed to his Safety: and ſo the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil broke up.</p>
               <p>Moral.] <hi>This ſheweth, that the Brook being diſgrac'd for ſtanding up for his Kinſman, gave not over to vindicate him; ſo ſome Men, innocent 'emſelves, think all ſo, and run 'emſelves into Hazards, by vindicating their vicious Actions. The King's decently buiying the Hin, ſhew the Effects of a good Diſpoſition to the Injured, in giving what preſent Satisfaction they can. In the Bear's Readineſs to fetch the Fox, we find thoſe that hate us, will take hold of any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to do us Miſchief, tho' they run a Hazard in doing it; as we find by his being intrapped by the Fox's Cunning, with a feigned Bait of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

By the Cat's going unwillingly, ſignifies Prudence not to venture upon an Undertaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt cunning crafty Men, leſt we be unadviſedly enſnared, as the Cat was in hopes of Mice.</hi>

                  <p>How <hi>Grimbard</hi> the Brock was ſent to command the Fox to come to Court; how he conſented to come, and was Shriven by him; and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe he made before the King of the Crimes laid to his Charge; whereupon he was condemn'd to be hang'd; with the Confeſſion he made.</p>
               </argument>
               <figure/>
               <p>EArly the next Morning <hi>Grimbard,</hi> the Brock, took leave of the King, and went on his Journey to <hi>Malepardus,</hi> where
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31557:22"/>
he found <hi>Reynard</hi> and <hi>Ermilin</hi> his Wife play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Young; and when they had ſaluted one another, he ſaid, Dear Uncle, take heed to your ſelf, almoſt ever one at Court is againſt you, and your Death will certaintly enſue, with thoſe of your Wife and Children; alſo the Deſtruction of this your fair Palace and other Edifices, if you ſpeedily appear not to vindicate your ſelf; which if you do, upon this third Summons, you will foil your Adverſaries, and put 'em to Silence; for you know better how to plead your own Cauſe then any one; you have paſs'd thro' many Dangers, and came off with Safety: then do not incenſe the King in ſtanding out, but go along with me.</p>
               <p>I fear not, replied <hi>Reynard,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will go to Court; not to anſwer to Crimes, but becauſe I know it ſtands in need of my Council; nor do I doubt to make my Defence, and ſhame my Accuſers.</p>
               <p>Accuſers, indeed, in Men abſence are bold, ſaid the Brock, but when they come Face to Face, they have little to ſay to 'em.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Reynard,</hi> being about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, addreſs'd him to his Wife, ſaying, Dame <hi>Ermilin,</hi> take care of my Children, <hi>Reynardine</hi> and <hi>Roſſel,</hi> and doubt not, but, if I eſcape, I ſhall make quick returu to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:31557:22"/>
Then he took his leave, and went with the Brock, leaving them Weeping, and in great Heavineſs for his Departure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reynard</hi> and <hi>Grimbard</hi> had not gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Mile on their way, before the Fox ſighed grievouſly, and appear'd very pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; of which Alteration the Brock de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Reaſon, the Fox fetching a deeper Sigh than before, replied, Dear Nephew, ſince I am going to venture my Life, and ſome things lie heave on my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it is but reaſonable to disburthen myſelf of 'em, and confeſs 'em to you, that ſo, according to your Wiſdom, you being in Orders, may abſolve me of them, that I may ſpeak the more boldly, when I come to make my Defence.</p>
               <p>Content, ſaid the Brock, ſo that for the future you'll become a true Penitent.</p>
               <p>This the Fox promis'd, and began to make his Confeſſion: I have, ſaid he, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly offended againſt almoſt all Creatures: <hi>Bruin</hi> the Bear, was brought near unto Death by me; <hi>Tybert</hi> the Cat I likewiſe ſnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and caus'd to loſe his Eye; <hi>Chanticleer</hi> I have abuſed, and devoured many of his Children; nay the King and Queen have not been free from my Malice; the Wolf I have injur'd many ways, calling him Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31557:23"/>
the better to delude him into Danger, tho' he is not any ways akin to me, no part of his filthy Blood running in my Veins, however, by this Decoy, I gain'd ſo upon his Eaſineſs, as to make him believe he was exceeding learned, and that I would prefer him to be a Pariſh clerk, which he joyfully hearkening to, I told him, the firſt Step to it was to toll the Bell: Well, he deſired me that I would teach him to do it; ſo finding out Day the Chappel-door careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left open, I faſten'd his Foot to a Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, when making a Jangling with the Bell, the Vill ge roſe upon him and almoſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him; I taught him to catch Fiſh with his Tail in the froſty Weather; and led him to a rich Prieſt's Houſe to ſteal Bacon, where feeding ſo unreaſonably that he could not get out at the Hole he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſnatch'd a Hen from the Prieſt's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and running away with it, dropt it where the Wolf was, where my Purſuers found him, and having, as they thought, beat him to Death, they dragg'd him out and threw him into a Ditch; where not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanging, he revived, and crawl'd home with broken Bones, curſing me all the way; But the more the Fox is curs'd, the better he thrives; for I catch'd by the

way a Stubble-gooſe, and putting her up into my Mail, went to <hi>Malepardus,</hi> and made merry with my Wife and Children: Another time I led him to a Place where I told him, there was ſeven Hens and a Cock, which indeed there was before I had ſtole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and convey'd them to my Den, and there I thruſt him on a Trap-door, ſo that he fell down into the Houſe many Stories, raiſed the Family, who crying out; <hi>The Wolf, the Wolf,</hi> roſe with Tongs and Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and ſo belabour'd him, that had he not eſcaped at a Door, left open by Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, they had there ended his Life. Thus at ſundry times I've brought him to the Brink of the Grave: yet, like a true Fox, can deny it upon the account of any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to my ſelf, as confidently as if I had never ſeen him in all my Life: I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Dame <hi>Arſewind</hi> his Wife, of which I muſt likewiſe repent, tho' I am now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd before you, who are a very modeſt Perſon, to expreſs the manner of it:</p>
               <p>Nay, ſaid <hi>Grimbard,</hi> if you make your Shrift imperfectly, I know not how to allot your Pennance, and abſolve you.</p>
               <p>Truly, reply'd the Fox, I've often lain with her; firſt by force, when I perſwaded her to thruſt her Head and Fore-feet into
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31557:24"/>
a Yoak, telling her it was a Nun's Veil and that I'd teach her to ſing her <hi>Ave Mary</hi> and afterwaads often by her Conſent, ſince ſhe has been married to <hi>Iſgrim;</hi> and now I've told you all; order me my Pennance.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid <hi>Grimbard,</hi> break of that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel-wand with your Teeth. Which the Fox readily did; then ſaid the Brock, Give yourſelf three Stripes on the Body. With this he alſo complied; then ſaid the Brock Lay it down and leap over it, without bowing your Legs thrice. This he did likewiſe. Now, ſaid <hi>Grimbard,</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but one thing more, and I abſolve you, and that is, take it up and kiſs it gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in token of your Repentance and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
               <p>This done, the Brock abſolved him of his Murders, Thefts and other Crimes to that Day: So that the Fox exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, not that he fancied it ſignified any thing, but that it being told at Court, might ſtand him in ſtead with the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous, and beget in them a better O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of him for the future. Yet for all this, <hi>Reynard</hi> could not long diſlemble, for as they paſſed by a Nunnery where many Geeſe and Pullen were ſtraggling on the Common, he leap'd at a fat Hen, but ſhe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31557:24"/>
ſtruggled and got away from him, leaving him only his Mouth full of Feathers; for which the Brock extreamly chid him, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in mind of what he had lately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; but it ſignified little, for till they were out of ſight, he looked back and kept his Eyes on them, his Chops watring after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But you, my gracious Lord, may do your Pleaſure with your humble Slave who has no other Hope againſt ſuch powerful Opponents, but in your Royal Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, tho' my Death is too mean a Sacrifice for your Anger, and can yield you little Profit; yet

This made <hi>Reynard</hi> look pale, eſpecially when he found the King was no longer to be won on his ſide, for he cauſed him immediately to be arreſted, and upon plain Proof of many notorious Crimes, by ſeveral credible Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt him, Sentence was paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, That he ſhould be executed on a Pair of Gallows of twenty Foot high <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>This Requeſt was thought reaſonable by all, and the King thereupon giving <hi>Reynard</hi> leave to ſpeak; after fetching a deep ſigh, he thus proceeded: <hi>Alas! I ſee few here whom I have not offended in a grievous manner, tho' in my Youth I was accounted Vertuous; but playing with Lambs, at laſt I fortunated to bite one, and taſting the ſweetneſs of his Blood, I could not forbear till I had murthered many, this carried me likewiſe among the Goats, to deſtroy many of their Kids, then I fell upon Hens, Geeſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſo by degrees my Crimes encreaſed to greater matters, till roving in the Winter, I met with Sir</hi> Iſgrim, <hi>who lay in a hollow Tree almoſt famiſh'd, and made him believe he was my Uncle, declaring unto him my Pedigree, ſo that he ſeem'd to be very glad of his Kindred; and from that Day (which I am bound to curſe) I ſtruck a League of Friendſhip with him, and we together murthered many of your noble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the leſſer not being ſufficient for his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Maw, as, Bucks, Does, Rams, Ews, and

               <p>When the King heard him ſpeak of ſuch great Riches, he interrupted him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to declare how he came by it; as being deſirous to be poſſeſſed of it: To which the Fox replied, <hi>My Lord, this Wealth indeed was ſtole, and had it not been ſo it had coſt you your Life, which Heaven deſend from the bloody Deſigns of your Enemies.</hi> When the Queen heard him ſay ſo, ſhe ſtarted, ſaying,</p>

At this the Lion ſtared on him as if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it not; ſaying, he had heard of moſt Places in the World, as well Cities and Towns, as Foreſts and Rivers, but never heard of theſe. O my Lord, replied the Fox, as I am a dying Creature, unleſs your Mercy be extended to me, it is certainly true; and if my Words gain no belief, even <hi>Keyward</hi> the Hare, tho' he declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without Cauſe my Enemy, if he be ſworn, will give you an Account of the Wilderneſs and River. Then was <hi>Keyward</hi> call'd and put to his Oath to anſwer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Truth to ſuch Queſtions as ſhould be demanded of him. Then ſaid the Fox, <hi>Keyward,</hi> let not Prejudice hinder you to anſwer my Queſtion, Know you <hi>Creck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neypit?</hi> Yes, very well, replied the Hare, it is a great River that runs thro' the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Hulſterlo,</hi> where Father <hi>Simony</hi> the Monk, was taken coming falſe Money, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years before <hi>Ringwood</hi> the Hound and I

ſcrap'd Acquaintance: I may well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it, for there I have endured many bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Winters. Upon giving this Teſtimony he was ordered to withdraw. Then ſaid the Fox, May my Relation be now credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Yes, <hi>Reynard,</hi> ſaid the King, and I intreat you to excuſe my Jealouſie, which could not be leſs, ſince you have ſo many times deceived me; but, however, it will be convenient that you go with me, and ſhew me the Place. Alas, ſaid <hi>Reynard,</hi> I ſhould be proud to attend upon your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the willingeſt Creature in the World to do it, had I not Yeſterday made a Vow if I eſcaped with Life and Liberty, I would immediately take a Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome</hi> to be abſolv'd of the Pope's Curſe, which I lay under, for perſwading the Wolf to run away from a Monaſtery where he had enter'd himſelf a Monk, upon his complaining to me that he was almoſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed for want of Food, tho' indeed he eat as much as ſix; and from thence I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to paſs to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to mortifie myſelf by Faſting and doing good Works, that I may waſh off the Stains my Crimes have fixed on me. Well, replied the King, if ſuch a Vow be upon you, and you under the Cenſure of the Church, you ſhall not

accompany me, but depart and perform what you have promiſed: I will take <hi>Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Hare and ſome others with me, who may direct me as well.</p>
               <p>The Fox greatly rejoyced at this; and the Conference was no ſooner over, but the King and Queen mounted on a Scaffold, in ſight of all Beaſts preſent, placing the Fox between 'em, and Silence being commanded the Lion thus began: All you my Subjects, who are here aſſembled, give good Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what I ſhall ſay: In <hi>Reynard</hi> I find no Fault, or at leaſt ſuch as he has repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of; therefore I conſtitute him one of my ſupream Miniſters in State-affairs, and of my Houſhold the chief Officer, freely acquitting him of all his Treſpaſſes, and conſigning to him a general Pardon for all Crimes committed by him to this very Moment; and therefore command you, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Allegiance, to do to him, his Wife and Children, that Reverence as is due to their Characters; for he is going a Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome</hi> to repent him of his Sins, and obtain the Pope's Abſolution.</p>
               <p>When the Wolf, Bear and Cat heard this, they were much griev'd that his Flatteries and Lies had prevail'd againſt the Truth; ſo that the Wolf could not forbear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining

againſt the Fox to the King, with ſuch Arrogance, that being ſeconded in the manner by the Bear, it was taken ſo heinou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, that they were both arreſted for High-Treaſon, and bound hand and foot, ſo that they could not ſtir from the Place where they lay; afterward they were caſt into a Dungeon, which not only overjoyed the Fox, that his Project had taken ſo well, but ſtruck the reſt of his Enemies with ſuch Fear, that they immediately departed; yet here he ſtopped not, but petitioned the Queen to have as much of the Bear's Skin as would make a Male; as alſo to have the Wolf's two Foreſhoes, and his Wife's Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhoes, to keep his Feet from the Stones and and Gravel which were taken from them with great Pain and Danger of their Lives; yet notwithſtanding the intolerable Pain, they durſt not revile the treacherous Fox, who had been the Occaſion of their Miſeries.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Reynardine</hi> had greas'd and fitted on his Shoes, he deſired that his Staff might be bleſſed and delivered to him according to the Uſe of Pilgrims; which the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Ram to do, as alſo to ſay Maſs over him before he departed; but he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, becauſe he was under the Pope's

Curſe, unleſs the King would ſecure him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Biſhop and Ordinary; but when he ſaw the Lion angry, he trembl'd for Fear, and immediately ſung Maſs over the Fox, who little regarded it, more than to have the Honour of it; then giving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to his Staff and Male, he deliver'd it to him; ſo the Lion and all the Beaſts at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Fox part of his Way, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loath to depart, tho' inwardly he deſir'd nothing more than to be rid of their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance; ſo that he intreated the King to return for his Health's ſake, and to prevent the Danger that might happen if the Wolf and Bear ſhould get looſe and raiſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Commotions; ſo taking ſolemn Leave, the King return'd with all the Beaſts, except <hi>Keyward</hi> and Sir <hi>Bellin,</hi> whom <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> perſwaded to go further with him; ſo, by degrees, with pleaſant Tales and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, he drill'd 'em by unknown Ways, to <hi>Malepardus,</hi> that being his furtheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Pilgrimage; and now he was fully reſolved to be revenged on the Hare for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing him to the King; wherefore at the Gate of his Palace, he ſaid, <hi>Sir</hi> Bellin, <hi>if you'll but ſtay a little here, I and</hi> Keyward <hi>will ſtep in a few Moments, and take Leave of my Wife and Children, where he ſhall be Witneſs

               <p>
                  <hi>Keyward</hi> no ſooner heard this, but he trembled, and cried to <hi>Bellin</hi> for Help; but <hi>Reynard</hi> ſoon caught him by the Throat, and ſtopped his Noiſe, ſo they eat him up all but the Head, which the Fox ſaved to enſnare the Ram's Life.</p>
               <p>After they had merrily breakfaſted on poor <hi>Keyward</hi>'s Carcaſe, the Fox declared to his Wife, That this Fact known at Court, would make all be disbelieved he had ſaid, and then ſpeedy Search would be made after him: therefore if ſhe would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to it, he thought fit, for both their Safeties, to change the Place of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad,

               <p>Whilſt theſe things paſſed within, <hi>Bellin</hi> was without waiting, with much impatience for the Hare's Return, that they might go back to Court, and therefore call'd aloud for him to come forth; whereupon the Fox went to him, and ſaid, Good Sir <hi>Bellin,</hi> be not angry, for <hi>Keyward</hi> is ſo engag'd in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with his Aunt, he cannot leave her, nor can ſhe as yet part with him, her Love is ſo great to him; but if you will be pleas'd to go a ſoftly Pace before, you know he is light, and will eaſily overtake you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have travelled many Miles. Nay, ſaid the Ram, but, if I miſtake not, I heard <hi>Keyward</hi> piteouſly cry out, Murder. Alas, replied the Fox, then you are miſtaken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; can you ſo much as fancy he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Hurt under my Roof? far be that Thought from you: True it is, there is ſome thing in it; you might hear him cry indeed, for when I told my Wife the long and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Pilgrimage I had undertaken, ſhe ſwounded away for Grief; whereupon <hi>Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> thro' the great Affection he bears her, fearing ſhe would have dy'd, cry'd out, O!

but ſoon ſhe was revived to his and my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Joy, whereupon he left crying. But letting theſe things paſs, you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I promis'd to ſend the King Letters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Departure, which all this while I have been writing, and muſt intreat you, dear Couſin, to carry.</p>
               <p>I would be your Friend in this, ſaid the Ram, but I am, as you ſee, unprovided of any thing to put 'em in, and to carry 'em in my Mouth would look ridiculous. Well, ſaid the Fox, for this trouble not yourſelf, you ſhall have my Mail, which you may hang about your Neck, and carry with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trouble; they are ſo well penn'd that you will gain Credit by 'em, if not Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I am conſent you ſhould have the Praiſe of 'em, and ſay you dictated the Words, whilſt I writ them down.

When he came to Court almoſt breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for haſte, he found the King ſitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Nobles, diſcourſing of <hi>Reynard</hi>'s Pilgrimage, many pitying him for his tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Journey he had undertaken, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded him for his Reformation from a wicked, to a virtuous Life; but when the Lion ſay the Bear's Skin-mail about the Ram's Neck, with ſomething weighty in it, he wondered, and the more, becauſe he came without the Hare; and thereupon demanded where he left the Fox: My Lord, replied he, I attended him to his Houſe, and from thence I brought theſe Letters, which, indeed are of my own indicting, tho' my Couſin writ them over, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to your Majeſty, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but they'll give your Highneſs great Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>The King commanded <hi>Bocart</hi> his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to take off the Mail, open it, and read the Letters with a laudible Voice; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Letters, he had no ſooner put his Hand therein, but he drew out murdered <hi>Keyward</hi>'s Head, which ſtruck the whole Aſſembly into a great Conſternation; and the Ram ſeeing how he was impoſed on, trembled, and fell on his Knees, craving Mercy. The King having by this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31557:36"/>
himſelf from his Amaze, with an angry Voice, his Eyes ſparkling like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſaid, How blinded was I in my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, e'er to credit this Traytor <hi>Reynard,</hi> who under all his fair Speeches, covers Malice and Miſchief. Whereupon he groan'd terribly, and hung down his Head for Anger and Shame to be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on, as likewiſe did the Queen; which Sir <hi>Firelapel</hi> the Libbard, who ſat next to the King, perceiving, thus began:</p>
               <p>Let not Sorrow come near your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Heart for this trayterous Deed, but keep it for nobler Purpoſes: Are not you Lord of the Foreſts, and all your Subjects in your Power to puniſh as you pleaſe? To this the King replied, Dear Couſin, ſuch unexpected Miſchef and Diſgrace as this cannot but touch me near; I am, to my Shame, betrayed by a baſe Villian, whom I too fondly, and againſt Reaſon, credited, one who has made me do Injury to my beſt Friends, and even thoſe of my Blood, as is teſtified in what I have unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly done to the Wolf and Bear on his Accuſation, and my Queen's Perſwaſions, which will ſtick as a Stain and Reproach on me for ever.</p>
               <p>Let not your Majeſty ſay ſo, replied the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:31557:36"/>
Libbard, you ſtand above all Injuries, and your Smiles can eaſily cure the Wounds you have made, the Recompences you are able to give, are ſufficient to reward thoſe that may complain: If the Bear and Wolf have been injured by <hi>Reynard</hi>'s falſe Accuſations, there is a preſent way before you to make them amends: ſince the Ram has confeſs'd himſelf a Party with <hi>Reynard</hi> in <hi>Keyward</hi>'s Death, owned he indicted the Letters, which in plain Terms was murdering the Hare, for no better Conſtruction can be made of it, ſeeing he has audaciouſly brought his Head to your Majeſty, let him and his Lineage be given to them as a Prey: And for <hi>Reynard,</hi> tho he is not in your Power at preſent, yet we will go and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege his Caſtle, take him thence by force, and bring him bound to your Majeſty, to do with him as you ſhall think fit.</p>
               <p>This Council highly pleas'd the King, who immediately ſent the Libbard to fetch Sir <hi>Bruin</hi> and Sir <hi>Iſgrim</hi> from Priſon, where they lay in Chains, expecting every Hour the Sentence of Death; but Sir <hi>Firelapel</hi> no ſooner pronounced their Pardon, but thoſe Fears vaniſhed, they rejoyed when he told them the King was not only ſorry for their Puniſhment he had cauſed to be inflicted
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31557:37"/>
on 'em, but as a Recompence, had deliver'd into their Power the Ram and his whole Lineage, to devour and deſtroy at their Pleaſure, where-ever they met 'em for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; as alſo to hunt and deſtroy <hi>Reynard</hi> the Fox, and all his Lineage where-ever they ſhould find him or them; and for which Privilege they ſhould receive Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents under the Royal Signet, not to be revok'd, if they kept their Fealty inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; upon theſe Terms, coming into the King's Preſence, they were received into Favour again, ſo that at the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <hi>Bellin</hi> was immediately ſlain, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, they went out and deſtroyed a great many of his Kindred, as well ſucking Lambs, as Ewes, and ſo continue to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them to this Day.</p>
               <p>Now upon this Reconciliation great Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting was made at Court, which continued many Days, to which reſorted all Beaſts, and as many Birds as were in Friendſhip with the King; but the Fox he kept cloſe, and would not be preſent, though he was cited, ſo that all manner of Recreations were to be ſeen there: But during this, came <hi>Laprel,</hi> the Coney, with a grievous Complaint againſt <hi>Reynard,</hi> That whereas he was paſſing by <hi>Malepardus,</hi> and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

him ſtanding in the Habit of a Pilgrim at the Gate, ſuppoſing to have paſſed peaceably by him, he leap'd on him at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, and ſtruck him ſuch a violent Blow between the Head and Shoulders, that he fell down, and had he not ſuddenly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and leaped from between <hi>Reynard</hi>'s Claws, tho' very much wounded, he had there devour'd him.</p>
               <p>The Coney had no ſooner made an end of his Complaint, and pray'd Juſtice, but <hi>Corbant</hi> the Rook came flying before the King with a piteous Noiſe, ſaying, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your Majeſty to hear and revenge my Wrongs on bloody <hi>Reynard;</hi> for ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that this Morning, <hi>Sharpbeak</hi> my Wife, leaving our young Ones in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Wood, flew to the Heath to ſeek ſome Food for 'em, where, to our great Amazement, we ſaw <hi>Reynard</hi> lie ſtretched on the Ground like a dead Carcaſe, his Tongue lolling out of his Mouth, and his Eyes fix'd and ſtaring; who, Wo is me! my Wife in her Simplicity, laying her Head to his Mouth, to hear if ſhe could perceive him Mouth, to hear if ſhe could perceive him breath, the treacherous Diſſembler, who had put himſelf into that Poſture to move our Compaſſion, and draw us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his, reach, leap'd up on a ſudden, and

               <p>This mov'd Sir <hi>Iſgrim</hi> to Anger, fearing, if the Fox had this Favour allow'd, he would not, by one Trick or other, fail to get another Advantage over him; ſaying, If my Lord the King's pleaſure be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with your Advice, none of us muſt gainſay it; however, I will maintain <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> a falſe Traytor, and one whoſe Life is deſervedly forfeited, if but for his late abuſing the King, with a falſe Story at <hi>Creckneypit,</hi> which was only feign'd to get his Liberty, and to bring the King's true Subjects into Diſgrace, that he might go on in his Rogueries, and rob and ſpoil all that paſs by his Caſtle: You ſee likewiſe, how little he reſpects the King, who the other Day gave him his Life, that he has ſent him, in Deriſion, <hi>Keyward</hi>'s Head, and laughs at the thoughts of his deceiving him with a feigned Pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>The King heating this, made but light of what the Queen and Libbard had ſaid, and therefore reſolving to take him from his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31557:40"/>
Caſtle by Force, and execute him on his former Sentence, he commanded all the Beaſts to arm, and attend him for that Purpoſe within ſix Days; ordering thoſe that were not foee to this, as any way fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Fox, to turn their Back, that he might know them for his Enemies; and hereupon the Aſſembly broke up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grimbard,</hi> hearing what Danger <hi>Reynard</hi> was in, privately withdrew, to advertiſe him of it, that ſo he might make timely Proviſion for his Safety: <hi>Reynard</hi> no ſooner ſaw him, but concluding he came with bad News, demanded what brought him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? To which the Brock, replied, O Uncle! fly for your Life, the King, with all the Power of his Kingdom, is arming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; your Enemies <hi>Bruin</hi> and <hi>Iſgrim,</hi> are releas'd out of Priſon; and have ſlain the Ram, for bringing <hi>Keyward</hi>'s Head; likewiſe all his Lineage is given up to their Power, and they are now in higher. Favour than ever, wherefore they will not fail to urge your Deſtruction; there are likewiſe exhibited againſt you, new Complaints by <hi>Corbant</hi> the Rook, and <hi>Laprel</hi> the Coney.</p>
               <p>Well, Nephew, replied the Fox, I return you hearty Thanks for your officious Care; but were there a Thouſand conſpiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31557:40"/>
me, I value 'em not a Ruſh; for if I can have liberty to ſpeak for my ſelf to the King, I ſhall be even with ſome of 'em, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are aware; Therefore trouble not your ſelf, Nephew, but let us go in and feaſt on this Pair of young Pigeons, I juſt now took, as they attempted to fly out of their Neſt: So, charging him he ſhould tell his Wife nothing of the Danger, in they went, where <hi>Ermelin</hi> receiv'd the Brock very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. After Dinner, <hi>Reynard</hi> requeſted <hi>Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi> that he would promiſe to ſtand by him, and get him as many Friends as he could to do the like, for he was reſolved to come to Court, and once more face his Enemies. You do well in that, replied the Brock, and on my Life, I will undertake for you, that you ſhall not be without Friends to ſecond you, nor want the Favour to ſpeak freely before the King. Then <hi>Reynard</hi> call'd his Sons before him, and declared to the Brock how forward they were at their Game, that they had the true Quality of the Fox, which was to intangle and betray, and kill when they ſeem'd moſt compaſſionate and all that he had further to learn 'em be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſent out, was to avoid Gins; Snares, and Hounds; which To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſs of his young Kindred made the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:31557:41"/>
Brock greatly rejoyce; and having reſted a little, they prepared to depart; <hi>Reynard</hi> charging his Wife to be troubl'd at no News ſhe ſhould hear, but conſtrue it to the beſt; as alſo to be careful of herſelf and his Children, and keep cloſe the Gates, not letting any one in, Friend or Foe, till his return, or that ſhe heard further from him: And ſo away they went together, not telling his Wife the Cauſe of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whereupon he left her in exceeding Sorrow for his ſo ſudden and unexpected Departure,</p>
               <p>Being on the Way, the Fox urg'd the Brock to take his Confeſſion a ſecond time, for that ſince he was laſt ſhriven, he had committed many Sins; to which <hi>Grimbard</hi> agreeing, he thus proceeded: <hi>You know very well how I caus'd the Bear and the Wolf to be ſerv'd by faſly accuſing 'em to the King, as alſo Dame</hi> Arſewind, <hi>whoſe Hinder-ſhooes were ſtript off at my Requeſt, and further then, know, that the Story that I told the King of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was all feign'd, as was the Conſpiracy of</hi> Bruin <hi>and</hi> Iſgrim; Keyward <hi>I kill'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd the Life of</hi> Bellin, <hi>in ſending his Head by him to the King; the Coney I wounded, and would have ſlain, had he not ſlipp'd out of my Hand;</hi> Sharpbeak <hi>I did ſlay and eat; I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31557:41"/>
put an almoſt fatal Trick upon the Wolf, which in my laſt Confeſſion I omitted to mention, which was thus: As we paſs'd over a Heath, by a Wood-ſide, the Wolf being very hungry, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpy'd a Mare with a curious-fat Colt running by her Side; at this his Chaps water'd, but fearing the Mare's Strength, he reſolv'd to try another Way, whereupon he ſent me to know whether ſhe would ſell it, and if ſo, what the Price wou'd be; when I, to pleaſe him at that time, went and ask'd the Queſtion; to which the Mare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; ſhe would willingly ſell him for ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but when I came to demand her Price, ſhe ſaid, ſhe could not tell it; but if I cou'd read, I might find it written at the botoom of her Hind-foot: Ho, ho, thought I, are you thereabouts; well, this will paſs on my Uncle</hi> Iſgrim, <hi>but not on me; then I told her truly, that I could not read, nor did I come to purchaſe for myſelf, but for the Wolf, who is hard by expecting your Anſwer: Then, ſaid the Mare, let him come and read it himſelf, that we may ſpeedily agree: So I went and told him, if he could read he might have his Belly full, for the Mare would freely ſell her Foal, if he could read to her the Price of him, which, ſhe ſaid, was written on the Bottom of her Hind-foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Read, replied <hi>Iſgrim,</hi> (with a kind of Diſdain) why I have ſtudied at both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31557:42"/>
and can read perfectly well all Languages: Therefore, if that be all, let me alone to buy the Purchaſe. So away he went, but had no ſooner taken up the Mare's Foot, but the crafty Jade, whilſt he was poring on it, ſmote him fall on the Forehead, ſo that he tumbled over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, lying and pitiouſly howling on the Ground, whilſt ſhe gallop'd away, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Trick, her Foal following her the ſame Pace, till they were both out of ſight; whereupon I went to him, and ſaid, Dear Uncle, what have you eaten up all the Colt, and lefe menor one ſmall Morſel? But pray what did you find written on the Mare's Foot; it ſhould be a prick'd Song by your ſinging; indeed you have now ſhewed yourſelf a good Scholar, and gain'd a plentiful Feaſt by it. O Nephew, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, do not add more Miſery to me by ſcoſſing at me, you ſee I am all bloody and deſperately wounded, for whilſt I was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or her Foot, taking the Nails to be Letters, the damn'd Jade, with her long Leg, and Iron-heel, ſmote me on the Head, that ſhe has e'en beat out my Brains. Alas, ſaid I. Uncle, I am ſorry for that; but indeed I took you to be one of the greateſt Scholars; but, I ſee, according to the old
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:31557:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Proverb, That the greateſt Scholars are not the wiſeſt Men. This, with my ſmiling, made him fret exceedingly, but all in vain, he knew not how to help himſelf.</p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Reynard</hi> deſired the Brock to abſolve him; which he did, by making him take certain Stones out of a Brook, and laying them at a Diſtance, rowl himſelf three times over them; and ſo they went on, diſcourſing of Flatteries of Courtiers, the Diſſimulation of Prieſts and Women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till they came to the King's Preſence, where he ſaw many of his Friends, which made him not a little rejoyce; then he fell down before the Throne, whilſt the King wondered how he durſt venture to appear; and thus began to deliver himſelf: <hi>My dread Sovereign Lord the King, and Lady the Queen, May all Bleſſings deſcend upon you to crown you with a laſting Health and Happineſs, and give you Wiſdom, that you may truly diſcern between Right and Falſhood; to know who are your Friends, and who are your Enemies: Here, I am come to excuſe my elf of Crimes unjuſtly laid to my Charge ſince my late Departure; or elſe by this time, I had been far on my Pilgrimage; therefore I beſeech your Majeſty to let me ſee my Accuſers that dare to impute to me any Failing in my Promiſe, or Diſobedience to your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:31557:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To this the King replied, with a ſtern Countenance, <hi>Reynard,</hi> I know you are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, and full of Deceit; but this Day ſhall be the end of your taking Pride in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, for which your Life ſhall immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely pay the Price of my Diſhonour: You have ſhewed your Obedience to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, in the Violence and Murder you offered to the Coney and Rook, who are here to teſtifie again you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My dread Sovereign,</hi> replied the Fox, <hi>their Accuſations I would gladly hear; however, I know it to be falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they accuſed him, as has been reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; upon which the Fox replied, <hi>My Lord, this is a palpable Malice, and no Truth, they are ſuborned by my Enemies, to bring theſe Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt me: I confeſs when my Nephew</hi> Grimbard, <hi>brought me Tidings of it, I was preparing for my Pilgrimage, but it ſo troubled me, that I reſolved not to go till I had cleared myſelf before your Majeſty: The Coney, whom I ever held as my Friend, came to my Houſe, as I was ſaying Mattins, and was kindly welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and feaſted by my Wife, with ſuch, as on a Faſt-day, I could keep in my Houſe; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving refreſhed himſelf,</hi> Ruſſel <hi>my Son, who waited at Table, offered to take away what he had left; whereupon the Coney gave him a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:31557:43"/>
Blow on his Mouth, which made him bleed; which his Brother</hi> Reynardine <hi>ſeeing, and being grieved thereat, fell upon him, and would have ſlain him, had not I, upon his crying out, come from my Devotions and taken him off, giving my Son ſevere Correction for breaking the Rules of Hoſpitality in my Houſe; but, it ſeems, for the good Deed, his Malice has made him poſt to your Highneſs, and accuſe me of a Crime I am ignorant of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for the Rook, there is nothing more falſe than this Accuſation; for, as Yeſterday, I was ſitting at my Door, he came flying about me with great Cries, of which I demanded the Cauſe, he ſaid, Wo is me! for my Wife, Dame</hi> Sharpbeak, <hi>is dead. How came ſhe by her Death? ſaid I. Alas, replied he, Yeſterday on the Heath ſhe found the Carcaſs of a dead Hare, which ſhe eating, and it being full of Worms, they eat thro' her Stomach and kill'd her. This, my Lord, is the Truth, neither more nor leſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be true, which I very much doubt, replied the King, there's another Treaſon againſt you, which I believe, you cannot deny, that is, the Murder of <hi>Keyward,</hi> whoſe Head you ſent me, in Deriſion, by <hi>Bellin,</hi> the Ram, who has been executed, as being only your Meſſenger, and for which you ſhall ſurely die.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:31557:44"/>
At this <hi>Reynard</hi> was much dejected, but being comforted by Dame <hi>Rukenaw</hi> the She-Ape, his Aunt, he took Courage, and replied, <hi>Alas, my gracious Lord, you tell me ſtrange News; is the poor Hare dead? It grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves me to think on't: he was very dear to me, and far be it from me, that I, who lov'd him, ſhou'd have a Hand in his Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſaid the King, ſternly, Thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling Traytor, dareſt thou pretend to guild over thy Wickedneſs with plauſible Words; thou art now too ſure in my Hands to eſcape my Juſtice.</p>
               <p>This made him fetch many deep Sighs, as fearing now his laſt Hour was come; which the She-Ape perceiving, addreſſed herſelf on his behalf, to the King in this manner: My gracious Lord, I beſeech you, for a while, ſuſpend your Anger, and hear what I've to ſay.</p>
               <p>At firſt the King refus'd her Requeſt, but the Queen and Libbard interceeding, ſhe had leave to proceed.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid ſhe, My gracious Lord, there are many here that complain, who have more grievouſly offended; my Kinſman's Merits plead for him, when they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to none, that has been any ways ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable

to your Highneſs; it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to your Majeſty, what Services yourſelf and Predeceſſors have receiv'd from his Father and ſelf, having born greater Reputation in Court than either the Bear or Wolf, or all their Kindred; their wiſe Councils have been in great Eſteem, when others have been rejected; but now things go ſtrangely, his Services are forgot, and thoſe that deſerve not, are token into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, who rather ſeek to Debaſe, than Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, your Majeſty's Honour and Dignity.</p>
               <p>The King replied, Dame <hi>Rukenaw,</hi> had the Offences done by <hi>Reynard</hi> been to you you'd have reſented 'em more: He has been ſo wicked, that of all others, there's none but yourſelf will ſpeak well of him; and you only he has deceiv'd into a belief of his Sanctity, by Flattery and Diſſimulation.</p>
               <p>Nay, replied ſhe, my Lord, I am more wiſe than to be deceiv'd, I know much Good of him, and therefore love him; I can tell how his Judgment and Wiſdom has been applauded by your Majeſty; you may we remember a Man and a Serpent came to the Court for Judgment, and he wiſely determin'd it; when neither the Bear, Wolf or any other knew how to do it; the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If the Man will releaſe him now, and truſt to his Oath, then the Serpent ſhall be at liberty to chuſe whether he will eat him, or forbear; but if he thinks he will break his Oath, then I leave it to his Diſcretion to do as he pleaſes.

               <p>THE Fox having now free leave to plead, ſaid, <hi>May it pleaſe my gracious Lord, you much aſtoniſh'd me, when you mention'd the Death of</hi> Keyward <hi>the Hare; if he be dead! O where is</hi> Bellin <hi>the Ram, that he may ſtand forth and clear my Innocence; beſides, I tremble to think what precious Jewels are loſt, if he has

miſcarried, all the Wealth of both the</hi> Indies <hi>cannot make a Recompence for their ineſtimable Value; but more it grieves me, they ſhould be detain'd from you, to whom I ſent one of them, and the other two to my Lady the Queen, in Reqiutal of her Kindneſs to me in my late Miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, ſaid the King, however it happen'd, I received no Jewels, the Ram only brought me the Head of <hi>Keyward,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this, the Fox look'd very ſad and dejected, crying out, <hi>Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and alas, to me! that ever I ſhould truſt ſo faithleſs a Meſſenger with ſuch ineſtimable Treaſure; the loſs of theſe Jewels, I know, will be the Death of my Wife, when the doleful Tidings comes to her.</hi> Well, ſaid Dame <hi>Rukenaw,</hi> ſorrowing for 'em will little avail; let us hear 'em deſcrib'd, and then we'll take care to find 'em out, in whoſe Hands they are, if all the wiſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Country can diſcover 'em.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O! dear Aunt,</hi> ſaid Reynard, <hi>you do but ſay this to take off my Sorrow, for I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, into whoſe Hands ſoever they are fallen, they will not part with them for any thing on Earth; no Crowns or Kingdoms can buy them from them, if they but know their Virtues, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though their Remembrance does add to my Affliction, yet, to pleaſe you, if the King and Queen deſire it, I will deſcribe them.</hi> Upon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31557:48"/>
this, having Leave given, he began in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firiſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that I ſent to my Lord the King, was a King of Gold, in which was plac'd a Jewel of great Price, it was inamel'd with Sable and Azure, and within it engraven three</hi> Hebrew <hi>Characters, which I could not read; but going to a great Aſtrologer and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſt, he told me, they were the Names which</hi> Seth <hi>brought out of Paradice, when he fetched from the Guardian Angel ſome of the Oyl of Mercy to heal his Father</hi> Adam'<hi>s grievous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and whoſoever wrote it, ſhould he free from Thunder and Lightning, and any Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies againſt him live long, be always victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, reſiſt Temptations, Witchcraft, and be Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Healthful: The Stone ſet in it was of three ſeveral Colours, the firſt like Chriſtial, glittering with Sparkles of Fire, ſo that in the Dark it gave a marvellous Light; the ſecond was clear and ſparkling with Flame-colour, having a Virtue to cure any Defect in the Eyes or Body, only by ſtroaking the Place griev'd, and indeed moſt Diſtempers, eſpecially all Venome: The laſt was of Emerald-colour, mix'd with ſmall Spots of Purple, ſo that whoever wore it, ſhould be matchleſs for Valour, altogether unconquerable, not ſtirred to Paſſion, but Wiſe, Juſt, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> had many other rare Virtues, ſo that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:31557:48"/>
I could not imagin any Creature on Farth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to poſſeſs it but your Majeſty, who is the beſt of Princes. The other two Jewels I ſent to my Lady the Queen, one of 'em was a Comb, made of the Shoulder-bone of</hi> Pantherus, <hi>a Beaſt found near Paradiſe, whoſe Beauty and Smell allures all Beaſts to him, and in this one Bone all the Virtues of him is contain'd, yet it was poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo light, that any Breath of Wind would move it from its place; the Scent of it was ſo rare, that it cured Appoplexies, and all Diſeaſes of the Head, beyond the Skill of the moſt learned Doctors; and between the Teeth of it, which look'd like Silver, were ſpaces in which curious Figures were engraven, and inlaid with Gold, repreſenting the Story, how the three Goddeſſes ſtrove for the Golden Apple, and choſe</hi> Paris, <hi>Son to King</hi> Parimus, <hi>Judge, to determine the Strife; who ſeeing them all naked, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription one it was,</hi> Be it be given to the Faireſt; <hi>he decreed it to</hi> Venus <hi>the Queen of Beauty, in lieu whereof, ſhe gave him the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> Hellen <hi>of</hi> Greece, <hi>Wife to King</hi> Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, <hi>which caus'd the ten Years Wars of</hi> Troy, <hi>and in the end, the Deſtruction of that famous City by the Greeks. The next Jewel as I may well term it, was a Mirror, or Glaſs, wherein whoever look'd, might ſee things at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as plain as if they had been near them,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31557:49"/>
yea, for many Miles: The Wood of the Frame was of ſuch a Nature, that it was exceeding light, no Worms, or ſpace of Time was capable to corrupt or deſtroy it; and on it were fram'd many curious Stories, inlaid with Wood of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Colours, enamal'd with Gold, the Words being written under the Figures in Letters of Gold to explain 'em: The firſt was the Fable of the Horſe, who being at Contention with the Hart, and not able to overcome him, implor'd the Herdſman to mount on his Back, that ſo he might purſue his Adverſary; but being weary, the Hart by much outſtripping him, he deſir'd his Rider to light, that he might reſt. Nay ſaid he, not ſo, for having a Bridle in your Mouth, and Spurs at my Heels, you having once volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily given up your Power and Freedom, ſhall be at Command. At which the poor Horſe, too late, ſeeing what Miſery his Thurſt of Revenge had brought him into, only ſighed and bewailed his Captivity. At another Corner of the Frame was, the Fable of the Aſs and the Hound: It ſo happen'd, that an old rich Farmer had a little Hound that he entirely lov'd, who us'd to play with him, leap'd into his Lap, and feed at his Table, whoſe lazy kind of Life the Aſs ſeeing, and how much the Hound was made of for't, whilſt himſelf, who by his Labour brought in much Gain, was turn'd into a dirty Hovel, to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:31557:49"/>
feed on Chaſt and Straw, reſolv'd to try if his flattering his Maſter might bring him into as great Favour; whereupon one Day as he came home he met him, leap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d upon him, frisk'd his Tail, and ſhook his Ears; but his Maſter little mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it he came nearer to him, and ſtanding on his Hind legs, laid his Fore-feet on his Shoulders, braying horribly, and offered to kiſs him; by which the Maſter was thrown to the Ground, crying out piteouſly, Help, help, this wicked Aſs will murder me. Whereupon his Servants came running with Cudgels, and ſo belabour'd poor</hi> Baldwin <hi>the Aſs, that with a bruiſed Pate and broken Bones, he was forc'd to fly to his Hovel for Shelter, where lying down on dirty Sraw, he thus complain'd to himſelf; O Wo is me! I ſee I muſt be a poor laborious Aſs, whilſt idle Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites Flatterers live by my Toil and Sweat, in Eaſe and Pleaſure.</hi> At another Corner was the Story of my Father and Sir <hi>Tybert,</hi> who travelling together by a Wood-ſide, and being eſpied by the Huntſmen and Hounds, when my Father ſaid to the Cat, Climb up that Tree, for I have a hundred Wiles to eſcape. Whereupon he immediately chamber'd up a high Oak, where, among the thick Boughs, he remain'd ſecure and unſeen, whilſt my Father was purſu'd near at the Heels; and had he not drop'd his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31557:50"/>
Mail, and flipp'd into a Hole, he had, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his Wiles, become a Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt to the greedy Hounds; whilſt the Cat ſtood ſecurely ſcoffing, ſaying, Now, Sir <hi>Reynard,</hi> it's time to uſe all your Cunning, or your Skin goes to the Furrier's At the fourth Corner was the Story of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Wolf, to the Crane, who having with his long Neck and Bill, pull'd a Bone out of his Throat, that ſtick croſs, which grievouſly pain'd him, and had certainly kill'd him; he not only refus'd Sir <hi>Gruin</hi> the Crain, his Reward, but ſcoffingly told him, It was well he eſcaped with Life; ſince when his Head was in his Mouth, it was in his Power to have bit it off; and ſince he was ſo kind as not to do it, he ought to take that for Satsfaction: which proves his high Ingratitude, not only to the Crane, but to me who have done him much good. Theſe, and a number more, were the Devices that beautified this ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jewel, which makes me ſhed Tears for its Loſs, ſince, with ſuch Care, I took it from the reſt of my Father's Treaſure, to preſerve it for your Majeſty: And one thing more there is that much troubles me, which is, That your Majeſty ſhou'd ſay, That neither my Father nor myſelf have
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31557:50"/>
done any Good, but been troubleſome to the Court: Remember, I beſeech you, when you were young, how your Royal Father, lying on a languiſhing Bed, deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Life my Father came from his ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Phyſick at <hi>Montpelier,</hi> and coming into the King's Preſence, he ſaid, Ah! <hi>Reynard,</hi> I am grievous ſick, and muſt die, unleſs your Learning and Skill in Phyſick can find a Remedy.</p>
               <p>Let not my Lord ſay ſo, replied he, then feeling his Pulſe, and viewing his Urine he found it was a Pleuriſie, and might be cur'd, by eating the Liver of a Wolf of ſeven Years growth. This, <hi>Iſgrim</hi>'s Father hearing began to tremble; but the languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King caſting his Eyes on him, ſaid, Sir <hi>Iſgrim,</hi> you hear this, and I am ſorry it falls on you, yet, for the Publick Good, you muſt not value your Life, ſince in mine the whole Common-wealth is ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.</p>
               <p>Then the Wolf began to excuſe it, ſaying, He was not meant by't, for he was but five Years old.</p>
               <p>However, ſaid my Father, that matters not, let me ſee the Liver, and then I can tell whether it will fit or not.</p>
               <p>So the Wolf was ſlain by the King's Cook,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31557:51"/>
his Liver taken out and dreſs'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon your Father recover'd his Health, and liv'd many Years; tho' perhaps your Highneſs was ſo young then, that this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is ſlipp'd out of your Memory; tho' my Father was honoured for this with a Gold Chain and Medal, which I yet have. Nay as for my own part, I may boaſt of ſome little Service done to your Majeſty; you may well remember, how when this Wolf preſent, and I, had kill'd a fat Swine, you and your Queen came very hungry out of the Foreſt, where you had been taking the Air, and demanded a Share, but <hi>Iſgrim</hi> grumbl'd, and would allow you none of his Part; however, I beſtowed mine on you freely; but that not ſufficing, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome of his, which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying away, and for his Refuſal gave him ſuch a Blow with your Royal Paw, as fetch'd the Skin over his Ears, and then compelled him to hunt for more; when I going with him, we ſoon found a fat Calf and brought it to you, and it being my Lot to divide it, I gave half to the Queen and half to you; the Intrails I ſent to the Princes your Children, giving the Wolf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Head, and being myſelf contented with the Feet, which made you ask, Who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31557:51"/>
taught you to divide ſo well? To which, pointing at the Wolf's Ears, I replied, That Fxample before me made me ſee how to behave my ſelf towards my Betters. This you applauded, and was very much pleas'd at what I had done; but now, by Flatterers and Upſtarts, all my paſt Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are forgotten, and I am trampled on, who having done well, whilſt they for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wickedly, are exalted: There was a time that nothing was done without my Advice, but that is paſt, and I muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with my Sufferings.</p>
               <p>Well, replied the King, grieve not ſo much Sir <hi>Reynard,</hi> for that Day mny be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, if you behave yourſelf as becomes your Birth; I have nothing more to lay to your Charge, but <hi>Keyward</hi>'s Death, and and the Diſgrace you put upon me in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; but <hi>Bellin</hi> being executed, and no Witneſs to prove it, as to Matter of Fact, I muſt take your Word that you are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and acquit you.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Fox fell on his Knees, and returned him hearty Thanks; vowing, by his Holineſs's Toe, none could be more ſorry than he for the Death of the Hare: but more particularly for the Loſs of the Jewels, which, he ſaid, the treacherous
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:31557:52"/>
Ram had embezelled; but that Search ſhould be made for 'em in all Parts of the World, both by Art Magick and ſtrict En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; which highly pleas'd the King and Queen; ſo that the Fox was diſmiſs'd to take his Repoſe, and make merry with his Friends; whilſt the King conſulted what ſhould be done for him.</p>
               <p>The Moral.] <hi>The Relation the Fox makes of the Jewels, which he knew would be Baits to a covetous Mind, ſhews a cunning Diſſembler, who knows how to blow with all Winds, he well knew if this gained Belief, his Intention of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em to their Majeſties would gain his Pardon, which he fancied his ſeeming Sorrow wou'd work on 'em, upon their Loſs, and that his inculcating to the King, his Father's, and his own Services, would much further it; which indeed, is the greateſt Inſinuation to gain Belief of our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</hi>

               <p>THE Fox at this unexpected Deliverance, and Hopes of Advantage, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joyful, laughing his Enemies to Scorn; which ſo enrag'd the Wolf, that he reſolved to lay new Accuſations to his Charge; and therefore when he was call'd into the Council, he ſtood up and crav'd An <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

ſhould again be deceiv'd by this Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, compoſed of all Falſhoods and Deceits, to whoſe Oath there is no Credit to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: This Villian, notwithſtanding he now looks ſo demure, lately raviſh'd my Wife; and put us both in Danger of our Lives: for perſwading her to take Fiſh with her Tail, whilſt ſhe, ſilly Soul, ſtaid ſo long in a froſty Morning till it was frozen in, he leap'd upon her and raviſh'd her before my Face, I being then at a Diſtance from him; but upon my Approach he ran away, and raiſed the Village upon us, ſo that we were deſperately wounded, and ſhe freed from the Ice, with the Loſs of four Inches of her Tail.</p>
               <p>To this the Fox replied, My Lord, It is altogether Untruth as to any Rape; I taught her indeed to catch Fiſh, and ſhe caught a great Number; but ſhe over greedy, ſtaid too long, till ſhe was frozen in, then ſhe call'd me to help her out, which I labour'd to do with all my Strength, but he, over-jealous of her, ſeeing me at a diſtance, ſuppos'd me over-familiar with her; to avoid whoſe Fury, I retired; then they ran howling about the Fields to catch 'em a Heat, which made the People come out armed in Purſuit of 'em. This, my
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:31557:53"/>
Lord is the Truth, and Truth is the Badge of our Family; which in eight Days I'll prove by ſufficient Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid Dame <hi>Arſewind,</hi> O thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling Villian! this is not only true, but more; for finding you once in a Well, got down in a Bucket, I ask'd what you was doing? and you replied, you had there found ſo many Fiſh, that you had almoſt broke your Belly with 'em, and yet great ſtore was remaining; then ſaid I, <hi>Reynard,</hi> how may I come to help you to devour 'em? O Aunt, ſaid you, get into the other Bucket, which is aloft, and you will be preſently with me; ſo I leap'd in, when by my Weight I deſcended, and you aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got out; then with Taunts and Jears, you left me there, where I narrowly eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Life, being found half ſtarved by the Swains, that came to draw Water for their Sheep, who miſerably beat me.</p>
               <p>Why Aunt, replied the Fox, if this be true, it was but Self-preſervation, and there is no Mortal, I think, but would free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Trouble, when it lies in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to accompliſh it; beſides, you were more able to bear the Stroaks than I, being both feeble and tender: In this I have taught you that Wit, never to truſt Friendſhip too
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31557:54"/>
far, before you have tried it, leſt you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent your Credulity too late.</p>
               <p>Well, Villian, ſaid <hi>Iſgrim,</hi> you may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over my Wife's Weakneſs, tho' it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you not; but do you remember, Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, how you ſerv'd me with the She-Ape?</p>
               <p>I remember, replyed the Fox, ſhe gave you due Correction for your Sawcineſs and Brutality; and, if you pleaſe, I will relate the Story before this noble Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>With all my Heart, ſaid <hi>Iſgrim,</hi> if you will ſpeak Truth.</p>
               <p>Fear it not, ſaid the Fox; And thus my gracious Lord, it happen'd, As I was ranging the Woods, <hi>Iſgrim</hi> found me, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of Hunter, asking me if I had any thing to give him, or could ſet any Prey for him; for he is naturally lazy of himſelf, and will rather undergo the Hazard of ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, than labour, as other Creatures do for their Food: I told him, at that time I could not, and ſo we travell'd together in various Diſcourſes, till we heard a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in a Hole, under a Tuſt of Buſhes, where I imagin'd there might be ſome Prey; thereupon deſired him to go in, by reaſon of his great Strength, to ſeize it, but he ſtrained Courteſie with me, ſaying, He was afraid leaſt Serpents ſhould lurk there; but
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:31557:54"/>
I being wiſe and ſubtle, might better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Danger, and he would ſtay till I returned to give him an Account; ſo, to pleaſe him, I ventur'd, and found there a monſtrous She-ape with her Young, the ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glieſt that ever I beheld, the Place ſtunk abominably with their Piſs and rotten Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they lay on; yet being willing to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him with Food, of which I ſaw great ſtore I ſpoke her very fair, calling her Aunt tho' indeed, none but <hi>Rukenaw</hi> of that Kind is my Aunt, ſaying, Much Joy to you and my fair Couſins, your Children; I would have viſited you ſooner had I known of your Lying in.</p>
               <p>Truely, <hi>Reynard,</hi> replyed ſhe, I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you find me no better provided; but to ſuch as I have you are heartily welcome.</p>
               <p>Then ſhe ſet before me Venſion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proviſions, on which I ſeemed hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feed, the better to pleaſe her, tho' indeed, the Stench had much impaired my Appetite: Then ſaid ſhe, Nephew, I am glad you are come, being the worthieſt and wiſeſt Gentleman in the King's Dominions, that I may recommend the Care of my Children to you, to be train'd up in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and induſtrious Ways, that they may know how to live, and behave themſelves
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:31557:55"/>
in the World with Credit.</p>
               <p>I told her I would do any thing for her, and the good of my young Couſins at my next viſit, which ſhould be very ſhortly; ſo being willing to be out of this noiſom Place, I made my Compliment of Leave; but ſhe forc'd upon me a ſide of Veniſon, to carry to my Wife, which when I came out, I gave to the Wolf who lay howling under a Tree for Meat; but that not half ſufficing him, he ask'd if there were any more in the Place? I told him there was, and he might have it, if he could diſſemble and give ſmooth Words; O, ſaid he, let me alone for that: and ſo he grecdily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, yet he had not long been there, but I heard him howl moſt terribly, and ſoon after he came ruſhing out, with his Ears bloody, and his Skin torn in many Parts; for, it ſeems, he had not only reproach'd her with her own and her Youngs Uglineſs but went to take away her Meat by force, wherefore they all fell upon him, and uſed him as he deſerv'd, for ſo ill timing his brutiſh Language, ſince he ought to know according to the old Proverb, That how deformed ſoever they be, each one eſteems her own the faireſt. This my Lord, is the Truth of the Matter, and if he can deny it, let him ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:31557:55"/>
The Wolf hearing this, fell into a great Rage, (for indeed he had been betray'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Place by <hi>Reynard)</hi> ſaying, Thou Traytor, this, as all the reſt thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, is utterly falſe; and to juſtifie it, and that thou art the baſeſt of all Traytors, I will prove upon thy Body by Combat, according as the Laws direct: in Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, I throw down my Gage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, if thou dareſt take it up to anſwer me.</p>
               <p>The Fox doubting his Strength, knew not what to think of it: yet conſidering the Wolf's Claws, ſince the laſt ſtripping, were not grown again, and contemning to let his Courage fall before ſo many of his Kindred; and that what he had ſaid might thereupon be ſuſpected, he recollected his Spirits, and ſtarting up, ſaid, Whoſoever accuſed him as a Traytor, was a Liar to his Face, and he would prove it upon his Body by Arms, when, or whereſoever he ſhould be required to it. That do I, ſaid <hi>Iſgrim.</hi> Then there, ſaid the Fox, is my Gage to anſwer thee. Theſe being mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually exchanged, were deliver'd to the King, who allow'd the Combate to be the next Day, and took Sureties of 'em for the performing it.</p>

Dame <hi>Rukenaw</hi> underſtanding this, came to the Fox, and drawing him aſide, after ſhe had commended his Courage, as a Grace to his Family, who had been valiant, doing many brave exploits in Arms, at home and abroad, ſhe proceeded to give him ſome Council as to this particular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, ſaying, Good Nephew, be attentive to my Advice, and then the Wolf ſhall not prevail againſt you</p>
               <p>Dear Aunt, replyed <hi>Reynard,</hi> your Love and wiſe Councils have always been ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to me, that I ſhall not forget the leaſt of your Inſtructions, but, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, put in Practice whatſoever you deſire. Then ſhe proceeded in this manner.</p>
               <p>You muſt, to make you the nimbler, and not to be laid hold on, have all your Hair ſhav'd off, except that on the Tail, which you ſhall reſerve to offend your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; then I will ſleek you over with an Ointment that ſhall harden your Skin, and yet make it ſo ſtick, that he can never lay hold of you.</p>
               <p>This being done, <hi>Reynard</hi> look'd very airy and gay, and ſo he went to Bed, in great Hopes of obtaining the Victory: Many other Advices ſhe gave him, too tedious here to mention, and not much to the purpoſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31557:56"/>
of the Hiſtory; but one among the reſt, was, That the next Morning he ſhould drink ſtoutly, the better to expel any Fear; and to piſs upon his Tail, and ſprinkle it as he ſaw occaſion, thereby to blind the Wolf, and hinder his Purſuit. For this the Fox gave her infinite Thanks, and kept her Councils in his Mind, as reſolving to put 'em in Practice.</p>
               <p>He ſlept little that Night for thinking of his next Day's Enterprize; but the Wolf ſlept ſoundly, as fancying himſelf ſure of the Victory; by which we may ſee how Men are often diſappointed of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. In the Morning his Kinſman the Otter came to him, and brought him a young Duck, ſaying, Take good Heart, and eat this to ſtrengthen you, for great is your Undertaking, and requires your utmoſt Strength and Policy to acquit yourſelf nobly</p>
               <p>I thank you for your preſent Advice, ſaid the Fox, and ſo they breakfaſted together.</p>

               <p>AFter this Refreſhment, <hi>Reynard</hi> went, attended by a great number of his Kinsfolks, to enter the Liſts, where the Wolf ſtood raving, and accuſing him as a Traytor; and tho' he had accepted the Challenge, he was ſo guilty he durſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:31557:57"/>
but when they ſaw him marching very ſtately in that Trim, they ſtar'd on him; whereupon the King ſaid, <hi>Reynard,</hi> I ſee you more regard your Safety than your fine Apparel. But he only made his Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and paſs'd on; then entering the Liſt, they were both ſworn by the Libard, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Marſhal of the Field, that their Cauſes were right and juſt; and every one, on pain of Death, except the Combatants, to avoid the Liſt: And now the King, Queen, and Nobles, having taken their places, the Trumpets ſounded the Signal to begin the Combate.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Wolf came towards the Fox with open Mouth and extended Paws, as if he would immediately have devour'd him; but <hi>Reynard</hi> nimbly leap'd between his Legs, and when he turn'd again upon him, he piſs'd on his Tail, and daſh'd it in his Eyes, which ſo blinded him, that it hindred his Purſuit, and in the next Courſe he caſt up the Sand with his Hind-feet, which ſticking to the Urine, put him to more Pain, which whilſt he was clearing, he ſprung upon him, and with his Claws tore the Skin of his Eye-brow down to the middle of his Face, whereupon his Eye hung out, and Blood flow'd exceedingly;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:31557:58"/>
but this enrag'd Sir <hi>Iſgrim</hi> the more, ſo that violently falling upon him, he ruſh'd him to the Ground, and whilſt he laboured to get from under him, he catc'h one of <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>'s Feet in his Mouth, whereupon he cry'd out, Now Traytor, thou are at my Mercy, confeſs thy Sins, and all the Injuries done to me before thou dyeſt, for now thy End is come.</p>
               <p>The Fox finding himſelf in this piteous Plight, betook him to his Diſſimulation, humbly beſeeching Mercy, and for ſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Life, himſelf, his Family, and whole Eſtate ſhould be at his Service, to diſpoſe of as he pleas'd; that he would freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his Guilt, and be at his Command to bring him Proviſions at all times; that he was ſorry he had undertaken the Combate againſt him.</p>
               <p>O thou baſe Diſſembler, replied the Wolf, theſe fair Speeches are made only to eſcape from the Advantage I have over you, and then you will ſing a new Song to my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; but I have been too often deceiv'd, e'er to truſt you more; but will now take my Revenge at full, for the Injuries done to my Wife and myſelf, which cry aloud for Vengeance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reynard</hi> perceiving there was no good to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:31557:58"/>
be done by Flattery, had, by this time, bethought himſelf of a Stratagem; and thereupon, putting down his other Foot between the Wolf's Legs, he catch'd him faſt hold by the Stones, and made him howl in a lamentable manner, ſo that the Fox had an Opportunity to free his other Foot, when leaping upon him, he drag'd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Liſt, as one half dead, biting and taring him in divers places; ſo that his Friends beholding in what a ſad condition he was, petition'd the King to cauſe the Combat to ceaſe, and take it into his own Hands for the Deciſion; of which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as being unwilling to loſe the Lives of either of his Subjects. Then the Marſhal went to <hi>Reynard,</hi> and told him, The King would ſpeak with him; and he muſt, upon pain of high. Diſpleaſure, deſiſt from any further Violence towards the Wolf, for he would, no doubt, decree him the Victory.</p>
               <p>My Lord, ſaid <hi>Reynard,</hi> whatever the King pleaſes to command, I yield ready Obedience to. All his Kindred came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him, and proffered their humble Service; nay, happy was he that could be own'd by him, as knowing he was now on the riſing Ground; if he had loſt the Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, they for the moſt part would have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:31557:59"/>
diſown'd him to be any of their Relations: For ſuch is the Faſhion of this World, ever to adore the Riſing ſun; nay, many embrac'd him with diſſembling Affection, and elaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kindred of him, who before was his Enemies: ſo much the Terror of this wrought in their Minds: And thus with a ſtately Train of about a hundred, or more, he preſented himſelf before the King, falling on his Knees; but the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to riſe up, ſaying, <hi>Reynard,</hi> you have cauſe to rejoyce at this Victory you have obtain'd, contrary to my Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which you have won much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown; therefore ſeeing Right and Juſtice declare on your ſide, I acquit you of all things laid to your Charge, by <hi>Iſgrim,</hi> or any other; and as ſoon as his Wounds are cur'd, he ſhall be try'd, if you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Fox replied, <hi>My Gracious Lord, I have no Malice againſt him, but his to me has brought him to deſerved Puniſhment; yet, if your Majeſty pleaſes, I can freely pardon him, and theſe my Enemies that ſtand about you, who ſided with him when in great Favour with your Majeſty, and could raiſe them to Promotion; but now they ſhrink from him, and are aſham'd to own him; they'er like the Kennel of Hounds, who waited for one bold Hound, who went into
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31557:59"/>
a Lord's Kitchen to ſteal Proviſion, he came out, indeed, with a fair Rib of Beef, but the Cook running after him, threw ſealding Water on him, that took off his Hair behind, which they, at firſt, not eſpying, began to praiſe him for his Venterſomeneſs, but ſeeing how he had ſuffered, they ſlunk away from him, and would no more admit him into their Company, leſt they ſhould be ſerved in the like manner for partaking with him. Theſe, in like manner have left the Wolf in his Extremity, whom I, tho' he is my cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Enemy pity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This diſſembling of the Fox gain'd much Applauſe, ſo that he was immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Court, where a noble Feaſt was prepared for him, with Muſick and Rejoycing, every one praiſing and extolling him for his fortunate Victory: So that now from the Depth of Miſery, he was riſing to the Pinacle of Honour, every one croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to offer their Service to him. Then was he exalted on the King's right Hand, who ſaid, <hi>Reynard,</hi> I expect now you ſhould ſtedfaſtly keep your Allegiance, and let not my Ears be fill'd with any more Complaints of you, then ſhall you always govern in this high Station, and I will be guided by your Wiſdom; whilſt, at my expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, all the Beaſts of the Foreſt bow as

By the Wolf's catching him by the Foot, is noted, how many Men, not knowing how to make uſe of their Advantage, overſlip it to their Misfortune.

               <p>Alas, ſaid the Fox, meeting with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Booty, I have eaten ſo much, that I am even ready to burſt: What dilicious Booty was it? ſaid the Wolf; I have been hunting all this barren Country o'er and could find nothing, but what I ventured my Life for, in leaping a Stye for this poor Pig, flghting firſt the ſharp-twanged Sow, and, e'er I could bear it off, the Farmer's Men, alarum'd by her Cries, fell on me, in my flght, and almoſt broke my Bones; and you well know, could I have got any thing elſe, I wou'd not have ventured ſo for Swine's Fleſh, which I leaſt of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem:</p>

Diligence to pleaſe his Lord, though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge was his Aim, for the Death of his Brother <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and the Loſs of his Father's Treaſure; which, as you have heard, the Panther was mainly inſtrumental in; nor was it long e'er an opportunity was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Hands to execute his Deſigns: For the Panther falling grievous ſick, Dr. <hi>Aſſino,</hi> Brother to <hi>Simpleton</hi> the Aſs, was ſent for, who had ſupplied his Brother's Place, and was no wiſer than himſelf: This Aſs-doctor gave his Patient many Potions, but to little purpoſe: for the Panther being grievouſly ſurfeited by devouring a Stagg he had run down, and withal his Body very foul, his Stomach was ſorely afflicted and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Aſſino</hi> not knowing what further to do to give him Eaſe, or any ways to relieve him: The Fox underſtanding this, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joyful, and coming into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Panther, while the Aſs-doctor was gone to take care of the Medicines, leaſt any one ſhould play ſome evil Trick in his Abſence: But the Fox's Deſign being Michief and Deſtruction, he in the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, infuſed a deadly Bane into it, which, upon taking, ſoon kill'd the Panther, who died in great Torment; and tho' they were both of them vehemently ſuſpected, yet

according to the common Rule of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ignorant Quacks, they ſtrongly alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Panther being old, his time was come, which had it not, a Medicine ſo excellently prepared, had wrought his Recovery; uſing many Allegations to prove it by the Rules of Phyſick and Nature, and the Fox, the better to excuſe himſelf, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his Death extreamly, to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, often going to his Grave, and there ſhedding feigned Tears; ſo that at length he was not only concluded Innocent, but much commended for the great Love they ſuppoſed he bore his deceaſed Lord; and the King hearing of it, ſent for him to Court, and made him his Purveyor.</p>

The King hearing this ſtrange Story, was much perplexed, and ſhrewdly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected his Servant <hi>Crabron</hi> had a hand in it, but having no Proof, he held his Peace for a time.</p>
               <p>The Fox now ſuppoſing he was ſafe, all being deſtroyed that could accuſe or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him; in the midſt of all his Jolity, was daſhed by the arrival of <hi>Lightfoot</hi> the Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, who has lived in the Monaſtery of <hi>Manton;</hi> of him the King enquired, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever he knew one <hi>Reynardine,</hi> that had been an Officiate in the Monaſtery? To this he replied, He had, indeed, heard of ſuch a one's being there, and of the Pranks he had plaid; which agreeing with what <hi>Brindle</hi> had ſaid, increaſed the King's Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, eſpecially when confirmed by <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent</hi> the Lurcher, that came from the ſaid Monaſtery; ſo, whatever Excuſes <hi>Crabron,</hi> or the diſguiſed <hi>Reynardine</hi> could make, the King's Anger encreaſing, he reſolv'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort a true Confeſſion out of him, which he ſeemed to decline, by racking him: <hi>Crabron</hi> hearing his Decree, begged hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have it excuſed, and greatly urged his Innocency; but could not prevail, for the King's Suſpicion more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, he ordered four ſtrong Beaſts to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:31557:75"/>
take him and draw his Limbs divers ways, and not to leave off till he had confeſſed the truth.</p>
               <p>This Puniſhment being immediately put in execution, <hi>Craborn</hi> crying out very griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlly, as if he had been torn in ſunder, though, to ſay the truth, he was little hurt, yet his Tormentors not leaving off, thinking he ſhould at laſt be killed in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, with a mournful Voice he begged to be delivered out of their Hands, and he would freely confeſs all. This being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he, inſtead of performing it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only to excuſe himſelf of not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his Accuſers, or ever being in the Country where the Monaſtery ſtood; which much inraged the King, but for that time he thought it ſufficient to commit him to ſtrong Ward in Priſon, and on the Morrow cauſe him to be racked again, till he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſed the truth of the matter.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Fox was carried off, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly complaining he ſhould die with the Anguiſh of his Tortures, for his Limbs were all disjoynteds, but this ſerved only as a Pretence to make his Guards the more careleſs of him, that he might the better make his Eſcape, which accordingly he did; for being lodged in the Ground-room
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:31557:75"/>
of the Priſon, and ſtrongly locked and bolted in, whilſt his Goalers ſlept, he dug a Hole under the Foundation of the Wall, and creeping through it, fled; but they for their Drowſineſs paid very dear, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed King cauſing them, the next Day, to be executed, as Traytors, for conſpiting with <hi>Crabron,</hi> and furthering his Eſcape to plot new Treaſons againſt his Royal Crown and Dignity; all they could alledge not availing them.</p>
               <p>The Fox having eſcaped thus luckily, travelled all Night, till he came into the Foreſt of <hi>Pitwood,</hi> where Sir <hi>Chanticleer</hi> the Cock, with his numerous Progeny, held his Reſidence, of whom he made a grievous Spoil, till, at laſt, the old Cock ſuſpecting who he was, haſted to young Sir <hi>Firelapil,</hi> and made him acquainted with his thoughts; this young Gallant knowing the King's Proclamation was out againſt the Fox, with Promiſe of a great Reward and Preferment to thoſe that ſhould apprehend him, acquainted the King with it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſeize him and bring him to Court with him; yet <hi>Quickſcent</hi> following his footing, after a tedious Race, run him down and took him; at this the Libard grinned, knowing his Honour was ecliſp'd
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31557:76"/>
thereby, therefore he took the Fox by force from the Lurcher, and made him his Priſoner; but the Bear, Wolf and Hanna envying him that Advantage, fell upon him to take the Priſoner from him; but the two laſt of theſe he ſlew, and put the firſt, ſore wounded, to flight; in the mean while the Fox had eſcaped, had not the Lurcher had a watchful Eye over him, and taken him on freſh Purſuit. Then he was brought to Court, where the King up braid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with his Father's, and his own Treacheries, and ordered him immediately to the Gallows, placing a Writing on his Head of the ſeveral Namms he had gone by to deceive and betray the Beaſts of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
               <p>When he was aſcending the Ladder, he made a free Confeſſion of all his Crimes he had committed, except the Murders, which he laboured to excuſe; and then to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate himſelf with the King, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pardon, he made a long feigned Story of an infinite Maſs of Treaſure not yet diſcovered, giving a large Catalogue of Jewels, Rings, Gold-chains, and Money; then ſeemly offered himſelf to Death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out telling the place where they lay: To this the King began to harken attentively,

yet doubted it was a diſſembling to ſave his Life; yet Covetouſneſs prompting him eargerly to thurſt after ſo great Riches, he, upon <hi>Craborn</hi>'s ſolemn Oath that all was true, cauſed him to be taken from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and returned to Priſon, till he had conſidered the matter, whether it might be true or not; and demanding if it could not be taken up without him, he being kept as a Pledge for the Certainty of its being there; No, replied the Fox, for it was ſecured by one <hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE King finding himſelf thus deluded by the Fox, was exceeding angry, blaming much the Lurcher, but more him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for crediting ſo cunning a Diſſembler; yet reſolving to be revenged, he put out his Proclamation, encouraging the Purſuit of him with promiſe of Reward and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; ſo that a number of Beaſts haſted to the Kingdom of <hi>Zalap,</hi> whether they ſuſpected him to be gone; each poſting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways to outſtrip each other, as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by coming too late, to loſe this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and with them went the Brock, the Fox's Friend, to give him private Notice of the Dangers, if he might find him out without any others knowing it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

What is that? ſays the Woodman. Why, replied he, yonder is a ſtrange wild Aſs without an Owner, fat, luſty, and of a large ſize, that will, if you take him, do you great Service in carrying Wood or other Burthens, much to the eaſe of your own Labour. Where is he? ſaid

the Wood-man. Let me but ſee him, and I'll halter him, I'll warrant you, and ſoon make him tame: and for your Kindneſs in ſhewing me him, when ever you chance to be hunted, make into this Foreſt, and I will do my Endeavour to ſecure you from the Fury of the Hounds.</p>
               <p>The Fox thanked him, and immediately leſt him to the Place where the Aſs ſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Wood-man, upon this, coming ſlily behind him, creeping under the ſhelter of the Bank, ſo that he could not be ſeen of the Aſs, all on a ſudden, to the Aſs's great Surprize, clapped a ſtrong Haltar about his Neck, faſtning it immediately to a ſtrong Poſt that upheld the Pails, and tho' the Aſs ſtruggled and brayed hideouſly, all was in vain, the more he ſtruggled, the more the Wood-man cudgeled him; till quite tired, and ſore bruiſed, he was forced to lie down, and ſubmit himſelf to his Mercy.</p>
               <p>The Fox ſeeing this, laughed heartily, to think how he had taken his Taker; yet, not appearing in ſight, he lay cloſe to ſee the Aſs carried away, and then poſted back

               <p>Nay, ſaid the Goaler, if to take off your Irons, in way of Courteſie to eaſe you, might do you a Kindneſs, could I do it, I ſo much honour your Race, that I would do you ſuch a Courteſie: But how ſhall I come by the Reward, if you are executed; have you any Money about you?

               <p>Whereupon after he had complained a while his Head aked, he fell a reaching and vomiting, declaring, he was piteous Sick, and deſired to have a Phyſician and a Confeſſor ſent for fearing in the caſe of the latter, he might die before Sentence was paſſed upon him, and he was willing to make peace with his Conſcience before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. The Goaler, who had ſtrick Orders to let none come at him, without they brought the King's Signet, ſaid he could not do this; deſiring him in theſe Extramities, to make uſe of him, pretending, boaſtingly of his own Parts and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirments, to be both Prieſt and Phyſician.

which his Goaler being ignorant of, among others, he choſe, and defining him to fetch him ſome Wine to mix them with, the better to take them: The Goaler flattering himſelf, if he pleaſed him well, and he ſhould now die, he would at large diſcover to him his Treaſure he had hid, and no body beſide ſhould know it, fetched a Quart.

O, replied the Goaler, you may well enough uſe it, or if you do not, I can well enough diſpenſe with it.</p>
               <p>This was to the Fox's purpoſe, and thereupon, with ſome of it, he proceeded to mix what Drugs he pleaſed, ſecretly conveying the <hi>Opium</hi> into the reſt; then feigning to be much better, heartily thanked him, and told him, he might take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and for his Confeſſion, he would defer it till he ſaw how he ſhould be, if he thought he ſhould live, he would reſerve it to be made at the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, where his own Confeſſor was to attend him.</p>
               <p>The Goaler ſeemed ſatisfied, and gulped down the reſt of the Wine to the good Recovery of the Fox's Health, and his finding great Favour with the King; and ſo ſitting down, immediately fell into a profound Sleep. Then the Fox took the Keys and opened the Inner-door, in hopes to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the other and eſcape; but there contrary to expectation, he found a Guard, who it ſeems, watch'd Night and Day; this much ſtartled him, wherefore he return'd and attempted the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, but the Bars were ſo cloſe, that he could not get his Head thro'; but then a Project coming into his Mind, he pull'd of ſome of his Wooll and ſtuck it on the Grates, that however, when ſearch was made, they might think he had eſcaped that way, as being grown thin and lean by his long Faſting; and then give over in that place, and

Now two Days being paſſed, his Execution was deſigned the next Morning, and a great Guard came to receive the Priſoner; but inſtead of this the Goaler a waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Effects of his ſleepy Doſe, in great Perplexity, and about to hang himſelf thro' Fear of worſe Puniſhment for his Neglect, and the Anger, that at the ſame time poſſeſſed him for his giving Credit to the Fox's Flatteries and Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, whom he, at the ſame time, knew had often deceived wiſer than himſelf.</p>
               <p>Of him they enquired for the Priſoner, ſhe wing the King's Order for him to deliver him into their Hands; to which he anſwered, in a diſtracted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he knew not what was become of him, but believed him to be the Devil, for he had got from him inviſible, the Doors being ſhut; telling them the Story of his pretended Sickneſs, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his taking off the Irons, nor that himſelf had profoundly ſlept. The Fox heard all this, and could not forbear laughing: Then they looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſee what Place poſſibly he might get out at, and finding no Suſpicion of any, till they came to the Window, where they found his Wool ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Iron-bars; whereupon ſome ſaid he was gone that Way, but others conſidering the Narrowneſs of the Space between, ſaid it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. However, they commanded the Goaler to go along with them, and give an Account of it to the King, that the matter might be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:31557:85"/>
and they freed from Suſpicion and Blame: This Fear made him loath to go; but they told him, if he would not go willingly, they would compel him, and then it would look as if he had purpoſely permitted the Eſcape; whereupon he accompanied them to Court.</p>
               <p>The King hearing the Story, and how he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain been deluded, groan'd with himſelf for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, immediately cauſing the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE FOX, in his cloſe hiding, being driven to great Straits for want of Proviſion, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtifl'd, began to contrive what way he might yet take to make his Eſcape, he attempted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to dig a Hole under the Priſon-wall, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape that way, but found it ſo rocky, after he had digged half a Fathom, that he could go no further; this put him into a pitiful Plight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he concluded to he privately behind the Outward-door, and when it was opened, ſteal out, if he might, unſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:31557:86"/>
This he attempted, but without Succeſs; for ſoarce was he got out of the Court-yard but he was eſpy'd and ſo furiouſly purſued by many Beaſts, that he, in the chaſe of a Mile or two, was taken, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately dragged to the Court, with great Shouts and Acclamations. The King hearing the Noiſe demanded the Cauſe, and being told that <hi>Reynar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> was retaken, he greatly rejoyced, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould be brought before him, which he was with a ſorrowful and dejected Countenance; then he commanded Manacles ſhould be put on him, to prevent his ſtarting for the future.</p>
               <p>This done, he ſaid, <hi>Reynardine,</hi> thou Traytor, you ſee even Deſtiny it ſelf has deſigned you for a ſhameful Death, from which all your Wiles can not free you: What can you now ſay to the many Murders charg'd againſt you?

               <p>To this the Fox replied, Dread Sovereign, I own myſelf worthy of Death: for indeed I have grievouſly offended againſt your Highneſs, and hurt moſt Beaſts in the Foreſts; many I have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dared in Revenge of my Father's Death, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to prevent being diſcovered: As to the firſt, I poiſon'd the Leopard and Panther, who I was inform'd had betrayed my Father, and brought him to a ſhameful Death, and thereby pull'd down your Wrath, upon me, and his whole Poſterity: <hi>Grimlock</hi> the Maſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That I turned Phyſician I own, and that in meer Emulation to ſpoil the Aſs Doctor's Trade; tho' ſince, I think there are ſo many Pretenders, as skilful in Phyſick as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that few but Aſſes turn Phyſicians; and as I did a little purpoſed Miſchief, they do a great deal; mine was on a juſt Revenge, purpoſely, whilſt their is ignorantly, for Lucre and Self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: for where they to be paid if the Patient lived, and not if he died, they would be more careful, or their Trade would be of little Value; but die or die not, it being all one many times, when the Patient's Money is exhauſted, and the Deſeaſe grows tedious to them, and they know not what to make of it, they try Practiſes at random, if he lives ſo, if not, why then truly his time was come and why could help it?
