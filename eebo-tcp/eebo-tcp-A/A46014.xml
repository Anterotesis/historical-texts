         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>BY THE SVPREAME COVNCELL OF THE CONFEDERATE CATHOLICQVES OF IRELAND</head>
            <p>VVEE the ſupreame Councell of the ſaid Confederate Catholickes, hauing of a long tyme, with dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe ſenſe of the ſufferings of the people, and the wayes taken to heape miſeries on this afflicted. Kingdome, beene equally diſtracted betweene the care wee were oblidged to haue taken of the ſafetie and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Confederate Catholickes, and the reſpect which was due from vs, and hath beene aboundantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by vs to the Lord Archbishopp of Firmo, his Hollynes extraordinary Nuntio in Ireland, wee finding his Grace (by the ſuggeſtions of a few perſons, for their priuate ends averſe to ſubiection, and diſaffected to any meane, by which a ſettlement (how advantagious and ſecure ſoeuer for Catholick Religion) might be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced) to inſiſt on ſuch wayes as may bring evident deſtruction vpon this Nation; when neither by reaſon or earneſt ſollicitation, wee could diuert ſuch proceedings, wee are at leinght enforced to admonish the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Catholickes (Whoſe lyues and fortunes are entruſted with vs) that henceforth by any ſuch groundles pretentions and ſuggeſtions, or any act grounded there, vpon, they be not withdrawen from that obedience they owe vnto our Commaundes, leaſt they should expoſe themſelues to that confuſion, and the Kingdome, to that diſtraction, wich might be fatall vnto both. The Coppy of a late declaration againſt the Ceſſation, made by a few Biſshopps conuened before his Grace, and oppoſed by others of them, of exemplar life and emin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent learning, (albeit ſubmitting in obedience to the Maior vote of that meeting they ſubſcribed thereunto) this day affixed by order of the lord Nuntio, the Lord Bishopp of Clogher, the Lord Bishopp of Roſſe, and the Lord Bishopp of Cork, hath draweu vs (much againſt our will) by this our publique declaration to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the honor of the Kingdome, and betymes to forewarne the Confederate Catholickes, of the miſcheefes wich may be fall them, ſince now wee play nely ſee, that contrary to his Hollynes pious affections, for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Catholick Religion, the obſeruance of due allegeance to his Majeſtie, and the preſeruation of vnion among the Confederate Catholickes (theſe being the ſcope of the Lord Nuntio his miſſion,) all wayes are attempted to introduce the miſerie of diſtraction vppon vs, otherwiſe it could not be, that vſe should now bee made of that declaration, after wee had, in concluding the articles of that Ceſſation, fully prouided for the free exerciſe of our Religion and Function, and the poſſeſſions of our Cleargie, and after the Lord Nuntio had ſent vnto vs, by Patrick Bryan and Geffrey Barron Eſquiers, (as a meane to make the Ceſſation conſcionable) propoſitions meerely Temporall, Whereunto Wee haue giuen ample ſatisfaction, as by the ſaid propoſitions and anſweares now printed may appeare. Now therefore, that Wee ſee noe end of the afflictions, vnder which the people doe groane, Wee doe proteſt, that Wee may not giue Way to haue the Gouernment of the Kingdome entruſted With vs, caſt downe, and throd vpon, nor permitt that all affayres, of what nature ſoever, shall (<hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia</hi>) deuolue to a Spirituall tribunall, which muſt follow, if wee may not (without lycence firſt had) either conclude Ceſſation, regulate Armyes, nominate Officers, appoint Commiſſioners, or diſpoſe of places of truſt in the Ciuill liſt. And having reſolued to repreſent vnto his Hollynes our condition, and humbly to begg, (as wee doe hereby) that he would be pleaſed to giue remedie vnto theſe diſtractions (in which wee find ourſelues inuolued) by aſſuming vnto himſelfe the judgment of the matter of Conſcience, pretended in the tranſactions of this Ceſſation, as the moſt powerfull, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and indifferent Iudge, to whoſe ſacred throne, in the behalfe of the ſaid Confederate Catholickes, wee doe therein appeale, Wee doe premonish all and every the Conſederat Catholickes, that nothing proceeding from the Lord Nuntio, vpon this or the like ſubiect, doe leſſen the obedience, wich by oath, and otherwiſe they are oblidged to beare vnto our Comaunds. Giuen at Kilkenny the 27 day of May 1648.</p>
