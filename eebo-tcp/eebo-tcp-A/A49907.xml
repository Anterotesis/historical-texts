            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Letter from Mr. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> to a Friend in <hi>England,</hi> occaſion'd by the Engliſh Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Additions to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on the New Teſtament; with ſomething relating to his <hi>Ars Critica.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAVING perus'd ſeveral Sheets of an Engliſh Verſion of my Additions to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on the New Teſtament, which were ſent me over, I was well ſatisfied with the care and faithfulneſs of the Tranſlator, not doubting of his exactneſs in the other Sheets, which I have not yet look'd over; but conſidering how unfit Judges of ſuch kind of Writings, thoſe who can read them only in their mother Tongue often are, I could not tell whether I had any occaſion to rejoice. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thoſe things are ſubmitted to the Cenſure of the Vulgar, which are in part above a vulgar Capacity; for there are ſeveral things in this Volume, which, tho render'd into Engliſh, cannot be underſtood but by thoſe who have ſome skill in the Greek Language, and in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Eccleſiaſtical Antiquities. No others can ſafely enough judg of them, becauſe the force of Arguments many times entirely depends upon knowing the uſe of the Greek Tongue, or Eccleſiaſtical or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Hiſtory. Yet no Men determine more confidently of theſe things than thoſe who want that knowledg; becauſe they think themſelves competent Judges of every thing that is written in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And therefore I have often wonder'd that the learned Man, whoſe Annotations I have tranſlated into Latin, did not chuſe rather to write in Latin, than in Engliſh; when he very well knew that a great many, nay all the beſt things he had written in them, were ſuch as could not be underſtood by mere Engliſh Readers. Beſides, I did not know whether ſome learned Men of your Church-Clergy might think well of a Tranſlation of my Additions; not becauſe I have any where op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Doctrins of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but becauſe many, I can't tell why, are diſpleaſed that the Books of Strangers ſhould be read by their Countrymen. I have found this by experience, both before
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:99486:3"/>
and not long ſince, when one that was a perfect Stranger to me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my Knowledg and Conſent, turned into Engliſh the Lives of ſome Fathers that I had written in French a conſiderable time before, in the <hi>Bibliotheque <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſelle.</hi> For thoſe Engliſh Lives, which I have not yet ſeen, ſtirred up againſt me the learned Dr. <hi>Cave,</hi> who perhaps would have ſaid nothing about the French Lives; at leaſt he was till that time ſilent, when in truth he had no reaſon to reflect upon me for any thing I had ſaid in them, as I ſhall ſome time or other, and perhaps ſoon, ſhew. And yet there is no man it may be in the Continent, that has a greater value for the Engliſh Clergy, and other learned Men of that Nation, than I, or that ſpeaks or writes oftner in their praiſe; and this not out of Flattery (for what Advantages have I, or can have from thence, who have long ſince ſettled my ſelf in <hi>Holland?</hi>) but becauſe I am really of that mind. And this I have teſtified alſo by my Actions, having tranſlated ſeveral of their Writings into more known Languages than Engliſh, that every one might have the benefit of the Learning of the Engliſh Nation. What therefore can be the reaſon, why ſome Engliſh Gentlemen are unwilling to have my Writings read in Engliſh? I do not know, nor do I think my ſelf concerned to be very inquiſitive into it.</p>
            <p>But as I am a lover of Peace, and utterly averſe to all Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would perhaps have been more for my ſatisfaction if I had continued <hi>under the ſhelter,</hi> if I may ſo ſpeak, of the Latin Tongue, and ſo neither feared the raſh Cenſures of the ignorant, nor provoked the diſpleaſure of thoſe learned Men, who would have no body heard but themſelves. Yet ſince I am forced to take my Chance, and the Bookſeller has thought fit to make me appear to his Countrymen in Engliſh, I ſhall ſay a few things to you, as my Friend, by which I may perhaps remove the prejudices and miſapprehenſions of ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Since my Latin Verſion of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> was publiſhed, I find he is become very famous, by that multitude of Copies which have been diſperſed into all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and are much uſed by all that ſtudy the Scriptures. But notwithſtanding the eagerneſs of Buyers and Readers, there have been divers Cenſures paſſed upon this my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. And ſome of them are come to my knowledg, to which I ſhall briefly reply.</p>
            <p>There are ſome who would not have had me taken up ſo much time and pains in tranſlating Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>; but rather my ſelf have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a new Paraphraſe on the New Teſtament, adding thoſe things which I thought were omitted by other Interpreters. Theſe think too
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:99486:3"/>
favourably of me, and not honourably enough of the learned <hi>Doctor.</hi> But I who know my ſelf and him better, and underſtand what it is to keep within compaſs, count it an honour to have my fragments added to his completer Labours; if I may but do it with the leave of thoſe who are of a contrary opinion. And that I ſpeak herein ſincerely, and not out of any feigned Modeſty, ſufficiently appears by the great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I have taken upon ſelf, more for Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s ſake than my own; for if I had not had a great eſteem for his Writings, I ſhould never have tranſlated ſuch a large Volume; nor would I have added any thing to idle Fictions, or ſpent time in confuting things, the weakneſs of which every one might ſee. And indeed as there are three things requiſite in an Interpreter, without which nothing extraordinary can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from him, and which, if any one has, he does ill except he employs them for the publick good; thoſe, in my judgment, were all found in Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> To wit, a knowledg of the Tongue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Author writes whom we undertake to interpret, and the Subject of which he treats; a continual and careful reading of that Writer, ſo as to become perfect Maſters of his Stile and Method; and laſtly a ſort of Critical or Grammatical Habit, acquired by long Cuſtom, and confirmed by reading the beſt Interpreters, ſo as to be able to apply what we know of the Language and Things, skilfully and pertinently, whenever there is occaſion.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> was not only a very skilful Divine, but an excellent Grecian and likewiſe Hebrician, the Idioms of which Language are often mixed by the Writers of the New Teſtament with Greek Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. They that underſtand only ſpeculative Divinity, often ſtumble in particular Paſſages, and many times look for Doctrins, true indeed in themſelves, but nothing at all to their purpoſe, in places where they are not; and know not how to make a right uſe of thoſe places whence they may really be deduced. They are contented not to oppoſe the received Doctrins, and think they cannot do amiſs in ſeeking them any where, provided the words do not too plainly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. By which means we ſee the Antient Interpreters of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both Greek and Latin, becauſe they had no regard to Words or Grammar, but minded only truth of Doctrine, have ſtrangely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the genuin ſenſe of Scripture. Hence, in part, came innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vain Allegories; which I do not call vain, becauſe they contain falſe Doctrins, but becauſe they are grounded upon no certain reaſon. Hence proceeded the violent Interpretations, and pitiful Subtilties, with which the Writings of thoſe Interpreters abound. We need but read St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Commentaries on the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> where we ſhall ſcarce
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:99486:4"/>
meet with a page, that has not ſome examples of this kind. Which if it were a true way of interpreting, any thing, almoſt might be proved or diſproved out of any place whatſoever. This Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> carefully avoided, and would have avoided more, if ſome particular things had not a little too often occurred to his thoughts; as <hi>the Hereſy of the</hi> Gnoſticks, <hi>the Deſtruction of</hi> Jeruſalem, and <hi>Church-Diſcipline</hi>; which three things he frequently ſought for, where no body acquainted with the Apoſtles ſtile, had ever before look'd for them, and few again ever will. Yet, as I ſaid before, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> does not near ſo often daſh upon this Rock, as the Antient, or moſt late Interpreters, eſpecially thoſe who have written in the laſt Age. I might add this alſo, which is no ſmall commendation of his Annotations, that he follows moſtly that ſcheme of Divinity which is more agreable to Scripture, than the Opinions of many Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, keeping a middle way between thoſe who deduce a ſort of fatal Neceſſity from all eternity, of which neceſſity the Mind of Man is a mere Inſtrument; and thoſe, who like the Heathens, are ſaid to deny that Vertue is at all owing to God.</p>
            <p>No Man that reads his Annotations can doubt, whether he had that other faculty of an excellent Interpreter, which I ſaid lay in an exact knowledg of the ſtile of Scripture, and cannot be acquired but by a conſtant reading of it. We ſhall find but few Interpreters ſo well acquainted with the Sacred Writings: That frequent and exact comparing of the words and expreſſions of Scripture with one another, which the Reader, upon the firſt opening of the Book, may obſerve, puts this matter beyond all doubt.</p>
            <p>The third Qualification, which I ſaid was a Critical Habit of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning the meaning of places, tho it was not ſo great in him as the two former, was however conſiderable. And this I doubt not he attained by a diligent reading of the beſt Writers, eſpecially <hi>Grotius</hi>; and he would have acquired it in a much greater degree, if the conſtant trouble of defending the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt ſeveral ſorts of Adverſaries, had not diverted him. But if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him with the Antient Interpreters, or with the greateſt part of thoſe who have written in the foregoing Age, we ſhall find <hi>none</hi> among the Antients, and but <hi>few</hi> among thoſe of late, that can be thought his Equals. For the Antients tho they underſtood Greek, truſted more to their skill in Rhetorick than Language; and took more pleaſure in running out into common places, or Allegories, than in ſeriouſly interpreting words and expreſſions. <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who beſides underſtood Hebrew, did alſo much more ſeldom
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:99486:4"/>
uſe their knowledg in that kind, than a ſort of Eloquence which took much in their Age. And later Interpreters have been more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to fill up their Commentaries with their own Divinity, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies with other Sects of Chriſtians, than with ſtrict enquiries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſignification of Words and Phraſes. But Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what is expected from an Interpreter, and knowing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a Preacher or a Divine, and an Expoſitor of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſets himſelf to perform the part of an Interpreter, and ſeldom concerns himſelf about any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>Which being ſo, it cannot reaſonably be ſaid that I have ſpent my time ill in tranſlating Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Annotations, or in illuſtrating, correcting, and enlarging them. But as mens Judgments commonly are, proceeding not from love to Truth, but from Paſſion, I find there are others, who whether really or ſeemingly, affirm that I am not indeed to be blamed for tranſlating Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>; but for annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things to his Annotations, wherein I often charge him with Error, or do otherwiſe contradict his Opinion; as if I were bound to aſſent to all that he ſays, or ought to have ſo great a reverence for him, as to be afraid of profeſſing that I think he was miſtaken in his interpretation of ſome Paſſages.</p>
            <p>But to give theſe Men ſatisfaction, if they are willing to be ſatisfied, I would fain know which of the two ought to be moſt valued, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Honour, or Truth? The Reputation of a Man long ſince dead, and whoſe Opinions no Law divine or humane obliges us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; or the defence of immortal Truth, which we cannot forſake without offending both God and Men? If they are of that humour, that they had rather maintain the Honour of a learned Divine, as I before ſaid, but ſubject to error, than Truth, they are not fit to be ſpoken with. I will have no conteſt with ſuch Men as profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enemies to Truth; but ſhall leave them, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, to the Mercy of their own perverſe Temper. But the Errors, they ſay, of great Men, ought to be conceal'd, rather than aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. I anſwer, I have no where aggravated any thing, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed him in the ſofteſt terms, whenever I ſuppoſed him in a miſtake. However, I don't think the greateſt Mens Faults ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, who the greater they are thought to be, the more liable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary men are to be deceived by them, and therefore whenever they are out of the way, they ought above all others to be ſet right again. It is juſt we ſhould forgive their Miſtakes, and bear with their Defects, in conſideration of their greater Vertues, and the notable Service they have done the learned World; but we ought not to let Errors
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:99486:5"/>
paſs under the diſguiſe of Truths. It becomes all Candidates of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially thoſe that ſtudy the Scriptures, to endeavour all they can, and contend earneſtly, that Truth upon all occaſions may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; not that it may be concealed, out of reſpect to any man, or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror receiv'd inſtead of Truth. The only thing juſtly blamable, in thoſe who take upon them to correct the Miſtakes of great Men, is, if they charge them falſly, paſſionately, or maliciouſly, not for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Truth, but to leſſen their Reputation; or if they endeavour to obſcure their great Excellencies, and ſeverely inveigh againſt ſmall Offences as unpardonable Crimes.</p>
            <p>But when Miſtakes in men, that have otherwiſe done great ſervice to the World by their Learning, are modeſtly cenſured, only with this deſign, that others may not follow them in an Error; the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of great Men are ſo far from having any reaſon to complain, that if thoſe great Men themſelves were to live again, they could not, without the greateſt ingratitude, and being chargeable with intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pride, but thank thoſe that had civilly ſhewn them their Error, and ſet them in the right way. Men are not ſo perfect in this World as to be liable to no Miſtakes; and thoſe to whom we give the higheſt Commendations are not ſuch as have never erred, but whoſe Miſtakes are but few, or only in things of little moment. Let us not therefore extol Men ſo, as if the greatneſs of their Judgment, or Learning, had exempted them from the common danger of erring; nor on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, think them excluded out of the number of great Men, becauſe they are convinced of ſome Error. I have ſo high an opinion of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> upon reading over his Works, that I think there have been few Interpreters ever in the World comparable to him; tho I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten differ'd from him, and ſhewn ſometimes that he was miſtaken. So no man has a greater value for <hi>H. Grotius,</hi> or is more forward to commend him, or does it more frequently than I; yet I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confuted him, both in theſe Additions and elſewhere, without any abatement of my eſteem or veneration for him. I am none of thoſe, who are always upon the extreams both in applauding men and reviling them. I am for commending, without envy, what is praiſe-worthy; and rejecting, without malice, what is oppoſite to Truth.</p>
            <p>But you ought not, they ſay, to have mixed things of another kind with Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Annotations. Why not? for it's true he ought not to have any thing attributed to him that he did not ſay; but in a Work publiſhed ſo long after his death, and that in another language, I don't ſee why I might not add what I thought wanting in him,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:99486:5"/>
tho perhaps he himſelf would not have approved of my Additions, if he had been alive. For I did not publiſh this work for his uſe, but of them who are now living, or for poſterity, who may reaſonably have a greater regard to Truth than to Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> They who do not like my Additions, may refuſe to buy them. They may get Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Annotations in Engliſh by themſelves. But are there not great Volumes publiſhed both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> in which the Commentaries of learned men both Papiſts and Proteſtantes, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differing in their opinions from one another, are printed together? And who even among the Papiſts, was ever diſpleaſed upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or did not rather highly commend the deſign, becauſe by that means what is wanting in ſome is ſupplied by others? But tho I am not always of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s judgment, yet the differences between us are much fewer, than between the Critical Interpreters of the Old and New Teſtament; and if they had not, I would certainly never have undertaken to tranſlate any thing of his. But becauſe I agreed with him as to the chief points of Religion and the manner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting, therefore I tranſlated his Annotations, tho I differ'd from him in ſome things. As I would have others bear with me whenever I diſagree with them, ſo I cannot only bear with, but alſo love and reſpect others when they diſagree with me. I count it an honour, as I ſaid before, to have my ſhort Remarks publiſhed with his accurate Labours; but if I may ſpeak a little boldly without offence, I do not think ſo meanly of my own performances as that their value, if it be any, can ſeem e're the leſs by their being joined with Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s. If I had thought ſo, I would never have publiſhed them either together or alone. I might be miſtaken indeed, as all men are commonly dim-ſighted in that which concerns themſelves; which whether it be true of me, let learned and impartial Readers only judg: but I could not but do what I thought fit to be done.</p>
            <p>There is fallen lately into my hands an Engliſh Pamphlet intitled <hi>A Free but Modeſt Cenſure</hi> of ſome Controverſial Books written in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and among the reſt of my <hi>Ars Critica,</hi> tho a Latin Treatiſe, and quite of another nature from thoſe Controverſies. To which there is alſo added the Authors judgment concerning my deſign in tranſlating Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> of which I ſhall here ſubjoin a few things. That <hi>Modeſt,</hi> but <hi>Free</hi> Writer, whoſoever he be, will not take it amiſs, or at leaſt cannot in reaſon, if I <hi>modeſtly and freely</hi> vindicate my intention. He
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:99486:6"/>
ſays, <hi>it is a harmful project to publiſh Dr.</hi> Hammond''<hi>s Annotations on the New Teſtament, and at the ſame time to mix my own Additional Notes with them, This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is a politick way to promote the Cauſe, eſpecially in</hi> England, <hi>where the Works of that learned and pious Annotator are in ſo great eſteem: When his Criticiſms and Interpretations are blended with the Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ones, how eaſily will they be both imbibed together? I thought fit to caution my Countrymen about this hazard, that they may not be betrayed into Error, even the worſt of Errors, whilſt they are intent upon ſtudying the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cauſe I have undertaken to defend, both in all my other printed Works, and my Additions to Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> is no other than the Cauſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; whoſe Authority alone (in matters of Religion) all Proteſtants think is to be regarded and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, if we may judg of their Opinion by the Confeſſions they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe; of which mind I always was and ever ſhall be. I value the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Socinus,</hi> or any other uninſpired perſons whatever, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of reaſon, no more than Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s or the <hi>Council of Trent</hi>'s. When I think they agree with Chriſt and his Apoſtles, I aſſent to them; and if not, I differ from them. I never read all <hi>Socinus</hi> his Works, nor like his peculiar Opinions, ſo far as I know them, any more than other mens, whom I judg to be in an Error. Nay, I have ſometimes confuted them, and as I ſee occaſion ſhall confute more of them; not with a deſign to make his Followers odious, or to gain the favour of any Mortal, but to vindicate Truth. However, I am not of their mind who becauſe men err in ſome things, that are otherwiſe obedient to the Precepts of the Goſpel, and look for the coming of Chriſt to judg the quick and the dead, after the reſurrection, by the rule of the Goſpel, and reward the Good and puniſh the Wicked; and think not that they can attain Salvation by any other means, than the Faith they have in Chriſt, as one ſent from God, which Faith alone they hope by the mercy of God, to have imputed to them <hi>for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> I am not, I ſay, of their mind that ſentence ſuch men to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Flames, into which they would, if they were able, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurry them, without the leaſt mercy; and in the mean time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in a cruel manner to perſecute them with Execrations, and Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Puniſhments. I have not <hi>ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> I do not find the Apoſtles ever acted in that manner: and whilſt they are ſilent, and do not lead the way by their Example, I had rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the danger of being too merciful, than expoſe my ſelf to the Charge of the leaſt Cruelty and Barbarity. God will much ſooner forgive
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:99486:6"/>
them that heartily love him, that is, who keep his Commandments, and eſpecially that great and ſo often repeated one of loving our Neighbour, their exceſſive Charity, if any Charity can be exceſſive towards men fearing God and Chriſt, tho in ſome things erroneous; than that horrible inhumanity, with which they are frequently defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and perſecuted, and forced to endure all manner of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, only becauſe they profeſs themſelves not to believe, what they think Chriſt or his Apoſtles never revealed. I had infinitely rather ſtand in the number of the merciful, before the tribunal of the great Judg, than in the company of Perſecutors, whatever their Riches or Honours are in this World. I had rather be in the mean while evil ſpoken of and ſuſpected of Errors, which I am as far from as can be, than appear by any means to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuch Barbarity.</p>
            <p>Nor am I of their mind, who oppoſe thoſe that differ from them with any kind of Arguments, after the example of bad Lawyers, who deny all that their Adverſaries affirm, and affirm all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Truth, in my judgment, can never be well defended but by Truth. Let others contend with Paſſion, and affirm what it is the intereſt of their party ſhould ſeem true, or deny, not that which they are ſure is falſe, but which they think it neceſſary ſhould appear ſo, that their ſide may prevail; as for me I will always ſay what I think true, and ſhall never fear any danger to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion from Truth. This was heretofore the mind of a great man, for whom Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> had always a very high value, whom he often tranſcribed, whom he defended againſt the Calumnies of his Adverſaries, and in whoſe praiſe he every where ſpeaks. All know very well that I deſcribe <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> who whenever he thought <hi>Socinus,</hi> or <hi>Crellius,</hi> truly interpreted any place of Scripture, made no ſcruple to follow them; tho he knew at the ſame time that ſome ill minded men reviled him for it. Wherefore Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> has juſtly more than once pleaded his Cauſe, as every one, that has read over the ſecond Volume of his Works, knows.</p>
            <p>I am not at all for diminiſhing Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Reputation, as I have already ſufficiently declared; I do not deny but he was a <hi>pious and learned</hi> man; nay if I had not thoſe thoughts of him, I would never have undertaken to tranſlate one line of his Writings. But my Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions neither need his Piety nor Learning to make them be read, if they are valuable; and if they are not, <hi>the Learning and Piety</hi> of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> will not procure me the Reader's favour: on the
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:99486:7"/>
contrary, if I am any where miſtaken, the comparing them with Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> will but render my Miſtakes the more viſible. But <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrins, ſays my Cenſurer, will be imbibed with the true. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I have before denyed, that I follow <hi>Socinus</hi> as my Guide; but I don't underſtand why this Cenſurer ſhould be ſo much afraid leſt the true Doctrins aſſerted by Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſhould not be effectual to prevent the ill impreſſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that falſe and <hi>Socinian</hi> Interpretations may make upon Readers minds. If I were to reaſon after his manner, I ſhould ſay that this Cenſurer is a cloſe <hi>Socinian</hi>; who by ſecret me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods e<gap reason="illegible" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>ours to advance the credit of <hi>Socinus</hi> his Opinions. For it muſt needs be a very powerful Doctrine in his apprehenſion, which if any, tho never ſo little, of it be mixed with the Writings of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines, it ſo obſcures all their Reaſons, that whether they will or no, it is <hi>eaſily imbibed.</hi> This way of arguing tends more to magnify and promote, than to depreſs and extinguiſh <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> againſt which the moſt learned Annotations on the New Teſtament are not, it ſeems, a ſufficient Preſervative. Beſides this, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing which gives ground for ſuſpicion, and it is what my Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, and other ſuch as he generally ſtand by. To wit, If a perſon be any thing ingenious, or more learned than ordinary, and writes out of the common road, he is preſently a <hi>Socinian</hi>; as if all men of ſenſe muſt needs turn <hi>Socinians.</hi> We have lately had a remarkable inſtance of this in the worthy and ingenious Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> who, becauſe he reaſons more accurately about many things, than any before him had done, in his Excellent Treatiſe of <hi>Humane <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cried down as a <hi>Socinian,</hi> by this Cenſurer and others. This is in earneſt to favour the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to make all good wits of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Juſt ſuch reports were formerly ſpread at <hi>Hug. Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Ren. Carteſius</hi>; which were no diſgrace at all to thoſe men, but an honour to the <hi>Socinians.</hi> So <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was before charged with <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> by the Monks of thoſe times, and others no better than they; as if it had been impoſſible for a man of his capacity to be <hi>Orthodox.</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to my ſelf how far I come ſhort of thoſe great men in learning and natural abilities; but if my Cenſurer was in earneſt in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations he beſtows upon me, he muſt needs own, that thoſe endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mind which he attributes to me, were alſo the occaſion of my falling into thoſe Opinions, which he calls <hi>the worst of errors.</hi> But if he only flatter'd me, that he might ſpeak the more ſpitefully of me afterwards, let me tell him, that feigned Reſpect is an argument of very little candour, to ſay no worſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:99486:7"/>If he will ſay that <hi>Socinus</hi> was miſtaken in a great many things, I fully agree with him; but I can reckon up a great many worſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors than his, whereof I ſhall mention but one out of reſpect to my Cenſurer: that is, of thoſe who think men deſerve eternal Torments whom Chriſt never condemned; who by all means perſecute thoſe that differ from them, tho they own themſelves to be as liable to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror as the very men whom they perſecute; who, in a word, think they may upon very ſlight ſuſpicions traduce men that are heartily devoted to Chriſtianity, and ſober in their lives, as a kind of Plagues to be carefully ſhunned. He that does not aſcribe to Chriſt, what he thinks Chriſt never aſſumed to himſelf, if otherwiſe he perform conſtant obedience to all his Precepts which he fully underſtands, may obtain the forgiveneſs of his Ignorance from a moſt favourable and compaſſionate Judg; but he that breaks the Command of loving his Neighbour, which is as clear as the Sun at noon-day, by Slandering, and Bitterneſs, and Cruelty, and dies in thoſe Vices, ſhall never, unleſs a new Goſpel be made for him, be admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Here I might take leave of my Cenſurer; but becauſe he has thought fit to ſet ſuch another mark of Infamy upon my <hi>Ars Critica,</hi> I ſhall briefly ſhew, that he is mightily miſtaken, and did not diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read what he was reſolved to condemn. He ſays in the firſt place, that my Deſign in that Treatiſe was, by a new and cunning way <hi>to propagate Socinianiſm.</hi> But I who know my own mind and purpoſe a great deal better, utterly deny it: and there is nothing in the thing it ſelf, which argues that I did ſo undeſignedly. My intent was to ſhew how Students might arrive to a ſolid and uſeful ſort of Learning. And therefore I intermixed a great many Examples, taken from things of the greateſt moment, to prove that <hi>Criticiſm</hi> was no contemptible Art.</p>
            <p>But my Cenſurer produces ſome Paſſages by which he endeavours to ſhew that my Deſign was to clear the way for <hi>Socinianiſm</hi>; which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I ſhall briefly conſider, that every one may ſee with what Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Modeſty he deſcants upon them.</p>
            <p>I ſaid in <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. §. 3. That many things in the Writings of the Antients had a reſpect to the Opinions of their Times; which muſt therefore be known, that we may underſtand what they mean. <hi>Ita cum Judaeorum praecipua in divino cultu ceremonia in ſacrificio eſſent ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta; ideo in Novo Teſtamento omnia fere pietatis officia ſacrificii nomine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdum indigitari. So becauſe the chief Ceremony of the Jews in divine
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:99486:8"/>
Worſhip was Sacrificing, therefore in the New Teſtament almost all religious duties are ſometimes expreſſed by the name of Sacrifices.</hi> Then I add, <hi>Mortem Chriſti ſacrificium quoque vocari, quod fuerit praecipua</hi> ejus pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis <hi>pars, &amp; quaedam habeat ſacrificiis ſimilia: That the death of Chriſt is called alſo a Sacrifice, becauſe it was the chief part of</hi> his Obedience, <hi>and had ſome things in it reſembling Sacrifices.</hi> Here my Cenſurer tranſlated my words ſo negligently, that he renders the Phraſe <hi>ejus pietatis, of that Religion,</hi> as if I had a reſpect to the Jewiſh Religion; whereas I manifeſtly ſpeak of Chriſt's Piety towards his Father. Then hence he infers, that I ſuppoſe the Sacrifice of Chriſt was only a <hi>metaphorical and improper</hi> Sacrifice, to ſide with thoſe that reject Chriſt's Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But what kind of Logick is this? That action of Chriſt, by which he principally redeemed men, is called a Sacrifice, by a Phraſe taken from the Cuſtom of the Jews, tho it did not in all things reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Sacrifice: therefore Chriſt did not redeem us. By what revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came my Cenſurer to know, that to the end Chriſt might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem men, it was requiſite he ſhould be ſlain juſt like a Victim, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of difference? And how will he prove that there was every thing in the death of Chriſt which was obſervable in a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? It's certain the Prieſt and the Sacrifice was not the ſame; the Sacrifice was ſlain in a conſecrated place, the Blood of it was pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out at the foot of an Altar; and many other Rites were uſed, none of which, properly ſpeaking, were obſerved in Chriſt's Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion. Notwithſtanding which, the Death of Chriſt might have all the efficacy of a Sacrifice. It is fit, for my Cenſurer's information, to obſerve that we are not to ſeek for all the circumſtances of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the death of Chriſt; becauſe in ſo doing men often mix their own rotten Inventions with divine Revelation: as for inſtance, ſome inconſiderately ſay, that the Croſs was an Altar; whereas there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, nor could be, any Altar in this Oblation, upon which the Sacrifice was to be conſecrated; as it was in the Levitical Sacrifices. But this every one knows, and I would not have mention'd it, but that my Cenſurer ſpeaks as if he was ignorant of it. As for his ſaying that what I affirm of the word Sacrifice being attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Death of Chriſt, is nothing to the buſineſs of which I undertook to treat in that place of my <hi>Ars Critica,</hi> I leave that to the examination of the Reader. I have not ſo much time to ſpare, that I ſhould always be teaching the Elements of Logick or Grammar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:99486:8"/>In Part II. §. 1. c. 3. I have put it beyond all doubt, that <hi>tho the most high God is ſtiled by the Jews</hi> Elohim, <hi>yet that word ſignifies God, as he is the object of Worſhip, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not his most perfect Nature.</hi> I have ſhewn alſo that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was uſed by the Jews that ſpake Greek, by the Gentiles and the Chriſtians themſelves in the ſame ſenſe; which is of no ſmall uſe to the underſtanding of innumerable Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in antient Writers, both ſacred and profane, which would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be very obſcure. Nothing can be more evident; and the deſign of the whole Chapter, to thoſe who are not wilfully blind, is very plain. The thing it ſelf is not oppoſed by my unknown Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, becauſe it is undeniable, and is confirmed by the Conſent of the moſt learned men; but he ſuſpects that my deſign in writing it was, <hi>to intimate that tho our Saviour might be the object of divine Worſhip, yet that he is not God.</hi> Whether he ſpeaks as he thinks I cannot tell, be that to himſelf; but I beſeech him never to treat any other man at the ſame rate as he has done me. For to pretend to know the ſecret deſigns of Men, is not only <hi>immodest,</hi> but <hi>ſenſleſs</hi>; and in this matter I aſſure him he is utterly miſtaken. I never thought Chriſt might be <hi>the object of divine Worſhip,</hi> tho he was not God: that would be mere Idolatry. Nay, the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves do not ſay that Chriſt ought to be worſhipped as the moſt high God, while they do not think him to be the moſt high God; but only with ſuch a Worſhip as is due to an Ambaſſador from the ſupreme Majeſty. I would have my Cenſurer read their Books before he undertakes to oppoſe them; and not attribute to me what neither I nor any man elſe ever ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd. It is not the part of a <hi>modest</hi> Man to cavil at what he does not underſtand, nor of a man of Candor, to miſrepreſent other mens Principles.</p>
            <p>In the following Chap. IV. I ſaid I did not think there was any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis in this Phraſe, <hi>thou ſhalt die the death,</hi> Gen. ii.16. but that it ſignified ſimply, Death; and I rejected both the Opinion of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who looks here for I know not how many kinds of Death, and thoſe who interpret it of Mortality, which Interpretation I affirmed <hi>to be contrary to</hi> the conſtant uſe of the Hebrew Language. What ſays my Cenſurer to this? Does he ſhew that Uſe is againſt me? Does he prove that I was miſtaken? By no means; but he contends that I ſide with a Party, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Socinians</hi>; as if there were not learned Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of all Parties that reject that Interpretation; which can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by no Example, but only by weak Arguments. Beſides, for my Cenſurer's ſatisfaction, tho I do not think Mortality is there meant,
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:99486:9"/>
yet I doubt not but <hi>Adam</hi> was immortal before he ſinned, and that he really became mortal by Sin, which he might have underſtood from my Commentary on <hi>Gen.</hi> iii.19.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Chapter I proved by manifeſt Examples, not only out of Heathen Writers, but out of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that the Phraſe <hi>to write laws in the heart,</hi> in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> is not to make them <hi>neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> be obeyed, but only remembred without a Monitor. My Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſays, that the Prophet ſpeaks of the New Covenant, which I never denied; then he adds, that this Phraſe ſignifies that <hi>by virtue of the holy Spirit the underſtandings of the faithful are ſo enlightned, and their wills and conſciences ſo effectually wrought upon, that they are enabled to obſerve the Law.</hi> But by what undoubted. Example does he prove this? None at all. Nor could it any more than that irreſiſtible efficacy, be demonſtrated by any Theological Arguments. But I have proved by examples out of St. <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. ii.15. and <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that that Phraſe is not to be ſtrained too far. And as to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, my Cenſurer ſays nothing, only he denies that examples taken out of Heathen Writers are any proofs; as if I had produced none but them. Then he ſays that in the paſſages of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the <hi>Writing of the Law in Mens Minds, and the preſerving it in their Memories,</hi> ſeem to him to be two diſtinct things. But let the Reader conſult thoſe places, and he will wonder at the ſhrewdneſs of this <hi>free Cenſurer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſaid that by this Phraſe of St. <hi>Luke</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> xvi.14. <hi>The Lord opened her Heart, that ſhe attended to thoſe things which were ſpoken of</hi> Paul, was meant no more than that, by <hi>divine Providence it came to paſs,</hi> (quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque tandem machinis uſus ſit Deus) <hi>whatever engines God made uſe of that</hi> Lydia <hi>attentively gave ear to St.</hi> Paul: As ſufficiently appears by the foregoing Examples. My Cenſurer thinks this to be a ſtrange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>quibuſcunque tandem machinis uſus ſit Deus</hi>; as if any that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Latin did not know it to be a metaphorical Phraſe taken from Cities, are batter'd with <hi>Engines.</hi> And my uſing ſuch a Metaphor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeem ſtrange to thoſe, who have read in St. <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> x.4. that <hi>the Weapons</hi> of the Apoſtles <hi>warfare were not Carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrongholds.</hi> For why may not I uſe ſuch another Metaphor, and ſay <hi>Engines?</hi> Who, beſides, that has any thing of Learning does not know that the beſt Latin Writers uſe that word in this Metaphorical ſenſe? Let my Cenſurer read but this Paſſage of <hi>Cicero</hi> in Epiſt. xviii. to <hi>Brutus: ad reliquos his quoque labor mihi acceſſit, ut omnes adhibeam</hi> machinas, <hi>ad tenendum adoleſcentem.</hi> But would you know, good Sir, what thoſe <hi>machines</hi> were, which God
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:99486:9"/>
made uſe of <hi>to open the Heart of</hi> Lydia, ſeeing I have not expreſſed my Mind more clearly in my <hi>Ars Critica?</hi> Why they were thoſe <hi>ſpiritual Weapons</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by which <hi>he pulled down ſtrong holds</hi>; namely, the Goſpel, which opens the Hearts of its Hearers, unleſs they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhut againſt God's call. So the <hi>Jews</hi> ordinarily ſaid that <hi>the Law opened their Hearts,</hi> as you may be informed by <hi>Lud. Cappellus</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv.25. A ſort of Inſpiration whereby God works upon all the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel, to enable them to receive it as they ought, if it be not their own fault, or upon ſome only, whom he irreſiſtibly works upon, is no where intimated in Scripture, as ſome of the moſt learned Men have long ſince ſhewn, whom my Cenſurer may read. Whereas he ſays that I inſiſt upon the ambiguity of the words <hi>to redeem,</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> on purpoſe to patronize <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> that is but the repetition of a Calumny which he brings over ſo often as to make it nauſeous. He can't deny that what I ſaid is true, but to leſſen my Reputation, he pretends I wrote it with an ill deſign. I muſt undoubtedly, to pleaſe him, not only have reviled the <hi>Socinians,</hi> but made my ſelf alſo a Liar, or concealed the Truth, that they might be the more eaſily refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or rather ſeem to be ſo. Then the commendableneſs of my deſign would have made all my diſſimulations and falſhoods praiſe-worthy: But theſe are the tricks of a Man whoſe own Conſcience condemns him, and who is a great favourer of the <hi>Socinian</hi> cauſe, whilſt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning Perſons he ſeems to oppoſe it. Which if it was not my Cenſurer's deſign, as I will not affirm; at leaſt he manages things ſo, that it is as eaſy to ſee he is as unfit a Man to put an end to that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, as he is good at detracting and calumniating.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Cap.</hi> vii. I ſhewed that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>In the viii<hi>th</hi> Chapter I ſaid that irreſiſtible <hi>Grace,</hi> which is aſſerted by S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> did not ſeem to me to be agreable to Scripture; and that the word <hi>Grace</hi> had no evident meaning in it. My Cenſurer does not prove the contrary, but endeavours to make me odious, for ſaying that St. <hi>Auſtin was a popular Speaker, but no Critick.</hi> As if that were not a thing very well known to all that have read his Works, or as if any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it. I eaſily believe my Cenſurer never read St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s works, in which I deal more fairly with him, than he does with me. Otherwiſe I
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:99486:10"/>
ſhould ſay that either he had no knowledg at all of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or a great deal of impudence, who ſhould attribute to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> a critical Skill, and that in the Scriptures (for here the Diſcourſe is about the interpretation of Scripture) and endeavour to make me ill thought of for denying it. He calls him <hi>a pious and learned Father,</hi> which titles he gives to Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> whom he knew to be of a contrary opinion. But in this matter St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> neither thought <hi>piouſly,</hi> nor wrote <hi>learnedly</hi> of God. And as little <hi>piety</hi> or learning does he ſhew in his Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Vincentius</hi>; where he zealouſly defends Perſecution on the account of Religion, and that with very abſurd Arguments. He was one of the very firſt that promoted ſome two Doctrins, which take away all Goodneſs and Juſtice, both from God and Men. For by the one God is repreſented as creating the greateſt part of Mankind to damn them, and ſentence them to eternal Torments, for Sins committed by another, or which they themſelves could not avoid; and by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Magiſtrates, and all that have the Adminiſtration of publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, are ſtirred up to perſecute thoſe that differ from them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. However that firſt Doctrin might be born with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if any Man raſhly ſhuts others out of Heaven, and erroneouſly reflects upon the Goodneſs and Juſtice of God, provided he does not perſecute thoſe that differ from him, and force them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves of his Opinion; he does more hurt to himſelf than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe God is nevertheleſs Gracious and Merciful. But he that is for being cruel to thoſe that differ from him, does miſchief both to others, and to the Truth. He makes himſelf a Beaſt, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits eternal Happineſs, which is promiſed to reaſonable Creatures, not to Savages; he perſecutes the innocent, and expoſes them to innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Calamities; in fine, he diſparages Truth, if he defends it by ſuch Methods; and if he oppoſes it, he profanes the moſt Sacred thing in the World, and fights againſt God who is its Author. And this is no vain fear about what perhaps will never be; we have reaſon to be afraid leſt St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Authority ſhould move Chriſtians to perſecute one another for differences in Religion. The thing is actually come to paſs already; for a certain great and powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, in whoſe Kingdom many thouſands of Proteſtants lately lived, was chiefly by that Father's Authority moved to attempt and execute thoſe things; for which all <hi>Europe</hi> has juſtly rung with the loud Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of poor wretches that have been forc'd to fly their Country. It's certain the French King, who is otherwiſe no Tyrant, could not by any means have been induced to cancel all his paſt Edicts in favour
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:99486:10"/>
of the Reformed; and make uſe of the barbarity of Souldiers, to extort from them a confeſſion which none of the Clergy of that Kingdom could by all their falſe reaſonings bring them to, unleſs it were after the foremention'd Letters of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had been read to him, whoſe Authority, being impoſed upon by Flatterers, he thought he might ſafely follow. Let my Cenſurer go now and reſent my being ſo hardy as to ſay the truth of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> I ſpeak in that manner, who do not uſe, like many others, to calumniate the Living, and ſpeak untruths in favour of the Dead.</p>
            <p>My Cenſurer pretends, that in <hi>Chap.</hi> ix. where I ſaid that Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Divines often uſe words that have no meaning in them, and which if any one deſire them to interpret, they can give no ſolid anſwer, for which I inſtanc'd in the words <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</hi> My Cenſurer, I ſay, pretends that I have a reſpect alſo to the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and other particular points belonging to the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This forſooth is that <hi>modeſt</hi> Cenſurer, otherwiſe called <hi>ſearcher of Hearts,</hi> who can divine what other Men think, tho they are never ſo profoundly ſilent. Were I to make a Conjecture from what he has written, I ſhould ſay that he did not only exterminate Charity, but even Juſtice and Truth out of the number of Chriſtian Vertues. But I had rather think he erred through I know not what Paſſion, that hurried him to the violation of thoſe Duties of Religion, which he himſelf accounted the moſt ſacred.</p>
            <p>My Interpretation of the words <hi>Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> xii.17. for God's righteous Precepts, has no affinity with the peculiar Doctrins of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> unleſs it be in the brains of a Man that ſees things where they are not, and has conceived ſuch a dreadful Notion of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that upon the leaſt noiſe he preſently imagins a whole Army of them to be coming upon him. I am ſure <hi>Crellius</hi> and <hi>Schlictingius,</hi> their chief Leaders, give us a quite different interpretation of this place.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Chap.</hi> xiv. I did not ſay that St. <hi>John</hi> had the ſame thoughts of the eternal <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi>; but only called the Divinity which dwelt in Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in a <hi>Platonical</hi> manner; and added, that it remained to be enquir'd whether S. <hi>John</hi> underſtood that word in a Platonical ſenſe, plainly intimating that I thought the ſame word might be taken in different notions. I ſaid alſo that if that word were to be underſtood in a Platonical ſenſe in St. <hi>John,</hi> we ſhould be forced to go over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the <hi>Arians</hi>; which, according to the opinion my Cenſurer repreſents me to be of, no Man in his wits would ſay it were neceſſary to do.
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:99486:11"/>
But this ſearcher into Hereſies forgot that <hi>Platoniſm</hi> or <hi>Arianiſm</hi> was very different from <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi> And he knows not, or makes as if he did not know, that I have in a particular Diſſertation, explained the beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, in a ſenſe contrary to <hi>Platoniſm.</hi> Whereas I ſaid that all Chriſtians do at this day very much differ from the Opinion of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, he knows that can be manifeſtly proved from Engliſh Books, not to mention Latin. He knows very well that the learned Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> has proved that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, and others, thought the three Hypoſtaſes to be three equal Gods, as we ſhould now expreſs it. Let him read alſo the Life of <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen,</hi> which I have written, and has been tranſlated into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, if he does not underſtand French; and he will find that <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> was undoubtedly of that Opinion. The thing is ſo clear, that it cannot be queſtion'd by thoſe who have conſider'd it. But of this elſewhere.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Chap.</hi> xvi. I rejected the myſtical and high flown interpretations, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Antients which are deſtitute of reaſon; and I ſtill reject them, with all the beſt Interpreters of Scripture. I value Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Arguments, which depend only upon the Speakers fancy, and are not to be tried by the rule of right Reaſon, no more than my Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer's Calumnies, which are the products of his own fruitful brain. Such is his ſaying that I rejected the Rhetorical Diſcourſes of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe I think all things to be clear and plain in Chriſtianity, and that no Myſtery is to be admitted. Of which there is not ſo much as one word in that Chapter, where I ſpeak of vain Rhetorick, and not of the obſcurity or perſpicuity or Religion. I never thought we had a clear and perfect Notion of all things revealed, as I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhewn in the 2<hi>d Part</hi> of my <hi>Ars Critica,</hi> where I treat of <hi>clear and adequate Notions.</hi> My Cenſurer, who knows the ſecret Thoughts of mens Hearts, ought to have known what I had written in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe he took upon him to cenſure. But he read it only to find matter of Calumny, not to do himſelf any good by it.</p>
            <p>What I ſaid about <hi>Concrete</hi> and <hi>Abſtract</hi> Notions in <hi>Part.</hi> ii. c. 5. let my Cenſurer read over again a little more ſedately; and he will find I had great reaſon to ſay that the names of Synods were names of abſtract Ideas; becauſe many attributed to them things which rather ſhould have been in them, than which really were ſo, to heighten their Authority to the prejudice of Religion. The <hi>Council of Trent</hi> is alone enough to ſhew the neceſſity of this Obſervation. But theſe Leſſons were written for the ſake of ſuch as love Truth; not
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:99486:11"/>
ſuch as are ready to defend or oppoſe any thing for Reward.</p>
            <p>In the viii<hi>th Chap.</hi> of the ſame Part, I ſaid that all Men had not the ſame Notion of God, but ſome a larger and more noble one, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a meaner and more contracted one, of which I alledged very plain examples, which I thought were almoſt uſeleſs, becauſe no Man that had the leaſt knowledg of Mankind could have any doubt of it. But this Cenſurer neither underſtood what I ſaid, nor himſelf, while he affirms that theſe are <hi>no very reverent thoughts of God.</hi> They only think irreverently of God, who either worſhip Idols, or after they have endeavour'd, without any regard to Truth, Juſtice or Charity, to defame Men that fear God, think they have deſerved well of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and their Country, and that therefore thoſe Revenues are due to them, which the Piety of the Antient Chriſtians inſtituted only in favour of good and learned Men, not of Slanderers.</p>
            <p>Afterwards my Cenſurer upbraids me for reciting in <hi>Part</hi> iii. ſeveral places of the New Teſtament, wherein the Diſcourſe is of Chriſt, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by bad Men in the antient Copies, whether they thought well or ill of Chriſt; which I did not enquire into, nor did I deduce any Conſectary, relating to any Theological Doctrin, from thence. He does not ſhew that there was no alteration made in thoſe Copies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not; but he interprets all theſe things in a bad ſenſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his cuſtom. What he himſelf thinks of theſe things, I cannot tell, nor am I concern'd to know; but I muſt needs ſays he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the Cauſe which he affirms to be the beſt, both here and elſewhere; juſt as the moſt deſperate Cauſes uſe to be defended; that is, by concealing Truth, and endeavouring to make thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, as odious as is poſſible. Which whether it be for the honour of a Party, I leave him to conſider, and thoſe whoſe province that is.</p>
            <p>At laſt he concludes his unjuſt Accuſations with an Obſervation, which effectually confutes almoſt all he had ſaid before: to wit, that I have alledged nothing new in favour of the <hi>Socinians</hi> about thoſe places, nor endeavour'd to confute Biſhop <hi>Pearſon,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi> For thence he ought to have inferred, that I had another deſign, which I ſhould not have executed otherwiſe than I have done, if there had never been any <hi>Socinians</hi> in the World. My intention having been only to ſhew the uſe of Criticks in things of the greateſt moment, and if I am not miſtaken, I have reached my end. The reſt of what my Cenſurer ſays, has either been already confuted, or does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:99486:12"/>This, worthy Sir, is what I thought fit to ſay of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and my <hi>Ars Critica,</hi> which I had a mind ſhould be publiſhed, that the World might have this Teſtimonial of my Intentions, not to engage my ſelf in a Quarrel with my Cenſurer; who if he be not brought to righter Apprehenſions by what I have here ſaid, no Arguments would ever convince him. Let him now call himſelf to an account for his Accuſations, and not hope that God ſhould be propitious to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he repent of his unchriſtian Behaviour; which I ſpeak with ſo hearty a good will to him, that I earneſtly pray God not to lay this thing to his charge, but rather reduce him to a better Mind.</p>

            <head>ADDITIONS TO Dr. <hi>HAMMOND</hi>'s ANNOTATIONS ON THE New Teſtament. Addition to the Annotation on the Title of the whole Book.</head>
            <p>T0 this which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> has obſerved of the word διαθήκη, if we add what is ſaid of the ſame word by <hi>Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> there will remain but this one thing further to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereby many places of Scripture, yea, the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrin may be illuſtrated: Namely, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in whatever ſenſe it be taken, is metaphorical, and borrowed from the Cuſtoms of Men; for Covenants and Teſtaments properly ſo called, are only made amongst Men. Now Metaphorical Terms are ſeldom grounded upon a perfect Similitude between thoſe things, to which they are indifferently applied; and therefore they cannot always be ſcrued up to the whole Latitude of their natural ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is ſufficient if there be any Agreement, tho but ſmall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:99486:13"/>
the thing, of which any word is uſed in a metaphorical ſenſe, and that which it properly ſignifies. So that all that can be inferred from the bare word, is, that the ſeveral things expreſſed by it, have ſome affinity with one another. And in order to determin wherein that ſimilitude lies, we muſt carefully conſider both things themſelves: Which being done, we may argue from the thing to the ſignification of the word, but not from the word to the thing.</p>
            <p>So that from the ſacred Writers calling the Laws of God <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a Covenant</hi> or <hi>Teſtament,</hi> this only in the firſt place can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that there is ſome likeneſs between the Laws of God and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants or Teſtaments. But that we may diſtinctly know wherein that likeneſs conſiſts, we muſt firſt conſider in what manner God deals with Men, ſetting aſide all metaphorical Notions, and looking as narrowly as poſſible into things themſelves; then we muſt enquire what Men do when they enter into Covenants, or make Teſtaments; and laſtly, by a compariſon of both, we may gather the true ſenſe of the metaphorical Word or Phraſe. So that they labour in vain, who whilſt things themſelves remain obſcure, deduce as many Similitudes as they can from words.</p>
            <p>Now if we conſider the way in which God deals with Men under the Goſpel, and then think what is ordinarily done in Teſtaments, we ſhall find that there is only this ſimilitude between the Goſpel and a Teſtament, that in both there is ſomething given, and in both Death intervenes. So that wherever the Goſpel is called a Teſtament, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Speaker can be thought to have a clear knowledg of things themſelves, only one or other of theſe will be ſignified. For this is alſo to be carefully obſerved, that the mind of the Speaker muſt be known before <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny thing be affirmed of it; for tho two things agree in many particulars, yet we often think but of one, or a few of them, and would not always have them all urged. To illuſtrate this by an example, It appears from the place in <hi>Heb. ix.16, 17.</hi> which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> here interprets, that the Sacred Writer only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Goſpel and a Teſtament ſo far, as there is a Death and Gift in both. And therefore the ſignification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ought not, as to thoſe words, to be extended any farther. In like
<pb facs="tcp:99486:13"/>
manner where it is taken for a <hi>Covenant,</hi> it is not to be inferred that all thoſe things are to be ſought for in God's 0economy, either Old or New, that are obſervable in Covenants, and that every thing muſt be interpreted according to the Notion of a Covenant. From a ſteddy conſideration of the thing it ſelf, it appears that God's Diſpenſations are nothing but Laws: And therefore whatever is ſaid about foederal Signs, by which God and Men do more cloſely bind themſelves to one another, being beſides Scripture, and not to be certainly concluded from the word <hi>Covenant,</hi> is perhaps to be reckon'd among thoſe things, which Divines have more ſubtilly invented than ſolidly proved. God has no where declared that it was his deſign to deal with Men ſo as that all his Diſpenſations ſhould perfectly reſemble Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, even in the ſmalleſt Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome may reply that ſometimes neither the mind of the Speaker, nor things themſelves are ſufficiently known to us, and ask what we are to think then of the ſignification of words: I do not ſee what elſe can be done in ſuch a caſe, than to determine nothing raſhly as if it were certain. It is undoubtedly the part of a wiſe Man to refrain from judging of what is doubtful, and I confeſs I do not know, in this dark ſtate of Mortality, what can be ſafer than lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a reſtraint upon our ſelves. But this Doctrin will pleaſe but few, becauſe moſt Men love to conceal their Ignorance, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeem learned than really be ſo. This may ſuffice to have been ſaid once for all about an over ſubtil interpretation of metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal words, that I may have no occaſion to inculcate it.</p>

Concerning theſe Omiſſions, many make divers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures. That of <hi>Grotius</hi> is generally look'd upon to be the beſt; that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> kept to the number of Generations in the <hi>first</hi> claſs from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> which was <hi>most</hi> known, for <hi>memory</hi> ſake, in the <hi>rest</hi>; and ſo it was neceſſary that ſome Generations ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that there might be juſt three <hi>fourteens.</hi> But it does not ſeem probable at all to others, that the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> merely for the ſake of keeping to the number of <hi>fourteen,</hi> ſhould deſignedly paſs over <hi>ten</hi> perſons, and eſpecially in that part of his Computation in which it behov'd him to uſe the <hi>greatest</hi> exactneſs, becauſe it was <hi>least</hi> known; for <hi>till</hi> the time of the Captivity, the Genealogical ſeries of the Royal Family of <hi>David</hi> was very well <hi>underſtood,</hi> but from that time to <hi>Christ</hi> it was known but <hi>obſcurely.</hi> Beſides, a perſon cannot be ſaid to <hi>retain</hi> any Genealogy in his <hi>memory,</hi> that out of fifty perſons, or thereabouts, <hi>omits</hi> ten; and if the Genealogy of Chriſt muſt needs have been divided into <hi>certain claſſes,</hi> it was not therefore neceſſary that a <hi>fifth</hi> part of his Anceſtors ſhould be paſs'd over to make a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into <hi>fourteens,</hi> when it had been eaſy to make <hi>another</hi> diviſion. This made a very good <hi>Friend</hi> of mine think that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> lighted upon a genealogical book of <hi>David</hi>'s family that was defective; and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally obſerving there three claſſes of <hi>fourteen</hi> Generations between theſe three great periods of time, <hi>viz.</hi> before the ſetting up of the Regal Government, during its continuance, and after its fall, was thereby mov'd to make <hi>ſuch</hi> a diviſion in his account of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage; which he would not ſo much as have <hi>thought</hi> of, if he had made uſe of an entire Book. There was no reaſon, he ſaid, to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at his <hi>ſaying</hi> that a genealogical Book might be <hi>corrupted,</hi> ſince a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and conſiderable Error, that had formerly perplex'd the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and by that appears to be a very <hi>old one,</hi> was crept into the 11<hi>th</hi> verſ. of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Text <hi>it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> notwithſtanding his accurate enumeration of perſons, and <hi>indication</hi> of their number. And <hi>hence</hi> alſo he thought it was, that there are ſome perſons omitted in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> iv.1. as likewiſe in <hi>chap.</hi> vi. in the recounting of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Race, which <hi>Grotius</hi> upon this place obſerves. But this is ſubmitted to the Judgment of the learned Reader. Yet it <hi>looks</hi> as if <hi>Matthew</hi> did in the 1<hi>st</hi> verſe cite <hi>a Book of the origin of Chriſt,</hi> from whence he took <hi>all</hi> that follows as far as verſ. 16.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Note</hi> c. <hi>NEW Stars,</hi> among the Gentiles, were ſometimes look'd upon as <hi>Omens</hi> that the Infants born at the time of their appearance ſhould arrive to great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. See my Note upon <hi>Num.</hi> xxiv.13. But whatever truth there was in ſuch <hi>Omens,</hi> it was only underſtood and brought to mind after thoſe Infants were <hi>actually</hi> poſſeſs'd of the ſupreme Authority; for no Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy can aſſure ſuch a thing any length of time before-hand. <hi>Suppoſe</hi> a new Star appears upon the birth-day of any one; was there no other Child born in all the Country, beſides that <hi>one,</hi> on that day? Or is it written upon the Star in ſuch characters as the reſt of Mankind cannot underſtand, but are eaſily legible by <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in honour of ſuch a <hi>particular</hi> Infant?</p>
               <p>There is no recurring here therefore to <hi>Aſtrology</hi>; no more than to <hi>Balaam's</hi> or any <hi>ſuch</hi> like <hi>prophecy,</hi> which had been too dark to help the Wiſe-men, upon ſight of the Star, to <hi>divine</hi> that there was a <hi>King</hi> born to the <hi>Jews.</hi> It is much more credible, that they had been warn'd of it by a heavenly viſion, as afterward <hi>v.</hi> 12. they are admoniſhed to return another way into their own Countrey. <hi>However</hi> this Star was no <hi>Comet,</hi> for Comets are too high, to mark out <hi>certainly</hi> ſo ſmall a place as a little Houſe. It ſeems to have been a <hi>firy meteor</hi> that was miraculouſly ſo long preſerv'd, and appear'd in the <hi>middle</hi> of the Air like one of thoſe we call <hi>falling Stars,</hi> or the <hi>like.</hi> This is the likelieſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this matter; but it may not be unuſeful, to ſhew out of a very learned Gentleman of <hi>Ireland</hi> what Arguments there are to ſupport <hi>their</hi> opinion who attribute ſomething here to <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe there is ſomething in <hi>his</hi> Opinion that is very well worth our obſervation, and of <hi>ſpecial</hi> uſe in the Interpretation of Prophecies.

               <p>[<hi>Firſt</hi> therefore, I ſuppoſe that God did intend the <hi>Prophecies</hi> which were committed to <hi>writing,</hi> and enrolled in the <hi>public Canon</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſhould be <hi>underſtood</hi> by the Perſons concerned in them. For otherwiſe it could not properly be called a <hi>Revelation,</hi> if after the diſcovery things ſtill remained as intricate as formerly. And it is not credible that God ſhould publiſh Revelations only to <hi>exerciſe</hi> and <hi>puzzle</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of human enquiries; or as an evidence of his own knowledg of things exceeding ours (tho indeed that it ſelf cannot be known

by us unleſs we be able to diſcern ſome ſenſe which otherwiſe could not have been known than by ſuch Propheſies) much leſs to give occaſion to <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> and <hi>cunningly deſigning Perſons,</hi> to practiſe <hi>ſeditions</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations</hi> under the pretence of <hi>fulfilling Propheſies,</hi> without any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>rational confutation</hi> by the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> who upon this ſuppoſal muſt be preſumed as ignorant of them as themſelves: and there is no prudent way of avoiding this <hi>uſeleſneſs</hi> and <hi>dangerouſneſs</hi> but by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them intelligible to the Perſons concerned. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Perſons concerned in theſe kinds of <hi>Revelations,</hi> cannot be the <hi>Prophets themſelves,</hi> or any other <hi>private Perſons</hi> of the Ages wherein they were delivered, but the <hi>Church in general</hi> alſo in <hi>future Ages.</hi> For as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie</hi> in general is a <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> and therefore as all others <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that kind given <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>originally</hi> for the <hi>publick uſe</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; ſo certainly ſuch of them as were committed to writing, and deſignedly propagated to <hi>future ages,</hi> muſt needs have been of a <hi>general</hi> and <hi>perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent concernment.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Church concerned in thoſe <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> cannot only be thoſe Ages which were to ſurvive their accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo thoſe before; and therefore it cannot be ſufficient to pretend, as many do, that theſe Propheſies ſhall then be <hi>underſtood</hi> when they are <hi>fulfilled,</hi> but it will be further requiſite to aſſert that they may be ſo before. For the only <hi>momentous reaſon,</hi> that muſt be conceived concerning theſe, as well as other Revelations, muſt be ſome duty which could not otherwiſe have been known, which muſt have been ſomething <hi>antecedent</hi>; for all <hi>conſequent</hi> duties of <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>reſignation</hi> are common to them with other <hi>Providences,</hi> and therefore may be known in an <hi>ordinary way.</hi> Now for <hi>antecedent</hi> duties, ſuch as ſeem to be intimated in the <hi>Propheſies themſelves</hi> where any are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nothing can ſuffice but an <hi>antecedent information.</hi> Beſides, to what end can this <hi>poſtnate</hi> knowledg ſerve? For ſatisfying <hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>Divine preſcience</hi> upon the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of his <hi>Predictions?</hi> This is <hi>needleſs</hi>; for they already profeſs themſelves to believe it. Is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the <hi>conviction</hi> of <hi>Infidels?</hi> But neither can this be preſumed on a <hi>rational account.</hi> For how can it be known that a <hi>prediction</hi> was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led when it is not known what was predicted? Or how can it be known what was predicted when the prediction is ſo expreſſed as to be capable of <hi>many ſenſes,</hi> and no means are acknowledged poſſible for diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>equivocation?</hi> Nay, will not ſuch a <hi>deſign</hi> of <hi>ambiguity</hi> ſeem to ſuch a Perſon ſuſpicious of that <hi>ſtratagem</hi> of the <hi>Delphick Oracles,</hi> to preſerve the reputation of a <hi>Prophetick Spirit</hi> by a proviſion beforehand for avoiding the danger of <hi>diſcovery?</hi> for indeed this kind of Propheſie will be ſo weak an argument for proving <hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> as that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99486:17"/>
it may agree to any natural Man of <hi>ordinary prudence.</hi> For in <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs</hi> (the ſubject of theſe Propheſies) which proceed more <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</hi> and are leſs obnoxious to an interpoſition of <hi>private Liberty,</hi> the <hi>multitude</hi> who are the cauſes of ſuch Revolutions generally following the <hi>complexion</hi> of their Bodies, and therefore being as eaſily determined, and therefore predicted from <hi>natural cauſes,</hi> as ſuch their <hi>complexions</hi>; it will not be <hi>hard,</hi> at leaſt very <hi>probably,</hi> to conjecture <hi>future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi> from <hi>preſent appearances</hi> of their <hi>natural cauſes.</hi> And then by foretelling them in <hi>ambiguous expreſſions,</hi> he may provide that if any of thoſe ſenſes, of which his words are capable, come to paſs, that may be taken for the ſenſe intended; ſo that a miſtaking in all but one would not be likely to prejudice his credit. And at length if all ſhould <hi>fail,</hi> yet a <hi>refuge</hi> would be reſerved for their <hi>ſuperſtitious reverencers</hi> of his <hi>Authority,</hi> that themſelves had rather failed of underſtanding his <hi>true ſenſe,</hi> than that had failed of <hi>truth.</hi> Eſpecially if among a multitude of attempts, but <hi>one</hi> hit in <hi>one ſenſe</hi> (as it is hard even in a <hi>Lottery</hi> that any ſhould always miſs, much more in matters capable of <hi>prudential conjectures</hi>) that <hi>one</hi> inſtance of <hi>ſucceſs</hi> would upon thoſe accounts more <hi>confirm</hi> his credit than a <hi>multitude</hi> of <hi>failures</hi> would <hi>diſparage</hi> it; becauſe in point of <hi>ſucceſs</hi> they would be confident of their underſtanding him rightly, but in <hi>miſcarriages</hi> they would lay the <hi>blame,</hi> not on the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> but their own <hi>miſunderſtandings.</hi> Now ſeeing this way is ſo very eaſily pretended to by <hi>Cheats</hi> beyond any probable danger of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, it cannot to perſons not already <hi>favourably affected</hi> (who only need <hi>conviction</hi>) prove any Argument of a <hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> and therefore will, even upon this account, be perfectly uſeleſs. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing therefore that it is neceſſary that theſe predictions be underſtood <hi>before,</hi> as well as after that they are <hi>fulfilled</hi>; it will follow <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that where they were not <hi>explained</hi> by the <hi>Prophets themſelves,</hi> there they were intelligible by the uſe of <hi>ordinary means,</hi> ſuch as might, by the Perſons to whom the Revelations were made, be <hi>judged ordinary.</hi> For that they ſhould be explained by <hi>new Prophets</hi> to be ſent on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſion, there is no ground to believe; and if theſe Propheſies were ſo expreſſed as that they needed a <hi>new Revelation</hi> for <hi>explaining</hi> them, they muſt have been uſeleſs, and indeed could not have deſerved the name of <hi>Revelations,</hi> they ſtill tranſcending the uſe of <hi>human means</hi> as much as formerly. For if they had been revealed <hi>formerly,</hi> what need had there been of a <hi>new diſcovery?</hi> And if this need be ſuppoſed, it muſt plainly argue that the former <hi>pretended Revelation</hi> was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the information of mankind in the uſe of <hi>ordinary means</hi>; and that which is not ſo, cannot anſwer the <hi>intrinſick ends</hi> of a <hi>Revelation.</hi>

This therefore being ſuppoſed, that <hi>old Revelations</hi> are thus intelligible without <hi>new ones,</hi> it muſt needs follow that their explication muſt be derived from the uſe of <hi>ordinary means.</hi> And then for determining further what theſe <hi>ordinary means</hi> are that might have been judged ſuch by thoſe to whom theſe Revelations were made, I conſider <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that this whole indulgence of God in granting the Spirit of Propheſie was plainly accommodated to the <hi>Heathen</hi> practice of <hi>Divination.</hi> This might have been exemplified in ſeveral particulars. Thus Firſt, the very practiſe of revealing <hi>future contingences,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>ordinary conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> concerning the affairs of <hi>private</hi> and <hi>particular perſons,</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed grounded on <hi>reaſon</hi> (otherwiſe it would have been of <hi>eternal uſe,</hi> even now under the <hi>Goſpel</hi>) but a condeſcenſion to the <hi>cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>expectations</hi> of the Perſons to whom they were communicated. And Secondly, that an <hi>order</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of <hi>Prophets</hi> was eſtabliſhed, in <hi>Analogy</hi> to the <hi>Heathen Diviners,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>'s <hi>Orig. Sacr.</hi> l. 2. c. 4.

Celſ.</hi> L. 1. And thirdly, that the ſenſe of the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> and other <hi>Heathens,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> its nature and <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>different degrees,</hi> and <hi>diſtinction from Enthuſiaſm,</hi> does very much agree with the notions of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> concerning it, will appear to any that conſiders the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of both, produced by Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in his excellent Diſcourſe on this ſubject. Hence it will follow Sixthly, that, as this Divination of which they were ſo eager, was originally <hi>Heatheniſh,</hi> ſo they were moſt inclinable to make uſe of thoſe means of underſtanding it to which they had been inured from the ſame principles of <hi>Heatheniſm</hi>; eſpecially where God had not otherwiſe either expreſly provided for it, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly prohibited the means formerly uſed; and thoſe Means, others fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were moſt likely by them to be judged ordinary. And that <hi>Onei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocriticks</hi> were the proper means among the <hi>Heathens</hi> for explaining their <hi>Divinatio per ſomnium,</hi> anſwering the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> degree of <hi>Propheſie by Dreams</hi>; and indeed the principal Art of the <hi>Harioli</hi> and <hi>conjectures</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Viſions,</hi> as far as they held Analogy with thoſe Repreſentations which were made to other leſs prepared Perſons in their ſleep, will not need any proof. It might have been ſhewn how the principal Rules of the <hi>Jewiſh Cabbala</hi> were very agreeable to the like. Arts of Tradition among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and among them were a curious myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal kind of Learning contrived for maintaining a converſation with their Gods; wherein as they were imitated by the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> ſo theſe Rules themſelves were derived from the <hi>Heathen occult Philoſophy.</hi> And certainly it is moſt likely to have been ſome kind of expreſſing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining

                  <hi>Propheſies,</hi> and ſome kinds of <hi>Learning</hi> ſubſervient thereunto, which was ſo ſolemnly ſtudied by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Candidates for <hi>Propheſie</hi> in their <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Colleges,</hi> and which made it ſo ſtrange, that Perſons wanting that preparation, ſuch as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Amos,</hi> ſhould be by God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with it. Beſides that we find the punctual fulfilling of ſeveral predictions of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> by virtue of their <hi>Oneirocriticks</hi> (thoſe moſt eminent Tranſactions of the Conqueſts of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the Death of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, were thus foretold) plainly implying that God himſelf, as he deſigned thoſe <hi>Dreams</hi> to be <hi>Divinatory,</hi> ſo he obſerved the <hi>Oneiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Rules</hi> in their ſignification. For it is not probable that Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons managed by ſuch ſpecial deſigns, and ſignal interpoſitions of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> could have been foreknown or ſignified by the <hi>Devil,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently put to his ſolemn ſhifts of <hi>equivocation</hi> for concealment of his ignorance in affairs of <hi>greater moral probability,</hi> and conſequently of <hi>eaſier prediction.</hi> And it cannot ſeem more ſtrange that God ſhould obſerve the Rules of <hi>Oneirocriticks</hi> and <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> in his <hi>Reſponſes</hi> when made uſe of with a pious deſign by his own people, than that he ſhould anſwer the <hi>Heathens themſelves</hi> in their own practice. Thus he obſerved the ſign propoſed by the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> for diſcerning the true reaſon of their ſufferings, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> vi.2, 9, 12. and met <hi>Balaam</hi> in the uſe of his <hi>enchantments,</hi> Numb. xxiii.4, 16. and revealed our <hi>Saviours Nativity</hi> to the <hi>MAGI by the means of a STAR.</hi> And particularly for <hi>Oneirocriticks,</hi> their ſutableneſs to this purpoſe will not be ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by them who admit the Teſtimony of <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi>

               <p>But there are a few things to be obſerved with relation to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which the moſt learned Interpreters have paſt by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> to uſe the inſtance of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> it muſt be confeſs'd that no body living in that Age could have poſſibly diſcern'd any <hi>prediction</hi> in thoſe words of his, but by an intimation from the <hi>Prophet</hi> himſelf; <hi>viz.</hi> that tho he ſpake of a thing that was paſt, yet he had his mind upon an event that was to happen at ſome Ages diſtant, of which the former was a typical repreſentation. Otherwiſe, who could in the leaſt <hi>ſuſpect</hi> that there was any Prediction latent in a ſimple relation of matter of Fact? <hi>Iſrael was a Child, and I loved him, and called my Son out of Egypt.</hi> No body ſure will ſay, that the <hi>Jews</hi> who were far from being a ſubtil People, could ever of their own heads, without any advertiſment, have diſcover'd <hi>here</hi> a Prophecy. The ſame we are to think of all other Prophecies of this kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Since it is no where found in the old Teſtament, that any ſuch <hi>Intimation</hi> or <hi>Advertiſment</hi> was given, either we muſt acknowledg that no Prophecy <hi>being</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> could be underſtood by the <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>event</hi>; or elſe that the Prophets did privately inſtruct their Diſciples, if not alſo <hi>admoniſh</hi> the common People, that whenever they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99486:19"/>
recounted any of <hi>God's</hi> paſt favours, or when they ſpake of themſelves, they had in their minds a reſpect to ſomething <hi>future.</hi> Nay it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they ſhould have <hi>particularly</hi> and <hi>ſeverally</hi> interpreted every Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of that kind, and pointed to the <hi>event</hi> which it had a reſpect to; for otherwiſe <hi>who</hi> could be ſo ſubtil as between two not much <hi>differing events,</hi> to diſcern which of'em was deſigned in the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? But the firſt of theſe having been confuted by Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> we muſt neceſſarily admit <hi>the latter,</hi> and ſay that there remained among the <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſt's time ſeveral traditions concerning the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, handed down from the <hi>Prophets</hi> themſelves. The reaſon why they did not commit thoſe traditions to writing, I confeſs I do not clearly ſee, but it does not follow from thence that there were <hi>no</hi> ſuch unwritten <hi>Doctrines.</hi> Nor do I deny but that this way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had its <hi>inconveniences,</hi> and that ſome <hi>falſe</hi> opinions might creep in amongſt the true traditions; but our enquiry is not what would be moſt <hi>convenient,</hi> or what we our ſelves ſhould have done, but what <hi>was</hi> done; which is the <hi>only</hi> thing to be conſidered in ſearching into Antiquities.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> The ſame we muſt think of the <hi>types</hi> and of <hi>typical Predictions,</hi> for no body that was not firſt warn'd could ever underſtand thoſe things that were done, or which came to paſs, to have been <hi>repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of things <hi>future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> Unleſs theſe things be ſo, all the uſe of thoſe typical Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt have been confin'd to thoſe to whom they were explained after the <hi>event,</hi> which how ſmall that is, appears from what we have cited out of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> at the 2<hi>d verſ.</hi> And not to repeat what has been ſaid by him, I might at leaſt gather from hence, that no Arguments could be brought from that ſort of Predictions to convince <hi>Infidels</hi> by and whatever weight they had among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> it was intirely ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Authority of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and not to the Evidence of the Arguments. For it is manifeſt to all that underſtand <hi>Hebrew</hi> that the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks concerning <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and that he ſhould, <hi>ſpeaking</hi> of <hi>their</hi> going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> have had a reſpect to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> return into <hi>Judaea,</hi> would have been impoſſible for us to know without a Revelation. And therefore we muſt be oblig'd to ſay that the <hi>Prophets</hi> left their <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> a <hi>Key, q. e.</hi> by which to unlock their Predictions, which would otherwiſe have been ſhut up out of every body's view. And had not this been ſo, it is certain the <hi>Jews</hi> could <hi>never</hi> have grounded their expectations of a <hi>Meſſias</hi> upon ſome places in the <hi>Prophets,</hi> out of which no ſuch matter could be fetch'd by the mere aſſiſtance of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>; nor would the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have cited them as making for their purpoſe. For both the former had made themſelves ridiculous if
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99486:20"/>
they had neglected the <hi>grammatical ſenſe,</hi> and recurred, without any other reaſon than their own fancy, to a more <hi>ſublime</hi> one; and the latter had been but ill Diſputants, to produce ſuch Paſſages as might be <hi>hiſs'd at.</hi> The Authority of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ought not here to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as that which added ſtrength to their Reaſonings; for they <hi>themſelves</hi> did not rely upon their own Authority, but upon the force of their Arguments. You will no where find it ſaid, that Prophecies ought ſo or ſo to be interpreted, becauſe the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt, and whoſe Doctrine <hi>God</hi> confirm'd by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, did in that manner interpret them; but this they take every where for <hi>granted,</hi> that they ſhould be <hi>ſo</hi> explained, as they explain'd them from the <hi>receiv'd Opinion</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Note</hi> l.] Many think it ſtrange that the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſhould here be quoted, when no ſuch thing as what is here mentioned can by the help of <hi>Grammar</hi> be deduc'd from any words of the <hi>Prophets</hi>; for there is no place from whence it can be <hi>grammatically</hi> gather'd that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be called by this name of a <hi>Nazarene.</hi> That which is drawn from the <hi>meer</hi> ſimilitude between the words <hi>Netſer</hi> and <hi>Nezir,</hi> is harſh and far-fetch'd. By <hi>what</hi> means therefore could this be deduced from the Writings of the <hi>Prophets?</hi> It muſt be, doubtleſs, by an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical Interpretation of ſome place which was vulgarly known in thoſe times, but is not now extant. And this ſeems to be the reaſon why St. <hi>Matthew</hi> did not produce any one <hi>Prophet</hi> by <hi>name,</hi> but ſaid <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Verſ 1. <hi>Note</hi> a. THis ſame <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and theſe very Diſcourſes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are related by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. vi. but much more compendiouſly, and not ſo diſtinctly; whence we may perceive that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> have not reported the very <hi>words</hi> of Chriſt, but only the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of what he ſaid; according as their own or others memory ſuggeſted it to them. And this may teach us that the ſenſe is that which we ſhould principally look to, and that we ought not to <hi>anatomize,</hi> or inſiſt too nicely upon every ſingle word. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhall hardly make the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> to agree with one another. As for inſtance, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays here in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>bleſſed are the poor in Spirit,</hi> but in St. <hi>Luke</hi> this word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is wanting. Now if we take theſe words of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> in the <hi>fineſt</hi> and <hi>niceſt</hi> ſenſe, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will be found to ſpeak here, not of thoſe that are <hi>deſtitute of riches,</hi> but thoſe who in what condition <hi>ſoever</hi> they be are not too much <hi>puff'd up</hi> in their minds. On the other hand, St. <hi>Luke's</hi> words do not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly import humble-minded perſons, but perſons of <hi>mean eſtate.</hi> The like we may obſerve concerning the 6<hi>th</hi> verſe, and abundance of other places, in which the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> report the ſame thing with ſome variation.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Note</hi> c.] That in theſe words <hi>the pure in heart</hi> have a bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conferred upon them, is plain enough; but what that bleſſedneſs is, is not ſo clear. Of old the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as the <hi>Heathens</hi> thought they might ſometimes have a ſight of the <hi>Gods.</hi> By the <hi>Gods,</hi> I do not mean the very <hi>divine Nature,</hi> but <hi>corporal Shapes</hi> aſſumed by Angels. Yea and ſo the <hi>moſt high God himſelf</hi> (if it was not rather an <hi>Angel</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his name that appear'd to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) gave notice of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by a cloud or by fire, which <hi>form</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> called by the name of <hi>God,</hi> as appears from the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> They had a conceit alſo, that if any one ſhould ſee thoſe <hi>forms</hi> againſt the will of the <hi>Gods,</hi> they would certainly die, or loſe their ſight. See my notes upon <hi>Gen.</hi> xvi.13. And therefore whoever was admitted by any <hi>God</hi> to an interview with him, was look'd upon to be his ſpecial <hi>favourite</hi>; as the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture informs us concerning <hi>Moſes,</hi> who went near to the Cloud, in which the <hi>Angel</hi> had wrapt himſelf, and talked with him. Hence, this phraſe <hi>to ſee God</hi> was uſed to expreſs ſome <hi>great happineſs,</hi> even amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which gave occaſion to thoſe Verſes in <hi>Virgil</hi>;

<q>21, 22. Ye know that Murder was forbidden by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that this Law of his threatned Death to the Tranſgreſſors of it; but let me tell you, that it is not only thoſe heinous ſort of crimes that will be puniſhed by <hi>God</hi> in another life: Whoever ſhall but <hi>indulge his anger,</hi> and make a cuſtom of carrying himſelf haſtily and moroſely to others without reaſon, ſhall have a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted upon him, comparable to that capital one to which perſons are ſentenced by the <hi>leſſer Sanhedrim</hi>; and that ſhall be the lighteſt penalty for Sins committed againſt your Neighbour. But whoever ſhall be found to have got an ill habit of <hi>mocking and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99486:24"/>
deriding</hi> others, ſhall <hi>in this kind of Puniſhments</hi> ſuffer as heavy a one, as that which uſed to be inflicted by the <hi>greater Sanhedrim</hi> for the boldeſt Crimes. But laſtly, he that ſhall accuſtom himſelf to <hi>rail,</hi> or <hi>revile</hi> other men, ſhall have a Penalty laid upon him by <hi>God</hi> reſembling the ſevereſt that is us'd amongſt Men, ſuch as to be burnt alive.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> may be referred to <hi>two</hi> Heads, the <hi>former</hi> of which is, that there are ſome Sins which have no Puniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>; and the <hi>latter,</hi> that for <hi>thoſe</hi> very Sins men ſhall ſuffer as ſevere, nay and a ſeverer puniſhment in the other life, than the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> inflicted for the <hi>greatest</hi> crimes. Which was a very neceſſary Doctrine for the <hi>Jews,</hi> who thought themſelves to be very good men, and to have fulfilled their duty in all points, if they were but ſafe from any charge being brought againſt them out of the Law; as is the caſe of many even at this day, among <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But then we are not to underſtand by the Sins here ſpoken of, <hi>ſingle Commiſſions,</hi> ſuch as a ſudden fit of Anger, <hi>once</hi> mocking, or <hi>one</hi> abuſeful Speech raſhly thrown out; but a <hi>habit</hi> of being angry, or of deriding and reviling our Neighbour, and continuing in it as long as we live: for ſingle acts of Sin, which we fall into not through a cuſtom in ſinning, but through infirmity, are according to the Laws of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>-Covenant, pardoned by <hi>God.</hi> That which <hi>Christ</hi> here therefore condemns is, firſt an <hi>angry Diſpoſition,</hi> or a habit of being eaſily, and for little or no reaſon, diſpleaſed with others; and then <hi>Pride,</hi> which is, as I may ſay, the <hi>Parent</hi> of <hi>mocking</hi>; and laſtly, both an angry and proud cuſtom of ſpeaking <hi>abuſively</hi> or <hi>revilingly.</hi> And indeed, theſe corrupt Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Mind are like ſo many poiſonous Fountains from whence innumerable Evils proceed; for they do not only induce a neglect of the contrary Duties, but are the occaſion many times of the greateſt Sins.

               <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Note</hi> b.] Beſides the reaſons which the learned <hi>Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> has aſſigned of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> unwillingneſs to have it divulged that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> there may be <hi>two</hi> others given of no ſmall importance. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had rather this ſhould be gathered from his works than by his Diſciples or his own publiſhing it, becauſe the <hi>faith</hi> that was hereby begotten in Men would be much the firmer, as having the true grounds of a <hi>ſolid faith</hi> to rely upon. And thus when thoſe that were ſent to him by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> deſired of him to be ſatisfied whether he was that perſon <hi>that was to come,</hi> he made anſwer: <hi>Go and tell John the things which ye hear and ſee; The blind receive their ſight,</hi> &amp;c. Matt. xi.4, 5. The <hi>other</hi> is, becauſe if his Diſciples had openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they would have drawn after them a vaſt multitude of People who expected the <hi>Meſſias</hi> under the notion of a <hi>temporal King,</hi> and were exceeding deſirous of innovations; which ſort of Men were more fit to raiſe a ſedition than to advance the Kingdom of Heaven by juſt and proper Methods. To prevent therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting of evil men to him with a deſign to innovate, and ſo making a wrong uſe of his Name and Authority, he thought it better, till that danger was over, to have the publiſhing of the truth deferred. Thus <hi>Joh.</hi> vi.15. we ſee, the multitude after they had been fed by him, fell into ſuch a ſort of conſultation; whereupon <hi>when he knew that they would come and take him by force, to make him a King, he departed alone by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a mountain.</hi> It was an extraordinary piece of Wiſdom in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to take care there might be no ſedition laid either to his or his Diſciples charge, whilſt the Goſpel was but begun to be preached; for if ſuch a thing could have been done with any appearance of juſtice, every body eaſily perceives that it would have been a mighty preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Chriſtian Religion.</p>

But becauſe no one can believe the Authority of any Laws, but he muſt alſo obſerve them, provided he does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree with himſelf; therefore no body could ſeriouſly and heartily believe that <hi>Christ</hi> was ſent down from Heaven to men, to teach them the way of eternal Salvation, without obeying <hi>Christ</hi>'s Precepts: juſt as no body believed the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be the only Rule of Life revealed by <hi>God,</hi> who did not, in part at leaſt, conform themſelves thereto. And hence this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> came, in the Writings of the Apoſtles, to ſignify not only a perſwaſion of the truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99486:29"/>
Doctrin, but alſo a diſpoſition of Mind, and Practice agreeable to it, the neceſſary effect of believing.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be obſerved, that in different places of the New Teſtament, in proportion to the Subject treated of, this word has a larger or more contracted Notion. 1. Where the Diſcourſe is about the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> we are to underſtand by it ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the truth of thoſe things they received as divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as was accompanied with an anſwerable temper of Mind and Life. In which ſenſe it occurs frequently in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. xi. and elſewhere. 2. Where <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s diſcourſe is of thoſe that believed in him as tranſacting upon earth, as he does here in S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and up and down every where in the Goſpels, by Faith is meant a perſwaſion of his having been truly ſent of <hi>God,</hi> with a power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles, and of the truth of all his Doctrine as far as it was known. 3. But after the Apoſtles had received the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and expounded the whole Chriſtian Doctrine more at large, the notion of <hi>Faith</hi> included in it a perſwaſion not only of the truth of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Miſſion, but alſo of his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Diſciples,</hi> whoſe Doctrine <hi>God</hi> gave a teſtimony to by innumerable wonders; and an aſſent accordingly yielded to whatever they aſſerted, joined with a Life ſutable to ſuch a perſwaſion. And this notion the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> has in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> where St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſputes about <hi>Juſtification.</hi> For in theſe places <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> a living according to the Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſetting aſide the works commanded by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> only, is ſaid to <hi>juſtify,</hi> i. e. to procure mens being eſteemed <hi>just,</hi> or good and pious by <hi>God,</hi> and being acceptable to him. And on the other hand, the Apoſtle denies that <hi>Works,</hi> viz. thoſe which were <hi>oppoſed</hi> by the <hi>Jews</hi> to Faith, or the Chriſtian Religion, did either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, or ever of old, juſtify. And this he makes good by ſeveral Arguments, which ſhall in their proper places be explained. It ſhall ſuffice at preſent to have run over the different ſenſes that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is capable of, and pointed to its original Signification.</p>
               <p>But there is this further to be added, that as <hi>Faith</hi> includes more than a <hi>bare perſwaſion</hi> about the truth of a thing in the mind; ſo this <hi>perſwaſion</hi> it ſelf muſt be ſuch a one, as is the reſult of having ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly weighed and examined the Arguments by which the truth of the Chriſtian Doctrine is confirmed. For it is not to be imagined that the <hi>Centurion,</hi> for inſtance, did believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hand over head, without reaſon or due conſideration: He had, without doubt, ſeen ſome of his other Miracles, and heard his Doctrine, and had been made to believe that there was nothing too difficult for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99486:29"/>
had all power given him by <hi>God,</hi> to do. This his Diſcourſe manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews. But he could never have examined <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Doctrine and Miracles, as it was requiſite he ſhould, unleſs he had been freed from two of the mightieſt Impediments to it, whereof one is Obſtinacy, whereby we become impenetrable to all reaſons, be they never ſo ſtrong; and the other, a wicked Life, which makes Men unwilling to believe thoſe things, the acknowledgment whereof would render it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them to live otherwiſe than they did before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that Faith has ſuch a commendation beſtowed upon it; which matter I have diſcourſed upon in my Notes upon <hi>Gen.</hi> xv.6. and have there quoted out of <hi>Philo</hi> a very remarkable paſſage in which Faith is commended.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Note</hi> h.] It is no wonder, (when men are neither able to diſcourſe themſelves, nor to underſtand what Beings of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſay about the Concernments of another Life, but in Metaphors taken from the things of this) that the future Happineſs is deſcribed in this place by the ſimilitude of a Feaſt. But yet I believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not the firſt inventor of this ſimilitude, but borrowed it from the <hi>Jews</hi> of that time, amongſt whom it was in daily uſe, and who alſo were beholden for it, as they were for many other things, to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Poets of that Nation in order to repreſent <hi>Ixion</hi> as a moſt happy King, feigned him to have been <hi>entertained at a Feaſt by the Gods.</hi> The ſame they ſaid of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who, to uſe the words of <hi>Pindar</hi> in <hi>Olympion,</hi> Od. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

Had <hi>God</hi> ſpoken any otherwiſe than he did, it could hardly have been known which that ſeventh day was which he would have to be kept as a day of reſt; for it might have been the ſeventh day of every month, or of every year. III. That place in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> Chap. x. is nothing at all to the purpoſe: <hi>Whoſoever,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>ſhall put away his wife, and ſhall marry another, committeth adultery; and if a woman ſhall put away her husband and be married to another, ſhe committeth adultery.</hi> Where Chriſt does not reſpect what might be done in purſuance of the <hi>Law,</hi> but the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who allowed Women this power. We are ſure that <hi>Salome, Herod</hi>'s Siſter, followed this example, and there were perhaps ſome others that would have been ready enough to have done the like. IV. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> iv. is really, that Anger is not unlawful if it be but kept within bounds. V. The place cited out of St. <hi>James</hi> ſerves not in the leaſt the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s deſign. For the comforting of the rich upon the loſs of their riches, is not the only thing that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> there intends. See the Notes upon that place. VI. The form of ſpeech uſed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. vi.12. <hi>But God be thanked that ye were the ſervants of ſin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine, into which ye were delivered,</hi> is almoſt like that of the Diſciples of <hi>John.</hi> But <hi>that ye were</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Obſervation is true, if it be accommodated to other places. There are, for inſtance, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things ſaid in <hi>Parables</hi> which do not concern the ſcope of them, but are only for ornament ſake, and to make the Hearers the more attentive; tho it ſeems to have no manner of ground in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by him alledged. But it is common for thoſe that have not from their very youth made it their buſineſs carefully to ſtudy the Criticks, to find difficulties in the plaineſt things. And Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> is far from being the only inſtance of this.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Note</hi> f.] Our ingenious Author, to illuſtrate the general propoſition he lays down by examples, plainly miſapplies moſt of the paſſages here alledged by him. For excepting one place out of <hi>Matt.</hi> xxiii.16. all the reſt are eithar precepts or admonitions, as thoſe who will but examin them will eaſily ſee. I ſhall inſtance but in two. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>I ſend you forth as ſheep in the midſt of wolves; be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſe as ſerpents, and ſimple as doves.</hi> Theſe words contain a plain precept, and that a very neceſſary one, as well as one that is agreeable to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Doctrine. For the Apoſtles being not ſent to men that were lovers of Truth and Juſtice, but to ſuch Perſons as were more like Beaſts than reaſonable creatures, there was a neceſſity of their uſing prudence, leſt going to addreſs themſelves to Men who were wicked to a degree of madneſs, their pains ſhould not only prove ineffectual and to no purpoſe, but they themſelves alſo be oppreſſed by them. And
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99486:31"/>
this <hi>Chriſt</hi> commands <hi>Matt.</hi> vii.6. <hi>Give not that which is holy unto Dogs,</hi> &amp;c. But they were at the ſame time to take heed that that prudence of theirs did not turn to craftineſs or deceit, as it would have done, if they had either privately renounced the Goſpel which they had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly preached, or feigned themſelves inclined to the wicked opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Phariſees. They were not to ſay every thing in all places and in all companies, but they were to ſay nothing that was in the leaſt repugnant to the Doctrines which they had received from their Maſter, or that might hinder the Goſpel's propagation. That which <hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore enjoyns his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> is, to mix prudence and a ſincere plainneſs together. Of which vertues he himſelf was a moſt perfect pattern, who never expoſed himſelf to the fury of the Jews but when there was a neceſſity for it. But St. <hi>Peter</hi> offended againſt this precept by acting the part of a Diſſembler, of which we have an account given us by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. ii.12. making uſe of prudence to an extreme, he forfeited the commendation of being ſincere and upright.</p>
               <p>The following words, <hi>Beware of men for they will deliver you,</hi> &amp;c. are a prohibition of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his Apoſtles not to publiſh immediately to every one the inſtructions they had received from him, for fear they ſhould be dragged to the Synagogues upon the very firſt beginning of their miniſtry. A thing which he himſelf alſo practiſed, delivering his mind in parables, that he might not give too great an occaſion for the paſſions of ill minded men to exert themſelves, and ſaying nothing which he thought would not at preſent be endured by the Perſons he ſpake to. But this was to be no hindrance, as it really was not to the Apoſtles, from expoſing themſelves to ſuch dangers as they could not avoid but by a culpable diſſembling. Theſe things are too manifeſt to need any longer inſiſting upon.</p>

                  </gap>ds thought <hi>that</hi> to be the true Etymology of the word which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> gives us. So the Author of the <hi>Etymologicon mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> ſays, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which may be pronounced not only as the Authors of the <hi>Maſora</hi> do, <hi>ed,</hi> but <hi>ajid.</hi> The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> perhaps wrote it <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Hajid</hi> came <hi>haïdes</hi> and <hi>hades</hi>; and that word, as it is very well known, ſignifies <hi>deſtruction.</hi> There are a great many words that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have in vain attempted to find the original of in their Language, and which have with good ſucceſs been derived by learned men from the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi> I could ſhew why the youngeſt of <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Sons was ſo called, and aſſign the reaſon of the Names of the reſt of them out of the ſame Language: but this is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place for it.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Now when this word is oppoſed to <hi>Heaven,</hi> it ſignifies, among the Hebrews, <hi>the loweſt places of the earth</hi>; and where <hi>Heaven</hi> is by a metaphor taken for <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Proſperity,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, i. e. the appearance of a Man. This is known to be the conſtant uſe of this phraſe in the Old Teſtament; and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſometimes uſe it in the ſame ſignification will not ſeem ſtrange to any, tho at other times he calls <hi>himſelf</hi> the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> or <hi>a Man.</hi> III. The phraſe <hi>for man</hi> in St. <hi>Mark</hi> does certainly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy <hi>for the good of Man</hi>; to wit, that Servants might have reſt, which was the principal end of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>; from whence it follows that man is <hi>Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> in this reſpect, that he may either obſerve, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> according as affairs, upon which his ſafety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, require. For otherwiſe, if this had not been lawful, <hi>man had been for the Sabbath</hi> and <hi>not the Sabbath for man</hi>; in as much as it would have been his duty to ſet leſs by his own Life than the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Thus, if there be a juſt occaſion, we are obliged to lay down our lives, rather than not obſerve thoſe precepts of eternal equity and obligation, that are contained in the Goſpel; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the keeping of thoſe precepts was the end for which <hi>God</hi> created us. And yet <hi>they</hi> too, I acknowledg, may in a ſort be ſaid to be <hi>for us,</hi> becauſe, if they were but univerſally obſerved, they would be a means of making men happy both in this life, and everlaſtingly in the other. But the Sabbatical days of reſt come quite under another conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and were not appointed for the good of the mind, ſo much as of the body. The <hi>Jews,</hi> according to the intention of the Lawgiver, were bound only to obſerve them ſo far as they could without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, and conſiſtently with ſelf-preſervation. In all other caſes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99486:36"/>
they were to have a greater regard to their life than to the keeping of holy days. <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> therefore has made an ill advantage of the ambiguity of this phraſe <hi>for the good of man,</hi> which does not always ſignify the ſame thing. Add to this that I have ſaid what <hi>Grotius</hi> has upon this place, and then there will be no room to doubt but that this learned Engliſh Gentleman has miſtaken the true deſign of it.</p>

                  </gap>, and would be underſtood thus, to advance the Doctrine of true Piety ſo as that it ſhall prevail over falſhood; which is the ſame, as to lay down that Doctrine in ſuch a manner as to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear true.

               <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> d.] This proverbial expreſſion, <hi>not to break a bruiſed reed, nor to quench ſmoking flax,</hi> is rightly expounded by <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> as well as by many others before him. I add, that the <hi>Latins</hi> much after the ſame manner uſed the phraſe <hi>extinguere extinctos,</hi> to ſignify the killing or deſtroying outright ſuch as had before but little hope left of ſafety.

Certain it is that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> wrote firſt. But both of them were deceived by a falſe reading in <hi>Pliny,</hi> whoſe words, in the vulgar editions were corrupted. In the Manuſcript Copy there is no mention made of the <hi>Cyrenaeans,</hi> nor of <hi>Achor Deus,</hi> as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> in his <hi>Plinian. exercit.</hi> p. 10. <hi>Edit. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltraj.</hi> obſerves, who muſt be conſulted by thoſe that have a mind to enquire more through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into this matter.

               <p>It will bear likewiſe a diſpute, whether it be a probable conjecture of our Author, that the <hi>Ekronites God Beelzebub</hi> was the ſame with the <hi>Grecians Jupiter.</hi> For <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a Deity among the Greeks, was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> as <hi>Dagon</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> was to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> It was a piece of vanity in the poor ſilly <hi>Grecians,</hi> raſhly to think that their Gods were every where worſhipped, as I might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew if it was a thing to be done in this place: But I do not here take upon me to explain the <hi>Greek</hi> Mythology.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>Note</hi> g.] The <hi>Doctor</hi> might perhaps have added, that the whole of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s reaſoning in this place conſiſts of Arguments <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>; for there are ſeveral things here ſuppoſed as true, becauſe they were believed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> which are no where deſignedly laid down for certain by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor any where confirmed by the <hi>Apoſtles. One</hi> is, that there is ſuch a political order amongſt the Devils, as that one rules over the reſt in the quality of a <hi>Prince,</hi> and under the name of <hi>Beelzebub</hi>; which every one muſt needs look upon as doubtful. <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> thing is, that that political order ſhould continue for a great while after that time, and conſequently the Devils ſhould have no civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions among themſelves. It's certain that the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Devil</hi> by the name of <hi>Arimanes,</hi> thought that his Empire would never be at an end till it was overthrown by <hi>Oromazes</hi> or the <hi>good God.</hi> See <hi>Stanley Philoſoph. Oriental.</hi> Lib. ii. c. 6. And much ſuch an opinion as this ſeems to have been taken up by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had it from the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and, if we believe learned men, the reſt alſo of the Doctrine about the ſeveral orders that there are among the <hi>Angels.</hi> It may be further asked perhaps, why <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer an objection which eaſily ſprings up in a mans mind upon the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this reaſoning of his. For it might have been pretended by the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that this was only an artifice in the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Devils</hi> to expel his ſubject <hi>Devils</hi> for a little time, who might afterwards enter in again unobſerved and ſettle him more ſecurely in his Dominion; and ſo that there ſeemed to be a diſſenſion among the <hi>Devils,</hi> tho <hi>really</hi> there was none. But this pretence the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> it ſelf ſufficiently confuted; and his Reſurrection, which was purpoſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a confirmation of his Doctrine, put the matter out of all doubt. For how could it be imagined that ſo <hi>holy</hi> a Doctrine, confirm'd by miracles from <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſhould owe its being ſo univerſally ſpread to a previous juggle and contrivance among the <hi>Devils?</hi> This is in effect, tho but obſcurely, ſuggeſted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the 33<hi>d</hi> Verſ.</p>

So that our Author, which I am ſorry for, has not in the beginning of this laſt Annotation of his, given us any Evidence of his great skill in <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar:</hi> What he ſays beſides is extraordinary; and no body, that I know of, has ſo happily explained wherein the Sin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> conſiſts. This Sin is excellently compared to ſinning under the Law <hi>with a hand lifted up</hi>; which thoſe were guilty of who, after warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given them, put an open contempt upon the Laws authority, and ſpake in reproachful terms concerning it, as we have ſhewn in our Notes on <hi>Numbers.</hi> For juſt as thoſe who are here ſaid to ſin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> defamed the Miracles wrought by <hi>Chriſt</hi>; ſo thoſe that ſinned under the Law <hi>with a high hand</hi> derided the Miracles wrought by <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                  <hi>ſlothful perſons,</hi> performed no good works, but were wicked themſelves, and by their bad Converſation kept others from becoming ſober or ſerviceable. Their Diſcourſes were the Diſcourſes of <gap reason="foreign">

But tho there was a very important reaſon for blotting his name out, the antient Tranſcribers had none at all for adding it; which is a thing that deſerves our conſideration, as well as what S. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſays beſides in that place.</p>

The phraſe <hi>to proceed out of the heart</hi> does not ſignify for any thing that lies hid in the heart to diſcover it ſelf by ſome external Action, but to have a Fountain in the Mind, which is the original of all our thoughts.

                  </gap>, <hi>did not only undergo one or two, but many ſorrows; and ſo becoming a Martyr, went to his proper place in glory.</hi> We may apply to him that paſſage of <hi>Seneca</hi> as we find it in <hi>Lactantius</hi> Lib. vi. c. 17. <hi>Hic eſt ille homo honeſtus, non apice, purpuráve, non lictorum inſignis miniſterio, ſed nulla re minor, qui cum MORTEM in VICINIA videt, non ſic perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, tanquam rem novam viderit; qui ſive toto corpore tormenta patienda ſunt, ſive flamma ore recipienda eſt, ſive extendendae per patibulum manus, non quaerit quid patiatur, ſed quam bene. This is that brave and honorable perſon, who is not remarkable for his fine hat of feathers, his purple robe, or his guard of Lictors, which is the leaſt part of his glory; but who when he ſees death juſt before him, is not ſurprized with the ſtrangeneſs of the ſight; and whether he is to undergo the torment of the rack, or to receive fire into his mouth, or have his arms ſtretched out upon a croſs, does not regard what, but how well he ſuffers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one thing that may perhaps here be objected, <hi>viz.</hi> that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this interpretation <hi>Christ</hi> does not keep to the Metaphor; for after he had called <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>ſtone,</hi> he adds that <hi>death</hi> ſhould not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. It is true, but it was neither neceſſary that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould go on in the ſame Metaphor; nor yet ſuppoſing that what we refer to <hi>Peter</hi> did, as it is commonly thought, belong to the Church, will he be found to continue the ſame Metaphor. For he compares the Church to a <hi>building,</hi> which cannot properly be ſaid to <hi>be overcome by the gates of death,</hi> but only to be pulled down or deſtroyed. Nothing is more ordinary in all ſort of Writers than to begin with one Metaphor and end with another. As for inſtance, <hi>Clemens</hi> ſays a little before the words already alledged, concerning St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>However, by this it appears that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> or his interpreter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fitly uſes here the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which properly ſignifies to <hi>overcome by force</hi>; for this is what <hi>Chriſt</hi> means, that the terror of having a <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> Death ſet before him, ſhould not overcome St. <hi>Peters</hi> conſtancy; tho he ſaw <hi>the gates of death</hi> opened for him, yet he ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

to Biſhops; as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had by theſe words alone conferred an <hi>equal</hi> Power upon the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſors.

                  <hi>entire diſcourſes,</hi> I can by no means think.

As for inſtance, this Parable of the <hi>Houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the Labourers,</hi> which is extant in the <hi>Jeruſalem Gemara,</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an age and a half at leaſt after the Deſtruction of the Temple. And this being ſo, it ſeems to me a great deal more probable, that the Author of the <hi>Jeruſalem Gemara,</hi> or whoever it is that is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as uſing this Parable, did it in imitation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than that he owed it to any antient tradition.

did by accident ſometimes ſay much the ſame things.

               <p n="1">I. If it were his deſign to expreſs and accurately diſtinguiſh the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and figurative ſignifications of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is <hi>to invite</hi> to a feaſt, becauſe he that is ſo invited is called upon by name; which there was no need of proving, nothing being, in all Writers, more common. And hence <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Verſ. 29. <hi>Note</hi> d.] It were to be wiſh'd that Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> as well as others who quote that Greek and Latin Manuſcript, had given us alſo the Latin Verſion out of it, or rather that it were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed entire. But in the mean time, the more I conſider the various readings of that Manuſcript, as they are ſet down both in many places of <hi>Beza,</hi> and in the <hi>Oxford Edit.</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the more I am confirmed in the Opinion which I have ſometime ſince made learned Men the Judges of, <hi>viz.</hi> that that <hi>Manuſcript</hi> does not ſo much contain the words of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> as of ſome <hi>Paraphraſt,</hi> who now and then fills up what he thought was wanting, and where the Greek was not good mended the Language; and all that will but examine it with a particular care will be of the ſame Opinion. The Paraphraſe of <hi>Epictetus's Enchiridion</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Meric. Caſaubon,</hi> is much ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which there are moſt of <hi>Epictetus</hi>'s words ſet down, but often in a different order and with ſeveral Enlargements. And therefore I diſagree with the Doctor in his ſuſpecting that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ought to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99486:51"/>
be ſupplied out of that one <hi>Manuſcript,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chapter XXI.</note> which all the reſt contradict, it being more probable that that Addition is taken out of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> tho with ſome Alterations. But I ſay again, that it were to be wiſhed that that Copy were publiſhed entire; and thoſe who keep up ſuch things to be burnt by the next Fire, are not to be commended.</p>
               <p>Since the writing of this, I have happened to ſee ſome new An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations upon the New Teſtament made by <hi>R.

And this ſame Addition which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> mentions, he found alſo in thoſe antient Manuſcripts which have the Latin Verſion as it was before it was corrected by S. <hi>Jerom.</hi> He tells us <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. that he had read theſe words in the Latin Manuſcript of the four Goſpels, which is extant in the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Library at <hi>Paris: Vos autem quaeritis de puſillo creſcere, &amp; de majore minores eſſe.

               <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Note</hi> b.] Our learned <hi>Author</hi>'s Memory has fail'd him as to ſome things in this place, which I ſhall briefly take notice of.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In his Paraphraſe, he deſcribes the <hi>Herodians</hi> thus, <hi>Others that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to</hi> Herod <hi>the Roman Governor:</hi> in which words who would not think that he affirmed <hi>Herod</hi> to have been a <hi>Roman</hi> ſent by <hi>Tiberius</hi> to govern <hi>Judaea?</hi> than which nothing can be imagined more abſurd; neither can I conceive that a Man ſo learned as he could ever be guilty of ſo groſs a Miſtake. And therefore I rather think that it was his deſign to ſay, <hi>Thoſe that adhered to the Roman Government, as</hi> Herod. See his Note upon <hi>Chap.</hi> xvi.6. <hi>Herodes Antipas,</hi> who lived in thoſe times, and was in favor with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> was the <hi>Tetrarch</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> not of <hi>Judaea,</hi> of which <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was Procurator.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I do not ſee what uſe the <hi>Doctor</hi> could make of the <hi>Syriack</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, who does not read <hi>Herod's Followers,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">III.

               <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Note</hi> d.] There are ſeveral things both in our <hi>Author</hi>'s Paraphraſe upon the Objection of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and in his Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon this place, that need Correction.</p>

               <p n="2">II.

III. I confeſs <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> do give us that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Miracles of which the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſpeaks; but that what they tell us was real matter of Fact, is not ſufficiently clear: for what aſſurance can any Man give us, that ſome vain fellows among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did not make it their buſineſs to flatter <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> or that he himſelf being a <hi>Politick</hi> Man did not ſeek ſuch an occaſion to gain the favour of the ſuperſtitious multitude, at his entrance upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? or elſe it may be it was an invention of <hi>Idolaters</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn Chriſtianity, by making people believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not the <hi>only</hi> Perſon that had healed the <hi>blind with Spittle</hi>; and it was dangerous

for any man to go about to detect a Cheat which was countenanced by the Emperor. IV. I cannot imagin where the <hi>Doctor</hi> read in <hi>Suetonius</hi> that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was <hi>Humillimus &amp; Clementiſſimus</hi>; for theſe words are not to be found in the Life of <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> He ſays indeed in Chap. xii. <hi>Principatus ad ultimum civilis &amp; clemens</hi>; but he never calls him <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> which amongſt the <hi>Latins</hi> is a Reproach, and not the name of a Vertue.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99486:58"/>
from that ſort of <hi>Marble</hi> which was called Alabaſter, of which thoſe Veſſels that bore that name were commonly made. For to ſay that Marble was <hi>ſo</hi> called, becauſe out of that were formed Veſſels <hi>without handles,</hi> as the <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Salmaſ.</hi> himſelf does, is abſurd; ſince not only Veſſels of all ſhapes and forms, but even Pillars alſo were made out of it. 'Tis as if one ſhould ſay, becauſe the word <hi>Onyx</hi> ſometimes ſignifies a Veſſel, therefore that ſort of ſtone was <hi>ſo</hi> called, becauſe it was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which thoſe Veſſels were made.

The Tranſlation of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Latin is very exact, <hi>elegit ſuſpendium anima mea,</hi> &amp;c. VI. There is no doubt but that the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies to <hi>choak</hi> or <hi>ſuffocate</hi> by any means whatſoever, but it does not follow that the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed in any other notion than that of <hi>hanging</hi>; nor is any other ſignification to be affixed to it where the diſcourſe relates to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in deſpair, and that chuſes Death rather than Life, which was the caſe of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Achitophel.</hi> VII. But our <hi>Author</hi> tells us, that it is neceſſary to put another ſenſe upon this word, in order to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile St. <hi>Luke</hi> with St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> This would be true, if we could not make them agree any other way; which we may very well do by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding both their accounts together thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>And going away hanged himſelf, and falling down forwards he burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his bowels guſhed out.</hi> But it may be asked, if he hanged himſelf, how could he fall down? to which I anſwer, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>by the ropes breaking, or by being cut down by ſome body</hi>; which circumſtance, as long as it was known that he killed himſelf in deſpair, was not thought material enough to be ſet down. But it may be ſaid again, How came he to burſt aſunder, and his bowels to guſh out? I anſwer, becauſe he fell down from on high, as he muſt needs have done if he hanged himſelf upon the battlement of ſome Terras, or upon a Tree that leaned over a deeper Valley than ordinary; for then if he fell upon ſome ſtone, or ſtump, or ſtake, that was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, his belly might eaſily be ripped open. <hi>Pricaeus</hi> upon this place has given us ſeveral Examples of this nature, and the thing is plain. But never did any Woman, by a ſuffocation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, burſt aſunder in the midſt, and much leſs did ever any Man do ſo. Our Author ſhould have given us but one ſuch inſtance at leaſt; but I am ſure he was not able. The Interpretation I have given is not only the moſt natural, but agrees exactly with the words. The learned Perſon I but now ſpake of, who has written largely and on ſet purpoſe about this matter, does indeed very well ſhew that the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies to kill by hanging; but he has not proved that <hi>Judas,</hi> as he conjectures, was thrown down from ſome ſteep Rock as a mark of infamy ſet upon him. It does not appear from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99486:60"/>
any Teſtimony, that thoſe who killed themſelves were ſo puniſhed by the <hi>Jews.</hi> Beſides, the Phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſufficiently intimates that the Body of <hi>Judas</hi> was not conveyed to any other place to be thrown down from; for that would rather have been expreſſed by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ſome other ſuch words; but the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies that the Body fell down without any forcible impulſe. It may be enquired perhaps why St. <hi>Matthew</hi> did not add the Circumſtance taken notice of by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and why St. <hi>Luke</hi> did not make mention of <hi>Judas</hi>'s hanging himſelf? To which I anſwer, it may reaſonably enough be ſuppoſed that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> heard only of his <hi>hanging,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> who ſpeaks in <hi>Acts</hi> i. only of his falling down ſome ſteep place; and tho both were true, yet they related ſeverally the ſtory juſt as they had heard it. That in a matter of no great moment, all the Circumſtances are not exactly ſet down, let ſuch only wonder, as have not obſerved that Circumſtances of much greater moment are frequently paſſed over by one or other of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> as appears from other places. Compare St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> as to what they both ſay about the <hi>Thieves</hi> that were crucified with <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Note</hi> d.] There are ſome things in this laſt Note that need Correction. I. The Phraſe <hi>ad faciendum populum</hi> is not a Latin Phraſe, nor has any ſignification, but I believe it was an Error of the <hi>Printer</hi>'s, and that the <hi>Doctor</hi> wrote <hi>ad faciendum ſibi favorem apud populum.</hi> II. What is here ſaid about the ſingular Privilege of the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> has no affinity with the matter in hand; for tho a Roman Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen could not be put to death without the Suffrage of the People, yet I ſuppoſe <hi>Pilate</hi> did not wait for the conſent of the <hi>Jews</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power him to behead ſuch as he judged guilty. He gratified the <hi>Jews</hi> when he let go a Criminal at their requeſt; and he did not condemn any at their requeſt, when they were otherwiſe affected, but of his own accord to get their favour: but in <hi>Rome</hi> no Magiſtrate had authority to behead any Citizen without the peoples Conſent, and thoſe that the people abſolved were to be let go whether the Magiſtrates would or not, and thoſe whom they condemned were certainly to be puniſhed. III. It would have been better obſerved that it was the cuſtom alſo among other Nations to releaſe their Priſoners upon feſtival days. So in <hi>Athens</hi> it was a Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that <hi>at the time when the Feaſts were kept in honour of</hi> Ceres, <hi>the Priſoners ſhould be let looſe.</hi> And the ſame was practiſed upon other Athenian Feaſts, as <hi>Sam. Petitus</hi> has ſhewn, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Legg. Att.</hi> Tit. 1. See likewiſe <hi>Iſ. Caſaubon</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Suet.</hi> Tib. <hi>cap.</hi> lxi. IV. This Cuſtom was imitated by the Chriſtian Emperors, who for <hi>joy</hi> at the <hi>Paſſover</hi> gave
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99486:61"/>
order in their Letters that the Priſons ſhould be opened. But that you may not miſtake, this was done in honour not of the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> but of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Paſſover, and the <hi>Jews</hi> were releaſed no more than others; which contradicts what the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays. So in <hi>Cod.</hi> lib. 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> iv. <hi>Leg.</hi> 3. there is this Law made by <hi>Valentinian, Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadius: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi primus dies Paſchatis extiterit, nullum teneat carcer incluſum, omnium vincula diſſolvantur. As ſoon as the firſt day of the Paſſover is come, let there be none kept ſhut up in Priſon; let them be all releaſed of their Chains.</hi> There is no mention at all here made of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And there are a great many ſuch like Orders in <hi>Cod. Theodoſ.</hi> where the <hi>Jews</hi> are not mentioned. See the Collections of <hi>Sam. Petitus</hi> in the place before cited. 'Tis oftner than once that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adds or diminiſhes the ſayings of the <hi>Antients,</hi> which he thought by being a little changed, would better illuſtrate the Writings of the New Teſtament. But yet I do not believe he did it deſignedly, who was ſo good a Man, and ſo great a lover of Truth, but rather was miſled by others who were not ſo faithful as they ſhould have been in their Citations.</p>

And then the ſenſe may be the ſame, tho at firſt ſight the words ſeem to contradict one another. Now the meaning of <hi>Christ</hi> here is only this, that the Apoſtles were not to make any preparation or proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their journey; and that may as well be expreſſed in the words of <hi>one</hi> Evangeliſt as the <hi>other.</hi> In St. <hi>Matthew</hi> it is, <hi>Do not get any gold or ſilver or braſs in your purſes, nor any ſatchel for your journey, nor any ſtaff, for the workman is worthy of his food.</hi> The plain meaning of this is, that <hi>God</hi> would take care of thoſe things which were neceſſary for the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and therefore that they were immediately to ſet upon their Journey without making any preparation for it, but juſt as they were. If it happened that they <hi>had</hi> a Staff already in their hands, there is no command given them to <hi>throw</hi> it away; but if they had never a one, they ave forbidden to <hi>get</hi> any, or to furniſh themſelves with any thing that they <hi>then</hi> had not. And this, as to the ſenſe, is not contrary to what is here ſaid in S. <hi>Mark; He commanded them that they ſhould take nothing for their journey, ſave a ſtaff only, no ſatchel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> to begin their Journey juſt as they were when he ſpake to them, with a ſtaff only, which ſome of them perhaps already had, without getting any thing that they wanted. If the words of both the Evangeliſts were to be expreſſed together in a Paraphraſe, they might moſt fitly be explained thus: <hi>Go immediately and preach the Goſpel, provide no money, nor clothes, nor victuals for your Journey. Thoſe that have ſtaves let them travel only with them; and thoſe that have none let them not get any, but enter upon their Journey without. They whom you preach the Goſpel to, God ſo ordering it, will furniſh you with all neceſſaries.</hi>

I expreſs it therefore thus:
<q>12. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> anſwered them, it was requiſite indeed that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhould firſt come, and call all the <hi>Jews</hi> to their duty, that they might entertain the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was ſuddenly to come amongſt them, in a fit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; nor was this Prophecy contrary to thoſe by which it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be ill treated by the <hi>Jews</hi>: 13. For <hi>Elias</hi> alſo was already come, who was <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, intended for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reaſons by that name, and had gone about to call the <hi>Jews</hi> to Repentance, that they might be ſo diſpoſed as perſons ought to be who were to receive the <hi>Meſſias</hi>; but the <hi>Jews</hi> had refuſed to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to that holy man, yea and had killed him.</q>
The words of the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> muſt be rendered thus: 12. <hi>And he anſwering, ſaid unto them, Elias indeed muſt firſt come and reſtore all things. But how (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>For the better underſtanding of theſe words there are theſe three things to be obſerved: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Apoſtles underſtood the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the event, whence they inferred that it was impoſſible that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be killed by the <hi>Jews</hi>; becauſe he was not to enter upon his Reign till a great Reformation had been made among the People of the

                  <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Elias.</hi> But <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s anſwer, which is grounded upon matter of fact, ſhews that this ought to be underſtood of the deſign of <hi>John's</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what it would have effected if the <hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>hearkened</hi> to it, and not of what really came to paſs.

But I have ſeveral Obſervations to make both with relation to this matter, and to what Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſays in this Note.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> does ill confound the time of Wheat and Barly Harveſt among the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> which fell out in <hi>divers</hi> Months. See my Notes upon <hi>Gen.</hi> xxx.14.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I wonder that the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſhould ſpeak of the <hi>Fruit of Trees</hi> in <hi>Judaea</hi> without any diſtinction; whereas it is certain that all ſort of Fruits do no more come to their full growth at the ſame time in <hi>that</hi> Country than in <hi>other</hi> places: They have their Summer and Autumn Fruits in <hi>Judaea</hi> as well as elſewhere. Nor does it appear by the Paſſage cited out of <hi>Philo,</hi> that the Fruits of Trees were gathered at the ſame time with the <hi>Corn,</hi> as our <hi>Author</hi> ſays. but only that if the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99486:69"/>
Statue of <hi>Caius</hi> was ſet up in the Temple, it was to be feared that the <hi>Jews</hi> would deſtroy the ripe Corn: and then he adds that care was alſo to be taken for the gathering in of the Fruits, which the Country that was planted with Trees brought forth; which may be underſtood not only of the Fruits that were ripe at <hi>that</hi> time, but alſo of thoſe that were of a <hi>later</hi> growth, and which could not have been gathered if the Trees were deſtroyed before they came to perfection.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I ſhould not doubt but that the Interpretation given by the <hi>Doctor</hi> of this place were true, if he had but produced any Example to ſhew that the <hi>Greek</hi> Phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> muſt not be confounded; for tho the latter do indifferently ſignify any time whatſoever, yet the former is taken only for <hi>a particular juncture of time,</hi> and for <hi>opportunity,</hi> and is therefore capable indeed of being uſed to ſignify ſet ſeaſons in the year, but not ſimply a <hi>year.</hi> Tho this it may be might be obſerved in favor of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Note</hi> a. THere are ſome things in this <hi>laſt</hi> Note that may lead the Reader into a miſtake, which I ſhall therefore briefly confute.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If <hi>Nard</hi> were a dry Ointment, yet it might as eaſily be contained in a Marble or Alabaſter Box as if it were liquid. Do not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>dry Ointments</hi> uſe to be put in ſuch ſort of Veſſels for the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them? This every body knows that has but once been in an Apothecary's Shop.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Nard</hi> is not always liquid. There was a liquider and a thicker ſort of it, as <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> informs us, <hi>Mat. Med.</hi> lib. 1. <hi>cap.</hi> lxxv. where having deſcribed the manner of making this Ointment, he ſays; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>it is liquid, and not thick like dregs unleſs it have gum in it.</hi> Now nothing hinders but that the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which St. <hi>Mark</hi> here ſpeaks of might have gum mixed with it, and ſo be a <hi>thicker</hi> ſort of Nard, which might eaſily alſo be if it had been a great while kept.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Our <hi>Author</hi> deſcribes a ſort of Nard unknown to all Antiquity, who never reckoned Nard among the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. None of the Antients, and perhaps no one Modern Author beſides Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> ever ſpake thus, who ſeems to have confounded <hi>Nard</hi> with <hi>Myrrh.</hi> Nard is an <hi>Herb</hi> of an indifferent bigneſs, as <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> lib. i. <hi>cap.</hi> vi, and viii. and <hi>Pliny</hi> lib. 12. <hi>cap.</hi> xii. tell us. The words of <hi>Pliny</hi> are theſe: <hi>De folio Nardi plura dici par eſt, ut principali in unguentis. Frutex eſt gravi &amp; craſſa radice, ſed brevi ac nigra fragilique—folio parvo, den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoque, Cacumina in ariſtas ſe ſpargunt; ideo gemina dote, Nardi ſpicas ac folia celebrant. Of the leaf of the Herb Nard more ought to be ſaid, as that which has the principal place in Ointments. It is a Plant that has a thick and heavy Root, but a ſhort black and brittle one—its Leaf is ſmall and thick, the top of it is bearded; Nard therefore is famous both for the virtue of its ſpikes and leaves.</hi> So he deſcribes the <hi>Indian</hi> Nard, and having mentioned other kinds of it, adds; <hi>Sunt autem omnia herbae, praeter Indicam; they are all Herbs, except that which comes from</hi> India. Of theſe leaves, or the ſpikes bruiſed together and mixed with Oil and other Spices, the Ointment of Nard was made, and not of any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor which is diſtilled from them. This appears alſo from <hi>Dioſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> lib. 1. <hi>cap.</hi> lxxv. and from <hi>Pliny</hi> lib. 13. <hi>cap.</hi> i. Our <hi>Author</hi> ſeems again to have confounded <hi>Nard</hi> with <hi>Myrrh,</hi> which makes an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it ſelf without Oil, as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us. He confounds alſo the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99486:71"/>
word <hi>Nard,</hi> as that ſignifies either the <hi>Plant</hi> before deſcribed, or the <hi>Ointment</hi> which is made of it; for the Plant indeed is called <hi>ſpicata Nardus,</hi> becauſe of its ſpiked leaves, but not the <hi>Ointment</hi> which was called <hi>unguentum ſpicatum,</hi> or <hi>unguentum Nardi ſpicatae,</hi> not <hi>Nardus ſpicata,</hi> viz. becauſe the <hi>ſpike</hi> was the principal Ingredient in that Ointment, which Name was given to <hi>Nard</hi> by way of eminence. See <hi>Salmaſius</hi> upon <hi>Solinus,</hi> p. 750. <hi>Ed. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltraj.</hi> about this matter.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Phraſe <hi>pura Nardus, pure Nard,</hi> in <hi>Tibullus</hi> does not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, as the <hi>Doctor</hi> thinks, Ointment made <hi>only</hi> of Nard, or the juice of Nard, but that which was called <hi>Ointment of Nard,</hi> in which beſides other Spices there was <hi>pure Nard,</hi> i. e. not adulterated, as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was, as <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> tell us. And this Ointment it is that St. <hi>Mark</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>Nard faithfully made</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</hi> ſuch as had <hi>true unſophiſticated Nard</hi> in it, which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its being <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>of great price. Pliny</hi> lib. 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Pretium ſpicae in libras</hi> x. c. <hi>Folii diviſere annonam, ab amplitudine hadroſphaerium vocatur, majoribus foliis,</hi> x.xxx. &amp;c. <hi>The price of Nard is</hi> x.c. <hi>a pound. The difference in the bigneſs of the Leaves made a difference in the price; that which had the biggeſt Leaves was called</hi> Hadroſphaerium, <hi>and the price of it was</hi> x.xxx.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The <hi>Ointment</hi> of Nard cannot be called <hi>Nardus ſpicata,</hi> but the <hi>Plant</hi> only, and therefore <hi>Grotius</hi> is miſtaken when he ſays that <gap reason="foreign">

And thoſe that endeavour to put any other ſenſe upon that Phraſe here, ſtrain it. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s two firſt Reaſons for another Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have confuted already in a Note upon the parallel place in St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> The third, together with the reſt, are, I ſuppoſe, taken out of <hi>Baronius,</hi> and relie upon a nauſeous Fable which is related in the following words by <hi>Suidas,</hi> whom, if our <hi>Author</hi> had but look'd
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99486:72"/>
into, I believe he would never have made uſe of this Teſtimony. Thus <hi>Suidas</hi> tells the ſtory in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, out of ſome unknown Fable-maker, as he uſed to do. <gap reason="foreign">

Suidas</hi> does not give the leaſt intimation that he thought this ſilly Fable to be true; he only tells it, as he does many others, as he had read it. And therefore the Conſequences that the <hi>Doctor</hi> draws from his Authority and Learning are inſignificant. Nay, tho <hi>Suidas</hi> had ſaid that he believed this Fable, yet it would be much more likely that he had either forgot this Paſſage in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> or that it did not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mind, than that he thought the Phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

I have mentioned.

               <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>Note</hi> b. I. OF this paſſage in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the learned <hi>Jac. Perizonius</hi> has treated in a particular Diſcourſe by it ſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has confuted Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and others opinion at large, and, if I am not miſtaken, ſolidly. He affirms that St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s words in the 2 <hi>verſe</hi> ought to be rendred thus: <hi>haec deſcriptio ante facta eſt, quam praeeſſet Syriae Quirinus, this enrolling was made before Quirinus was Governour of Syria</hi>; and having examined his reaſons, I freely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to them, and refer the Reader to the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Our Author has committed a great miſtake in his paraphraſe upon the 2 <hi>verſe,</hi> where he tells us that at that time, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the reign of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, <hi>Palaeſtine was under Syria</hi>; whereas it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the King of <hi>Judaea</hi> had no dependence upon the Proconſul of <hi>Syria,</hi> and that <hi>Judaea</hi> was not <hi>a province,</hi> at that time. This appears evidently from <hi>Joſephus</hi> Antiq. Jud. <hi>Lib.</hi> xviii. c. 1. where he tells us that <hi>Judaea</hi> was not made a Province till after <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s baniſhment. But perhaps our Learned Author fell into the ſame Miſtake with <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who ſays that <hi>Joſephus</hi> made mention of the ſame regiſtring which St. <hi>Luke</hi> here ſpeaks of, becauſe he affirmed it to have been made by <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi> whoſe name is mentioned by St. <hi>Luke</hi>; for which miſtake never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,

he has long ſince been corrected by learned Men. The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which <hi>Euſebius</hi> refers to in <hi>Joſephus</hi> is at the end of his ſeventeenth book of <hi>Antiq.</hi> in theſe words: <gap reason="foreign">

Grotius</hi> thinks, that as we ought not to be ſuperſtitious in ſearching for Allegories in every part of a Parable; ſo neither ought we to overlook them when they are ſuggeſted by the agreement of what is ſaid in Parables, with other places of Scripture. And therefore if we believe him, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Robe,</hi> here ſignifies that conſtant innocency of Life, which by God's Grace, a Perſon who has receiv'd ſo much mercy from him, is enabled to perſevere in. And for this he refers us to <hi>Rev.</hi> vi.11. &amp; vii 13, 14. &amp; xix.8. Now I do not indeed deny, but that a white Robe is taken ſometimes for an Emblem of Innocence; but I ſay that there is nothing ſaid of that here; and that the beſtowing of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Robe, ſignifies the Father's Joy for the return of his Son: ſo that we are not to conſider the Robe in it ſelf, but only the Father's Affection in giving it. He tells us alſo, as the Antients have done before him, that by the <hi>Ring</hi> we are to underſtand the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>by which we are ſealed,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i.21. But this part of the Parable likewiſe is only a farther deſcription of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Joy for the ſafe return of his prodigal Son, whom he thought to have been loſt, and mourned upon that account. And to repreſent this Joy to us, <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes uſe of Similitudes taken from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived cuſtom; for at that time a Superior could not confer a greater Honour upon his Inferior, than by beſtowing a <hi>Ring</hi> and a <hi>Robe</hi> upon him. Of which we have an Example in <hi>Gen.</hi> xli.42. See my Notes on the place. The beſt way therefore had been to look only to the main ſcope of the Parable, which is ſufficiently plain, and not to inſiſt upon the ſignificancy of every particular word: For whatſoever may be ſaid of that kind, tho not altogether frivolous, is certainly beſides <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s deſign; and has no other foundation than the ingenious fancy of the Interpreter. But that learned Expoſitor had put almoſt all the principal Obſervations which he had to make upon the three firſt Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, in his Notes upon St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and therefore he could not be large upon the two following; and ſometimes, that he might not be wholly ſilent, he was forced to ſay a great many far-fetch'd things, and now and then intermix Allegories in his Annotations. Tho I would not have this taken as an Argument that I have the leaſt undervaluing thought of that incomparable Man.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <p>SOME who have joined the ſtudy of the Heathen Philoſophy, with the Profeſſion of the Jewiſh or Chriſtian Religion, have took upon them to teach a great many things concerning the Divine REASON, LIFE and LIGHT, and the ONLY BEGOTTEN Son of God, which they have inculcated upon their Diſciples as points of Faith of the greateſt moment. And becauſe what they have aſſerted is neither all true, nor all falſe, that we may know what we are to reject, and what we are to admit of, I ſhall in few words ſet down that which is agreeable to the Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt, before I enter upon his Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Verſe 1. <hi>In the beginning was</hi> REASON, <hi>and that</hi> REASON <hi>was with</hi> GOD, <hi>and</hi> GOD <hi>was that</hi> REASON.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is true, before the Creation of the World, there was REASON, for REASON was then in GOD, yea GOD himſelf, ſince God cannot be without REASON.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſame was in the beginning with</hi> GOD.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There was, I ſay, REASON in GOD, before the World was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>All things were made by it, and without it was not any thing made that was made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For every thing in the World was made with the higheſt REASON; nor can any one thing be inſtanced in, that was created without REASON.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In it was</hi> LIFE, <hi>and this</hi> LIFE <hi>was the</hi> LIGHT <hi>of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Heretofore was lodged only in this REASON, a full and complete knowledg of the way that leads to Eternal LIFE; and this Knowledg want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to be communicated to Men, to be a ſufficient LIGHT to guide them in their purſuit after that LIFE.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:99486:93"/>5. <hi>And the</hi> LIGHT <hi>ſhineth in darkneſs, and the darkneſs comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. And now that LIGHT has been brought down upon Earth, amongſt Men, and has ſhined for many years paſt upon the way that leads to LIFE; but the greateſt part of Mankind chuſe rather to wander in the darkneſs of Ignorance than to make uſe of that LIGHT.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>There was a Man ſent by God, his name</hi> was <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>The ſame came for a Witneſs, to bear witneſs of the</hi> LIGHT, <hi>that all Men through him might believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6, 7. <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Zacharias</hi> was ſent by God to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſhew them in whom that LIGHT reſided, and by bearing witneſs to him openly, to induce them to believe on him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>He was not the LIGHT, but</hi> was ſent <hi>to bear witneſs of the LIGHT.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. But <hi>John</hi> had not this LIGHT in himſelf, nor was it the end of his Coming, to make Men partakers of that LIGHT; but only by his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to procure Credit and Authority to him who had that LIGHT a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>That</hi> LIGHT <hi>was the true</hi> LIGHT, <hi>which came into the World, and lightneth every Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. In that Man, and no other reſided this LIGHT, which in the moſt excellent Senſe deſerves only to be ſo called, and which now ſhines among Men; ſo that every one who will but follow this Light may be ſure of being brought to eternal LIFE.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>REASON was in the World, and the World was made by it, but the World knew it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. And he in whom that LIGHT was, converſed for ſome time among Men; but they notwithſtanding their having been created by the Divine REASON which dwelt in that Man, did not diſtinguiſh him from falſe Teachers.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>It came to its own, but its own received it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Nay he lived amongſt thoſe who alone were called the People and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and yet they did not know the Doctrin of their God.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>But to as many as received it, it gave power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on its Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. But all that embraced his Divine Revelations, were thereupon made God's People, and taken, tho they were not <hi>Jews,</hi> into the number of his Children.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>Who were born not of Blood, nor of the will of the Fleſh, nor of the will of Man, but of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Tho they were neither Jews by Birth, nor by Marriages, nor Proſelytes, yet God was pleaſed freely to honour them with that Title.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>And that</hi> REASON <hi>was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us, (we beheld its Glory, the glory as of the</hi> ONLY BEGOTTEN <hi>of the Father) full of Grace and Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:99486:93"/>14. That REASON which I before ſpake of, and aſſerted to have been with GOD from the beginning, yea to have been GOD himſelf, and in which was LIFE and the LIGHT of Men, did not always, as I ſaid, conceal it ſelf from us; but by the Man in whom it was, became conſpicuous, and dwelt for ſome time among us. (We ſaw the majeſty of the Divine REASON which was never before beheld, diſcovering it ſelf in that Man, as it became him who is the SON of God, not in that manner that we are, but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner peculiar and proper to himſelf alone.) That Eternal REASON made it ſelf viſible and manifeſt to us in him, and ſhewed it ſelf Merciful and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to us.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. John <hi>bare witneſs of him, and cried, ſaying: This was he of whom I ſpake, He that is to come after me, is preferred before me, becauſe he was before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. <hi>John</hi> bare witneſs concerning this Man openly, and declared him to be the Perſon whom he had deſcribed in theſe words: He that is to come after me, ſhall be greater than I.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>And of his Fulneſs have we all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. From that Knowledg wherewith the divine REASON hath MOST FULLY enlightned that Man, all the Knowledg that every one of us have, is derived; and by him we are aſſured that the Mercy and Goodneſs of God to us is ſuch, as that for all the GRACE and Favour which he reſolved to ſhew us, and thoſe great Benefits which flow from his Love towards us, he requires nothing in return but a GRATEFUL Mind.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>For the Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. For whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> publiſhed Laws, in which he impoſed moſt grievous and burdenſom Rites upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> and threatned with Death thoſe who did not punctually obſerve them; Jeſus who is the true CHRIST, and in whom the Divine REASON reſides, came to aſſure us of the Goodneſs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in pardoning all our paſt Sins, and eaſing us of that intolerable Moſaical Yoke.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>No Man hath ſeen God at any time; the</hi> ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, <hi>which is in the boſom of the Father, has been his Interpreter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. Before, that Will or Purpoſe of God was not fully uuderſtood by any but he of whom I ſpake; the ONLY BEGOTTEN SON of GOD, who was ſingularly and peculiarly beloved by his Father, was ſent by God to declare it to us.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE I come to enquire ſeverally into the ſenſe of the words here made uſe of by the Evangeliſt, I muſt endeavour to aſcertain ſome things on which the Interpretation I ſhall afterwards give of them, will in a great meaſure depend. As <hi>firſt,</hi> I ſhall examin whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Goſpel (as I my ſelf think it is, and all the Antients uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally almoſt affirm) be juſtly attributed to the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> there
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99486:94"/>
being ſome in our Age, who, treading in the ſteps of the antient <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logi,</hi> a ſort of <hi>Hereticks</hi> ſo called, and deſcribed by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ.</hi> 51. endeavour to bring that opinion into queſtion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall enquire into the time when it was written. And, <hi>lastly,</hi> where St. <hi>John</hi> writ it; and what was the occaſion and deſign of his beginning his Goſpel in this manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtle <hi>JOHN</hi> was the Writer of this Goſpel, the Antients do univerſally, as I ſaid, affirm, whoſe Teſtimony in a matter of this nature cannot by any one be rendered invalid, unleſs he can plainly make it appear, that the Antients were all miſtaken, and ſhew us at the ſame time the occaſion and original of their miſtake. For to juſtify our diſſent from the moſt antient Chriſtian Writers, who ſaw the Diſciples of St. <hi>John,</hi> and teſtify that they heard this affirmed by them; and to charge the Chriſtian Churches of that Age with Error, who read this Goſpel as the genuin product of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>; it is not ſufficient to propoſe ſome ſlight conjectures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſhew a <hi>Metaphyſical poſſibility,</hi> if I may ſo ſpeak, of their erring. But to make it credible that they were all really miſtaken, and that ſo ſoon after St. <hi>John</hi>'s death, there muſt be thoſe evident proofs given of their miſtake, as none of the weighty reaſons I ſhall hereafter alledg can be thought ſufficient to cope with: For it is abſurd, againſt moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Arguments, and ſuch as in another caſe we ſhould acquieſce in, to object bare ſuſpicions or conjectures which have not the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of likelihood in them, and prefer theſe to the former, merely becauſe the opinion which we have eſpouſed, and are reſolved to maintain, makes it neceſſary for us to think that thoſe conjectures are of great weight. It is juſt as if one that was accuſed of writing bad Latin, upon comparing and examining it with <hi>Livy</hi>'s, who was certainly a very clean Writer, ſhould therefore begin to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Hiſtory, which goes under <hi>Livy</hi>'s name, and which all the Antients with one conſent attribute to him, were really his; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſome very ſlight conjectures againſt it, ſhould think he had rendered the Authority of that Hiſtory queſtionable; and becauſe it might poſſibly have been written by ſome other, pretend that no body ought to produce any teſtimony out of it ever after. And yet this they do, who, as I underſtand, go about to rob the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> of that Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which has always been reckoned his; as I ſhall briefly ſhew, by producing ſome of the moſt antient Teſtimonies to that purpoſe; which are well enough known already to learned Men; but it may be not ſo well to thoſe for whoſe ſake I now write, who ſeldom ſpend much time in reading the Writings of the Antients.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:99486:94"/>The firſt Teſtimony I ſhall mention, and the moſt antient of all, is at the end of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel it ſelf. <hi>Chap.</hi> xxi.24. where, after a Prediction delivered by <hi>Christ</hi> concerning the great Age that St. <hi>John</hi> ſhould live to, it is immediately added; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. THIS <hi>is the Diſciple which teſtifieth of theſe things, and wrote theſe things, and we</hi> KNOW <hi>that his Teſtimony is true.</hi> We may read what <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays in his Notes on <hi>Chap.</hi> xx.29. and <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> on this place it ſelf. Where thoſe great men have ſhewn that this is the Teſtimony of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi>; whereby it appears that from the very firſt, this Goſpel was thought to be the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s, even by thoſe who lived and converſed with him; which is a certain evidence of its being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, becauſe this Teſtimony was given by Perſons who lived at the time when it was written, and might certainly know who was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. Nor let any one ſay that this Teſtimony, or this whole Chapter was an addition put in by ſome other a conſiderable time afterwards, for it is read in all the Copies, and all Interpreters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it.</p>
                  <p>Another proof of this may be taken out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who when a Child might perhaps have ſeen St. <hi>John</hi> himſelf. And he in that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, which is commonly called his <hi>ſecond,</hi> and which he preſented to <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> in the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 140. where he deſcribes the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Aſſemblies of the Chriſtians, ſays, that in them were read <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, for the ſame reaſon, rejecting the Authority of all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, denied St. <hi>John</hi> to be the Author of this Goſpel. It were to be wiſhed that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had given us their right name inſtead of catching at the ambiguity of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to ſhew his wit. But whoever they were, it is certain they were ignorant Criticks, who for the ſake of a preconceived opinion, affirmed this Goſpel to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious, which they would have owned to be genuin, if it had not contradicted that opinion. But to paſs this by, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> obſerves that they appeared after the <hi>Cataphryges, Quintilians</hi> and <hi>Quartadeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> i. e. about the end of the ſecond Century, or the beginning of the third. Nor are they any where mentioned by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who ſpends a great many words in praiſe of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Writings, and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have taken notice of them, if there had been any ſuch perſons in his time.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſince they began ſo late to oppoſe the Authority of this Goſpel, which before was univerſally owned and received, they ought to have given very clear proofs of its being ſuppoſititious, which yet they neither did nor were able to do. For whereas they ſay in the firſt place, that St. <hi>John</hi> writ in a ſingular method; this is plainly nothing to the purpoſe: for why might not St. <hi>John</hi> uſe a different way of writing from the reſt of the <hi>Evangeliſts?</hi> But there are a great many puzling difficulties, they tell us, in his account of the laſt years of Chriſt's Life. But this is not peculiar to St. <hi>John,</hi> for there are great difficulties alſo in St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Chronology, as every one knows; nor can it be denied, that the ſacred Hiſtorians had general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very little regard to the order of time, in their relation of the Life and Diſcourſes of <hi>Christ.</hi> But that is no Argument that all their Writings are ſuppoſititious. The Evangeliſts, it is plain, did not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99486:96"/>
deſign to make a Chronology, or an exact Hiſtory of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Life, but only to record his principal Diſcourſes, and the main Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Life, and ſome of his Miracles. But this pretence is confuted by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who has ſhewn that thoſe times of <hi>Christ</hi> may be eaſily digeſted by an attentive Reader; and his Animadverſions are excellently illuſtrated by <hi>Petavius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there are ſome, I underſtand, who object alſo againſt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion commonly received about the Writer of this Goſpel, That the Diſcourſes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which are recorded in it, are many times more <hi>intricate</hi> and <hi>obſcure,</hi> than thoſe which are related in the <hi>other</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, nor ſo often intermixed with <hi>Parables.</hi> But doubtleſs all Chriſt's Diſcourſes, for three years together or thereabouts, were not of the <hi>ſame</hi> ſort, but ſome were plainer, and others more obſcure: and when the cleareſt of them, and moſt of his Parables had been already related by the <hi>other Evangeliſts,</hi> it is no wonder that St. <hi>John</hi> ſhould not have ſo many Parables as <hi>they</hi>; or that the Diſcourſes which he relates as ſpoken by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> have ſometimes more obſcurity in them than thoſe which <hi>they</hi> have recorded. Beſides, the Holy Ghoſt, by whom the Writers of the Goſpels were inſpired, that they might not ſay any thing that was not agreable to Truth, did not alter any thing peculiar to each in their way of ſpeaking or writing, but left them to uſe their <hi>own ſtile</hi> in relating the principal heads of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſcourſes; and poſſibly St. <hi>John</hi>'s ſtile might be more intricate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times than ordinary, which is alſo diſcernible in his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> There is no body but has obſerved that St. <hi>Luke</hi> writes the pureſt Greek, and that there are more Latiniſms to be found in <hi>that</hi> Evangeliſt, than in any of the reſt. And ſo St. <hi>John</hi> likewiſe has his Peculiarities, as Interpreters, and among the reſt <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> have obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Theſe being the only Arguments that can be alledged to prove this Goſpel to be ſuppoſititious; and thoſe being very ſlight and frivolous, or rather none at all, it is no wonder that the <hi>Alogi</hi> of old had no followers: and I dare ſay, whoever ſhall revive their Hereſy, and have no better grounds for it than they had, will meet with as few; If they will but lay aſide their preconceived opinions, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſometime to the ſtudy of Criticks, they will be aſhamed of their own raſhneſs. When the <hi>Alogi</hi> were asked who it was that wrote this Goſpel, if it was not St. <hi>John,</hi> they anſwered <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it was univerſally reckoned that <hi>Cerinthus</hi>'s Opinion was directly oppoſite to this Goſpel: and the ſame is pretended now by thoſe who follow the <hi>Alogi.</hi> But their making ſuch an abſurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99486:96"/>
manifeſtly ſhews what excellent Criticks the Antients and we have to deal with: For it's moſt certain that <hi>Cerinthus</hi>'s error was oppoſed by St. <hi>John,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew on <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. And then can any one be induced to believe, that any thing which was written by ſo deteſted a Perſon as <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> could be ſo obtruded upon the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of St. <hi>John,</hi> and all the Orthodox, as to be unanimouſly received by all the Chriſtian World for Genuin, not long after St. <hi>John</hi>'s Death? Who will believe that all the Antients were ſo blind as to think an opinion was confuted in a Book that aſſerted it? Theſe things are abſolutely incredible; nor would they have ſeemed leſs ſo to the <hi>Alogi</hi> of old, or now to their followers, than to us, if they had been able then, or could at preſent ſhew that the beginning of this Goſpel does not contradict the opinion of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi>; which becauſe they deſpaired of, they reſolved, contrary to all the Rules of Criticks, to deny this Goſpel to be the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s. But with what ſucceſs may be diſcerned from what I have hitherto ſaid, and it is ſuperfluous to add more.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Antients which ſpeak of the time when St. <hi>John</hi> wrote his Goſpel do agree, that it was not written before his departure into the Iſland of <hi>Patmos</hi>; but ſome ſay that it was dictated in that <hi>Iſland,</hi> and publiſhed at <hi>Epheſus</hi>; and others that it was written in that <hi>City</hi> after the Apoſtles return. Now St. <hi>John</hi> was ſent into the Iſle of <hi>Patmos</hi> in the year of Chriſt 94. and thence he returned to <hi>Epheſus</hi> in the year 96. as appears from St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in <hi>Catal.

                  <p n="3">III. By theſe Teſtimonies it appears that St. <hi>John</hi> either wrote or publiſhed his Goſpel at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> alſo expreſly affirms, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. c. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>If it be enquired on what occaſion, and to what end St. <hi>John</hi> began his Goſpel, ſo as we ſee he does? <hi>Irenaeus</hi> anſwers in theſe words, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11. after he had ſpoken of the other Evangeliſts: <hi>St.</hi> John <hi>the Diſciple of our Lord, deſigning to extirpate that error which had been ſowed</hi> (in mens Minds) <hi>by</hi> Cerinthus, <hi>and a great while before by thoſe that are called</hi> Nicolaitans, <hi>who are a branch of that Hereſy, which is falſly called Knowledg,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> from whence they had the name of <hi>Gnoſticks) that he might confound them, and perſwade them, that there is one God who made all things by his Word,</hi> &amp;c. So that St. <hi>John,</hi> if we believe <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> began his Goſpel ſo as he did, on purpoſe to refute the Doctrin of <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> as he declares afterwards more at large. <hi>Euſebius</hi> in Hiſt. Eccleſ. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 24. affirms, that the intention of St. <hi>John</hi> was to fill up what was wanting in the relation of the <hi>other Evangeliſts:</hi> In his room I ſhall ſubſtitute St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who in <hi>Catal. Script. Eccleſ.</hi> has theſe words: <hi>Noviſſimus omnium ſcripſit Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, rogatus ab Aſiae Epiſcopis, adverſus Cerinthum, alióſque Haereticos, &amp; maxime tunc Ebionitarum dogma conſurgens, qui aſſerunt Chriſtum ante Mariam non fuiſſe; unde &amp; compulſus eſt divinam ejus nativitatem ediſſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. Sed &amp; aliam cauſam hujus ſcripturae ferunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He wrote his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel laſt of all, at the deſire of the Biſhops of</hi> Aſia, <hi>againſt</hi> Cerinthus <hi>and other Hereticks, and the Hereſy of the</hi> Ebionites <hi>which began to prevail ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly at that time, who aſſerted that Chriſt was not before the Virgin</hi> Mary; <hi>upon which account alſo he was forced to declare his Divine Birth. But there is another reaſon likewiſe given of this writing,</hi> which is the ſame I have alledged out of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and is not to our purpoſe. The ſame Author in <hi>Proaem. ad Matthaeum,</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>Joannes Apoſtolus &amp; Evangeliſta — cum eſſet in</hi> Aſia, <hi>&amp;c. St.</hi> John <hi>the Apoſtle and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt — being in</hi> Aſia, <hi>and the Hereſies of</hi> Cerinthus, Ebion, <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who denied that Chriſt was come in the Fleſh, and whom he alſo in his Epiſtle calls Antichriſts, ſpringing up at that very time — he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled almoſt by all the then Biſhops of</hi> Aſia, <hi>and the Meſſages of many
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99486:97"/>
Churches, to write concerning our Saviour's Divinity more particularly — Whence it is alſo related in Church-Hiſtory, that being urged by his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to write, he promiſed that he would, provided they would all keep a faſt and implore the aſſiſtance of God on his behalf, which being accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and immediately dictated as from Heaven that</hi> Proemium: <hi>In the beginning,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Altho all theſe Authors had been ſilent, we might eaſily enough have drawn a conjecture from the thing it ſelf: for celebrated Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Sects of Hereticks, having introduced ſeveral <hi>Platonick</hi> terms into the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Religion, before St. <hi>John</hi> wrote; and the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> being the firſt Chriſtian Writer that uſed thoſe terms in a peculiar Senſe, in the beginning of his Goſpel; it may be eaſily conjectured that he alluded to the Doctrin of thoſe Men, and that it was his deſign to teach Chriſtians in what ſenſe thoſe terms might be made uſe of. If the Writings of thoſe antient Hereticks were now extant, they would be a great help doubtleſs to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this matter; but ſince they are loſt, we can only make uſe of their fragments which are extant in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the moſt antient Writer that has related their Opinions. There are extant alſo ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Books of the famous <hi>Philo Alexandrinus,</hi> who was contemporary with the Apoſtles, and if we believe ſome of the Antients, familiar with them; where the ſame terms are ſo often uſed, that I am apt to think St. <hi>John</hi> has as great a reſpect to him as the forementioned He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. It is certain that all his Writings were publiſhed a long while before ever St. <hi>John</hi> wrote; and his eloquence is ſuch, that he was juſtly had in admiration by all who lived in his time, and is ſtill read by learned Men with great delight. What high Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Joſephus, Juſtin Martyr, Euſebius,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and others give him, I need not ſay.</p>
                  <p>So celebrated a Writer therefore could not be unknown to the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> who dwelt ſo long at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in the very <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>Aſia.</hi> That he had been carefully read by the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the great <hi>Grotius</hi> has obſerved. And therefore being often read by the Chriſtians, and having a great many things in him of a near affinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Chriſtian Tenets, it was poſſible that many who were taken with his Eloquence, might imitate him, and mix his Opinions before they were aware with Chriſtianity. To prevent which St. <hi>John</hi> in the beginning of his Goſpel, made uſe of thoſe terms which were moſt likely to impoſe on the unwary, that the Chriſtians might underſtand in what ſenſe they might be uſed: and how probable this is, will, by comparing the words of the Apoſtle with thoſe of <hi>Philo,</hi> ſufficiently appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:99486:98"/>But before I come to that, I ſhall endeavour to ſtrengthen this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, by producing ſome paſſages out of him parallel to ſeveral ſayings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf and his Apoſtles in this Goſpel: For the more I ſhew to be in <hi>Philo</hi> reſembling the Diſcourſes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Diſciples, the more likely it will be that he was frequently read and delighted in by the Chriſtians of that Age; and accordingly that St. <hi>John</hi> had a reference to him in the beginning of his Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is nothing in Chriſtianity that more offends the <hi>Jews,</hi> than our ſo aſſerting God to be <hi>one,</hi> as yet to make mention of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in whoſe names we are baptized. And there is ſomething ſo like this <hi>Ten<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

That the word <hi>Fleſh</hi> is taken here for human Nature, as conſpicuous, appears by the following words in this, and by the 18<hi>th</hi> verſe.

them. For our Fleſh is therefore conſpicuous, becauſe it is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary property of human nature to be conſpicuous.</p>
                  <p>It is rightly ſaid by Divines, that <hi>Reaſon was made Fleſh,</hi> not by a converſion of the divine Nature into a human, which is as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as for a human to be changed into a divine; but by an unexpreſſible <hi>indwelling</hi> of God, whereby the humanity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> became the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>God,</hi> in a ſingular and extraordinary manner; as on the other hand the <hi>divine</hi> Reaſon was made the Divinity of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret union. From that time <hi>God</hi> might be called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the name of <hi>God</hi> might be attributed to <hi>Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi> And upon the account of this conjunction of two Natures in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Apoſtles ſpeak of him ſometimes as <hi>God,</hi> ſometimes as a <hi>Man</hi>; and do not only aſcribe to Chriſt, what they had ſeen done by the <hi>man Jeſus,</hi> but alſo what the divine Reaſon did before <hi>Jeſus</hi> was born: ſee <hi>Col.</hi> i.14. &amp; <hi>ſeqq.</hi> &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> i.2, 10.</p>

There is an oppoſition made here between the Goſpel and the Law, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the 17<hi>th</hi> verſe. The Moſaical Law appointed Sacrifices for the expiation of ſome ſort of Sins; which if they were wilfully and knowingly neglected, tho it were but once, it denounced death upon the Sinner, whatever his Repentance was afterwards. For other ſins there were no expiatory Sacrifices inſtituted, but they were to be puniſhed with death. Neither did God by virtue of that Covenant promiſe to any one that died for tranſgreſſing the Law, tho never ſo penitent, any mercy in the life to come. And yet theſe were Sins, which by reaſon of the multitude of the Laws were frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; ſo that God diſcovered nothing but his inflexible Juſtice in the Law. It's true, he promiſes Forgiveneſs to the whole Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becoming penitent after the deſtruction of their Commonwealth, in <hi>Levit.</hi> xxvi. and elſewhere. But particular Perſons, as long as the Commonwealth ſtood ſinning in that manner as I have ſaid, had no hopes of pardon. But it is quite otherwiſe under the Goſpel, in which God promiſes pardon to the greateſt Sinner, upon repentance and amendment of life, and that without the intervention of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And in this ſenſe the Goſpel alone is full of the <hi>grace and mercy</hi> of God.</p>

THere are two things which I would have here further obſerved for the underſtanding of <hi>Mary</hi>'s Petition, and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s anſwer. <hi>One</hi> is, that the words <hi>they have no Wine,</hi> are the expreſſion of <hi>Mary</hi>'s requeſt to her Son to ſupply that defect, as appears by the anſwer which <hi>Chriſt</hi> made her. But how was it that ſhe would have him do that? Undoubtedly not by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing Wine with <hi>Money,</hi> with which ſhe knew <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not abound; but, as Interpreters generally ſuppoſe, by working a <hi>Miracle,</hi> and ſupplying the new married couple with <hi>Wine,</hi> in the ſame manner as <hi>Elijah</hi> of old had ſupplied the widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> with <hi>Oil.</hi> And hence it may be probably inferred that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had done ſome other Miracles before this time: For how could his Mother have deſired him to work a Miracle, if ſhe had never ſeen him do any before? She knew indeed by the revelation of the Angel, that her Son was the <hi>Meſſias</hi>; but ſhe could not from thence conclude that he would work Miracles, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch a one as that, when ſhe pleaſed to deſire it.

when it is ſaid at <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. that <hi>this beginning of Miracles did Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. we muſt underſtand the Evangeliſt to ſpeak of ſuch Miracles as were done <hi>publickly.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would have it obſerved, that the anſwer which <hi>Chriſt</hi> here gave to his Mother, contains nothing in it whereby ſhe might conclude his purpoſe to comply with her Requeſt; nay that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he ſeems to have rejected her Petition. And therefore it may be matter of enquiry, whence ſhe gathered that he intended to fulfil it, and doubtleſs it muſt be from ſome other words of his, which perhaps St. <hi>John</hi> not having heard, has omitted, or ſome ſign he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave her to aſſure her of it, tho her Requeſt was at that time unſeaſonable.</p>

But on the other hand, thoſe that for the moſt part lived agreably to Nature, and were miſled only by ignorance or infirmity, were mightily refreſhed and pleaſed with the light of the Goſpel, and moſt readily entertained it, either becauſe it was agreable to thoſe true notions that they had before, or delivered them from that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and impotency which they would gladly have been freed from if there had been any light to convince them of the Truth, or confirm them in it.

Cauſes: For tho the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt the Commonwealth ſtood, might appeal firſt to the <hi>People,</hi> and then to the <hi>Emperor</hi> in ſuch Cauſes; and accordingly the Magiſtrates, whilſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth ſtood, could not condemn any one, either without the conſent of the People if they were appealed to, or without the Authority of the Emperor, if an Appeal was afterwards made to him; yet it will not follow that what the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays is true. Whilſt the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was in the hands of <hi>more</hi> than one, the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrates no where expected the Suffrage of their <hi>Provincials,</hi> to empower them to condemn or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve; and much leſs did they do ſo, when the ſupreme Authority came to be lodged in the hands of the <hi>Emperors.</hi> Tho the <hi>Jews</hi> were permitted to live according to their own Laws, yet at that time they had no power to ſentence any one to death, as appears from <hi>Chap.</hi> xviii.31. when <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned <hi>Chriſt</hi> becauſe of the importunity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he did it to <hi>gratify</hi> them, when he might have refuſed to do it; and not as our <hi>Author</hi> thought, becauſe he was <hi>obliged</hi> to do ſo, as I have elſewhere already obſerved. The <hi>Proconſuls, Pretors</hi> and <hi>Procurators,</hi> did always with unlimited Authority, by the advice of their Council, <hi>i. e.</hi> a few <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, paſs ſentence upon their Provincials, without ever <hi>conſulting</hi> or convening their Provincials, unleſs they had a particular mind to gratify them. This ſufficiently appears by <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Orations againſt <hi>Verres.</hi> But the <hi>Doctor</hi> objects that <hi>Pilate</hi> asked the Multitude; <hi>What then ſhall I do with Jeſus, who is called Chriſt?</hi> as if he waited for their Suffrages.

The reaſon therefore why <hi>Pilate</hi> asked the multitude this queſtion, was not that he might hear their reſolution or determination, without which he could not have proceeded to paſs Sentence, either of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution or Condemnation; but becauſe he thought they favoured <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and would have reſcued him out of the hands of the chief Men among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had accuſed him out of malice and envy, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> in ſetting down this ſtory tells us.

But <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have his Diſciples to pray to God <hi>in his Name,</hi> i. e. to deſire what they would have granted to them, becauſe they were called, and were the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So the <hi>gathered together in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> are <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Aſſemblies in oppoſition to an Aſſembly of <hi>Jews</hi>; ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> xviii.20. And ſo afterwards, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to be ſent <hi>in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> i. e. as that Spirit which was to be called the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred only on Chriſt's Diſciples.

But there are ſeveral things to be obſerved in relation to what <hi>Grotius</hi> there ſays, which I ſhall briefly ſet down. 1. He produces a paſſage out of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> as in his Epiſtle to the Inhabitants of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which is not in <hi>that</hi> Epiſtle, but in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Trallians.</hi> 2. He makes uſe of an <hi>Interpolator</hi> inſtead of the true <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but in this he ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, becauſe <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s true Epiſtles were not then publiſhed by themſelves. 3. But it is ſtrange that he ſhould alledg that Paſſage as agreeable to the reading of our Copies, both in St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> when if we believe that Interpolator, we ought in St. <hi>John</hi> to read <hi>the third</hi> and not the <hi>ſixth Hour</hi>; and in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> the <hi>ſixth,</hi> not the <hi>third,</hi> juſt contrary to the reading of the Copies: For <hi>his</hi> words in <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Ep. ad Trall.</hi> are theſe: <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>on friday therefore, at the third hour he received ſentence of Death from</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, <hi>the Father ſo permitting it; at the ſixth hour he was crucified; at the ninth he expired.</hi> But St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſays, <gap reason="foreign">

ſay the ſame, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 14. and <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 34. and almoſt in the ſame words; whereby the Author of them appears to have thought that the Hours of Chriſt's Condemnation ought to be ſo diſtributed as to make that in which he received the Sentence of Death to have been the <hi>third</hi> (and not as it is in our Copies of St. <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>ſixth</hi>) and that of his Crucifixion the <hi>ſixth,</hi> and not (as we read it now in St. <hi>Mark</hi>) the <hi>third.</hi> 5. And yet that Great Man infers from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and the <hi>Clementine Conſtitutions,</hi> that we ought not to admit any alteration, <hi>contrary to the Authority of the moſt antient Copies, and of the Metaphraſts.</hi> But not to ſay again, that the contrary ought to have been inferred, I would fain know what <hi>Metaphraſts</hi> he means? <hi>Nonnus</hi> it is certain, who generally goes only by that name, expreſſes himſelf in his Metaphraſis of St. <hi>John,</hi> ſo as that he ſeems to have read in him <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>The third mortal Hour was lengthened out; i. e.</hi> was not yet paſt. And it is plain that if the Hours be thus diſpoſed, and the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have written ſo, there will be no difficulty; and it is highly probable that there was a conſiderable interval of time between <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>'s pronouncing the Sentence and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Crucifixion. For there was a <hi>Croſs</hi> to be provided, which perhaps was not yet got ready; and it would take up ſome time to go to the <hi>place of Execution,</hi> becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not well able to carry his Croſs, and then there muſt be ſome time alſo allowed for their <hi>crucifying</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>It can hardly be doubted but that it was ſo, and therefore if <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not condemned, properly ſpeaking, till a little before the ſixth Hour, as the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſuppoſes, it will be difficult to underſtand how he was crucified in the ſecond quarter of the day. And yet I hardly think that the <hi>Copies</hi> of both the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> are corrupted. It would not indeed be incredible that St. <hi>Mark</hi> was corrected out of St. <hi>John,</hi> or St. <hi>John</hi> out of St. <hi>Mark</hi>; and there are frequent inſtances of ſuch corrections as thoſe; but that this ſeeming contrariety between them is owing to the corrections of ſome Criticks is not credible: and therefore I am apt to think that the ordinary reading is true, but we muſt take another Method to ſolve the difficulty.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Mark</hi> who wrote before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſeems to have reckoned the Hours after the manner of the <hi>Jews:</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> dated their firſt Hour from the riſing of the Sun, and ſo by the third Hour we muſt underſtand the third from that time, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun's
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99486:118"/>
riſing; and accordingly if we ſuppoſe that the Sun (purſuant to our way of computation from Midnight) roſe about ſix a Clock, that which is St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s <hi>third</hi> Hour will be our <hi>ninth.</hi> And the relation which the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> give us of this matter, makes it reaſonable to think that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not crucified ſooner. For early in the Morning he was ſent by the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and accuſed before <hi>Pilate, Mat.</hi> xxvii.1, 2. <hi>Mark</hi> xv.1. <hi>John</hi> xviii.28. Then <hi>Pilate</hi> queſtioned him, and ſent him to <hi>Herod,</hi> and tried to reſcue him out of the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by ordering him only to be ſcourged, and ſuffering him to be mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and at laſt being no longer able to reſiſt the <hi>Jews</hi> importunity, he condemned him. And about the third hour from the riſing of the Sun we will ſuppoſe that he was faſtened to the Croſs; and after he had hanged there three hours, at the ſixth from the Sun's riſing, but the twelfth from Midnight, began that darkneſs mentioned in <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvii.45. which reſted till the ninth (<hi>i. e.</hi> our three in the Afternoon) upon <hi>Judaea.</hi> And then a little after the ninth <hi>Chriſt</hi> expired.</p>
                  <p>But how then is it ſaid by St. <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was condemned about the ſixth Hour? <hi>viz.</hi> according to the cuſtom of the old <hi>Romans</hi> who uſed to reckon the beginning of their <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>artificial</hi> day from Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: of which ſee <hi>A.

                     </gap>; <hi>why they counted the beginning of the day from Midnight?</hi> And this Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was probably followed by St. <hi>John,</hi> who wrote a great while after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

And beſides, the ſenſe of the phraſes <hi>to remit</hi> and <hi>retain Sins,</hi> is ſometimes quite different from that which can belong to them in the buſineſs of the excommunication of an Offender, or the admiſſion of a Penitent. The phraſe <hi>to remit ſin</hi> in the New Teſtament, ſignifies ſometimes to deliver a perſon from the puniſhment inflicted upon him by <hi>God</hi> for his ſins; and if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that ſenſe here, <hi>to retain ſins</hi> will be to inflict or continue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of ſuch puniſhment. Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> ix.2. <hi>Thy ſins are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thee,</hi> is all one as, I deliver thee from thy Palſy, which has been ſent upon thee as a puniſhment for thy ſins, as the following words manifeſtly ſhew, and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> acknowledges; and ſo if we apply the phraſe in this ſenſe to this place, that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> here beſtows upon his Apoſtles, will be a power <hi>of delivering up to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>i. e.</hi> of inflicting diſeaſes upon the impenitent,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99486:119"/>

                  <p>Thus alſo <hi>to bind,</hi> ſignifies ſometimes to inflict diſeaſes, and <hi>to looſe,</hi> to cure them. So <hi>Luke</hi> xiii.12. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaking to the Woman that had been diſeaſed eighteen years, ſays: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>of an upper room where they abode,</hi> and pray'd to God. But the <hi>Doctor</hi> himſelf acknowledges that the Apoſtles were not in the Temple the whole day, but only at the ſtated times of publick Prayer: At other times therefore they were at their own Houſes, in which I do not ſee why there could not be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, into which they might retire in order to pray, or to ſpend their time with their Maſter, or in pious Diſcourſes about him. And therefore this place may be very well underſtood thus; <hi>where they abode</hi> when they were not in the Temple, or hinder'd by other Affairs; where they were for the moſt part when they kept at home.</p>

who were poor men, and <hi>Galileans,</hi> and odious for their Maſter's ſake to the <hi>Jews,</hi> dared to do any thing which others could not in the Temple, in which they might have been taken notice of by the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites.</hi> Our Author therefore ought to have ſhewn that it was the cuſtom of pious Men to retire ſometimes into the more ſecret Chambers of the Temple for their private Devotion, which I cannot tell whether any body can prove; at leaſt I never met with any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep of that cuſtom.</p>

Thirdly,</hi> It was alſo of very great concernment, that thoſe who firſt joined themſelves to the Apoſtles, ſhould not be hypocritical Perſons, that made a ſhew of Piety, when they had none, becauſe the Sins of ſuch Perſons would have diſcredited the Chriſtian Religion it ſelf, among thoſe to whom it had not been yet preached. Eſpecially, if it had been commonly reported, that Men that were ſlothful or covetous had joined themſelves to the Chriſtians; becauſe all that brought a little Mony to the Apoſtles, pretending it to be their whole Eſtate, were maintained at the publick Charge: as this would have been a great Reproach to Chriſtianity, ſo it would have induced a great many lewd People to feign themſelves Chriſtians, that they might abuſe the Churches Liberality, as it frequently, I believe, happened in ſucceeding Ages, when the Poſſeſſions of the Chriſtians were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged: Of which we have a famous Example in one <hi>Peregrinus</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Lucian.</hi>

<q>Who compelled thee to ſell thy Eſtate? Would it not have continued thy own if thou hadſt not ſold it? But thou wert reſolved to ſell it.

the Holy Ghoſt, and feign thy ſelf to have brought the whole Sum, that thou mighteſt be maintained by the publick Liberality; as if thou hadſt left thy ſelf nothing at all, and made thy ſelf as indigent as the pooreſt.</q>

                  <q>The other Interpretations which he was forced to, are yet more extravagant; as when he renders the <hi>eternal Godhead, that which God would always have us to do,</hi> or <hi>his everlaſting Will,</hi> and proves that rendring of it by another place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. ii.9. <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily</hi>; that is, ſays he, <hi>all the Will of God:</hi> (whereas it is moſt certain, that where the <hi>Godhead</hi> is, eſpecially where the <hi>fulneſs,</hi> even <hi>all the fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> is, there muſt be all the Attributes as well as the <hi>Will</hi> of God:) and when he interprets the <hi>eternal Power</hi> to be <hi>the Promiſes which ſhall never fail,</hi> and thinks he has ſufficiently prov'd it, becauſe the ſame Apoſtle calls the Goſpel <hi>the Power of God.</hi> For by this way of Interpretation no Sentence of Scripture can have any certain ſenſe.</q>

Thoſe who refuſe to believe it, ſhall be puniſhed by the Divine Juſtice for their former Sins, which cannot be expiated any otherwiſe than by Faith in the Goſpel; and whereof the greateſt by far is that whereby the Heathens, and even their Philoſophers do diſſemble the knowledg which they have of the true God, and do not conform their Divine Worſhip to it. 19.

For it is not ground enough, that ſuch or ſuch a ſenſe of a word is not foreign to the deſign of any place, nay that it is very agreeable to it, to infer that that is ſometimes the ſignification of that word; ſeeing the ſeries of the diſcourſe will often permit it to be taken in other ſenſes altogether as commodious; and leſs proper words likewiſe are many times made uſe of inſtead of more proper. And therefore before we make uſe of reaſoning to find out the ſignification of any word, the certain uſe of it muſt be otherwiſe known; for elſe it is very eaſy to miſtake. Now to review the Paſſages alledged by our Author: (1.) The words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> iv.19. will very well bear to be underſtood of <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> has obſerved, becauſe there were a great many of the Male Sex, that proſtituted themſelves for the ſake of Gain.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:99486:140"/>
require the ſenſe of <hi>Luſts,</hi> but may eaſily be underſtood like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of <hi>Covetouſneſs.</hi> (3.) The example of <hi>Aſterius</hi> proves nothing at all, becauſe his words may be very well underſtood of a deſire of Riches and Power, yea ought to be ſo. I have not indeed <hi>Alexander Aphrodiſienſis,</hi> nor can I conveniently get him; but I dare lay any wager, we ought to read <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, nor does that word among the Greeks ever ſignify <hi>a voluptuary.</hi> (4.) Tho the <hi>Septuagint</hi> render the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

It is not to be thought that the Greek words made uſe of in the barbarous ſtile of thoſe Interpreters, are always of the ſame latitude with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew; and beſides, there was no neceſſary reaſon for the <hi>Septuagints</hi> tranſlating the Hebrew word in that place of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>he was juſtified,</hi> that is, accounted a juſt Man, not according to ſtrict Juſtice, but the gracious acceptance of God, who judged him to be a good and pious Perſon: Whence it is ſaid in Scripture, that <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was counted,</hi> or <hi>imputed to him for Righteouſneſs</hi>; that is, that Faith was look'd upon as the Act of a good Man, and one that feared God; and therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> was judged by God to be ſuch an one.

               <p>Theſe things, if carefully obſerved, will give great light into this whole Diſputation of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which is otherwiſe hardly intelligible. The <hi>Jews</hi> affirmed, that by the bare obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they interpreted it, a Man was <hi>juſtified in the ſight of God,</hi> that is, accounted juſt by <hi>God,</hi> and accordingly accepted by him, and might expect from him the Reward promiſed to all good Men. And they
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99486:144"/>
thought they could exactly fulfil the Law in all points, and ſo be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as good Men upon that account; meaning by the obſervation of the Law, a Life ſo regulated, that no Charge could by any one be brought againſt them out of the Law, as Tranſgreſſors of any of its Precepts, which had a threatning of Puniſhment annexed to it: And if they lived ſo, they thought the Reward of pious Men was juſtly due to them. This was the Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> againſt which St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſputes, and ſhews that Men are not <hi>juſtified by the Works of the Law,</hi> that is, eſteemed pious by <hi>God</hi>; but <hi>by Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th,</hi> i. e. upon their believing God's Revelations, and for the future obeying them, tho they had not before obſerved the Law, or any of its Ceremonies: To which purpoſe he alledges the Example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who, when uncircumciſed, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted juſt by God, upon believing his Promiſe. And he urges that no Man can juſtly contend with God, becauſe all have heinouſly ſinned, and therefore ſtand in need of God's pardoning Mercy in order to their being accounted juſt: With many other Arguments, of which, as the matter ſhall require, I ſhall afterwards ſpeak.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.] The Doctrin indeed laid down by our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author in the foregoing Annotation, I heartily ſubſcribe to; but I think it is foreign to this place, as depending upon a wrong inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The ſcope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew that there is another kind of Righteouſneſs brought in by Chriſt, which he calls <hi>the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> different from that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from Works, and by which <hi>we are juſtified freely by his Grace,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99486:145"/>
through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
And for the clearer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of that, he adds; <hi>whom God hath ſet forth as an Atonement, through Faith in his Blood</hi>; that is, <q>which <hi>Jeſus</hi> God declares in the Goſpel to be an expiatory Sacrifice, by whoſe Blood the Sins of thoſe who believe on him are expiated:
<hi>To make known his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe of the remiſſion of former Sins under the forbearance of God</hi>; "— To ſhew that thoſe are juſt in his ſight, whoſe paſt Sins he has "remitted, and whoſe Repentance he did not in vain wait for: <hi>At this time, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that is of the Faith of Jeſus</hi>; which at this time only is manifeſt to all: whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God is both a lover of Righteouſneſs, and alſo accounts thoſe juſt who have believed in Chriſt, and heartily obey him.</q>
The whole ſeries of the Diſcourſe does as it were proclaim this to be the ſcope and ſenſe of the Apoſtle; and I wonder that <hi>Grotius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did not ſee it, tho the <hi>Doctor,</hi> who often gives forced Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Places, might eaſily not diſcern it.</p>
               <p>Tho I do not deny that the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God, is often put for his <hi>Goodneſs and Mercy,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> has ſhewn; yet in this diſpute it has another ſignification, as appears from <hi>Chap.</hi> i.17. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 24, and 26 of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> where it is manifeſtly taken for <hi>Goſpel-Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, for ſanctity of Life, conſequent upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And this Righteouſneſs which <hi>God</hi> accepts, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Sacrifice, is not grounded upon <hi>a connivence</hi> or <hi>taking no notice of paſt Sins,</hi> but the <hi>remiſſion</hi> of them. For God accounts thoſe juſt, not whoſe Sins he overlooks or connives at, but thoſe whoſe Sins he has already pardoned, and upon their Repentance takes into his favour, contrary to their deſerts.</p>

This is the ſum of the foregoing Chapter, whence it might be juſtly inferred that <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was not juſtified by Works before <hi>God</hi>; and therefore in that ſenſe could not be ſaid to have <hi>found</hi> or <hi>obtained Grace before God,</hi> but only in the judgment of Men, who cannot judg of things exactly, and to talk of whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this caſe is abſurd.

St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning here therefore is, that the manner of God's Behaviour toward the <hi>Jews,</hi> had rather produced in their Minds a <hi>ſlaviſh</hi> Diſpoſition, than a <hi>filial</hi> one. But wherein did that ſervile Temper conſiſt? This we are told in the following words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:99486:150"/>
Maſters, but hope for very little from them; whereas <hi>Children</hi> hope much from the bounty of their Parents, and fear but little. But what was the reaſon why the Jews <hi>fear</hi> of God was greater than their <hi>hopes? Namely,</hi> becauſe the breach of his Laws, excepting Sins of Infirmity, and ſome of leſs moment, was threatned with Temporal Puniſhments, which were unavoidable whilſt the Jewiſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſtood and flouriſhed, and God had not any where promiſed Mercy to Perſons ſo offending, either in this Life or in the next, or allowed any place for Repentance: Becauſe he had not appointed any Expiatory Sacrifices in the Law for ſpiritual Sins, ſuch as Pride, or Covetouſneſs, or the like, tho he had denounced no Temporal Puniſhments againſt them; whereby it came to paſs, that tho cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, proud, or any other ſuch ſort of Sinners had nothing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from the Magiſtrate, yet they were afraid of being puniſhed by God, who had made no Promiſes ſo much as to the penitent.

               <p>This is what Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ought only to have expreſſed in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe, which may be gathered from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words themſelves, and not arbitrarily have inſerted foreign things into his Diſcourſe.

                  </gap>, when upon previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous notice given of it, we underſtand there is ſome great happineſs to be looked for, and which we impatiently expect, tho perhaps we do not know perfectly what it is. But the <hi>Gentiles</hi> knew <hi>nothing</hi> at all of their vocation to the true Religion upon the Goſpel's being rejected by the <hi>Jews.</hi> Who will believe that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in order to expreſs the Affection of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> plunged in the greateſt ignorance and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and who accordingly could not be ſaid otherwiſe than <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to be in expectation of the Goſpel, would make uſe of a word that has a ſingular <hi>emphaſis</hi> in it? It had been hardly tolerable if he had mollified it as much as poſſible, by adding <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ſome ſuch other form. The phraſes <hi>to ſeek death,</hi> and <hi>to love death,</hi> which ſignify to do thoſe things which ſuch as <hi>ſought</hi> or <hi>loved death</hi> would do, are not here to the purpoſe. For the Heathens did not do what thoſe ought to have done who were in a longing expectation of the Goſpel. The words of <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. are otherwiſe to be underſtood, as in my Notes on that paſſage I have ſhewn. Nor is there any neceſſity of interpreting the words of <hi>Haggai</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom Chriſt ſhould be as yet unknown; but they may be very well underſtood of thoſe which, after they had already embraced the Goſpel, ſhould make Chriſt their <hi>deſire,</hi> that is, ſhould long to enjoy his promiſed Benefits, and ſee him returning from Heaven to judg the World. This is that which is the object of our <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>earneſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. It is very true that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Language of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>men.</hi> Our Author might alſo have added, that in the ſame dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſignifies <hi>Heathens,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Jews,</hi> as his Countryman Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> on <hi>Mark</hi> xvi.15. has obſerved. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore is, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> who were converted to the Chriſtian Faith, did earneſtly expect the time when <hi>the Sons of God were to be revealed,</hi> that is, as the foregoing and following context ſhews, were to be made partakers of eternal Glory and Happineſs by Chriſt after the univerſal Judgment. He <hi>diſtinguiſhes</hi> afterwards <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> and the believing <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Heathens,</hi> when he ſays that <hi>not only they,</hi> or <hi>the Creature, did expect</hi> that time, <hi>but we alſo that have the firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> i. e. we <hi>Jews</hi> who have firſt received the Holy Spirit from God. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> at this time were no longer in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:99486:151"/>
of what the <hi>Jews</hi> were about to do; for the Goſpel upon their rejection of it, and continuing incredulous, had been preached a good while ago to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as is plain from the Hiſtory of the Apoſtles, and that account of times which our <hi>Author</hi> himſelf gives us in his <hi>Premonition</hi> to this <hi>Epiſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Beſides, I cannot imagin whence our Author inferred, that the happineſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did depend upon the <hi>obduracy</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi>; as if upon ſuppoſition that the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, or the greateſt part of it, had believed in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were never to have had the Chriſtian Faith preached to them! We are told indeed, both by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that the Goſpel was to be preached firſt to the <hi>Jews,</hi> purſuant to God's decree, but no where to them <hi>alone.</hi> There was no difference to be made in this matter between the <hi>Jews</hi> and the reſt of the World, but only in the <hi>time</hi> of preaching the Goſpel. If the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation had received <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they had underſtood that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to be called to the ſame Faith, and that they muſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their Rites and Ceremonies; and ſo all the <hi>Jews</hi> had become the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I confeſs the obſtinacy of the <hi>Jews</hi> was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Apoſtles going to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; but what the Jews obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was the occaſion of, Religion and Charity would have obliged the Apoſtles to, if the Jews had all or moſt of them believed in Chriſt. This we may conclude from the ſtory of <hi>Cornelius</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> x. to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> was directly ſent before the Apoſtles had departed from the Jews. And this <hi>Chriſt</hi> expreſly commanded in <hi>Mark</hi> xvi.15. and <hi>Acts</hi> i.8. So that it hence alſo appears that our Author puts a wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation on this diſcourſe of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> g. The <hi>Revelation of the Sons of God</hi> is manifeſtly the ſame with <hi>the Adoption</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. and that being nothing elſe but an admiſſion into the Kingdom of Heaven in the view of all the World, the <hi>Revelation of the Sons of God</hi> muſt be that ſame Action of God whereby he will make known to all, who thoſe are that he acknowledges for his Sons. The ſeries of the diſcourſe puts this out of all doubt: <hi>The</hi> CREATURE <hi>earneſtly waits for the</hi> REVELA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF THE SONS OF GOD, <hi>in hope becauſe the Creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of Corruption, into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberty of the Sons of God: for we know that every Creature groaneth, and travelleth in pain until now</hi>; and NOT <hi>only they</hi> [expect, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Revelation of the Sons of God, and groan becauſe of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition] BUT <hi>we our ſelves alſo who have the firſt Fruits of the Spirit, groan likewiſe our ſelves within our ſelves, waiting, for the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOPTION <hi>of Sons,</hi> viz. <hi>the Redemption of our Body.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:99486:152"/>
hinder'd his diſcerning this, by mixing a great many foreign things with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s diſcourſe, of which there is not the leaſt mark or foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep in the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> perhaps to have the reputation of ſaying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new.</p>
               <p>By <hi>the Revelation</hi> or <hi>Adoption of the Sons of God,</hi> is ſignified an act of Chriſt, acknowledging thoſe that are his, at the day of Judgment, in ſome ſuch words as thoſe, <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe it does not now appear who are the Sons of God by any particular and viſible evidences of the divine Favour towards them above the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ſo others <hi>deny</hi> them to be by a ſpecial privilege the <hi>Sons of God</hi>; but when <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes to ſeparate the Godly from the Wicked, this will be plain and manifeſt. See <hi>John</hi> 1 Ep. iii.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Note</hi> i.] Our Author covers one Miſtake with another, to keep them, as one ſaid, from leaking. This I moſt of all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, that he ſhould produce the Example of a moſt ſuperſtitious Heathen, and moſt malicious and implacable Enemy to the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>viz. Porphyry,</hi> as a Philoſopher who groaned under the burden of Idolatry. Whoever reads his Writings and his Life, writ by the learned <hi>Luc. Holſtenius,</hi> and underſtands but the nature of that new Platonick Philoſophy, will ſoon perceive that no Men were ever more devoted to Idolatry, than <hi>Porphyry,</hi> and the reſt of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of that Age. Our Author ought rather to have produced the Examples of <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> who in ſome meaſure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved Idolatry, than of ſuch as were its greateſt Champions, and with all their might defended it againſt Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>But there was no need of recurring to that, for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does not ſignify <hi>Idolatry,</hi> nor is the Diſcourſe here about <hi>Idolaters.</hi> For tho I ſhould grant our Author that Idolatry is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and Idolaters <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it does not follow, that wherever that word is uſed it muſt be ſo interpreted, or that it reſpects the Worſhip of Idols rather than any <hi>other Vanities</hi> of the Heathens. It may be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood here of that <hi>Emptineſs</hi> or Vanity which is in all the things of this Life. For the Heathens who had embraced the Goſpel did earneſtly expect that time wherein they knew they ſhould be delivered from the <hi>Vanity</hi> of this World; <hi>to wit,</hi> when Chriſt ſhould openly acknowledg and declare them to be the Sons of God, as I before ſaid. Thoſe who have entertained the Chriſtian Religion, and ſeriouſly conſidered it, do beſt of all know that thoſe things which relate only to this Life are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>perfect Vanity</hi>; ſuch only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truth of that ſaying of the Preacher, <hi>Vanity of Vanities, all things are Vanity,</hi> and of the Poet, <hi>Heu quantum eſt in rebus inane!</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:99486:152"/>
And accordingly the Heathens who had been converted to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did <hi>groan</hi> and as it were <hi>travel</hi> in pain, till they were ſet free from thoſe vain Occupations, which partly neceſſity, and partly the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and weakneſs of human Underſtanding, has impoſed on us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> is the proper ſignification of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <q>Verſ. 10. And not only the Example of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> teaches us, that it is not ſufficient for any Nation to have deſcended from the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> to claim to themſelves a right in the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or entitle them <hi>God</hi>'s People. This appears likewiſe by the inſtance of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which <hi>Rebecca</hi> bare to one <hi>Iſaac.</hi> 11. For before ever they were born, and conſequently had done good or evil, by which to procure the favour of God, or make him their Enemy; that the purpoſe of God concerning chuſing a certain Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to himſelf, might appear to proceed from his own arbitrary pleaſure, and not to have been excited by any Virtue or Merits of that People; 12. God anſwered <hi>Rebecca</hi> when ſhe conſulted him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Children ſtriving in her Womb: That ſhe carried in her Bowels the Fathers of two great People; of which People that which did firſt become the moſt numerous, and acquired the greateſt Riches and Power ſhould afterwards ſerve the other, tho in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning not ſo powerful. 13. To which purpoſe alſo is that ſaying of God in <hi>Malachi,</hi> that he had preferred <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Poſterity, to <hi>Eſau</hi> and his Progeny, and upon the former conferred much greater Benefits. 14. Perhaps ſome may object that God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Doctrin, ſeems to be unjuſt, who, as I affirm, ſo much prefers one People before another, that are no better than they. But that does not in the leaſt follow from this Doctrin. 15. For <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom none will affirm to charge God with any injuſtice, tells us, that when he had prayed God to continue to go before the Camp of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> tho they had deſerved his anger, and prevailed, he received this anſwer from him, that the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> tho they had
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:99486:156"/>
heinouſly offended him, ſince he had begun to ſhew them favour, ſhould find him alſo for the future gracious to them, and ſtill be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by him his People. 16. So that the Mercy of God in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any Nation to the knowledg of himſelf, and making them his peculiar People, does not uſe to depend on the Merits of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but on his own free Will and arbitrary Purpoſe.</q>

As there are two Paſſages here in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> at a conſiderable diſtance from one another, put together by the Apoſtle, ſo there are two Figures alſo conjoined. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt is conſidered as <hi>a ſtone of Offence,</hi> at which whether it be in walking or running, if any one do ſtumble, he is in danger of falling; and this refers to the Metaphors the Apoſtle had before taken from the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian <hi>Games,</hi> and particularly that of <hi>Running,</hi> which made him think of <hi>a ſtone of Offence,</hi> than which, in a ſwift motion, nothing can be more dangerous. Afterwards in the next words, <hi>every one that believeth on him ſhall not be confounded,</hi> Chriſt is repreſented not as a ſtone of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but as <hi>a corner ſtone,</hi> which he that builds any Wall upon, muſt truſt to the firmneſs of; and if he be deceived in his confidence, after he has finiſhed his Structure, his building falls, and that fills him with ſhame.</p>
               <p>This <hi>latter</hi> Similitude is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxviii.16. where God ſpeaks thus; <hi>I lay in</hi> Sion <hi>for a foundation, a Stone, an elect Stone</hi> (if we read <gap reason="foreign">

This conjecture of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> is favoured by the ſeries of the diſcourſe, in which it is not probable that among particular Precepts the Apoſtle would bring in that general one, comprehending all the duties of a Chriſtian's Life, of <hi>ſerving the Lord.</hi> Beſides, after the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and both together make up an excellent Precept to this ſenſe:
<q>In the buſineſs of Piety you muſt be zealous and fervent, but yet ſo as to obſerve the proper time for it, leſt by your unſeaſonable fervor you ſhould bring your ſelves into danger without doing any body elſe any good.</q>
The Apoſtle here makes uſe of a known Proverb, and ordinary both in Greek and Latin Authors. So <hi>Phocylides:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

So the Author of the Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick <hi>ad Piſonem:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Temporibus ſervire decet, qui tempora certis</l>
                     <l>Ponderibus penſavit, eum ſi bella vocabunt,</l>

                     <l>Hunc fora pacatum, bellantem caſtra decebunt.</l>

It's true, in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the ſenſe is ſomething different, but it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if it have but an affinity with that which it is commonly taken in; for ſuch ſort of ſayings have generally more ſenſes than one.

<q>That which Chriſt, who is our King, requires of us, does not conſiſt in abſtaining from meat or drink, but in living righteouſly, peaceably, and chearfully under the ſenſe of thoſe Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt which we have received from God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould endeavour to follow after Righteouſneſs and Peace, and not be moroſe towards others who do not abſtain from the Meats forbidden by the Law.</q>

The ſame word ſignifies <hi>Joy,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> v.22. which is reckoned among the Fruits of a Goſpel-Spirit, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends both that affection of mind which I have deſcribed, and that behaviour towards our Neighbour which proceeds from it, and which conſiſts in living and converſing with him in a friendly manner. And this amicable diſpoſition and behaviour St. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends elſewhere, as in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v.16. where he exhorts Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <hi>to rejoice always</hi>; or, as it is in <hi>Phil.</hi> iv.4. <hi>to rejoice in the Lord always,</hi> that is, for the Benefits they have received from the Lord. This Joy, as it ſhews that we are ſatisfied with our condition, ſo in all our tranſactions with our Neighbour it clearly diſcovers it ſelf, in the courteouſneſs and affableneſs of our behaviour towards him. Whereas on the contrary men who are diſcontented with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are in, as they want this Joy, ſo they are generally rugged and moroſe in their deportment. Of which number were the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were very much offended at the approaching deſtruction of their Temple, and could not upon any terms be friends with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who did not obſerve the difference between Meats preſcribed by the Law.

They were ſubtil crafty Perſons, who perceiving that a great many had embraced the Chriſtian Religion, who were very liberal to the poor of that Profeſſion, and ready to hearken to any that made a ſhew of Piety and Learning, took occaſion to deceive the ſimple, that they might live idly at their coſt, and privately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves in all manner of Senſuality: Of which number ſeems to have been that <hi>Peregrinus,</hi> whoſe death is related by <hi>Lucian,</hi> if we may give credit to an <hi>Epicurean</hi> and an Orator. And to theſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſeem to be owing that multitude of ſuppoſititious Writings which were received and uſed by the Chriſtians ever ſince the firſt Ages, and thoſe Philoſophical Opinions with which Chriſtianity was very early corrupted, and were taken by the ignorant and unwary for Apoſtolical Doctrines. See <hi>Col.</hi> ii.8. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But I believe it has a reference <hi>only</hi> to the <hi>perſecuting Jews,</hi> who waged an irreconcileable War with the Chriſtians as Apoſtates: For theſe being the inſtruments of the Devil, who is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Satan,</hi> or <hi>an Adverſary,</hi> and by his inſpiration endeavouring to oppreſs the Chriſtian Religion at its firſt riſe, could not be deſtroyed, but Satan muſt be <hi>trod under foot</hi> as it were, at the ſame time. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens had not as yet begun to perſecute the Chriſtians for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſake, but only under the notion of <hi>ſeditious</hi> Perſons, by which

name the <hi>Jews</hi> endeavour'd to defame them amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> as appears from the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts.</hi> So that the Chriſtians had no Adverſaries at that time but the <hi>Jews</hi>; who having ſome years after become odious themſelves to the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the account of their Seditions, were not in a condition to do the Chriſtians any great harm. And that ſeems to be the reaſon why St. <hi>Paul</hi> promiſed the Chriſtians peace <gap reason="foreign">

What our Author ſays on this place, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very ingenious; and ſome things he has tranſcribed out of <hi>Grotius</hi> ſo as to mend, and add to them.

Juſt as the Greeks and Latins frequently borrow paſſages out of their own <hi>Poets,</hi> not
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:99486:165"/>
to prove any thing by their Authority,<note place="margin">Chapter II.</note> but to expreſs their mind in <hi>their</hi> words more elegantly than they could do in their <hi>own</hi>; and to the ſame end likewiſe the Hebrews frequently alledg the words of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> And as the Greeks and Latins make no difficulty of applying the ſayings of their Poets to a different purpoſe than they intended them, provided they do not apply them abſurdly; the ſame is obſervable alſo among the Hebrews: Of which there are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inſtances to be met with in the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> and the myſtical Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Scripture; and before them in <hi>Philo,</hi> who ſeldom ever cites the Scripture but in that manner. And this being a uſual prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the time of the Apoſtles, it is no wonder if <hi>they</hi> followed the cuſtom of the Age wherein they lived, there being no harm at all in that cuſtom.

WHAT our Author ſays here about the ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that might be uſed to procure credit to the Goſpel, is all very true and undeniable; but the greateſt part of it is beſides the ſcope of this place: For by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> here is meant only the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which were uſed by thoſe who are called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in this very <hi>Chapter,</hi> in the Church; as the <hi>Gift of Tongues,</hi> which was no ſmall evidence of the truth of Chriſtianity. <hi>Achaia</hi> at that time being a place of great commerce, a great many <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> out of <hi>Africa, Egypt,</hi> and other places where the Inhabitants were <gap reason="foreign">

And theſe could not hear the Apoſtle ſpeaking properly in their ſeveral Languages without the higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, knowing that he had never learned them. See <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. of this Epiſtle, where the word <hi>Spirit</hi> often ſignifies ſuch Gifts. And by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as <hi>Grotius</hi> rightly obſerves, is meant the Gift of <hi>healing Diſeaſes,</hi> or the like. See the ſame Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 28, 29. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore is, that he did not come to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> as a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, to perſwade them to believe what he ſaid by argument and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, but endued with miraculous Gifts, ſuch as the Gift of Tongues and the like, and a power of curing the diſeaſed; that the credit they
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:99486:166"/>
gave to him might not be as to a Philoſopher, who confirmed the truth of his Doctrin by probable reaſons, but as to God's Meſſenger, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating by Miracles that he had a Command from Heaven to ſay what he preached to them, and did not diſcover it by reaſoning.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he was ſent from God. Our Author in his Paraphraſe on this Chapter, puts in ſo many things foreign to the ſenſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, that it is rather <hi>he</hi> himſelf than the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> that reaſons in it.</p>

IT is truly obſerved by learned Men, that this is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial form of Speech, taken from thoſe who haſtily and narrowly make their eſcape from a Fire which had like to conſume them. Such another Metaphor there is in <hi>Livy,</hi> Lib. 22. cap. 35. <hi>L.

               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:99486:167"/>But our learned Author forcedly applies all this to his <hi>Gnoſticks:</hi> for tho in <hi>Judaea</hi> it is poſſible the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> might feign themſelves to be <hi>Jews,</hi> to eſcape perſecution from them, becauſe the <hi>Jews there</hi> were far more numerous than the <hi>Heathens</hi>; it does not follow there was any reaſon to be afraid of them at <hi>Corinth,</hi> or in <hi>Achaia,</hi> where the <hi>Jews</hi> were much <hi>fewer</hi> in number than the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and where their Complaints of the Chriſtians were not hearkened to by the Roman Magiſtrates, as appears from <hi>Acts</hi> xviii.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after the <hi>Jews</hi> once began for their Seditions to be ſuſpected by the <hi>Romans,</hi> as not long after it happened, it had not been carnal Policy for any to join themſelves to their party: So that there is no room here for what the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays about the compliance of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> with the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> had reaſon to fear any danger in <hi>Greece,</hi> it was from the <hi>Romans</hi>; but it does not appear there was any perſecution raiſed againſt the Chriſtians in thoſe parts, till a great while after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> See Mr. <hi>Dodwell's</hi> Diſſert. <hi>de paucitate Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> among his <hi>Cyprianicae.</hi> So that that <hi>day</hi> of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, cannot be referred to the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews.</hi> It is much better by <hi>Grotius</hi> underſtood of a long ſpace of time, which very often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers what is true, and what is falſe, as many of the Antients have obſerved. Conſult <hi>Stobaei Excerpta de Rerum Natura,</hi> Tit. 11. where there are a great many ſayings to that purpoſe. As for the <hi>Fire</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here makes mention of, that is nothing but an examination of Doctrins, which after ſome time the Chriſtians would ſet themſelves to, and upon which all that were falſe would be rejected, and the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; which is called <hi>Fire</hi> by a Metaphor taken from Metals. They that retained the foundation of Chriſtianity, tho they built ſtrange Doctrins upon it, would at length upon that examination of them, find that they had built <hi>ſtubble</hi> upon <hi>Gold</hi>; and when they underſtood that they had been in danger of caſting away the foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelf for thoſe Errors, they would preſently forſake them, and eſcape as out of the Fire, not without the loſs of their Reputation and Time, beſides what they muſt be reckoned to have loſt in pious Actions and right Apprehenſions, by continuing ſo long in their Errors.</p>
               <p>That Character of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> which our Author would have to be contained in the following words, agrees to any others that err through a falſe notion of Wiſdom, and do miſchief to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church.

But all that he ſays afterwards is manifeſtly forced, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not ſpeak of that Sorrow which was cauſed by the cenſures of the Church, or <hi>Excommunication,</hi> but concerning Sorrow which proceeded from a depravation of Manners in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had juſtly reprehended them. For it is apparent that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to the <hi>whole Corinthian</hi> Church, which no one would ſay was excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated becauſe the Apoſtle had in this Epiſtle reproved their Manners, or becauſe he had ordered that <hi>one</hi> inceſtuous Perſon, ſpoken of in this Chapter, <hi>to be delivered to Satan.</hi> The thing confutes it ſelf upon the very mention of it; and I dare ſay our Author had never written in this manner, if he had not ſome time before compoſed a diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> which he was very much in love with, and perhaps more than he ſhould have been, and that made him think he ſaw thoſe <hi>Keys</hi> where no body elſe would ever have thought of them.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Note</hi> e. I. It had been better in my judgment, if our learned Author had inſiſted only on the <hi>ſecond</hi> reaſon he aſſigns of this phraſe, which is manifeſtly grounded on the Apoſtle's writings; for what need was there of inventing another <hi>new</hi> one, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had given <hi>one</hi> very <hi>ſufficient</hi> reaſon of it? But, unleſs I am miſtaken, the <hi>Doctor</hi> did not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh the common <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,</hi> as it is deſcribed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> or as it obtained in <hi>after</hi> Ages, from that <hi>delivering up to Satan</hi> in the time of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For <hi>this</hi> was a conſectary of that miraculous Power of the Apoſtles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the power of <hi>Excommunication</hi> was not conjoined with any Miracle. What <hi>Joſephus</hi> relates concerning the <hi>Eſſeni,</hi> may ſo be underſtood, as that the Excommunicate Perſon ſhould be ſaid to have died for <hi>Grief,</hi> not by the miraculous Virtue of the <hi>Excommunication</hi>; which yet if <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> had believed, it would be no Crime to refuſe to give Credit to him.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that it ſignifies here <hi>to deliver up upon Demand</hi> or <hi>Petition,</hi> is certainly ingenious; but if it ſhould be denied, I don't ſee how it could be proved. For an Executioner does not uſe to require the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to deliver up Malefactors to him, but they are delivered up to him without his <hi>demanding</hi> them. And when it is ſaid that Satan deſired permiſſion of God <hi>to ſift the Apoſtles,</hi> that was not properly to execute Puniſhment on them for their Sins, but to aſſault them the more vehemently with his Temptations and wicked Suggeſtions: Nor indeed can the Devil be ſuppoſed to demand bad Men of God in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to torment them, whom he would rather make happy, if he could, that he might entice others into ſin by the example of their Proſperity; ſo that he is rather to be thought to puniſh bad men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will, than to ask leave of God to afflict them. And it's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that bad men who ſerve Satan, are ſo far from being more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and obnoxious to diſeaſes than the good, that the contrary is generally true. Whence alſo by the way we may infer, that if <hi>to be delivered to Satan,</hi> were all one as to be caſt out of the Church, thoſe who never were within the Church muſt have been reckoned from their very birth to have been <hi>delivered up to Satan,</hi> and by conſequence have been all more obnoxious to diſeaſes than the Chriſtians: And all likewiſe that were rightfully Excommunicated ſhould have been ſaid to have been <hi>delivered to Satan,</hi> and been afflicted with Diſeaſes, which yet that it was of old ſo, no Writer has ever aſſerted, nor does any one believe. But <hi>delivering up to Satan,</hi> tho conjoined with Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, is not the ſame thing: And therefore our Author ought not to have confounded this unuſual Puniſhment inflicted by Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Authority, with the ordinary Cenſures of the Church. Nor is he more fortunate in conjecturing that this <hi>delivering to Satan</hi> was an imitation of God's dealing with Sinners, when he leaves them to the power of the Devil to execute his pleaſure upon them.</p>

                  </gap>.] Many Interpreters would have this to be underſtood of this very Epiſtle, contrary to all the rules of Grammar, leſt it ſhould be thought that any of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles were loſt; which yet why they might not, no reaſon at all can be given: For if ſo be, we want none of thoſe things which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, what reaſon can we have to accuſe the Providence of God, if any of the Writings of the Apoſtles were loſt? Should we have been ever the leſs Diſciples of Chriſt, if any of thoſe Epiſtles
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:99486:170"/>
had been loſt, which we now have? Was it abſolutely neceſſary that every thing which the Apoſtles wrote ſhould be tranſmitted to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Nay we may ſuppoſe that there were ſome ſuch Epiſtles, which it was the intereſt of the Churches, and Men of that Age to conceal; for there are ſecrets which every body need not to be acquainted with. And it would be no hard matter to produce inſtances of ſuch ſecrets, if every one could not eaſily find ſuch himſelf. So that there being no ſufficient reaſon to perſwade us that all the Apoſtles writings ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were or ought to have been preſerved, if it be moſt agreeable to the rules of Grammar to ſuppoſe, that the Diſcourſe here is about an Epiſtle which is loſt, I do not ſee why we ſhould not be of that Opinion. And there are three things that ſhew St. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeak of ſome <hi>other</hi> Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he had no where in the foregoing part of this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the <hi>Corinthians <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not to aſſociate with Fornicators:</hi> For what he had ſaid about the <hi>Corinthian</hi> who was guilty of <hi>Inceſt,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the thing here referred to, becauſe that had no ambiguity in it; and it appears by the following Verſe, that the ambiguity of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words either did, or at leaſt might have given the <hi>Corinthians</hi> an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to miſtake: <hi>I wrote unto you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in an Epiſtle not to keep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with Fornicators; but not altogether with the Fornicators of this World, or with the Covetous, or Extortioners, or Idolaters, for then muſt ye needs have gone out of the World. But now I have written unto you, not to keep Company with any Man that is called a Brother, and is a Fornicator,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The 11th <hi>Verſe</hi> which begins with the Particle NYNI <hi>now,</hi> ſufficiently ſhews that the Apoſtle in that ſpeaks of <hi>this</hi> Epiſtle, and in the 9<hi>th Verſe</hi> of <hi>another:</hi> I WROTE <hi>unto you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in an Epiſtle, not to,</hi> &amp;c. But NOW <hi>I have written unto you,</hi> &amp;c. There is here a plain oppoſition between the time of the Apoſtles writing the one and the other; for tho the Particle <hi>now</hi> be ſometimes only a <hi>tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and does not ſignify any difference of time, yet it is manifeſt that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks here of a thing that was paſt, which he now explains more clearly. Nay tho we ſhould grant the Particle <hi>now</hi> to be here a form of <hi>tranſition,</hi> and the Apoſtle to ſpeak of the ſame Epiſtle in <hi>both</hi> Verſes; yet that Epiſtle muſt be an Epiſtle in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpoken <hi>ambiguouſly,</hi> and not this in which there is <hi>no ambiguity,</hi> as I have juſt now ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Apoſtle had meant <hi>this</hi> Epiſtle, he would not have ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but either have <hi>wholly</hi> omitted it, or ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in this Epiſtle</hi>; tho even that could not be handſomly enough ſaid, if but juſt before he had written that which by many he is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:99486:170"/>
here to refer to. But undoubtedly he meant <hi>another</hi> Epiſtle, as in his 2<hi>d</hi> Epiſt. <hi>Chap.</hi> vii.8. where he ſpeaks of <hi>this,</hi> which is come to our hands: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>this Epiſtle,</hi> viz. in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> iv.16. and 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v.27. But I do not rely on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this reaſon, or the bare omiſſion of the <hi>Pronoun</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>All this did not hinder Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who was an excellent Divine, but an indifferent Grammarian, from declaring himſelf of another Opinion in his <hi>Note</hi> upon this <hi>Verſe,</hi> which, if I am not miſtaken, was owing to a Theological prejudice, mentioned in the beginning of this Animadverſion.</p>

That none of the Antients have made any mention of that Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which I ſay is loſt, does not prove that there was no ſuch Epiſtle; becauſe there might be reaſons, as I before ſaid, for the concealing of it, or perhaps alſo after it was read, for the tearing and burning it, by the Apoſtle's own order who had written it.</p>

And in this place where the word <gap reason="foreign">

For it is true indeed, the Solemnities uſed in the worſhip of ſome Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in ſome places, were accompanied with ſhameful Luſts, as I have ſhewn my ſelf on <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxiv.15. But that either every where, or for the moſt part it was ſo, I leave them to believe who are ignorant of the antient Heathen Cuſtoms. Our Author ſpeaks as if the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> did very freely ſuffer their Wives and Children to be corrupted and proſtituted in their ſacred Myſteries; and as if that was the general Cuſtom, than which nothing can be more falſe: Nay there were ſevere Decrees ſometimes made againſt Impurities in the worſhip of their Gods, as appears from <hi>Livy,</hi> Lib. 39. and by an order of the Senate it ſelf ſtill extant: See alſo <hi>Cicero de Legibus,</hi>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:99486:172"/>
Lib. 2. Cap. 14, 15. I do not therefore believe that an <hi>Idolater</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply is ever taken for a <hi>Fornicator</hi> or <hi>Adulterer,</hi> as if Idolatry and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs had always gone together: Nor does our Author produce any one Paſſage to make it probable; for tho all the Sins which are joined with Idolatry here and elſewhere, reſpected carnal Pleaſures, it would in no wiſe follow that by <hi>Idolatry</hi> is meant <hi>Impurity,</hi> when neither the proper ſignification of that word, nor its uſe will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that ſenſe; and it is very common for Sins of various kinds to be joined together. And yet upon this only ground almoſt, our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author in his <hi>Note</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> i.29. endeavoured to prove that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignified <hi>Luxury,</hi> againſt the proper ſignification of the word, and the conſtant uſe of all Writers, as I have there ſhewn. And the ſame I ſhall do here, as to the word <hi>Idolatry,</hi> leſt any ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by his Authority, or multitude of Examples.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>gilloul</hi> ſignifies <hi>Dung</hi> properly, and Idols are by way of contempt ſo called, not becauſe of thoſe carnal Pollutions that accompanied the Worſhip of them, but becauſe they were made no more account of than <hi>Dung</hi> by the <hi>Jews:</hi> For <hi>Dung</hi> did not pollute, <hi>viz.</hi> with any legal Pollution. By the <hi>Septuagint</hi> this word is rendred <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not as if that were the proper ſignification of it, but becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> who ſpake Greek, commonly called Idols <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>abominable things,</hi> not <hi>polluted</hi>; for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does not ſignify <hi>to be polluted,</hi> but <hi>to abhor, to deteſt.</hi> And the ſame is the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Hebrew root <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſchakats,</hi> whence <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> an <hi>abominable thing,</hi> not properly becauſe of carnal Pollution, but becauſe it is evil. <hi>Lyra</hi>'s Authority is not to be regarded. See my Notes on <hi>Gen.</hi> xxi.7.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I do not doubt but in the <hi>Bacchanalia,</hi> or night Revels of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> there were horrible Villanies committed; but I do not think it was univerſally known in <hi>Greece,</hi> that thoſe things were done there in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that God. Our learned Author might have produced a great many fitter Teſtimonies, to ſhew that the Myſteries of <hi>Ceres</hi> were <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> than thoſe which he alledges out of <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi>; or rather have let them quite alone, ſince every Child knows ſuch things.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That paſſage in <hi>Jerem.</hi> xliv.19. is perfectly foreign to this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there being nothing there ſaid about nocturnal Sacrifices: For thus the Women who had offered Sacrifice to the Queen of Heaven, that is, the Moon, ſpeak: <hi>When we burned Incenſe to the Queen of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and poured out drink Offerings, did we make her Images without our Husbands?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I am of opinion indeed with our Author, that God by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred mark of Circumciſion, did ſignify the amputation of inordinate
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:99486:172"/>
Pleaſures; but whether he had a particular reſpect to the ſhameful practices of the Heathens in their Religious Solemnities, which in that Ceremony he condemned, I cannot tell; nor is it evident from any place of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Our Author had not look'd into 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xxiii.7. for the word there in the Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  <hi>haſtheroth,</hi> which has a different ſignification. But he was deceived by an overhaſty reading of what Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſays about this matter, <hi>de Diis Syris,</hi> Synt. ii. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. who may be conſulted; and who has alſo treated at large of <hi>Milytta</hi> and the reſt here ſpoken of, in <hi>Syntag.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. To me likewiſe it ſeems moſt probable, what he conjectures about the original of the names <hi>Atergatis</hi> and <hi>Derceto,</hi> in <hi>cap.</hi> 3. of the ſame <hi>Syntagm.</hi> as if they were the ſame with <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>addir-dag, a magnificent Fiſh,</hi> becauſe he ſets down a ſtory which agrees with his conjecture, as he at large ſhews.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. By a pleaſant miſtake our Author produces Verſes out of the 3<hi>d</hi> Book of the <hi>Sybillin Oracles,</hi> as reſpecting the <hi>Roman Luſtrations,</hi> of which there is not in them the leaſt mark or footſtep; merely, if I am not miſtaken, becauſe <hi>Joan. Opſopaeus,</hi> who turned the <hi>Sybillin Oracles</hi> into bad Latin Verſe, had thus tranſlated the two firſt which Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> alledges:

                     <l>Maſque mari ſe junget, ſtatuentque pudendis</l>
                     <l>In <hi>LUSTRIS</hi> pueros.</l>

                  </gap>. The other places prove nothing, but only that the Heathens were generally given to inordinate Luſts, but not that thoſe Luſts were reckoned by the moſt of them a part of Religion.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. In the <hi>Eleuſinia Sacra,</hi> or Rites performed in honour of <hi>Ceres,</hi> there were indeed ſome indecent things practiſed, as <hi>Joannes Meurſius</hi> in <hi>Eleuſiniis</hi> will inform us; but that any horrible Villanies, and ſuch as are not to be named, were committed in them, will not be thought by any that ſhall read what is ſaid of them by <hi>Cicero</hi> de <hi>Legibus,</hi> Lib. 2. in the place before cited.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. In <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> iii.5. the word <gap reason="foreign">

As for the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> I ſhould no more imagin them to be here referred to, than any other bad Men, unleſs our Author meant to give the honourable name of <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> to all the vile wretches that in the Apoſtles times had crept into the Chriſtian Aſſemblies; tho why he ſhould, I can ſee no reaſon.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Note</hi> l. Our Author who makes his ſtile both in Engliſh and Latin rugged with unneceſſary and miſplaced Parentheſes, and thereby often renders it tedious to the Reader, makes too much uſe of that expedient to connect the Diſcourſe of the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Beſides, if we read the Greek words, it will appear that the Diſcourſe does not ſufficiently hang together; for we ſhould be obliged to read: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>doing this ye ſhall put away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall propoſe here a Conjecture, which if it were true, would make all things plain. We read the words in our Copies thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; Now what conſtruction this is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I confeſs I do not underſtand. I know the ſenſe commonly put upon it is, <hi>What have I to do,</hi> or <hi>what buſineſs is it of mine</hi> to judg them that are without? <hi>i. e.</hi> it is not my buſineſs. But there is no example given of any ſuch Phraſe. Beſides, the <hi>Conjunction</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> intervening, makes the Phraſe ſtill more harſh; for which reaſon it is left out in the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> and other <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> and omitted by the <hi>Syriack</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter; but in my judgment raſhly, becauſe that Particle may be of uſe to direct us to the true reading, which ſeems to be this: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>For what have I to do with thoſe that are without? But do you judg thoſe that are within; and thoſe that are without

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, becauſe the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

This makes the ſenſe very plain, whereas that interrogation, <hi>do not ye judg them?</hi> is very harſh and improper in this place. If St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid; It is not my buſineſs to judg thoſe who are <hi>among you,</hi> do not ye judg them? this would be ſome ſenſe, the foreign to this place, and the diſcourſe would be current; but as it is now, the connexion of the words is extremely harſh. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the following words <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe ſort of things are only the products of a fruitful Invention, which if they be look'd on as Demonſtrations, what will not Divines find in the Scripture? The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are ſaid to have been <hi>baptized in the Cloud</hi> and <hi>in the Sea,</hi> becauſe the Cloud that hung over them, and the Sea that encompaſſed them, were Water, which may be reckoned as it were to have wet them, becauſe of its nearneſs; as we are waſhed by the Water of Baptiſm.

But it may be proved perhaps out of the New. If it be asked where? out of <hi>John</hi> vi.31. <hi>&amp; ſeqq.</hi> where Chriſt oppoſes his Doctrin to <hi>Manna</hi>: As if a mere alluſion or oppoſition put by Chriſt between his Doctrin and <hi>Manna,</hi> did neceſſarily imply that it was the deſign of God in giving the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Manna, to typify the future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Goſpel by Chriſt! But I further ask, for whoſe ſake were theſe typical repreſentations made? Was it for the ſake of the <hi>Jews?</hi> This cannot be pretended, for that dull Nation hardly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the plaineſt and expreſſeſt things, tho frequently inculcated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and much leſs ſuch as were obſcure and intricate. And it is not probable that any thing was inſtituted by God for the ſake of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which they did not at all underſtand. But that thoſe Types were given for the ſake of Chriſtians is yet far more unlikely; becauſe if they were to be believed by us, they were to be deduced from the Writings of the Apoſtles, whoſe Authority alone would move us in
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:99486:181"/>
this matter; when otherwiſe we ſhould never have ſo much as dreamt of them. So that in order to our underſtanding that kind of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, the aſſiſtance of other Divine Perſons would have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, whom for other reaſons we already believe, <hi>viz.</hi> for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their Doctrin, and the Miracles which were wrought in confirmation of it. But this being ſuppoſed, what need is there of Types to thoſe who already believe Chriſt and his Apoſtles upon the firmeſt grounds? They illuſtrate, it may be you'l ſay, the Apoſtles Doctrin; that I deny, and ſay that they would rather obſcure it if they occurred in their Writings, for the alledged reaſons: See my Note on <hi>Mat.</hi> ii.2. Let the Learned judg of theſe things, and conſider whether it be not better at laſt to let all this Doctrin about the Types alone, which the Heathens of old derided, and the <hi>Jews</hi> ridicule at this day; and only make uſe of the moſt convincing Arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prove the truth of Chriſtianity. But this would be the ſubject of a whole Volume, which I have here but tranſiently touched, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherever there is a fit occaſion, to ſhew the weakneſs of all that is alledged in defence of Types out of the Apoſtles Writings.</p>

<q>And the caſe was the ſame of the Water that flowed out of that Rock, and thoſe that drank of it; and of the Doctrin of Chriſt and Chriſtians.</q>
So in the Parables of Chriſt, the parts of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are often called the parts of a <hi>Parable,</hi> becauſe they are compared with one another, and the caſe is the ſame in both: As <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19. <hi>When any one heareth the word of the Kingdom, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was ſown in his Heart:</hi> THIS IS <hi>he which received Seed by the way ſide. But he that received the Seed into ſtrong places,</hi> THIS IS <hi>he that heareth the Word,</hi> &amp;c. And it is known that the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom the Apoſtles fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, do very frequently borrow Compariſons from the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and allude to the ſtories of it ſo, as often to apply the words of them to their purpoſe; not that they thought thoſe places contained prefigurations of that which they accommodated them to, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought it a piece of elegance to appear to take every thing out of the Old Teſtament. See <hi>Gal.</hi> iv.24, 25, 16.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> b. I. Something, but briefly and obſcurely, there is about this matter in <hi>Rabbi Solomon,</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> xx.2. perhaps taken from the Chriſtians; for it is not eaſily to be believed that all the late <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſay, they owe to antient Tradition. It's certain neither the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:99486:182"/>
Paraphraſe of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> nor the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum,</hi> have any thing about the Water which followed the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> xvii. but in quite another place, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>Num.</hi> xxi.19, 20. where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of a Well that was digged upon the border of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the year before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> entred into <hi>Canaan.</hi> The words of <hi>Jonathan</hi> are theſe: <hi>And ever ſince the Well was given them in</hi> Mattan, <hi>it went up again with them into the high Mountains, and from the high Mountains is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended with them ihto the Hills. It encompaſſed all the Camp of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and yielded it ſelf for every one to drink of at the door of the Tabernacle. It deſcended alſo with them out of the high Mountains into the low Vallies,</hi> &amp;c. The like we read in the <hi>Jeruſalem Paraphraſe,</hi> but with this difference, that there is nothing there ſaid of this Well encompaſſing the Camp, or breaking out at the Gate of the Tabernacle, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> affirms.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Jews</hi> did not want Water, becauſe they both carried about with them the Water of <hi>Horeb,</hi> and might alſo meet with Springs in other places; for tho the <hi>rocky Arabia</hi> be a dry Country, yet it is not every where without Water, there being mention made of ſeveral Rivers which run through it. See my Notes on <hi>Gen.</hi> ii.12.</p>
               <p n="3">III. What Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſays about the Water's ceaſing to follow the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon the courſe of their Travels being changed, is a mere Invention, to ſupport his tottering Interpretation.</p>

                  </gap> is taken only in a threefold ſenſe in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>And <hi>firſt</hi> for any <hi>Form,</hi> whether corporeal, or conſpicuous only to the Mind; which ſenſe does not belong to this place. See <hi>John</hi> xx.25. <hi>Acts</hi> vii.43, 44. and xxiii.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> vi.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> viii.5.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ſignifies an <hi>Example,</hi> as here and in many other places, as we ſhall preſently ſee. The firſt ſignification of it is proper, this metaphorical. For <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is properly a <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> into which any thing is <hi>beaten</hi> or <hi>hammer'd,</hi>

                  </gap>.

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In another metaphorical ſignification, becauſe a Model or Pattern is <hi>like</hi> thoſe things which are made according to it, the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in one place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is taken for a thing which in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect reſembles another: And that is in <hi>Rom.</hi> v.14. where <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>like him that was to come,</hi> viz. in this, that he alone had done ſomething that was propagated to all Mankind, as Chriſt did ſomething alone which extends to all Men. For in other things the Apoſtle obſerves not only a diſſimilitude, but an oppoſition between them. But now who will believe that it was God's deſign, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould firſt of all ſin alone, and that that Sin ſhould do miſchief to all his Poſterity, to prefigure what was to be done by Chriſt? Who was able to diſcern the Similitude before the Event? Who after the Event finds his Faith confirmed by that Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude? Nor certainly was this the Apoſtle's meaning, but only that in the reſpect I have mention'd there was a Similitude between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as there is between a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>This laſt word perhaps may be made the ground of an Objection, which is twice found in the New Teſtament. The Author of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Ch. ix.24. denies that Chriſt was entred into Holy Places made with Hands, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but that is, <hi>which were made after the example of the true,</hi> viz. Heaven, or which were the images of Heaven, not which prefigured Heaven. So Baptiſm is ſaid in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii.21. to be <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">IV. Setting aſide what is ſaid about the <hi>Glory of God</hi> in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which does not at all belong to this place, tho <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks otherwiſe; the Man is called the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> becauſe whoever looks upon a Man, will perceive him to be a piece of Workmanſhip worthy of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, and give Glory to him upon that account. And the Woman is the glory of the Man, becauſe there is ſome ground for the Man to glory, when he conſiders that the Woman was formed out of his Body, and created for his Help and Aſſiſtance. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſe does ſhew that by being his <hi>glory,</hi> the Apoſtle means that for which he was made, and we need not go any further to underſtand St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Mind: The ſenſe of the whole place is, that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:99486:184"/>
the Man indeed ought to have his Head uncovered, becauſe God made him, as his other Works, to be beheld; and it is not for the glory of God, to have that Work of his hid by a Veil: but the Woman, which was made for the Man, ought to be veiled, becauſe ſhe is inferior to the Man, who uſes her as he pleaſes, and would have her veiled. It is for the Man's glory to have his Authority appear over the Woman, and as in other inſtances, ſo in this particularly, of having her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her ſelf whenever he pleaſes. <hi>Solomon</hi> has a ſaying in the xi<hi>th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> verſ. 16. which according to the Verſion of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And ſo ſaith <hi>Eſdras,</hi> Lib. 3. c. iv.7. of Women: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>But of this whole reaſoning, and many other ſuch, it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that they are not at all demonſtrative, becauſe they are not grounded upon things that are unchangeable, but alterable according to the Cuſtom or Opinion of Men. It was thought by the <hi>Greeks</hi> to be a token of the Mens Authority over the Women, for the Men to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear abroad with their Heads uncovered, as being their own Maſters, and expoſing themſelves to every ones view; and on the contrary an Argument of ſubjection in Women to go abroad veil'd, becauſe that ſignified them to be but one Man's, who had power to remove their Veil, and would not have them publickly beheld. But if a contrary Cuſtom had prevailed, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have reaſoned quite otherwiſe, to perſwade the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to what he endeavoured to induce them, <hi>viz.</hi> to do all things decently in the Church, and wherever any one propheſied. I confeſs he grounds his Argument alſo upon the Hiſtory of the Creation; but if we conſider the thing, who can deny but that the Woman was created after the Image of God, and for his Glory as well as the Man? See <hi>Gen.</hi> ii.27. Nor indeed is this denied by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but only in a certain ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as the Woman is ſaid to have been created after the Man, and to be an aſſiſtant to him. And in this ſenſe only his reaſoning is valid, and not by a general, and, if I may ſo ſpeak, mathematical deduction.</p>

               <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> e. About this difficult place of Scripture, I have written two years ago two Letters in anſwer to a Friend, who deſired to have my Opinion of it, which I ſhall here propoſe to the Readers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, declaring my ſelf ready to alter it whenever I ſee ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon. That part of thoſe Letters which relates to this matter is as follows.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:99486:184"/>I. I ſhall never forget that advice of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> than which nothing in ſuch matters can be more ſeaſonably call'd to mind: <hi>That in things obſcure and remote from our ſenſes, if ſo be we read any thing in Holy Scripture, which may without endangering the Faith we profeſs, be made to comply with different Opinions, we ſhould not raſhly eſpouſe any of them; or if we do, yet not ſo as to reſolve not to change our Judgment whatever light be offer'd to us afterwards, or to contend not ſo much for the ſenſe of the Holy Scriptures, as our own Opinion, as the true ſenſe of the Scripture, when it is our own, whereas we ought rather to make that to be ours which is the aſſertion of the Scripture.</hi> I have ſet down the whole Paſſage at length, to ſhew you that I am not ſo wedded to my preſent Opinion in this matter, as to reſolve that no reaſons ſhall move me to forſake it. Two things muſt here in the firſt place he obſerved. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Diſcourſe in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. is about Men and Women praying, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying among others at home: For the Women among the <hi>Greeks</hi> did not appear abroad without a Veil, nor therefore ſtand in need of the Apoſtle's Admonition, which no honeſt Matron ever acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to. And that ſome of their Neighbours or Acquaintance were preſent with them in thoſe Exerciſes is manifeſt; becauſe it is abſurd for a Woman praying by her ſelf to cover her Head, or to propheſy alone. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that as far as the <hi>fifteenth Verſe,</hi> the chief ſcope of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe is to ſhew the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Women, they ought not to propheſy or pray when Men were preſent, without being veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe two things I take here for certain, becauſe they offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Readers Mind at firſt view. After therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> had alledged Reaſons to that purpoſe, at the 10<hi>th</hi> Verſe he concludes thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>For this cauſe ought the Woman to have upon her Head,</hi> what? <hi>viz.</hi> a Veil, which the Apoſtle calls <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; To which I anſwer, becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a word much more common in Scripture than <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which occurs but once in all the New Teſtament, and not often in the Old. And many times it happen'd that the Tranſcribers ſubſtituted a more uſual and familiar word in the room of one leſs known, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> thought of the Name <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which occurs in <hi>Mat.</hi> xiii.35. The Apoſtle adds <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe it was not neceſſary for the Woman to cover her ſelf with a Veil at home, but only when ſhe went abroad, unleſs there was this or the like reaſon for it. They that make the diſcourſe here to refer to the Church, do not remember that it was unlawful for Women, covered or uncovered, to ſpeak in the Church, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches in this ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> xiv.34. But at home amongſt their Acquaintance nothing hinder'd but they <hi>might</hi> propheſy, if they had received that Gift from God; but they ought to have their Heads covered, as when they appeared in publick. This is my conjecture about this place, which I ſhall not abandon till I meet with ſomething more probable.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is a place of that nature, that as by its obſcurity it opens a door for Conjectures, ſo likewiſe it leaves room for innumerable Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; and it is no wonder that very great ones are objected againſt this of mine, which would not be a conjecture if thoſe who are of another opinion could bring no probability againſt it. Nevertheleſs what you alledg, I ſhall conſider as briefly as I can. 1. You ſuppoſe the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe here to refer to publick Aſſemblies, in which all or moſt of the Chriſtians of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> met. But it is plain St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids Women to ſpeak in publick Aſſemblies, either covered or uncovered, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But in private Converſation, ſay you, it does not ſeem probable that the Spirit of Prophecy was given: Why ſo? It's true, the principal uſe of it was in Churches, but it might be uſeful alſo ſometimes in private Converſation amongſt familiars, for Chriſtians to edify one another privately. And it is certain, Women had it not to preach, <hi>that</hi> being not allowed them by the Apoſtle. 2. But you ſay, tho it was not lawful for Women to teach others, yet they might <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>ſing</hi> in the Church, as the learned <hi>J. Mede</hi> interprets that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:99486:185"/>
word. I do not deny but the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has that ſignification, and is rendred by the Greek Interpreters <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but in the New Teſtament I do not know of any place wherein that word is ſo taken, and in this diſputation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> I am ſure that ſignification does no where agree to it. 3. That the fault of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Women lay in their coming to Church with their Hair all looſe, is no where intimated by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who would have much more vehemently inveighed againſt Chriſtian Women that ſhould have imitated the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Propheteſſes</hi> or <hi>Interpreters</hi> of impure Spirits. He does not ſay one word about their Hair being looſe or bound up, but ſpeaks only of a <hi>Veil.</hi> 4. But why did the Apoſtle call the pious Diſcourſes of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Women, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or predictions? In anſwer to that, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that the latter was the moſt common word, but the former alſo was uſed, as I have ſhewn. And then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies, at leaſt for the moſt part, the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf propheſied, not the <hi>act</hi> of propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not only the thing declared, but the Action it ſelf, or Office of declaring, if we believe <hi>Euſtathius</hi> on <hi>Iliad</hi> Λ. <hi>verſ.</hi> 140. where by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he thinks that <hi>Homer</hi> means <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And in this place I did not ſay that by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was meant the ſpiritual Gift of Prophecy, but either Prophecy, or the action it ſelf of propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what kind ſoever that be, which the Apoſtle has chiefly a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to; tho becauſe of their affinity they may be eaſily confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is taken both for the thing it ſelf preached, and for the Office or Action of preaching. 5. Another thing which you ſeem very much to ſtick at is, that this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is but once uſed in all the New Teſtament: but conſider <hi>firſt</hi> that it is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in <hi>Homer, Xenophon,</hi> and other Greek Writers, and therefore taken from the vulgar uſe. And then <hi>ſecondly,</hi> there are in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, as well as in other Authors, words that are but ſeldom uſed, as for inſtance <gap reason="foreign">

You add that in <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. the Apoſtle draws an Argument from the Cuſtom of the <hi>Churches</hi>; but that Cuſtom does no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect publick than private Aſſemblies; for the Apoſtle does not ſay, <gap reason="foreign">

Sect. 1. c. vii. §. 6. that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> ii.3. is this, that the <hi>Jews</hi> (meant by the word <hi>us,</hi> and not the <hi>Romans</hi>) were of as lewd and wicked a Diſpoſition as other Nations.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But in this place to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the word <hi>Nature</hi> does not ſignify properly a Cuſtom or Diſpoſition, but is oppoſed to Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

As to thoſe things which they have acquired the knowledg of by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not by Learning, they (viz.</hi> the Romans) <hi>incomparably go beyond the Greeks and all other Nations.</hi> The ſame Author in <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. thus beſpeaks <hi>Antonius: An verebare, ne non putaremus</hi> natura <hi>te potuiſſe tam improbum evadere, niſi acceſſiſſet etiam diſciplina?

I am contented if he does but any how interpret the ſenſe. But his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe of this Verſe is intolerable; for the Heathens did not believe that their Idols ſpake of themſelves, or that their Prieſts anſwered them of their own Heads, but were both moved by the Gods, whoſe Prieſts and Statues they were: So that the two firſt could not be charged upon them, and all that could be objected againſt them was, that it was not any <hi>God,</hi> as they ſuppoſed, that anſwered them by their Idols, but an evil Spirit. But the Apoſtle does not upbraid them ſo much as with that in this place, but only that they had formerly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves by their own blindneſs to be led to the worſhip of Idols, which gave no anſwers to them that enquired of them, either by their Prieſts or by evil Spirits; but were ſhamefully deceived by their crafty Prieſts, who pretended themſelves to be acted by the Spirit of the Gods, or by mere human artifice impoſed on the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, ſo as to perſwade them that Images could ſpeak, which were <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Verſ. 28. <hi>Note</hi> d. I. Of the difference between a <hi>Teacher</hi> and a Prophet, ſome things muſt be further obſerved, which our Author ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving omitted has left us not a little in the dark about this matter. The <hi>Prophets</hi> under the Old Teſtament had a twofold Office: The firſt and higheſt conſiſted in declaring thoſe things which they had received immediately from God, or by the mediation of Angels, and were ſuch as could not have been known by Men, without a Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: The other was to perſwade Men to the obſervation of the Law already revealed, by pious Exhortations, Reproofs and Counſels. And to this ſeems to belong thoſe Schools of the Prophets, ſo often mentioned in the Old Teſtament, and particularly in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xix.20. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> iv.38.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Worſhip of the only true God was to be firmly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> a generation of Men that chiefly regarded the things of this Life, and defended againſt the encroaching Idolatry of their neighbour Nations for ſeveral Ages, God ſaw it neceſſary to raiſe up Prophets, by inſpiring them in an extraordinary manner. And under the New Teſtament likewiſe, to eſtabliſh the Authority of the Apoſtles, God vouchſafed them and others the ſame extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Inſpiration; but as the Chriſtian Religion grew and flouriſhed, and by growing acquired Strength, the gift of foretelling things to come was by degrees more ſparingly conferred. And becauſe Chriſtianity did not much regard what was to happen in this World, but put Men upon the thoughts and expectations of another Life, the principal Office of the New Teſtament Prophets lay in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting thoſe things more clearly and at large, which were reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for the benefit of the common People.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:99486:187"/>
In which Office there are two things to be carefully diſtinguiſhed: <hi>one</hi> is, their preparation for the exerciſe of that Office, in which beſides natural Gifts, and Knowledg acquired by Induſtry, they were endued with the Holy Ghoſt, which was conferred on them by the impoſition of the hands of the Apoſtles, as appears from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv.14. <hi>Neglect not the Gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</hi> And tho we do not know how the Holy Spirit influenced their Minds, or what change it produced in them; yet it appears by what is afterwards ſaid about theſe Prophets by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that this was the effect of that divine Inſpiration, to fit them to preach the Goſpel: Which <hi>fitneſs,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, was all at once conferred upon them.</p>
               <p>And when they were thus made fit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for this Office, they executed it not by a particular ſort of Inſpiration, by which ſuch things were revealed to them as they knew not before, or which unaccountably and extraordinarily moved them to ſpeak, but as they ſaw fit themſelves; and thoſe things which they had received from Chriſt and the Apoſtles, they interpreted after their own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Which was the ground of thoſe Diſorders and Tumults in the Church, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in the 14<hi>th</hi> Chapter, when more Prophets than one would be heard at the ſame time. And hence this Gift did not ſuperſede the neceſſity of Study and diligent reading, as appears by that advice of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy: Till I come, give at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrin. Neglect not the Gift that is in thee,</hi> &amp;c. —<hi>Meditate upon theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are they whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>Prophets</hi>; the <hi>Teachers</hi> ſeem to be thoſe who had qualified themſelves for preaching the Goſpel on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Study, and had not received the extraordinary Gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The <hi>Prophets,</hi> for the moſt part at leaſt, did not teach by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but had been <hi>fitted</hi> to teach by Inſpiration; but theſe who are here peculiarly called <hi>Teachers,</hi> did not only teach without Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what they had learned, but had received no extraordinary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from God for the exerciſe of their Office. In which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar they were inferior to the Prophets, beſides that theſe did ſometimes foretel things to come. Unleſs this Interpretation be admitted, it will be hard to underſtand any thing that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays afterwards about Prophets.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As for theſe <hi>Teachers</hi> in that Age having been always Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Prieſts of the firſt Rank in the Church, I do not know whence that can certainly be concluded. I am ſure what our Author alledges
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:99486:188"/>
to that purpoſe, does by no means prove it; nor is there any reaſon from the thing it ſelf, which ſhould oblige us to be of his opinion.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> e. If the Apoſtles had ſhewn any other inſtances of ſeverity beſide that on <hi>Ananias,</hi> in the beginning of their Miniſtry, I do not think but St. <hi>Luke</hi> would have related them, and therefore I ſuppoſe they are other Miracles intended in <hi>Acts</hi> ii.43. But why doth St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſay there was ſuch a general fear upon that account? <hi>To wit,</hi> becauſe that fear might as well follow upon beneficial Miracles, as puniſhments inflicted on wicked Perſons; for any Miracles joined with a pious and reaſonable Doctrin, are capable of impreſſing an aw upon the Minds of Men, and making them afraid to oppoſe the Teachers of it, leſt they ſhould <hi>be found fighters againſt God.</hi> This is a much better Interpretation, than to ſay that the Apoſtles terrified Men by inflicting Diſeaſes upon them, and menacing them with Death; which they very ſeldom did, and could not have been frequently done without giving a fair occaſion to the enemies of Chriſtianity to cavil both at the Apoſtles conduct, and it. And I as little believe that this power belonged to all Governors of Churches, which we read of none that uſed beſides the Apoſtles, and thoſe to whom the Apoſtles did as it were lend it, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>: See <hi>chap.</hi> v.

                  </gap>.] What is ſaid in this Verſe, ſeems to be by way of conceſſion, and therefore ſhould be paraphraſed thus:
<q>For granting that he who ſpeaks in an unknown Language, does really uſe a Gift which he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God; yet he ſhould remember that he can ſpeak in that Language only to God, not to men who do not underſtand it, and to whom all that he ſays is unintelligible.</q>
It was certainly a piece of folly and arrogance, not to ſay any worſe of it, to ſpeak ſo as to be underſtood by no body; for it was a mere oſtentation of the Gift of Tongues. But there are ſome things to be obſerved with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that Gift, which our Author has paſt by, and will it may be give light to this whole Buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="1">I. They who received the Gift of Tongues, were doubtleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with them, in order to propagate the Goſpel among thoſe Nations whoſe Languages they were; whether they went into their
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:99486:191"/>
Countries, or diſcourſed with ſuch as came out of them: and therefore the time for uſing them was only when they could not be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in any other Language. Thoſe that were at that time at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and could ſpeak Greek, ought to uſe the Greek Tongue among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and not ſtrange Dialects which they could not underſtand, and for which they might be ſuſpected of Impoſture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no body underſtood them. For certainly one who could ſpeak Greek, and induſtriouſly uſed another Language among <hi>Grecians</hi> who underſtood nothing but their native Dialect, might not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be taken for a Deluder or Impoſtor.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But beſides <hi>Grecians,</hi> and thoſe who underſtood Greek, there were at <hi>Corinth</hi> ſome other People out of <hi>Africa, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> who reſorted thither for the ſake of Trade, and were unskilful in the Greek Language, and who having been converted by the Apoſtle to the Chriſtian Faith, had alſo received the Gift of Tongues, to enable them when they went into their own Country to preach the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong barbarous Nations. And theſe ſeem to be the firſt who might abuſe the Gift of Tongues in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>; as if for inſtance, a man that could ſpeak Latin, becauſe born and bred in <hi>Italy,</hi> had uſed the <hi>Illyrian, Celtick</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language, the knowledg of which had been conferred upon him by God, when no body was preſent that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood any of thoſe Tongues.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It muſt be acknowledged notwithſtanding, that a Grecian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Grecians, might, for example, ſpeak <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> that thoſe of his own Country might know he was inſtructed by God with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue; to which purpoſe there was need of an Interpreter, who by a faithful interpretation of what he ſaid, might ſhew that he did not ſpeak ſome fictitious Language, or uſe ſounds that had no ſenſe belonging to them, but the true <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language. For if he himſelf had firſt uſed a ſtrange Language, and then ſpoken in Greek what he had ſaid before in an unknown Tongue, he might be ſuſpected by thoſe who did not underſtand that ſtrange Language. But if no body were preſent, who could perform the Office of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter? It was better for the Perſon ſo miraculouſly endued with the knowledg of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language to hold his peace, leſt he ſhould ſpeak to thoſe who did not underſtand it, to no purpoſe, or become ſuſpected to the Hearers, if he himſelf ſhould take upon him to be his own Interpreter, or at leaſt by his proud oſtentation of an uſeleſs accompliſhment, at that inſtant of time, offend them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Theſe two ſorts of men St. <hi>Paul</hi> here reproves, who uſed the Gift of Tongues in an improper place and time, and prefers ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:99486:192"/>
as ſpake nothing but Greek to them. But you will ſay, Were not thoſe who preached the Goſpel in ſtrange Languages, alſo Prophets? Yes, undoubtedly; but not to thoſe who did not underſtand thoſe Languages, and therefore the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhes them from thoſe who ſpake only Greek. And he juſtly prefers a Grecian, endued on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Gift of Prophecy, and ſpeaking to his Countrymen in their own Language, to one who did not uſe the Gift of Prophecy, but of Tongues, among thoſe who did not underſtand them. Theſe things being diligently obſerved, which, if I am not miſtaken, are true, or very probable, the Apoſtle's whole diſcourſe will be perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which is otherwiſe very dark and intricate.</p>

So that by <gap reason="foreign">

<q>That is, not as our Author ſays, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he afterwards ſpeak in a known Language, what he had expreſſed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi>; for it would have been abſurd to ſpeak, for inſtance, in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> to <hi>Grecians,</hi> that which one ſhould be forced afterwards to ſpeak ones ſelf in Greek; but, he is a greater Prophet who propheſies in one known Language, than he that propheſies in many unknown, if he cannot deliver his mind without them in a known Tongue.</q>
A <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian,</hi> for example, who beſides the <hi>Punick,</hi> ſhould have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all the Dialects of the <hi>Mores</hi> and <hi>Lybians,</hi> could not be ſo much eſteemed at <hi>Corinth,</hi> as a <hi>Greek</hi> Prophet that underſtood only his <hi>native</hi> Language, unleſs he were able alſo to expreſs in <hi>Greek</hi> what he could ſay in the Language of the <hi>Mores</hi> or <hi>Libyans.</hi> This St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe he is ſpeaking of a man who did not underſtand Greek, and wanted an Interpreter among the Grecians, and ſo would have been his own, if he had underſtood that Language. No other Perſon can be intended, for who doubts but a native Grecian was able to ſpeak in his <hi>own</hi> Tongue what he ſaid in a ſtrange one? <hi>Grotius</hi> would have the Gift of Interpretation to be underſtood of <hi>a faithful Memory,</hi> but that is manifeſtly a harſh and far-fetch'd Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

                  </gap>.] Of one that could ſpeak Greek this cannot, as I have ſaid, be underſtood; for what need had any man of a miraculous Gift, to enable him to expreſs that in his Mother Tongue, which he himſelf ſpake in a ſtrange Language, if he did but underſtand what he ſaid? And every one that uſes a Language, the knowledg of which he has received from God, is ſuppoſed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he himſelf ſays; for he would <hi>really</hi> be <hi>a ſounding Braſs,</hi> or <hi>a Cymbal making a confuſed noiſe,</hi> who ſhould ſpeak words in a ſtrange Dialect, which yet he did not know the meaning of. <hi>Grotius</hi> interprets theſe words thus: <hi>Let him pray that he may faithfully retain in his memory what he ſpeaks outwardly with his Tongue, that ſo he may deliver the ſame things in Greek.</hi> But, <hi>firſt,</hi> this Interpretation does not agree with the ſenſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>to interpret,</hi> not <hi>to remember. Secondly,</hi> He ſuppoſes that thoſe who uſed ſtrange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, ſpake from Inſpiration, not their own thoughts, but what was ſuggeſted to them by the Spirit; which we have no certain ground to believe, nor is it probable it was ſo, at that time particularly, and in that place: For if this ſuppoſition of <hi>Grotius</hi> were true, the Holy Ghoſt would have inſpired a <hi>Corinthian</hi> to ſpeak, for example, in the <hi>Punick</hi> Language, in ſuch time and place as he would leaſt of all have ſtood in need of that Tongue, there being no <hi>Carthaginian</hi> preſent. But to what end I pray? Was it that he might hold his peace in the Church; in which certainly it would have been very improper to ſpeak in the <hi>Punick</hi> Dialect, if there was no body there that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it? Or was it that he might keep his skill in that Language till a fitter occaſion? But he had better have been inſpired with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the <hi>Punick</hi> Tongue, when there was need of that Inſpiration, leſt his memory ſhould not retain it, or there ſhould be occaſion for a new Miracle to confirm his memory. For if (which I obſerve in the <hi>third</hi> place in oppoſition to <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Interpretation) he could not have interpreted by his memory in Greek, what he had ſaid by heart and <hi>extempore</hi> in the <hi>Punick</hi> Language, without a Miracle, much leſs could he have performed that ſome time after. And the Interpretation which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> gives of theſe words in his Paraphraſe, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as inſignificant, unleſs we underſtand the Apoſtle to ſpeak of a Stranger that could not ſpeak Greek.</p>

That the Apoſtles did not falſly pretend themſelves to expect a Happineſs after this Life from Chriſt, but truly expected it; becauſe otherwiſe they would never have underwent ſo many Hardſhips and Dangers for his ſake. 2. That this their expectation was not vain, becauſe it was grounded upon the Reſurrection of Chriſt, whereof they were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and therefore credible, becauſe they ſuffer'd ſo much for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, and it was a thing in which they could not be deceived. This arguing has a great deal more ſtrength and certainty in it, than that of <hi>Cicero</hi> in a like matter, and grounded in part upon the ſame Topicks, <hi>Acad. Quaeſt.</hi> iv. where ſaith <hi>Lucullus: Ille vir bonus, qui ſtatuit omnem cruciatum perferre, intolerabili dolore lacerari potius, quam aut officium pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat aut fidem; cur has ſibi tam graves leges impoſuit, cum quamobrem ita oporteret nihil haberet comprehenſi, percepti, conſtituti?

That good Man who reſolves to undergo all manner of Torments, and to be torn in pieces with unſufferable pain, rather than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his Duty or Truſt; why has he impoſed upon himſelf ſuch ſevere Laws if he did not ſee ſufficient reaſon for him to do ſo? It is utterly impoſſible that any Man ſhould put ſuch a value upon Juſtice and Honeſty, as to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to any Tortures rather than act contrary to them, unleſs he have aſſented to ſuch things as cannot be falſe.</hi> And Tuſcul. Lib. 1. <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf ſpeaks thus: <hi>Neſcio quomodo inhaeret mentibus quaſi ſaeculorum quoddam augurium futurorum, idque in maximis ingeniis, altiſſimiſque animis &amp; exſtitit maxime &amp; apparet facillime; quo quidem demto, quis tam eſſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, qui ſemper in laboribus &amp; periculis viveret? I know not how, there abides in the Minds of Men as it were a preſage of a future State, and eſpecially in Perſons of the greateſt Capacity and deepeſt Thoughts, in whom it moſt eaſily diſcovers it ſelf; and if this apprehenſion was taken away, who would be ſo mad as to live perpetually in Troubles and Dangers?</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhews that thoſe Heathens believed another Life after this, but does not prove that they were not miſtaken. For it was poſſible they might be deceived by an Opinion taken up in their Childhood, for which they could produce no ſufficient Arguments. But the caſe of the Apoſtles was quite otherwiſe, who proved the reality of a future State by the Authority and Reſurrection of Chriſt; which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had ſeen, and confirmed the truth of by their Sufferings.</p>

By the ſame way of arguing we might prove, that bearing of Arms is not without a reward annexed to it: If thoſe that bore Arms were to have no reward for ſo doing, when ſo many Soldiers are continually killed, what ſhould they do who are liſted in the room of thoſe that are dead, and ſupply their place?

And Religion might well enough conſiſt with the opinion of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> tho the <hi>Sadduces</hi> who diſowned the Immortality of the Soul utterly overthrew it.

THE Epiſtles commendatory uſual among Chriſtians, did not ow their Original to the <hi>teſſerae hoſpitales</hi> of the Heathens, but to an univerſal cuſtom among all Nations of writing Letters of Recommendation in behalf of their Friends. And thoſe publick Letters which were ſent by the Biſhops of one Church to another, were inſtituted eſpecially upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Heathens and Hereticks, for fear Idolaters, or Perſons of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Opinions in the Faith, ſhould creep into the Churches, and make an ill uſe of their Liberality.

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:99486:199"/>
Jews or Gentiles, to preach the Goſpel. And it is certain that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jews nor Gentiles could any of them of their own heads have preached any thing like the Chriſtian Doctrin; but it was requiſite that thoſe firſt Preachers of the Goſpel ſhould receive the Evangelical Doctrin by Revelation from God and Chriſt, and be endued with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary extraordinary Gifts, to communicate the knowledg of it to others, ſuch as the power of working Miracles, a ſingular conſtancy and unweariedneſs of mind, and incredible patience to undergo all manner of Afflictions, and the like. Both the foregoing and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Context clearly ſhew, that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks about a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to preach the Goſpel, and nothing elſe; and therefore our Author ſhould have kept to that alone in his Paraphraſe.</p>

                  </gap> is meant the Law, as it was underſtood by the Jewiſh Doctors, in a literal or grammatical ſenſe, and ſo propoſed by them to the obſervation of their Diſciples; and by <gap reason="foreign">

But the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, the Goſpel, ſaves alone, without the obſervation of the Letter of the Law. This is the meaning here of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and not what our Author ſays in his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, which has no manifeſt ground in Scripture, but relies purely upon Theological conjecture.</p>

                  </gap> ſhould be ſo underſtood; for it is manifeſt that St. <hi>Paul</hi> compares the Apoſtles to frail and contemptible, and not precious or artificial Veſſels, ſuch as are made of the fineſt ſort of Shells. There is a clear oppoſition here put between the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Goſpel, and the meanneſs of its Preachers; or between the Power of God which exerted it ſelf in the Goſpel, and the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Note</hi> c. I fully agree with our learned Author in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words here, by the cuſtoms of the Heathens in their <hi>Agones.</hi> But there are ſome things to be obſerved on this Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is ſtrange he ſhould confound the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

It is manifeſt that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> interprets the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and this latter does no more ſignify <hi>to be cold</hi> than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but <hi>to be grieved</hi> or <hi>afflicted.</hi>

And indeed with whatever Arguments any Philoſopher came armed, or what ſublimity ſoever his Reaſonings ſeemed to have in them; if he attempted to diſturb the Church by Heretical Doctrins, and went to reſiſt the Apoſtles, as if he had found them in an error; the Apoſtles could preſently ſhew how much he was miſtaken, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Diſeaſe upon him, ſuch as Blindneſs, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> inflicted on <hi>Elymas,</hi> or delivering to Satan, to which others were ſubjected. For theſe were plain ſigns, by which it appeared that God approved of the Apoſtles Doctrin. But in ordinary Excommunication the caſe is otherwiſe: For all that can be concluded from <hi>that</hi> is, that when any one upon the ſpringing up of ſome new Controverſies, was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for diſagreeing with the Biſhop of the Church to which he belonged, the Biſhop and the reſt perhaps of the Clergy were of another Opinion; which might as eaſily be the worſe of the two as the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:99486:204"/>
better.<note place="margin">Chapter XI.</note> For Excommunication was a certain evidence of Mens differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among themſelves, but not that the excommunicate Perſon was in an error; becauſe one that had the Truth on his ſide, might be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by ignorant and prejudiced Perſons. But if any were chaſtiſed in the manner aforeſaid by the Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> by having a Diſeaſe inflicted on their Bodies, this was an infallible proof of their being Hereticks; becauſe God would not have ſuffered any pious orthodox Perſon to undergo a Puniſhment which he had not at all deſerved. Beſides, that a Miracle wrought in confirmation of any Doctrin, ſuch as this was, the preſent inflicting of a Diſtemper upon Mens Bodies, was of it ſelf ſufficient to ſhew the falſneſs of any thing advanced in contradiction to it, tho with ſome appearance of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; but certainly the Excommunication of any Biſhop, who might as eaſily abuſe his Authority, as others fall into Error, was no ſure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of any Man's being an Heretick. Theſe two things therefore muſt not be confounded, nor the ordinary Governors of the Church equal'd to the Apoſtles in their Cenſures, any more than in other Gifts and Endowments, as our Author occultly does, whether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly and knowingly I cannot tell, but I am ſure without reaſon.</p>

                  </gap>. Which becauſe learned Men have not ſufficiently underſtood, but have confounded things with words, I ſhall inſiſt on a little more at large.</p>
               <p>Orators differ in three things from the illiterate Vulgar, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing upon any Subject. <hi>Firſt,</hi> in <hi>Invention</hi> and choice of matter, in which they far ſurpaſs the ordinary ſort of People; but this I need not treat of, the Diſcourſe here being about Elocution. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> the rules of which are laid down by <hi>Rhetoricians,</hi> and are unknown to the Vulgar. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in <hi>Elocution,</hi> or choice of words and Sentences: And as to theſe two laſt, <hi>Idiots</hi> never equal Orators unleſs it be by chance, and in a very ſhort Diſcourſe. So that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a Stile or Diſcourſe, in which neither the Laws of Diſpoſition nor Elocution, ſuch as are laid down by the Maſters of Rhetorick, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; tho it be otherwiſe full of excellent Sentences, and ſhew the Speaker to have a great meaſure of Wiſdom and Knowledg.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> in <hi>Platone,</hi> §. 87. according to the opinion of <hi>Plato, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: Diſcourſe</hi> or <hi>Stile is divided into five kinds, whereof one is that which the Adminiſtrators of the Commonwealth make uſe of in publick Aſſemblies, and is called Political.</hi> Of this kind is the ſtile of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and other Orators, whoſe Employment lay in pleading at Court. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Another kind
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:99486:206"/>
of Stile is that which is uſed by Rhetoricians, and is for oſtentation, in which are written Encomiums, and ſatyrical Diſcourſes and Accuſations; and this kind we term Rhetorical.</hi> Such is the Stile of <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> and other Rhetoricians, who ſpent all their time in Schools. This latter kind has more of Grace and Ornament in it than the former, otherwiſe there is no difference between them. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>A third kind of Stile is that which Idiots,</hi> or illiterate Perſons, <hi>uſe in common diſcourſe; and this is called Idiotick.</hi> That is the Stile which I before deſcribed, and which is uſed by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And it is not oppoſed only to the painted Eloquence of Rhetoricians, but alſo to the Elegance of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, to whoſe Stile that of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> is much inferior. This as to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Writers of the New Teſtament, has been ſhewn at large by <hi>C. Salmaſius</hi> in Comment. <hi>de Lingua Hellen.</hi> Sect. 2. The other kinds of diſcourſe mention'd by <hi>Diogenes</hi> I omit, becauſe they are not to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But when I ſay that a <hi>Rhetorical</hi> or <hi>Political</hi> Stile excels that of the Vulgar or <hi>Idiotae,</hi> my meaning is not that it ſurpaſſed it only in <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which do not belong to the Matter, but alſo in <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> and Propriety of <hi>words,</hi> which very much contribute to the perſpicuity of any Diſcourſe. For which reaſon, one that is skilful in the Greek Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage may much more eaſily underſtand <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> than St. <hi>Paul</hi>; not only becauſe the ſtile of this latter has abundance of <hi>Hebrew Idioms</hi> in it, but becauſe the order of his Sentences is many times inverted, his Phraſes and Terms improper, and his Metaphors harſh. As <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> alſo, who wrote in an Idiotick Stile, and had no great regard to order or choice of words, is in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces very hard to underſtand. And ſuch are, among the Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and the Author <hi>Hiſtoriae Lauſiacae,</hi> in whoſe Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings often occur the like difficulties, proceeding from negligence of Stile.</p>
               <p>Which being ſo, I cannot ſufficiently wonder why <hi>Beza</hi> was ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> becauſe he did not admire St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Eloquence, which ſetting aſide his Matter, and conſidering only his Words, was certainly none at all. But let us hear <hi>Beza</hi> himſelf: <hi>Quid igitur,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>an imperitus loquendi Paulus, &amp; elinguis, ut Hieronimus exiſtimat? What then, did not St.</hi> Paul <hi>know how to expreſs himſelf, or had he not the uſe of his Tongue, as St.</hi> Jerom <hi>thinks?</hi> No, he was not ſo perfectly <hi>tongue-tied</hi> neither, that the Subſtance of his Diſcourſe and Doctrine cannot be underſtood; but his Stile is not ſo clear, nor his Expreſſion ſo elegant, as to make every thing that he ſays eaſy, or pleaſant to
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:99486:206"/>
critical Ears. St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not aim at that diſpoſition in his Words which might facilitate the underſtanding of a thing in it ſelf obſcure, or render his Diſcourſe more plain and perſpicuous: which <hi>Beza</hi> very well knew, and no one can be ignorant of who has read but St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles in Greek. But <hi>Beza</hi> goes on, and ſaith: <hi>Imo vero Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomum potius, &amp; doctiſſimos quoſque ex Graecis, ipſam denique rationem ſequutus quamvis nativa illa &amp; germana maſculae facundiae ornamenta ipſi videri poſſint non defuiſſe, fateor tamen illum fucatae illius rhetorices pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis uti noluiſſe. Yea rather following St.</hi> Chryſoſtom, <hi>and the moſt learned among the Greeks, and Reaſon it ſelf, tho thoſe native and genuin Ornaments of maſculine Eloquence ſeem not to have been wanting in him; yet I confeſs he uſes none of thoſe colours of falſe Rhetorick.</hi> But a clear way of ſpeaking, to begin with his laſt Words, and diſpoſing every thing we ſay in its right order, is no <hi>fucus.</hi> That artifice of thoſe Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricians who endeavor to magnify by words, things that are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inconſiderable, or skim over thoſe that are baſe, may properly be ſtiled <hi>fucus, daubing</hi>; but not apt Expreſſions, or ſoft Metaphors, and an orderly diſpoſition of every part in a Diſcourſe; in which the Speaker has no other end than to make himſelf eaſily underſtood, and carefully to avoid all Ambiguity, which might lead his Hearers into a miſtake. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſtile is not only without <hi>fucus,</hi> but deficient alſo in theſe things, which are not diſcommendable: So that if we <hi>follow reaſon,</hi> we ſhall never ſay that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was eloquent; provided it be remembred we are ſpeaking of words, or diſpoſition, and not of matter. That St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s matter is praiſed by St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and other Greek Fathers, and preferred before all the Arguments which the antient Greeks have treated of, I know, and none but a Mad-man will deny: but that they commended his Style, or the Order of his Words and Sentences as clear and elegant, I do not think; and if I did, their Authority would not move me, becauſe the contrary is ſo manifeſt. But they were not altogether ſo void of Underſtanding, as to attribute that Eloquence to St. <hi>Paul</hi> which he himſelf diſclaims. Nor does <hi>Beza</hi> himſelf diſagree with me in this matter, when he adds, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not make uſe of Rhetorick, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t vi ſpiritus hominum animos ad Chriſtum raperet, non autem Sermonis blanditiis, adulatorum more alliceret. That he might bring men to Chriſt by the Power of the Spirit, and not allure them after the manner of a Flatterer, by ſmoothneſs of Speech.</hi> Which is as much as if he had ſaid, Thoſe who are affected with what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, are affected with his Matter, not with his Words or Expreſſion, as being brought by the Spirit of God to an Enquiry and Love of the Truth, tho deliver'd in a rude Stile.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:99486:207"/>He adds: <hi>Cum orationis ipſius totam indolem &amp; characterem propius conſidero, &amp;c. When I more narrowly conſider the whole Strain and Form of his</hi> (the Apoſtles) <hi>Diſcourſe, I must needs ſay I never could ſee any ſuch Loftineſs in</hi> Plato <hi>himſelf, when ever he undertakes to thunder out the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God; any ſuch <gap reason="foreign">

Yet I do not deny but there occur even in St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, ſome Sentences admirably well expreſſed, but then they are but rare, and his Stile is for the moſt part barbarous, as the Speech or <hi>Idiotae</hi> uſes to be. But as things of ſmall moment in themſelves being ſet off with Rhetorical Colours, are and have been often admired; ſo on the other hand, things of the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance have many times made an obſcure and ill ordered Diſcourſe to be extolled; wheras thoſe two things ſhould be diſtinguiſhed and ſeparatly conſider'd.</p>

                  <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> in which it ſeems to ſignify the ſame, as it does in the words of <hi>Hippodamus,</hi> viz. in <hi>pag.</hi> 112. <hi>Ed. Francof.</hi> where he tells us, that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> uſed to ſay, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. But between theſe two, as there is no great difference in the ſound, ſo neither ſeemingly in the ſignification. And therefore Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> had no reaſon to think that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Heſychius</hi> was a corrupt reading for <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:99486:211"/>
ſame neceſſity of endeavouring to gain the favour of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as in <hi>Judaea.</hi> But there ſhould have been ſomething in St. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſupport this interpretation, otherwiſe it may very reaſonably be rejected, as I have already ſaid at the end of the <hi>Premonition.</hi> It is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that theſe diſturbers of the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> were <hi>Jews,</hi> and conſequently circumciſed, and had embraced the Goſpel, the Deſign and Virtue of which they did not however underſtand. I confeſs <hi>Grotius,</hi> in the Preface to his Annotations, had gone before our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in the contrary Opinion; but how great ſoever the Authority of that learned Man is with me, when it is not accompanied with ſolid Reaſons, it does not in the leaſt move my aſſent.</p>
               <p>He thinks that St. <hi>Paul is more vehement in this than in his other Epiſtles, becauſe thoſe who would have deprived the called among the</hi> Gentiles <hi>of their Liberty as to the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Ceremonies, were not</hi> Jews, <hi>whoſe zeal for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion might in ſome meaſure be excuſed, but Strangers who lived in</hi> Judaea, <hi>of whom the chief was</hi> Cerinthus. But it's true, it was a pardonable thing in the <hi>Jews themſelves</hi> to obſerve the antient Rites impoſed upon their Nation, and to be willing that the reſt of their Countrymen ſhould obſerve them, provided they were otherwiſe obedient to Chriſt; but to impoſe them upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and endeavour to make all the World ſubmit to the ſame Yoke, this ſurely could no more be born in the <hi>Jews</hi> than in others. Beſides, there is nothing here that gives the leaſt ground to think that thoſe who were ſo zealous for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies, were by birth <hi>Heathens.</hi> But <hi>Grotius</hi> goes on and ſays: <hi>And ſuch were thoſe who at</hi> Philippi <hi>taught the ſame Doctrine, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>himſelf tells us,</hi> Phil. iii.3. To which I ſay, it appears indeed by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words that there were ſome at <hi>Philippi,</hi> who gloried in the Circumciſion of the Fleſh; but they were <hi>Jews</hi> and not <hi>Gentiles: For we,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, are the Circumciſion, who worſhip God in the Spirit, and glory in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the Fleſh.</hi> In which words he has undoubtedly a reſpect to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who gloried in fleſhly Circumciſion, as the context evidently ſhews. So that I wonder that both <hi>Grotius</hi> and our Author ſhould alledg this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame Men,</hi> ſaith the learned <hi>Grotius, aſſerted the neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the Law of</hi> Moſes, not out of any <hi>principle of true Piety, but that they might grow rich and great by the aſſiſtance of the</hi> Jews. But I confeſs I do not ſee what Honors or Profits Men that were Heathens and Uncircumciſed could expect from the <hi>Jews,</hi> a People deſpiſed and hated by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that in a <hi>Roman</hi> Province, as <hi>Galatia</hi> ever ſince the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had been, as we are told by <hi>Strabo,</hi> Lib. 12.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:99486:212"/>
I wiſh either of theſe learned Men had eſſayed to prove more at large what they ſay, for they would preſently have perceived the vanity of ſuch an undertaking. But perhaps <hi>they thereby avoided thoſe preſſures which lay upon the Chriſtians, for in thoſe times the</hi> Jews, <hi>by the Roman Laws and Edicts, had the free exerciſe of their Religion; which the Chriſtians had not, but begun then to be perſecuted, as appears from the Acts, and other Epiſtles of St.</hi> Paul. To which I anſwer, if ſuch as were not heartily and really <hi>Jews,</hi> had a mind to eſcape perſecution, they ought rather to have feigned themſelves <hi>Heathens</hi> than <hi>Jews,</hi> in <hi>Galatia.</hi> Beſides, tho the <hi>Jews</hi> were allowed the profeſſion of their Religion in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they had not therefore any power granted them over others, ſo as to be able to do any hurt to the Chriſtians. They might indeed by Calumnies, and ſuch kind of unjuſt Methods, endeavour to miſchief them, but that was all they could do, as ſufficiently appears from the Acts of the Apoſtles. And they annoyed the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that way, who were reſolved to obey all Chriſt's commands, and firmly adhered to their purpoſe, whom upon that account they accuſed and charged with Sedition; but they could not moleſt Men, who if it were neceſſary feigned themſelves to be <hi>Heathens,</hi> of which ſort were the <hi>Gnoſticks.</hi>

Judaeorum,</hi> Lib. 1. cap. vii. It was only unlawful to converſe with them familiarly, and within the ſpace of four Cubits, as the ſame Author has proved at large. And if the Chriſtians at that time behaved themſelves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe towards the excommunicated, our Author would not have ſpent his time ill to have ſhewn it us: For it is not ſafe to judg of what was done in thoſe Primitive times, by the practice of latter Ages.</p>

                  <hi>ſeeming ſolaeciſms.</hi> But it matters not much by what name they are called, if we do but agree as to the thing. And it is univerſally acknowledg'd by thoſe who underſtand Greek, that there are a great many expreſſions in the Writings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which cannot accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rules of Grammar be reſolved into proper Conſtruction.

But there are two things which may make it appear that thoſe Authors are ill compared with St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that thoſe forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned defects do ſeldom occur in <hi>them,</hi> whoſe whole Diſcourſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe agreable to the Rules of Grammar, and has all thoſe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are requiſite to make it proper and elegant. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the ſtile of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is both deſtitute of all thoſe things which are ſo much admired and commended in any Diſcourſe, (I ſpeak of words and not of Matter) and has abundance of <hi>ſeeming Solaeciſms. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> the moſt elegant <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers, tho they were at the ſame time very well skilled both in Grammar and Rhetorick, do <hi>deſignedly</hi> ſometimes violate the Rules of Grammar for variety ſake, leſt their Stile ſhould ſeem too ſtudied and artificial; which therefore may be look'd upon as ſo many <hi>Figures,</hi> and a particular ſort of elegancy. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> naturally <hi>falls,</hi> as it were, into theſe kind of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, becauſe regarding things and neglecting words, he thought it enough if he were underſtood by an attentive and diligent Reader, who loved the Truths he declared. So far is he from <hi>deſignedly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifying</hi> his Diſcourſe with that kind of Negligence, that he does not ſeem to have aimed at ſo much as the common ornaments of Stile. Let us hear about this matter <hi>Quintilian,</hi> in Lib. 9. cap. 3. <hi>Eſſet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>omne ſchema vitium, ſi non peteretur, ſed accideret. — Virtus eſt, ſi habet probabile aliquid, quod ſequatur. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na tamen in re maxime utilis, ut quotidiani &amp; ſemper codem modo formati ſermonis faſtidium levet, &amp; nos a vulgari dicendi genere defendat.

But there is one thing in which it is moſt uſeful, and that is to take away that nauſeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is bred, by forming our Diſcourſe always after the ſame manner, and to keep us from a vulgar way of expreſſion: Which if any one ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe, and only when the thing requires it, it will give a grateful reliſh as it were to his Diſcourſe. But if he unneceſſarily affects it, he will loſe all that agreableneſs which a Variety would otherwiſe cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. Now I do not think there is any one will ſuppoſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> purpoſely <hi>choſe</hi> thoſe harſh and frequent <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to make his Diſcourſe leſs diſtaſtful to his Readers. And therefore it remains that they be looked on as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and <hi>Imperfections,</hi> which yet are no prejudice to his matter, becauſe the Goſpel is a very plain and eaſy thing, which does not need to be illuſtrated by any Light d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

I don't think he look'd himſelf into St. <hi>Jerom</hi> when he ſent us to that place: For otherwiſe he would certainly have cited him with more care, and inſtead of thoſe Divines which he alledges, appealed to the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> whoſe Authority is much more conſiderable.

                  </gap>, as if it therefore ordinarily ſignified the ſame with the Hebrew uſed in that place. One ſingle place in the <hi>Septuagint</hi> where they arbitrarily fix a ſenſe upon a word which they could not properly render, does not change the uſe of a Language, as I have already elſewhere ſuggeſted: For they uſed the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>The Jews, who believe in Chriſt, have not forſaken their antient Law; for they live according to it, and are ſurnamed from the poverty of their Law. For</hi> Ebion <hi>in the Hebrew Language ſignifies Poor; and thoſe of the Jews who receive Jeſus as the Chriſt, are called</hi> Ebionites. And it's true that in Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ebjon,</hi> is uſed indeed for Poverty, but never for Folly that I know of, tho I have made diligent ſearch. But to ſpeak what I think, I am of opinion that this name of <hi>Ebionites</hi> belonged to ſome poor <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who had embraced the Goſpel; but not being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently acquainted with its Doctrins, had mixed their antient Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with it: which mixture they too obſtinately adhered to, when they might have learned better from the Apoſtles and other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The reaſon why I think they were <hi>Samaritans</hi> and not <hi>Jews,</hi> is this very conſiderable one, that they received only the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and rejected the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in their Hereſy tells us, which was a principal part of <hi>Samaritaniſm.</hi> See <hi>Num.</hi> xv. It's certain the <hi>Ebionite</hi> who wrote the <hi>Clementine Homilies,</hi> alledges only the Law: Nor is it any wonder that theſe Men were <hi>poor,</hi> becauſe they were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally hated, both by <hi>Jews, Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> who none of them took any care to relieve their Neceſſities.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But I do not think that St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath a reference here to theſe Hereticks, becauſe he upbraids them with nothing but their obſtinate adherence to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies; the obſervation of which they endeavoured to impoſe alſo upon the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Our learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will have them to be the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> whom for that reaſon he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents as the Promoters of all kind of Hereſies. But whereas the Caſe as to the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> is doubtful, it is certain that the <hi>Jews</hi> of that Age who had received <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were very zealous for having the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites obſerved; and there is nothing ſaid here by the Apoſtle which does not exactly agree to them. And therefore we ought not to feign St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have had any other Adverſaries. Tho if any one think fit to call ſome of the Jews <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> becauſe they boaſted of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary meaſure of <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">III. The Alluſion which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſuppoſes the Apoſtle here might have to the name of <hi>Ebionites,</hi> is vain: for it is not true that their name ſignifies <hi>folly</hi>; nor is it neceſſary, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Verſ. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.] All theſe <hi>Verſes</hi> I ſhall interpret together, becauſe tho they are disjoined in place, they are united in ſenſe. In interpreting the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and enquiring into its nature, the firſt thing to be taken care of, is, that we do not confound things which are diſtinct, that is, the Law it ſelf as it is recorded in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and may be underſtood according to a literal and ſimple interpretation of the words, with the Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> prevalent in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, and againſt which he here diſputes. For otherwiſe we ſhall hardly be able to reconcile St. <hi>Paul</hi> with <hi>Moſes,</hi> or with right Reaſon.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as it is ſet down in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> we ſhall plainly perceive that it was very difficult indeed to obſerve all the Rites therein preſcribed; but yet that it was not ſuch as that the performance of it was impoſſible, as I have ſhewn on <hi>Deut.</hi> xix.9. And indeed <hi>Moſes</hi> every where ſuppoſes that it might be obſerved, as all Lawgivers alſo do; and if they did not, there ſhould be no Laws made, becauſe it is abſurd to make Laws which cannot be kept, and unjuſt to puniſh Men for not doing what they cannot do. Nor indeed is the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo very ſevere, as not to pardon the leaſt Sin, or to require ſuch a degree of Holineſs as is above human ſtrength: As appears only by two things which put the matter beyond all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God had inſtituted Sacrifices for ſome Sins; I do not mean <hi>ritual,</hi> but <hi>moral,</hi> upon the offering up of which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to forgive the penitent Offender; of which we have ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in <hi>Levit.</hi> v.4. &amp; vi.2. <hi>&amp; ſeqq. Secondly,</hi> That he ſuffered Divorces, which were contrary to Charity, and might be attended with very great Inconveniences, as every one eaſily ſees. Such is the Law conſidered in it ſelf, if we examin it a little more cloſely.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Jews</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, had got quite another Notion of it, and boaſted it to be the moſt compleat and perfect Pattern of Sanctity imaginable; as appears by ſeveral places in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and particularly in his Books againſt <hi>Appio,</hi> and of them chiefly the 2<hi>d.</hi> And it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing to ſay that the <hi>Jews</hi> otherwiſe thought, and did thoſe things which ſhew that they ought not to have had ſuch a Notion of their Law, if they would be conſiſtent with themſelves; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they frequently both did and ſpake Contradictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:99486:216"/>The ſame Perſons interpreted ſeveral places in the Law, not <hi>gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically,</hi> as <hi>Lawyers</hi> uſe to do the Roman Laws, but <hi>Theologically</hi>; that is, not with a bare regard to the uſe of the Language and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the Diſcourſe, but to their Opinions, with which they made the Law to agree, as is evident from ſeveral places in <hi>Philo, Joſephus,</hi> and the <hi>Talmudical</hi> Doctors. For they made their Traditions equal to the Law, which Chriſt often upbraids them with. As for inſtance, The <hi>Rabbins</hi> uſed (as appears by the Verſion of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and the Citations of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place) to interpret <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvii.26. as if the meaning of <hi>Moſes</hi> there was, that God required of them the moſt perfect Holineſs, which if they did not perform, they were to expect to be curſed by him. But in reality, all that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, is only that the People were to curſe him <hi>that did not confirm the words of the Law to do them,</hi> as I have ſhewn in my Notes on that place.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> who diſputes here againſt the Jews, and endeavours to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them with their own Weapons, reaſons from theſe Opinions of theirs, and ſhews that ſuppoſing the Truth of what they aſſerted, it was manifeſtly impoſſible any Man ſhould be accounted juſt before God by the Law, becauſe they acknowledged that all men were Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. So that it is all one as if the Apoſtle had ſaid:
<q>You ſay, O Jews, that ye expect Juſtification from God by the Law, and think that the Law is a moſt perfect Rule of Life. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that you lie under the Curſe of the Law, becauſe you have not perfectly kept it, for you do not pretend to be abſolutely ſinleſs; and by your own conceſſion, the Law denounces a Curſe upon all that do not perfectly obey it. So that you cannot hope for Juſtification by the Law, but muſt ſeek it from the Goſpel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If it be enquired how I know St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not reaſon here from the thing it ſelf, but upon the Jews Principles? I anſwer, By his citing the place of Scripture here alledged, not as it really is, but according to the Interpretation of the <hi>Rabbins.</hi> For the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> are theſe: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Curſed be he that confirmeth not the words of this Law, to do them.</hi> Which the <hi>Septuagint</hi> render, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And theſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> follows as far as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but then changes the reſt into <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But doubtleſs he would never have alter'd any thing in the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor followed the <hi>Septuagint</hi> at all, but render'd the Hebrew himſelf exactly, if he had reaſoned from the bare Authority of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> and not from the Opinion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And it is common with St. <hi>Paul</hi> to cite the Old Teſtament, ſo as it
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:99486:216"/>
was uſually alledged by the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>darſchanim</hi>; that is to ſay, with little regard to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the place, or the proper ſignification of the words, and to argue from them ſo alledged, becauſe that was the cuſtom of the <hi>Jews.</hi> See but the place cited out of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> Chap. ii.4. in <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.] That is, by perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, for the <hi>Law</hi> and a pattern of perfect Holineſs was the ſame in the opinion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And the thing it ſelf is true, tho the <hi>Jews</hi> had a wrong Notion of the Law's perfection; which truth of the thing it ſelf made St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſs himſelf as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, tho not ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately as they ſhould have done.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.] There are three things here worth our enquiring into, which moſt other Interpreters ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely paſs over. <hi>Firſt,</hi> who are meant by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> us; <hi>Secondly,</hi> what is <hi>the Curſe of the Law; Thirdly,</hi> how <hi>Chriſt has redeemed us from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>us</hi> we are to underſtand the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> himſelf and his Countrymen the <hi>Jews</hi> to whom the Law was given, not all Mankind. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the thing it ſelf, becauſe other Nations were utter Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which cannot be ſaid to have been given to ſuch as were always ignorant of it. Nay it was not given ſo much as to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, who were born after the revelation of the Goſpel, and much leſs yet to Chriſtians tho they knew it; becauſe it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready abrogated before they came to the knowledg of it, yea before ever they had a being. The following words alſo ſhew that the <hi>Jews</hi> are oppoſed to the <hi>Heathens</hi> in this Verſe: and therefore what Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> here ſays in his Paraphraſe, about the redemption of <hi>Men</hi> in general, tho it be true, does not belong to this place, becauſe the Diſcourſe is not about <hi>all Mankind,</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi> only.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Curſe of the Law</hi> here ſpoken of, ſeems to be that mentioned by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvii. and denounced upon thoſe who were guilty of ſeveral Impieties, and, as I before obſerved, who refuſed to <hi>confirm the Law,</hi> and did not think themſelves obliged by it. And thoſe who were <hi>ſo</hi> curſed, could not expiate their Sins by any Sacrifice, but ought to be puniſhed with Death; which becauſe it could not always be inflicted, (as in caſe the Crime or its Author was not known) therefore the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo offending had a Curſe denounced upon him, or was pronounced worthy of all manner of Evils and Calamities: See my Notes on that Chapter of the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> It is certain whilſt the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in force, or before it was abrogated by God, all the <hi>Jews</hi> ought to have engaged to obſerve it; and it was not lawful for them to ſay
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:99486:217"/>
that they would not be obliged by it, or live otherwiſe than according to its preſcription. And if any of them did ſo, they unavoidably ſubjected themſelves to the Curſes of the Law: Nay thoſe who thought the Law required perfect Holineſs, and yet did not think themſelves perfectly Holy, ought, if they would be ſelf-conſiſtent, to look upon themſelves as under the Law's Curſe.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt having eſtabliſhed a New Covenant, whereby that old Moſaical one was aboliſhed through his Death, did at the ſame time free the <hi>Jews</hi> from all the curſes contained in the Law; for whoever brings in a new Covenant, and makes new Laws, abrogates the old: Only that the <hi>Jews</hi> might partake of that Redemption, or be abſolved from the neceſſity of obſerving the Moſaical Law, and exempted from its Curſes, it was requiſite they ſhould embrace the Goſpel-Covenant, and keep it. And thus the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>redeemed from the Curſes of the Law,</hi> but not the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were never obnoxious to them, and, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in <hi>Rom.</hi> i. ſhall be <hi>judged without the Law.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> might therefore, after the New Covenant's being eſtabliſhed by the Death of Chriſt, deny that they were any longer obliged by the Law, and neglect its preſcriptions where they diſagreed with the Goſpel, without any fear of its curſes, to which God from that time ceaſed to have any regard.</p>

                  </gap>, as is rightly obſerved by <hi>Grotius</hi>; for nothing worſe could have befallen a Man whom the Law curſed, than Crucifixion. And <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is <hi>in our room:</hi> for as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is killed in our ſtead, and ſuffers that Death which we deſerved; ſo Chriſt died in the ſtead of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all Mankind.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.] Of this place I have treated at large on <hi>Deut.</hi> xxi.23. and I ſhall not here repeat what I have there ſaid. All that remains is to ſhew that St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not diſagree with <hi>Moſes: Moſes</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>he that is hanged is the curſe</hi> or <hi>abomination of God,</hi> that is, according to the Statutes of the Law, a very polluted thing. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> follows the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> excepting that he omits the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which they have, becauſe indeed it is not neceſſary, nay in the Greek Language might have bred a miſtake: For all that the Apoſtle means is this, that Chriſt was dealt with by the <hi>Romans</hi> as a vile Malefactor, tho he was perfectly innocent, and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:99486:217"/>
underwent a very infamous Puniſhment, which according to the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Jews,</hi> render'd the Perſon ſo ſuffering a polluted thing; and a greater and more diſgraceful than which could not have been inflicted upon the moſt profligate and curſed Offender. So that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is here the ſame with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the foregoing words. If St. <hi>Paul</hi> had added, <hi>by God,</hi> tho according to the Hebrew phraſe that ſignifies no more than what I have here ſaid, and ſhewn in my Notes on <hi>Deuteronomy</hi>; yet thoſe who underſtood only Greek might have been offended with an expreſſion which ſeemed to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>that Chriſt was curſed by God,</hi> that is, hateful to God; which is ſo far from Truth, that God was always well pleaſed with Chriſt, and eſpecially then when he beheld him on the Croſs, performing or having performed the higheſt Office of Love to Mankind, and moſt ſignal inſtance of ſubjection to himſelf. It is certainly known that the <hi>Jews,</hi> who from that time did not ſufficiently underſtand the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language, abuſed that phraſe. <hi>Nobis,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Jerom</hi> on this place, <hi>ſolet a Judaeis pro infamia objici, quod Salvator noſter &amp; Dominus ſub Dei fuerit maledicto. It is a thing we</hi> (Chriſtians) <hi>are often upbraided with by the Jews, as a matter of diſgrace, that our Lord and Saviour was under the curſe of God.</hi>

And he has ſo freed the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Moſaical Yoke, as at the ſame time to provide that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> upon whom it was never impoſed, and who by thoſe Ceremonies were kept off from having any communion with the <hi>Jews,</hi> might, ſetting aſide the obſervation of thoſe Rites, be adopted into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, become partakers of the ſame benefits with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and embracing the Goſpel, receive the gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as well as the believing <hi>Jews.</hi>

                  <hi>elements</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion. And thoſe who are taught only the Elements of a thing, are ſtill under a Schoolmaſter. This might be proved by other Arguments if it were neceſſary: So that what in it ſelf was true and relied upon firmer grounds, <hi>that</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> proved alſo from the Jewiſh Opinion, by this means the more effectually to put the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſilence, a thing which he often does. Such is the perverſneſs of Mankind, eſpecially in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are not moved ſo much by cogent Reaſon, as by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and opinions taken up in their Childhood. Such is the pride of Mens Hearts, that they cannot bear to have their Errors confuted or inveigh'd againſt, eſpecially when their miſtakes are of a long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and grown inveterate, or when thoſe who are charged with Error have been always judged by their own party to be in the right, and look'd upon as learned and judicious Men. And for theſe reaſons <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Apoſtles reproved as few of the <hi>Jews</hi> miſtakes as they could, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe only which would not conſiſt with Chriſtianity; but their other prejudices that had no very bad conſequences attending them, and which their obſtinacy would not ſuffer the eradication of to be attempted without manifeſt danger, they choſe rather to bear with, and to reaſon againſt them upon their own principles, becauſe they perceived that that way of arguing had the greateſt influence upon them.

And there is no doubt but he means the Moſaical Law; whence it may be again inferred that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not think, with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that that Law was a perfect rule of Sanctity: For if he had been of that mind, how could he have called it <hi>the Elements of the World,</hi> and <hi>weak and beggarly Elements?</hi> The <hi>elements</hi> are the rude beginnings of any Art or Science, and far from containing the whole art in its greateſt Extent and utmoſt Perfection.

               <p>But it will be ſaid, it may be that St. <hi>Paul</hi> has a reference to the Ceremonial part of the Law, and not that which is Moral.

What the Moral Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> commands is indeed Good and Holy, and what it forbids Evil; but it is not a perfect rule of Holineſs, that is, it does not command every thing that is Holy, nor forbid every thing that is evil. For inſtance, Husbands loving their Wives to ſuch a degree as to bear with their Manners, and never to put them away but in caſe of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:99486:220"/>
Adultery, is a vertue not enjoined in the Moſaical Law; as the contrary Inhumanity in putting them away at every turn, is not therein prohibited, nay is expreſly permitted, if they did but give them a Bill of Divorce. See <hi>Mat.</hi> v.31, 32.</p>

For on the effuſion of that Spirit upon them, the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſuch as of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> had embraced the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, perceived that they were then much more bountifully dealt with than when they were under the Law, and called upon God afterwards with greater aſſurance, no longer now behaving himſelf as a hard Maſter, or requiring the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſuperfluous Rites upon the ſevereſt Penalties, but as a moſt gracious and compaſſionate Father. Whence that Spirit is ſaid <hi>to cry Abba Father,</hi> that is, to make the <hi>Jews</hi> upon their Converſion to the Chriſtian Religion, to look upon God as a Father and not as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Maſter. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by <hi>the Spirit of his Son</hi> may be meant ſuch <hi>an affection of Mind</hi> towards God as was in his <hi>Son</hi>; as the <hi>Spirit of Elias</hi> and the like.

And indeed the Rewards and Puniſhments of the Jewiſh Law, which in a literal ſenſe were only temporal, could not have ſuch an influence upon the Minds of Men, as to bring them to any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Vertue. For tho they might reſtrain them from committing thoſe Sins which would have render'd them infamous in the Eyes of others, or expoſed them to civil Puniſhments; yet they could not keep them from doing a great many things contrary to true Vertue; of which ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> v. and what is ſaid by <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on that Chapter. In this ſenſe therefore the Law was <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Further, the <hi>Galatians</hi> who <hi>when they knew not God, did ſervice unto them which by nature are not Gods,</hi> are ſaid here by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon their defection to <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> to have turned <hi>to the weak and beggarly Elements, whereunto they deſired again to be in bondage</hi>; becauſe, as I have already ſuggeſted, they had gone over from <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> to <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> before they became Chriſtians. There is no doubt but many of thoſe who firſt believed the Goſpel among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were before <gap reason="foreign">

I remark this, becauſe <hi>Grotius,</hi> who on <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. had obſerved that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> unmindful of what he had there affirmed, tells us that the <hi>Galatians</hi> are ſaid here to return to the <hi>elements of Piety; non quod Judaizaſſent antea, ſed quia multa uſurpaſſent cum Judaeis communia, ut ciborum delectum, dierum diſcrimina,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Not becauſe they had judaized before, but becauſe</hi> (whilſt they were Heathens) <hi>they had a great many Cuſtoms common to them with the</hi> Jews, <hi>as the diſtinction of Meats, and Days,</hi> &amp;c. But that he is miſtaken is evident, becauſe it is the Jewiſh Law that was before called <hi>the Elements of the World,</hi> on which words he has an excellent Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:99486:221"/>
and becauſe the following Verſe here clearly ſhews that they are ſaid to return to the Jewiſh Ceremonies; not to ſay how manifeſt that is from the whole ſeries of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s diſputation in this place.

                  </gap>;] That is, do not ye underſtand the Law, or do ye not hearken to it attentively when it is read to you? It deſerved here to be noted, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues from ſome received <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>midraſch</hi> vulgarly known: For if that Allegory, whereof he here ſpeaks, had not been before heard of, he would have had no reaſon to wonder that the <hi>Galatians</hi> had never collected any ſuch thing from the Story which he refers to; it being not at all neceſſary that the words of Scripture ſhould have any ſuch allegorical ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as that is, ſuppoſed to belong to them. And therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it was a known Allegory, tho perhaps ſomewhat otherwiſe expreſſed by the <hi>Jews.</hi>

               <p>Further; ſeeing this Interpretation could not be urged againſt thoſe, who might deny that the Scripture ought to be ſo underſtood, and the Apoſtle does not make uſe of his Authority to confirm it, it is evident that he argues here from what was generally allowed. Which
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:99486:222"/>
kind of things it is not material ſhould be true or well grounded, as long as they contain nothing in them prejudical to Piety, and are believed by thoſe againſt whom we diſpute. So that from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s uſing ſuch an Allegory againſt the Judaizing <hi>Galatians,</hi> it does not follow that we in this Age are bound to admit it, as a ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven to the Apoſtle. For if we throughly conſider it, we ſhall find that moſt which has ever been ſaid by learned Men againſt this way of interpreting Scripture in general, may be objected againſt this particular Allegory.</p>

               <p>This kind of Allegories muſt be carefully diſtinguiſhed from the Allegories of <hi>Homer</hi> and other Poets: For the Greek Grammarians, and eſpecially their Philoſophers, affirmed that a great many things which were ſaid by their Poets about the Gods, were falſe in a proper ſenſe, and never really happened; but in another obſtruſe and ſecret ſenſe were true. Whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> did not deny but that their Hiſtories were true, but from real events deduced Conſectaries belonging to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, as if thoſe events had been as ſo many repreſentations of other things. <hi>Heraclides Ponticus</hi> in his little Treatiſe <hi>de Allegoriis Homericis,</hi> gives us this true definition of a Poetical Allegory; <gap reason="foreign">

I have often obſerved that learned Men ſupply out of their own Invention what is wanting in the Teſtimonies of the Antients; and afterwards thence draw Concluſions, as grounded upon the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Authority of Antient Writers; which yet is certainly no good way of arguing.</p>

<q>Theſe things uſe to be allegorically explained by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and may be interpreted ſo as to ſignify what I a little before ſaid. <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> are as it were the Symbols of two Covenants; the latter, viz. <hi>Hagar,</hi> of the Covenant given from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Laws of which impoſe nothing but Slavery upon thoſe who ſeek to be juſtified by it. 25. (And <hi>Hagar</hi> is ſo much the more fitly ſaid to be an emblem of the Covenant delivered from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> becauſe her name ſignifies a <hi>Rock.</hi>) And to that Covenant, of which the Servantmaid <hi>Hagar</hi> was an Image, belongs the earthly <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which is entirely taken up in the obſervation of ſervil Rites, and acted by a ſlaviſh Fear. 26. But <hi>Sarah</hi> the free Woman is a Symbol of the Evangelical Covenant, according to the Laws of which the Citizens of the Spiritual <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> live, that is, all we Chriſtians.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle undoubtedly alludes to the name of <hi>Hagar,</hi> which being written with an ח, according to the uſual confuſion of the gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Letters, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>hhagar,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Rock</hi> among the <hi>Arabians.</hi> It is probable that the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were no very great Friends to the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> ſaid a great many things <hi>by way of Allegory</hi> out of the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to extol their Nation, and on the contrary to depreſs the <hi>Hagarens</hi>; and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here applies to thoſe who were <hi>Iſraelites</hi> according to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> what the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to ſay in honour of their Nation; as on the contrary to the <hi>carnal Jews,</hi> what they often aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the diſadvantage of the <hi>Hagarens.</hi>

                  <p>We take you at your word, O <hi>Jews,</hi> that antient Events did ſhadow out and repreſent things future.

For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if it was of old revealed to the Prophets, they underſtood it; for that which is not underſtood cannot be thought revealed. And if it could have been gathered from the literal ſenſe of any Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the Angels might have underſtood it by thoſe Prophecies. But the event, you will ſay, which is the beſt Interpreter of Prophecies, has unfolded the ſenſe of them. But I demand whether ſuch an event can be eaſily ſuppoſed to be reſpected in Prophecies, which are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, that neither Men nor Angels could before underſtand them to contain any ſuch ſenſe? If that can be ſuppoſed, I do not ſee what event may not be found in them.

So that in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Verſe there can be no room for any enquiry about the Heart: tho the Heart be as it were the workhouſe of the Blood, in which the vital Moiſture is temper'd, and whence it is ſpread by a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal flowing through the whole Body, St. <hi>Paul</hi> has no reference at all to that, but to the <hi>effluvia</hi> of the Brain, from which proceed Spirits, that help the motion of the Blood, and moiſten the whole Body; and ſo the Body, which would otherwiſe wither and decay, is made to encreaſe.</p>

So that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>Note</hi> h. I. I confeſs I do not ſee any alluſion in the words of the Apoſtle to thoſe three kinds of angry Perſons mention'd here by our Author out of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> He teaches us that all exceſſive Anger is to be avoided, but he does not ſeem to refer to the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by that Philoſopher between the ſeveral degrees of Anger; at leaſt there is no ſign of it in his words. Beſides, why did not the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſay that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a reſpect to <hi>four</hi> ſorts of angry Perſons, ſeeing ſo many ſorts are reckon'd up by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? The reaſon of that, I ſuppoſe, was becauſe he did not look into <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, but cited his words upon truſt; for what he alledges out of him is not in either of thoſe places which he refers to, but in <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11.

But St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems principally to refer to the Gift of Prophecy, which lewd Diſcourſe corrupted and renderd uſeleſs. For it appears by other places, that thoſe who had received that Gift were obliged to preſerve it by care and holineſs of Life, which if they neglected to do, it was taken away from them. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv.14.</p>

                  </gap> that is, hath ſent with Power and Inſtructions, as you may ſee by his Miracles, which are as the Seal of God, for which ye ought to believe me. But the <hi>Epheſians</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>ſealed to the day of Redemption,</hi> by a Metaphor taken from Merchandizes or Slaves, which the buyer did not take away with him as ſoon as he had bought them.

               <p n="3">III. I cannot ſee to what purpoſe our Author, tho it is but by the way, ſets down the Etymology of the word <hi>ſervi</hi> from <hi>ſervando,</hi> when he is explaining an Author who wrote in Greek, and could not have any reſpect to that Latin word.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Our Author's interpretation of the words, <hi>to grieve the Holy Spirit,</hi> and <hi>to the day of Redemption,</hi> is perfectly forced. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle is this:
<q>Ye that have received Gifts from the Holy Spirit, do not either by neglecting them or deſpiſing them grieve him, and provoke him to take away from you thoſe things which he has given you, to diſtinguiſh you from other Men even in this World; till that day comes, in which in the view of Men and Angels, he will diſtinguiſh you from all the reſt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity.</q>

               <p n="1">I. It is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>or</hi>; but it is very often alſo a Disjunctive, and connects together words of a different ſenſe.

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:99486:232"/>
the time,</hi> ſignifies to delay, or put off as long as poſſible; that only Notion of it ſhould have been kept to; and not things of an Affinity with it, or very diſtant from it mixed together, as they are here by our Author, that he might have an occaſion to obtrude his <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> upon us: See <hi>Grotius</hi> on this place. St. <hi>Paul</hi> here adviſes the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to endeavour by all lawful means to get time allowed them by the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and to take heed leſt by their raſh fervour they ſhould bring Perſecution upon themſelves, eſpecially in an evil and troubleſom time, ſuch as that was wherein he wrote this Epiſtle; which was towards the end of <hi>Nero</hi>'s reign, or thoſe black and diſmal days in which that monſter of a Man outdid all that ever went before him in Wickedneſs and Villany. The reaſon of the Apoſtle's Admonition is this, that there was a time coming wherein the Truth might be defended with leſs danger. And the nature of Truth is ſuch, that if it have but time allowed it, and is not preſently extinguiſhed, tho it lie cover'd as it were under Aſhes for a while, yet afterwards in a fitter time it ſhines out, and makes an univerſal day. So that thoſe who defend it, ought never, as long as they can avoid it, to run all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or undergo the laſt hazard, that it may either triumph inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over Falſhood, or elſe unavoidably be oppreſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>Now I am apt to think that this phraſe had its riſe from the cuſtom of Debters, who when paiment is demanded of them, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſtore the whole ſum or principal due, obtain a longer time to diſcharge their Debt in, either by a preſent Fee, or by advancing the uſe of the Mony lent them. For this is truly <hi>to redeem time</hi>; whence it afterwards came to paſs, that becauſe the ſolution of a Debt is thus deferred, therefore to defer or delay is ſometimes called <hi>to redeem the time.</hi> Parallel to this is the Latin phraſe <hi>moram acquirere,</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in <hi>Cicero</hi> pro <hi>Caecina</hi> cap. ii. or Num. 6. where the Delegates, who had, after twice hearing the Cauſe, deferred to paſs Sentence, are ſaid <hi>moram ad condemnandum acquiſiviſſe,</hi> and alſo to have given the Defendant a ſpace wherein to recollect himſelf.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Note</hi> f. There was no need here of the <hi>Bacchanals</hi> or <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> becauſe there were Heathens enough in <hi>Aſia</hi> that loved Wine, and whenever they had an opportunity drank to exceſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged themſelves in other Luſts; whoſe example might have had a bad influence upon the Chriſtians, if they did not take great heed to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Note</hi> g. Our Author has ſhewn indeed here, that <hi>Songs</hi> are called by three ſeveral names; but that thoſe were ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds no one can prove, becauſe they are often confounded, as

would firſt have ſet down that which relates to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Church <gap reason="foreign">

<q>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 30. For between us and <hi>Chriſt</hi> there intercedes ſo near a conjunction, that we may be called his Fleſh and Bones, as it is ſaid of a Woman with relation to her Husband. So that as <hi>Chriſt</hi> loves his Church, as if it were his Wife and ſo his own Body; 31, 32. ſo Husbands having left their Fathers Houſe for the ſake of their Wives, and become as it were one Fleſh with them, ſhould look upon it as their Duty to love their Wives as themſelves.</q>
If we carefully read St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, and conſider the ſcope of his Diſcourſe, we ſhall not doubt but this is his meaning. For the Apoſtle's deſign here, at leaſt <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>profeſſedly,</hi> is not to teach any thing concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi>; but from the noted example of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſhew what conjunction and intimacy of Affection there ought to be between <hi>Man and Wife.</hi> So that what he ſays of Chriſt, is ſaid but by the way, and aſſumed as ſufficiently known.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This being ſuppoſed, it will be eaſy to perceive that the 32d <hi>verſe</hi> is a <hi>Parentheſis</hi> inſerted between words belonging to the ſame thing, but which make nothing to the ſeries of the Diſcourſe. And by this <hi>Parentheſis</hi> the intention of the Apoſtle is only to ſhew, that what he had ſaid about that intimate union of Chriſt with his Church for which he ſuffer'd Death, was hitherto unknown to Mankind. This he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii.16. and ſo theſe words are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, not to the myſtical ſenſe of the place in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> but to the thing it ſelf; that is, to the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his Church, which was ſo great that he did not refuſe to die for its ſake. Away therefore with that myſtical ſenſe, which is without reaſon ſought for in the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as by the ſuggeſtion here of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But what ſhall we ſay then to thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> whom our Author cites in his Paraphraſe, as knowing that great Myſtery from the ſecret ſenſe of the words of <hi>Moſes?</hi> To ſpeak what I think, they are either the words of ſome Impoſtor acting the part of a <hi>Jew,</hi> or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued to a wrong ſenſe. Our Author took this Teſtimony from <hi>H. Grotius,</hi> who on this place ſaith: <hi>Sic &amp; Hebraei aiunt mulierem de latere viri deſumtam, ad ſignificandum conjugium viri ſupremi, benedicti: So the</hi> Jews <hi>alſo ſay that the Woman was taken out of the ſide of the Man, to ſignify the marriage of the higheſt, bleſſed Man.</hi> But where are thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who ſay this? Do they with one conſent ſpeak thus in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick form? Or is it ſome <hi>Rabbin</hi> who propoſes his own Conjecture, or
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:99486:233"/>
the Tradition of the Antients? Such Citations as theſe, in a matter of no ſmall moment, or not univerſally known, ſhould be avoided by learned Men; ſeeing they cannot be relied on, unleſs it be ſuppoſed that a vain uncertain report may be ſo. But I know, if I am not miſtaken, whence <hi>Grotius</hi> took this obſervation; <hi>to wit</hi> from <hi>Camero,</hi> who himſelf had it from <hi>Sebaſt. Munſter,</hi> the firſt Author of it, in his Annotations on <hi>Gen.</hi> ii.24 <hi>Hebraei magiſtri,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>docent id quod Paulus docuit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins <hi>teach the ſame thing which is taught by St.</hi> Paul, <hi>that a Man ſhould love his Wife as his own Body, and honour her more than his own Body, becauſe of that ſignification and Myſtery. <gap reason="foreign">

Of which Myſtery St.</hi> Paul <hi>alſo makes mention, who teaches that we are eſpouſed to Chriſt.</hi> He did not render the Hebrew words, which ſeem to be corrupt; but they are rendred by <hi>Camero,</hi> after promiſing that he took them from <hi>Munſter,</hi> thus: <hi>ad ſignificandum conjugium viri ſuperni, qui benedictus eſt; to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the marriage of the Man on High, who is bleſſed.</hi> And ſo they are rendred by <hi>Grotius.</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">

For who will not prove any thing from the <hi>Jews</hi> or others, if ſuch Teſtimonies as theſe be admitted? I know this was the cuſtom of the Philologers of the laſt Age; but it was certainly a very bad one, and juſtly cenſured by the more exquiſite Wits of ours. I am apt to think it proceeded either from want of Judgment, or unfaithfulneſs, in their not being ſenſible with what caution and tenderneſs Teſtimonies ought to be handled, from which any Conſectary is to be deduced, or being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to have their Citations examined. Both which a Man that aims at Accuracy and purſues Truth, ſhould be very far from; for he that would neither be deceived himſelf, nor deceive others, cannot deſire to have what he affirms believed raſhly and without examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. A vaſt inconvenience ariſes from the cuſtom of writing out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Citations, unleſs we look into the Authors themſelves from whence they are taken; becauſe ſomething may eaſily be added, whilſt the ſenſe is rather expreſſed than the words.

I do not deny indeed but that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moſt ſacred Laws of human Society, and conſequently of God himſelf, People ought to obey Magiſtrates, as long as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand nothing which is contrary to true Devotion, Society, or good Manners. That Obedience being as neceſſary and natural a Duty as for Children to obey their Parents; becauſe without it Society, for which we are formed and born, cannot conſiſt. But hence it does not follow that, when the Scripture ſpeaks of the honour due to Parents, we muſt preſently run the diſcourſe to Magiſtrates. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he ought to have repreſented St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Paraphraſe, ſpeaking ſo as he ſpeaks; and not faſten'd upon him a Conſectary, which he did not think of. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> might, if he would, in his <hi>Annotations</hi> have deduced from the words of the Apoſtle, what ſeemed deducible from them, but not in his <hi>Paraphraſe,</hi> in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ought to ſpeak, and not his Interpreter.

But Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who makes the Apoſtle here to ſpeak of obedience to Magiſtrates, interprets theſe words <hi>in the Lord</hi> by <hi>under the Goſpel</hi>; for as to Parents, it would have

I do not believe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this Promiſe in any other ſenſe, becauſe there can be no doubt raiſed about it. Why therefore did he mention here a Promiſe which did not at all concern the <hi>Epheſians?</hi> Undoubtedly not to move or perſwade them by that Promiſe to honour their Parents; but to ſhew them how very pleaſing the performance of that Duty was to God, becauſe he had formerly annexed a promiſe to the Precept wherein the Duty of Children to their Parents was enjoined. As for what our Author ſays here about a <hi>peaceable Life</hi> being the effect of obedience to Superiors or Magiſtrates, that as it is often true, ſo it is frequently falſe. Civil or foreign Wars, not to mention Tyranny or Arbitrary Government, do no more ſpare faithful than unfaithful Subjects. Tho it be very true, that factious Perſons, and ſuch as are deſirous of Innovations, do bring upon themſelves a great many evils from the ſupreme Power; it do's not therefore follow that ſuch as are quiet and willing to obey, do enjoy a longer or more happy Life. Which as it holds good at all times, ſo then eſpecially when the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power is of a different perſwaſion in Religion from thoſe who honour their Parents, as it was in the time of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> So that what the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays here about the honour which is to be given to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, tho true, does not belong to this place.</p>

Is it ſo therefore, that when the Diſcourſe is about the Duty of Children to Parents, to Parents muſt be joined Princes; but when the Scripture ſpeaks of the Duty of Parents to Children, in that Magiſtrates are not at all concerned? Or is it true, that tho Subjects ought to obey Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, yet there is no Duty incumbent upon Magiſtrates with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Subjects? What can be the reaſon of this difference? Surely it deſerved to be mentioned if there was any. But, to ſpeak my thoughts, our learned Author writing this in a time when he ſaw his Countrymen had roſe up in Arms againſt the King, whoſe cauſe he very much favoured, and that a great many abuſed the Power which they thought was lodged in the People, reſolved to omit no occaſion of magnifying the Authority of Kings; and carefully to avoid every thing which might ſeem to countenance the Cauſe of the People, leſt his Adverſaries ſhould abuſe it.

               <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Note</hi> e.] Some years ago there aroſe a great Controverſy about this place, between two Gentlemen very skilful in the Roman Antiquities, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lricus Huberus</hi> and <hi>Jac.

And there is no doubt but that the moſt frequent notion of the Word, in the beſt Writers, is agreeable to the Opinion of this latter. And ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning will be, that his Bonds, that is, the Reaſon for which he was caſt into Bonds, was known to the <hi>Praetor's</hi> Guards, to which the Soldiers with whom he was bound, might have brought him.

                  </gap>, without bringing an example of the like phraſe. For as to the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſeparately conſider'd, ſuppoſing that ſignified what our Author affirms, it will not follow that it has the ſame ſignification in this Phraſe.

                  </gap> partly by the uſe of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> partly by the opinion of Divines, not by its vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar acceptation. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">II. If that were the meaning of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place, which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor after others ſuppoſes, the Apoſtle ſhould have expreſt himſelf thus: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: <hi>who being in the form of God, and thinking it no robbery to be made equal with God, yet emptied himſelf.</hi> And ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. would be oppoſed to all which goes before. But as the words now lie, it is oppoſed only to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery, but,</hi> &amp;c. Which is all one as to ſay; <hi>tho he was in the form of God, yet he did not think he might aſſume to himſelf an equality with God, but ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Will, and took upon him the form of a Servant,</hi> &amp;c. That this is the ſeries of the Diſcourſe, this the ſenſe of this place, was well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Novatian</hi> in Lib. <hi>de Trinitate,</hi> cap. xvii. whoſe words I ſhall not think much to ſet down. <hi>Imitator omnium paternorum operum, dum &amp; ipſe operatur ſicut &amp; Pater ejus, forma, ut expreſſimus, eſt Dei Patris. Et meritò in forma pronunciatus eſt Dei, dum &amp; ipſe ſuper omnia, &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis creaturae divinam obtinens poteſtatem, &amp; Deus eſt, exemplo, Patris; hoc ipſum tamen a Patre proprio conſequutus, ut omnium &amp; Deus eſſet &amp; Dominus eſſet, &amp; Deus ad formam Dei Patris ex ipſo genitus, atque pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus. Hic ergo quamvis eſſet in forma Dei, non eſt rapinam arbitratus aequalem ſe Deo eſſe. Quamvis enim ſe ex Deo Patre Deum eſſe memi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſet,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:99486:239"/>
nunquam ſe Deo Patri aut comparavit, aut contulit; memor ſe eſſe ex ſuo Patre, &amp; hoc ipſum quod eſt habere ſe, quia Pater dediſſet. Inde denique &amp; ante carnis aſſumtionem, ſed &amp; poſt adſumtionem corporis, poſt ipſam praeterea reſurrectionem, omnem Patri, in omnibus rebus, obedientiam praeſtitit pariter ac praeſtat. Ex quo probatur nunquam arbitratum illum eſſe rapinam quandam divinitatem, ut aequaret ſe Patri Deo; quinimò con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra omni ipſius imperio &amp; voluntati obediens atque ſubjectus ut forman ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi ſuſciperet contentus eſt. Being an imitator of all his Fathers works, and working alſo as his Father does, he is, as I have expreſſed, the form of God the Father. And juſtly was he pronounced to be in the form of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he alſo being over all things, and having a divine Power over every Creature, is God after the example of the Father; yet ſo as to have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Dignity from his Father, that he ſhould be God and Lord of all things, and to be God according to the form of God the Father, begotten and brought forth by him. And therefore tho he was in the form of God, he did not think it robbery to be equal with God. For tho he knew within himſelf that he was God of God the Father, yet he never compared himſelf with God the Father, being mindful that he was of his Father, and whatever he was, he was by his Father's Gift. And both before and after his aſſuming Fleſh, and after his Reſurrection, he yielded and ſtill yields all obedience to his Father in all things. Which ſhews that he never thought any Divinity robbery, to equal himſelf with God the Father; nay on tho contrary, being obedient and ſubject to all his Commands and Will, he was content to take upon him the form of a Servant.</hi> This is the direct tendency of the form of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which will not admit of any other interpretation. And with this ſenſe all the words made uſe of by him agree, as I ſhall ſhew. But firſt of all it muſt be ſuppoſed that the Diſcourſe here is about the <hi>Man</hi> Jeſus, and not about the Deity, which is evident, to produce but this one Argument for it, from that which follows; for he <hi>whom God hath exalted, and given him a Name above every Name, that in the name of Jeſus every Knee ſhould bow,</hi> is undoubtedly the Man Jeſus, and not the Deity, which never received any thing, nor could receive any new Dignity; and he whom God ſo very highly exalted, is the ſame who had humbled himſelf, and ſuffer'd Death in obedience to the Will of his Father. This reaſoning, which yet is the ſum of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interpretation, is hardly tolerable. <hi>The Divinity of Chriſt, tho equal</hi> (yea numerically the ſame with the Divinity of the Father) <hi>to the Father, humbled it ſelf to put on Humanity; wherefore, that Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty received this Reward from the Father, to be raiſed to the higheſt pitch of Glory.</hi> On the contrary, it is he that <hi>humbled</hi> himſelf, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:99486:240"/>
here ſays was rewarded. This premis'd, I ſhall now explain the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Phraſes the Apoſtle makes uſe of.</p>

For <hi>Adam</hi> indeed had the uſe of all thoſe things which God had made, and which were within his reach; but he had not a Command over the Sea and the Winds, and every thing in Nature, like <hi>Chriſt.</hi> See my Note on <hi>Gen.</hi> i.26.</p>

He who had the command of the whole World, ſuffered himſelf to be deſpitefully uſed, and cruelly killed by wicked Men. This cannot in the leaſt be ſaid of the Divine Nature, and therefore nor that which went before. For ſuch a Diſcourſe as this would be intolerable: The Divine Nature of Chriſt condeſcended ſo low as to aſſume Humanity, and humbled it ſelf ſo, as to become obedient to the Death of the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:99486:241"/>
Croſs. The Divinity of Chriſt was not <hi>obedient unto Death,</hi> but his Humanity only, as all agree. And all that is in the ſame compaſs of Words, and the ſame <hi>Antitheſis</hi> ought to be referred to one and the ſame Nature, unleſs the undoubted Signification of Words, or the things ſpoken of require the contrary.</p>

I obſerve that the Learned do often err, in thinking that any ſignification which belongs to words when they are found ſeparately, or in ſuch or ſuch a particular conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may alſo be attributed to them in any conſtruction whatſoever. But if the reading of the Antients did not, methinks the very geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of Modern Languages might teach them, that there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the ſignifications of words, according as they are joined with one another, and that the ſenſe of Phraſes is quite chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the addition or alteration of one ſmall Particle.</p>

               <p n="1">I. I acknowledg there is ſome agreement between <hi>Epheſ.</hi> ii.14. &amp; <hi>ſeqq.</hi> and this place, for in both the Redemption of Chriſt is ſpoken of; but that they are perfectly and in all things parallel, I utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo will any one who does but read both places with any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. And therefore this place ought not to be ſtrained, to agree exactly with that other.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This reaſoning of our Author is inconcluſive: <hi>The Heavens and the Earth ſignify this lower World; this lower World is all one with Men; therefore all things in Heaven and Earth ſignifies all Men,</hi> Gentiles <hi>as well as</hi> Jews. The parts of this Argument are falſe, and the conſequence illegitimate. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is falſe that <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> does any where ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify merely this lower World, that is, the Earth and the Air lying round about it, excluſive of the upper ſpaces. For thoſe words are uſed to comprehend the whole Univerſe, not excepting the Starry Heaven, as appears by <hi>Gen.</hi> i. I confeſs <hi>Heaven</hi> often ſignifies the Air, but then it is not joined with the <hi>Earth,</hi> which muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved; for the uſual ſignification of an entire Phraſe is one thing, and of ſingle words another. <hi>Secondly,</hi> granting that the Phraſe <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> ſignifies this inferiour World, it will not follow that <hi>Men</hi> are ſo called, nor indeed <hi>are</hi> they ſo ever. But <hi>third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſuppoſe that alſo were true, it muſt be obſerved that it is not ſaid here ſimply that <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> were reconciled, but <hi>all things which are in Heaven or in Earth,</hi> which is a quite different thing; for in this phraſe, the Heaven and the Earth, are clearly diſtinguiſhed from thoſe who are in them; nor can the words <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> be here thought ſynonimous to the name <hi>World,</hi> which often ſignifies Men. The Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>or,</hi> which being twice repeated is a <hi>Disjunctive,</hi> ſhews alſo that <hi>thoſe who are in Heaven,</hi> are not the ſame with thoſe <hi>who are on Earth,</hi> and therefore that <hi>Men</hi> only cannot be intended. Beſides, tho the word <hi>World</hi> ſignifies all Men, and <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> is called the World, it does not follow that Men may be ſignified by theſe words, <hi>all things which are in Heaven or in Earth.</hi> In interpreting Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:99486:246"/>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> hence it may be inferred, that what our Author adds about the Phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">IV. The reconciliation of Angels is not to be underſtood of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, but with Men, who being God's <hi>Enemies by evil Works,</hi> were at the ſame time Enemies to the Holy Angels; which are ſo intimately allied to God, that the Friends and Enemies of the one are the Enemies and Friends of the other. But Men being once converted by Chriſt to a holy and religious Life, and made Friends with God, they become alſo Friends to the Angels, who love the good as much as they deteſt the wicked. Thus God has reconciled all things <hi>into him,</hi> that is, Angels and Men, acknowledging and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping one Lord Jeſus Chriſt; made them Friends with one another, and compoſed one Family of both theſe orders of Creatures, who were before at a vaſt diſtance from each other, both in their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Diſpoſitions. This is that which is ſignified in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> i.10. on which place ſee <hi>Grotius.</hi> It was a Myſtery before unknown, that the time would come when <gap reason="foreign">

Which being ſo, what our Author alledges as out of that place in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his interpretation of this, is inſignificant.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Note</hi> d. <hi>Grotius</hi> and others, much better interpret this Phraſe of a <hi>fleſhly Body,</hi> that is, obnoxious to the ſame Infirmities as ours. It is not true, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> be uſed in places where another that ſignified <hi>to come near</hi> might have been uſed almoſt in the ſame ſenſe, it does not therefore follow that that Verb may be ſo rendred, or ſignifies juſt the ſame, becauſe <hi>handling</hi> is ſomething more than <hi>coming near</hi>; for one that comes near a thing does not therefore touch it, tho it cannot be touched without coming near it. The <hi>Judaizers</hi> often made uſe of theſe words, ſpeaking of thoſe Meats which were prohibited by the Law, <hi>touch not, taſte not, handle not</hi>; not all perhaps at the ſame time, or in the ſame order, but now one, and then another, juſt as it happen'd. So that it is no matter if the ſame thing be repeated, as long as they are different words, which were equally uſed to ſignify one thing.</p>

                  </gap>, and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ought not to have produced his own Conjecture for the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> without an Admonition. See on that place.</p>
               <p n="5">V. I do not indeed condemn all <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it is deſcribed by our Author; but I cannot perſwade my ſelf that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here uſes that word in a good ſenſe. When he ſays that the Life of thoſe whom he condemns, had ſome <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he does not ſpeak his own Sentiments, but the opinion of the Vulgar, who are more taken with thoſe outward ſhews, than with true inward Piety. And I have this reaſon on my ſide, that according to the judgment of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>Humility</hi> which conſiſted in the worſhip of Angels, had no appearance of Virtue in it; becauſe to ſpeak in the ſofteſt terms, it favoured ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Idolatry. The ſame may be ſaid of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which he declares <hi>to profit but little</hi>; which place I wonder Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> would alledg, ſeeing it makes ſo much againſt him. But beſides this, there is another reaſon which puts this matter out of all doubt, and that is, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here ſpoken of, is the worſhip of Angels, which was therefore unlawful becauſe <hi>voluntary</hi>; it being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable to invent <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>objects of Worſhip</hi> to our ſelves, of our own accord, without a Command from God. Compare this <hi>verſe</hi> with the 18<hi>th,</hi> where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>Let no Man ſeduce you in a voluntary Humility, and worſhipping of Angels</hi>; and there will be no doubt but the <hi>voluntary Worſhip,</hi> which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, is the <hi>worſhipping of Angels,</hi> it being manifeſt that he treats of the ſame thing in both places. So that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s notion of it, ſignifies ſomething unlawful, tho the common ſort of People who did not underſtand the nature of true Piety, admired ſuch <hi>voluntary</hi> and affected <hi>Worſhip.</hi>

               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="470" facs="tcp:99486:249"/>VI. But the caſe, as to the freewill-Offerings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>voluntary Worſhip of Angels,</hi> of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks, was quite different. For God had commanded that Sacrifices ſhould be offer'd to him, and preſcribed the way in which they were all to be offered; ſo that all that was voluntary in thoſe Sacrifices, was the offering them up at ſuch certain times as the Supplicant of his own accord determined, according to God's preſcribed Rule, both as to the matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But God never commanded or permitted that religious Worſhip ſhould be given to any but himſelf and his only begotten Son; and much leſs has he preſcribed the manner how Angels ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. So that there can be no compariſon between theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. I acknowledg there may be ſome things good in themſelves, which yet may be omitted without Sin; but that therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here is taken in a good ſenſe, I do not think, becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly ſignifies religious Worſhip, which we may not give to any or our own accord. But the <hi>Doctor</hi> underſtood the matter here ſo, as if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignified either a lawful way of divine Worſhip, or any Action good in it ſelf, but not indiſpenſably commanded. And ſo indeed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be taken in a good ſenſe: but the former, which I take to be the ſenſe wherein it is uſed by the Apoſtle, is a bad one.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. After all, there are two things which ſeem neceſſary to be obſerved concerning all voluntary Actions relating to Piety; which if they be not conſider'd, this whole buſineſs will be very obſcure, and may be miſunderſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That under the Goſpel, to make any voluntary courſe or act of Piety acceptable to God, the matter about which it is converſant muſt be good in it ſelf, and ſuch as cannot be done but by a good man, and conſequently a better than thoſe who do not perform any ſuch Action: otherwiſe, if it be a thing indifferent in its own nature, and may be done by bad men as well as good, that voluntary Piety can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to pleaſe God. To preach the Goſpel with a pious deſign, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>without making it chargeable to the Hearers,</hi> that ſo men might be the more eaſily perſwaded to the practice of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and brought to believe in Chriſt, was a thing good in it ſelf, and could not but be commendable in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and acceptable to God. But to live a ſingle Life, tho chaſte, is a thing neither good nor evil, if it be oppoſed to a chaſte married Life; and may be found in a man that is proud, unmerciful, contentious, or imperious, and conſequently worſe than others who are married. And therefore that <hi>voluntary Piety,</hi> as it is called, cannot pleaſe God, whatever is ſaid
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:99486:249"/>
by S. <hi>Jerom</hi>; who was not a whit the better for being a ſingle man. The ſame may be ſaid of all other things of the like nature.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing to be carefully obſerved in this matter is, that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary acts of Piety are commendable only in thoſe who obſerve what is indiſpenſably required, and not in thoſe who neglecting neceſſary and commanded Duty, as mean and trivial, would ſeem to aſpire to ſome higher degree of Piety. For what Maſter would be well pleaſed with a Servant, who omitting his expreſs Orders, ſhould ſet himſelf to do other things greater than he commanded him to do? All Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that with reaſon, expect their Servants ſhould do firſt what they require of them; and then, and not before, they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to do ſomething extraordinary; otherwiſe they are offended with the pride and perverſneſs of thoſe Servants, who when they do not perform what is exacted from them, are yet vainly ambitious of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing better than others. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had done all thoſe things which became a good man and an Apoſtle, preached the Goſpel <hi>freely,</hi> to his great Commendation, and with the ſure hope of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Reward. But if he had neglected plain Duty, or any eſſential part of his Apoſtolical Office, and pleaſed himſelf only with this, that he had preached the Goſpel without making it coſtly to his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he would not upon that account have been any thing the more acceptable to God. And ſo when we ſee that ſome of thoſe in antient times who ſhut up themſelves in Monaſteries, under a pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing themſelves in a more ſublime courſe of Piety, and being righteous above what is commanded, do manifeſtly diſcover a great deal of Pride, Hatred of their Neighbour, Impatience of Injuries, and the like Vices, in their Writings; he muſt be either ſtupid, or infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame Vices himſelf, that admires them, or thinks they were for that reaſon at all more pleaſing to God. Such alſo were the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> at leaſt for the moſt part, whom Chriſt ſo ſharply reproves, and whoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I cannot but wonder that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſhould take in a laudable ſenſe. No one that reads the beginning of the deſcription of their Hereſy, in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> can doubt but that word is uſed in a bad notion. The learned <hi>Dion. Petavius,</hi> tho a Jeſuit, preſently ſaw this, as appears by his Verſion of <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s words, here ſubjoined: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>Qui ideo,</hi> ſaith Petavius, <hi>Phariſaei dicti ſunt, quod eſſent, propter adſcititiam, ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamque diſciplinam à reliquis ſejuncti; who were therefore called</hi> Phariſees, <hi>becauſe by their affected and ſuperſtitious Diſcipline they were diſtinguiſhed from others.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Chapter III.</note>Hence it may be inferred in the <hi>third</hi> place, that thoſe whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is to perſwade men to Piety, have ſeldom need to recommend <gap reason="foreign">

Other things may be ſafely let alone, becauſe thoſe who are fit to be exhorted to works of Supererogation, are not only few in number, but do not need Exhortations to them.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Sacrifices not commanded by God, and Holy-days, and other things of the ſame nature, not preſcribed by any divine Laws, were in themſelves neither good nor evil; nor could they be acceptable to God, any otherwiſe than as they were performed with a devout and affectionate mind: and therefore accurately ſpeaking, it was not thoſe voluntary acts of Piety, materially conſidered, wherewith God was pleaſed, but the devout Mind of thoſe that performed them. Which was then only truly ſo, when, after they had done what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, they performed over and above thoſe uncommanded things. The ſame may be ſaid now of Eccleſiaſtical Rites, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by God, the obſervation of which can no otherwiſe, than upon thoſe terms, be pleaſing to him.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Note</hi> a. I. As to the thing it ſelf, I fully agree here with Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>; yet I cannot but caution the Reader, that he ſhould not think the words he produces as out of the <hi>Digeſt.</hi> to be the very words of the antient Lawyers. Our learned Author did not look into the <hi>Digeſta,</hi> but tranſcribed the words of <hi>Grotius</hi> in his <hi>Annot.</hi> on the Inſcription of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> which he erroneouſly thought to be the ſame with thoſe contained in the <hi>Digeſta.

Tit. 1. S. 65. ſpeaks thus: <hi>Si Epiſtolam tibi miſero, non erit ea tua, antequam reddita fuerit.</hi> Paulus: <hi>imò contrà, nam ſi miſeris ad me Tabellarium tuum, &amp; ego reſcribendi cauſa litteras tibi miſero, ſimul atque Tabellario tuo tradidero, tuae fient. Idem accidet in his litteris, quas tuae duntaxat rei gratia miſero; veluti ſi petieris a me, uti te alicui commendarem, &amp; eas commendatitias tibi miſero litteras. If I ſend you a Letter, it will not be yours before it is delivered to you.</hi> Paulus: <hi>Nay on the contrary, if you ſend me your Carrier</hi> [with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter] <hi>and I write another in anſwer to it, as ſoon as ever I deliver it to the Carrier, it becomes yours. And the ſame may be ſaid of a Letter which I ſhould ſend only on your behalf to another Perſon; as ſuppoſe you ſhould deſire me to recommend you to any one, and I ſhould ſend you that commendatory Letter.</hi> Theſe words <hi>Grotius</hi> abbreviated, whoſe <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi> of them, the <hi>Doctor</hi> raſhly took for the words of the Lawyers themſelves. Yet hence it appears that <hi>an Epiſtle of Laodicaea</hi> may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify not only one written by the <hi>Laodicaeans,</hi> but alſo one ſent to the <hi>Laodicaeans.</hi> In the mean while, thoſe who deſire neither to be miſtaken themſelves, nor to deceive others, may learn by this example, not raſhly to believe other Mens Citations, nor to alledg Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon truſt.</p>

            <p n="3">III.

I wonder our Author, in this diſcerning Age, in

                  </gap>.] There are a few things which it may not be amiſs to remark upon this Chapter, tho Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> has paſſed it over without any Annotations, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to expreſs what he thought to be the meaning of it in his Paraphraſe. <hi>Grotius</hi> explaining theſe words tells us, that the Apoſtle <hi>non nominat hic</hi> Presbyteros <hi>&amp;</hi> Diaconos, <hi>quia recens erat Eccleſia, nec dum formam plenam acceperat; does not name here</hi> Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, <hi>becauſe the Church of</hi> Theſſalonica <hi>had been but lately gathered, and not yet formed into a regular Church.</hi> But if this reaſon be good, none of the Churches to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, except that of <hi>Philippi,</hi> were <hi>regularly formed Churches</hi>; becauſe there is no mention made of Church-Governors, Biſhops and Deacons, in the inſcriptions of any of the Epiſtles, but to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> But who will believe that the <hi>Epheſian</hi> and <hi>Corinthian</hi> Churches, in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had for a great while reſided, were not yet ſo conſtituted as to have Rectors in them; and yet that the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> in which he made a ſhorter ſtay, had? Of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> the contrary appears from <hi>Acts</hi> xx.17, 28. and of the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> by the Epiſtles themſelves written to that Church. So that there muſt be another reaſon given for St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s not making mention of <hi>Biſhops and Deacons</hi> in the Inſcriptions of all his Epiſtles. And that which ſeems to me the moſt probable is, that the Governors of the Primitive Churches were modeſt, humble Men, who were unwilling to have themſelves diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the People in the front of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, that they might not appear to pretend to any magiſterial Authority, but to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves only as Miniſters inſtituted for the ſake of Order and Chriſtian Society. There are a great many ſigns of this, eſpecially in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in which the Governors of the Churches of <hi>Achaia</hi> are no where order'd to uſe any Authority in the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:99486:253"/>
Adminiſtration of their Office, or in curbing evil Men who broke the Order of the Church. St. <hi>Paul</hi> every where ſpeaks to whole Churches, never to the Governors of them apart from the People. However I would not be thought to deny, that ſome Churches were not yet compleatly formed when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to them; in which number ſeems to have been the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this of <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> muſt be excepted, as appears from <hi>Chap.</hi> v.12, 13.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>Note</hi> a. OUR Author here, as in many other places, meerly ſerves an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and forces every thing to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his own opinion.</p>
               <p>But I. Why may not we think that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had ſpoken of the laſt coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the concluſion of the foregoing Chapter, paſſes here to the time of it, not as to another thing, but as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtance of the ſame thing; ſo as alſo to ſpeak in this place about the laſt coming of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> The <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the condition of thoſe who died under Perſecutions; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the end of the laſt Chapter comforts them with the proſpect of an endleſs Reward, which ſuch perſons were to receive at the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and here he adds, that there was no need of his writing to them about the time when that ſhould be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would come on a ſudden, and when it was leaſt expected, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf had more than once ſaid. Which can be underſtood only of his final coming. For tho the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might perhaps be ſudden and unexpected to the <hi>Jews</hi> who lived in that City; yet it was an eaſy matter for others to conjecture that ſome great calamity was like to come upon them from the <hi>Romans,</hi> for their perpetual ſeditions and unruly tempers. <hi>Joſephus</hi> has ſhewn at large in Lib. ii. <hi>of the Jewiſh War,</hi> that the indignation of the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> was not preſently ſtirred up. But thoſe eſpecially, who were diſperſed through the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had time enough to know that the <hi>Jews</hi> were upon the point of utter ruin, when they ſaw <hi>Judea</hi> laid waſt by the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies. Beſides, the <hi>Jews</hi> who lived out of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> as thoſe who were diſperſed through <hi>Greece,</hi> did not periſh by any ſudden Deſtruction, in which they involved the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi>; but only thoſe who took up Arms againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> as the <hi>Antiochians, Cyrenians,</hi> and ſome others. I know indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> ſuffer'd very great Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries under <hi>Adrian,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi>; but our Author will not have the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> to be here referred to, nor did thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities befal them on a ſudden. It is not probable that the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who had no true Zeal for the Jewiſh Religion, and who, as the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor often tells us, complied with the Jews to eſcape being accuſed by them before the Roman Magiſtrates, did yet conſpire with a handful of that Nation againſt the whole Roman Power.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:99486:257"/>II. Our Author ſuppoſes that a conſtant Faith and holy Life would be an infallible means to preſerve the Chriſtians, which as I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to be moſt true, underſtood of <hi>eternal Salvation,</hi> ſo I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it true, if underſtood of a Deliverance from the Perſecutions of the <hi>Romans.</hi> For could not the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> feign themſelves to be Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and do ſacrifice to their Gods, that they might not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jews?</hi> And that, if I am not miſtaken, was abundantly enough to cauſe a diſtinction to be put between them and the Circumciſed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> as our Author thinks, were not real <hi>Jews.</hi> Beſides, the Chriſtians in <hi>Greece,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Romans</hi> were incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> did not eſcape the fury of the Magiſtrates becauſe they were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but becauſe they were not <hi>Jews,</hi> and were look'd upon as peaceable Men, who were not for making any diſturbance in the Government. I wonder our learned Author did not ſee theſe things, but ſo often ſerves himſelf of an Hypotheſis which he never attempted to prove by Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Note</hi> b. Our Author goes on to faſten his own Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> without any regard to Grammar.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is true indeed, that <hi>to live</hi> may ſignify to be in proſperity, and there are ſeveral examples of the word taken in that ſenſe, as our Author has ſhewn on <hi>Chap.</hi> iii.8. of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi>; but that <hi>to live with Chriſt</hi> has ever any ſuch ſignification, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> will never prove without examples, to any that underſtand Greek, or are acquainted with the ſtile of Scripture. Whatever a word ſignifies alone, it does not ſignify in conjunction with others. Whatever is meant by it in one place, it cannot ſignify in all. In this place, <hi>to live with Chriſt</hi> does not only include the notion of eternal Life, but ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing elſe, as the bare reading of the Verſe ſhews: <hi>who died for us, that whether we wake or ſleep, we might live together with him.</hi> Can Chriſt be ſaid to have died for the Chriſtians of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> that they might not periſh in that deſtruction which was to come upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> but ſurvive them? Where does the Scripture mention any ſuch end of the Death of Chriſt? Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> did not think fit to ſay ſo much as this in his Paraphraſe, where he does not expreſs the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but what he himſelf thought.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But Chriſt having died for Men, that they might live with him, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they might enjoy eternal Life with him in Heaven, and that being the ſenſe of the Apoſtle's words, the next thing to be conſider'd is, what is meant in this place by <hi>waking or ſleeping.</hi> And becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays that neither of theſe things ſignifies any thing to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for <hi>whether we wake or ſleep</hi> we ſhall live together with Chriſt;
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:99486:257"/>
thoſe Phraſes cannot be thought to ſignify either a <hi>Vice</hi> or a <hi>Virtue,</hi> contrary to what they do in <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, &amp; 8. Our Author who thinks the Diſcourſe is about a temporal Deliverance, interprets them of <hi>Sollicitude</hi> and <hi>Security</hi>; which I cannot admit, becauſe I affirm that the Diſcourſe is about eternal Salvation, as the thing it ſelf alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares. What therefore do they ſignify? why this, and nothing elſe, Whether we are ſtill alive, when he ſhall come to judg the Living and Dead, or whether we die before that time. As in <hi>Chap.</hi> iv.13, 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>thoſe who were aſleep,</hi> are they who ſhall be dead at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt: ſo here thoſe who ſhall be awake, ſignify them which ſhall be found alive at that time, as <hi>Grotius</hi> well obſerves, whom our Author ought to have followed. What the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays in this Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation beſides, I have already confuted.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Yet there is one thing perhaps that may be objected in favour of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> viz. that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to ſpeak of a thing which was to come to paſs in his time, becauſe he exhorts the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to watch, in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. leſt they ſhould be found in Darkneſs at the day of the Lord's ſudden Coming. But God having not revealed the day in which he will judg Mankind, ſo much as to his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whilſt he converſed in this World, but only ſaid that it would come on a ſudden, and when it was leaſt expected, with a deſign, ſeemingly, to keep Men from delaying their Repentance, while they hope to have time enough to repent before that day comes; it is no wonder that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of the laſt Judgment, as a thing which was to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in his Age. He could not ſpeak otherwiſe, ſeeing God had not revealed the thing more clearly. To which purpoſe it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that he does not deny but that the Judgment was deferred, in which there would have been a manifeſt Error, but only teach the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that Men ought to be always prepared, for fear of being ſurprized by the ſudden coming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I know indeed Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in his Paraphraſe of the 2<hi>d Verſe,</hi> repreſents the Apoſtle as ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not far off; but if we read St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, we ſhall ſee that he only teaches that it would be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected, not that it was near at hand, or ſhortly to be. For it is compared to the coming of <hi>a Thief in the Night,</hi> in which nothing but the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>unexpectedneſs</hi> of it is conſidered.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Note</hi> c. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may much more ſimply be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to ſignify the Governors of both Orders in the Church, who may be comprehended under the common name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as being all ſet over the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> tho not with an equal Authority. Conſidering this is grounded upon the proper ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:99486:258"/>
of the word, it may much more eaſily be admitted, than that there were more Epiſcopal Churches in <hi>Macedonia</hi> beſides that of <hi>Philippi</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> which were contained under theſe as their Metropolitans. See my Note on <hi>Philip.</hi> i.1.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>Note</hi> e. Our Author rightly interprets the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place of <hi>all kind of Evil:</hi> for after the Apoſtle had ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>prove all things, hold faſt that which is good</hi>; it very fitly follows, <hi>abſtain from all kind of evil</hi>; which is all one as if he had ſaid: When ye have carefully examined all that any Prophet ſhall ſay to you, be ſure to embrace and retain whatever you find to be good, but reject all that is evil. As <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does not ſignify that which has an appearance of good, ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is ſet oppoſite to it, is not every appearance of Evil, but all that is really Evil. That <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is often taken for <hi>kind,</hi> there is no need of proving. But if any doubt of it, they may conſult the <hi>old Gloſſes</hi> of <hi>Labbaeus</hi> his <hi>Edition,</hi> on the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>Note</hi> f. I. This in earneſt is a medly of inſignificant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and for the moſt part foreign to the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in which the firſt thing liable to cenſure is, that our Author here follows the old way of Philoſophizing, which in this particular is certainly falſe, there being nothing in a Man but his Body and reaſonable Soul, which Soul is moved by Affections ariſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Body, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of any third Faculty, as learned Men have long ago ſhewed, even before this was publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Hammond:</hi> And that Soul alone, not any inferior Nature, is the ſubject of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will. It is ſtrange that wiſe Men, in order to know what is in Man, that is, in themſelves, ſhould go and conſult <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as if they were enquiring into the nature of a living Creature, which <hi>they</hi> only had ſeen, and we knew nothing of, and make it their buſineſs to repeat what Men of little accuracy have ſaid about a thing, which every one may much better underſtand of himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is falſe that any ſuch thing can be deduced from the Hiſtory of Man's Creation, as it is ſet down by <hi>Moſes.</hi> For tho it be ſaid that God <hi>formed Man out of the Duſt of the Earth,</hi> by which words is meant his Body, yet he is not ſaid to have added two other parts to him, for <hi>Moſes</hi> proceeds thus <hi>verbatim: and breathed into his Noſtrils the breath of Life, and Man became a living Soul</hi>; or as I have rendered it in more proper terms, <hi>ſpiritumque vitalem in nares ejus flavit, atque h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſpeaking, contain nothing about an immortal and reaſonable Soul; tho there is no doubt, but that God, together with Life, infuſed <hi>that</hi> alſo into Man's Body. The diſtinction of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> between <hi>the breath of Life</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>a living Soul,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is grounded neither upon the Phraſe it ſelf, nor any Scripture example, tho it is alledged on this place by <hi>Grotius.</hi> However it muſt be acknowledged, that we may conſider in the nature of Man his Body and Soul as two diſtinct parts; and then his Life, not as another part or effect of ſome third Principle, but as a certain affection of the Body; and that to this St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to have had a reſpect, <gap reason="foreign">

I deny but <hi>Simon Magus</hi> deſerved to be thus ſignalized, or rather branded, but I do not believe it is he whom the Apoſtle here has a reſpect to; nor is there any certain Hiſtory which relates all that is ſaid of him by Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> or agrees with his conjectures. It is affirmed firſt by <hi>Euſebius</hi> out of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> that <hi>Simon</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which our Author interprets of the beginning of the Government of <hi>Claudius,</hi> becauſe it ſeemed to agree better with his conjectures. <hi>Juſtin,</hi> and out of him <hi>Euſebius,</hi> ſay that <hi>Simon</hi> was accounted a God, and that a Statue was erected to him as ſuch. In which learned Men have long ſince ſhewn that <hi>Juſtin</hi> was miſtaken; and it may be probably conjectured that that Journy of <hi>Simon</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> was a Fiction of ſome ignorant Man, who had not a due regard to Truth, and miſunderſtood the Inſcription of that Statue. At leaſt that St. <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> there are very important Chronological Reaſons to disbelieve, tho I do not doubt but he came into that City, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd Matyrdom in it, under the Reign of <hi>Nero.

That which he ſays about the <hi>deifying</hi> of <hi>Simon</hi> is alone enough to ſhew, that he is not an Author, whoſe bare Affirmation may be ſafely truſted. And hence perhaps <hi>Irenaeus</hi> would not poſitively affirm <hi>a Claudio Caeſare ſtatua honoratum propter magiam, that</hi> [Simon] <hi>was honoured with a Statue by</hi> Claudius Ceſar <hi>for his magick</hi>; but prefixed to this Story <hi>dicitur, it is reported.</hi> What our Authot ſays about his concealing himſelf, and contending with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is taken <hi>ex Clementinis,</hi> and unworthy of any credit. The reſt which he relates concerning his Followers ſhould have bin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly proved by the teſtimonies of good Authors; becauſe it is the ground of what he ſays here about the <hi>revelation</hi> of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> and that being uncertain, the other muſt be ſo too.

And could not he who erred ſo groſly in theſe things, not to mention any more, raſhly take an occaſion from the inſcription of a Statue, which he miſunderſtood, to ſay what was not true? He was a Martyr, what then? Are Martyrs infallible, or to be believed when they are manifeſtly miſtaken? And if they have been deceived in ſome eaſy things, and are not to be credited in all, why might not they be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in matters of greater difficulty? Beſides, this Inſcription, if it be underſtood of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> is contrary both to the uſe of the Latin Tongue and the Cuſtom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor is it at all countenanced by the Hiſtory of that Age. In Latin there is none ſo called, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>Deus Sanctus,</hi> beſides <hi>Semon</hi> or <hi>Simon</hi> (if we chuſe ſo to write it, tho corruptly) an unknown God of the <hi>Sabins,</hi> or <hi>Hercules,</hi> as <hi>Lilius Giraldus</hi> will inform us in <hi>Hiſt.

And if ſo unuſual a thing had been done by <hi>Claudius,</hi> whoſe Folly ſo many Writers have recorded, there would be ſome mention made of it by the Heathens, whereas there is not the leaſt mark or ſign of it any where to be found. But, ſays our Author, if <hi>Juſtin</hi> had been miſtaken, or wrote what he knew to be falſe, the Emperors to whom he wrote, would eaſily have diſcovered the Cheat. But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors perhaps did not ſo much as look into the <hi>Apologeticks</hi> of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> it may be which was their ignorance or wickedneſs; they laughed at them, and deſpiſed every thing elſe that was good in them, becauſe of this error. And who can doubt, if there was ever any <hi>Tripho Judaeus</hi> in the World that ſhould have read his Dialogue, or any other <hi>Jew</hi> whatſoever, but he would have ſcorned, and that juſtly, what <hi>Juſtin</hi> upbraids the Jews with, as to the corruption of the ſacred Writings, which in a modern Author would be called a Calumny.

Such were the <hi>Epicureans</hi> and other Pſeudo Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:99486:267"/>
who lived in the practice of the greateſt Vices, which they cover'd with a philoſophical Cloak, and could not endure the ſanctity of the Chriſtian Doctrin; or being blinded by Pride, and a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their own Wiſdom, thought it would be a diſgrace to them to confeſs that Men ſo univerſally learned as they, could learn any thing from <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> called them, or acknowledg that they had all the while before been ſtudying and philoſophizing in vain.

Sect. 1. Cap. 12. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> interprets the Love of God to ſignify that Love which is terminated upon God, and ſo makes the Genitive <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which I acknowledg to be a ſenſe worthy of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. But if we interpret it of a <hi>Love</hi> commanded by God, ſo that the Genitive be underſtood to ſignify a Cauſe, the ſenſe will be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as proper and agreeable to the Goſpel.

               <p n="2">II. In <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.50. This Law is given to the <hi>Levites: They ſhall bear the Tabernacle, and all the veſſels thereof; they ſhall minister unto it, and ſhall encamp round about the Tabernacle:</hi> which words muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in their proper ſenſe; for the <hi>Levites</hi> in the Deſart did really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp about the Tabernacle.

               <p n="3">III.

               <p n="4">IV. In 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vi.2. God is called <hi>the Lord of Hosts,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, as frequently elſewhere, not as the Lord of the Ark or Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which is a Phraſe that no where occurs, and the Ark and Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle are never called <hi>hosts</hi>; but the Diſcourſe is about conveying the Ark from one place to another, to which the title of <hi>Lord of hosts,</hi> that is, Preſident of War, has no manner of relation. But what then? Is not God often called by that name in the Prophets, where neither War, nor the Miniſtry of the Prieſts or Levites is ſpoken of?

theſe are perpetual Epithets, and as it were Appendages to proper Names, or like Sirnames, which are uſed whenever thoſe Names are mention'd without any certain deſign. The <hi>Jews</hi> called the true God <hi>the Lord of Hosts,</hi> becauſe they look'd upon Victory as one of the chief Favours God could confer upon men in this World; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a Defeat in War, whereby whole Nations were ſometimes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Slavery, as the greateſt evil. They ſaw alſo often, that thoſe whom God favoured obtained the Victory, tho they were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour both in Policy and Strength to their Enemies: and that tho all military Stratagems were uſed in Battels, yet the Event was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and did not depend upon men; becauſe unforeſeen Accidents, tho very ſmall, are ſometimes the cauſe of Victories and Defeats. Therefore they thought that God did preſide in a ſpecial manner over War, and thence made him a Sirname. The Heathens ſometimes ſpeak almoſt in the ſame manner about their Deities, as <hi>Hirtius</hi> de <hi>Bello Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andr.</hi> c. 75. where he deſcribes the Battel between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,</hi> whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> overcame with much fewer Forces, and thoſe not ſufficiently prepared to fight: <hi>Clamore ſublato,</hi> ſaith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="5">V. The Angels are called <hi>Gods Hosts</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> ciii.21. becauſe God uſes them as Kings and Generals do Armies, to aſſiſt their Friends in danger, and ſubdue their Enemies; and the Stars, not the Sun and Moon only, becauſe they are like a ſtraggling Army, diſperſed over all parts of the Heaven.</p>

               <p>As to the deſertion of that Office, it is a great Sin without doubt in thoſe, who have applyed themſelves to it being duly qualified, and can diſcharge it as they ought and uſefully; but how many are there who raſhly aſpire to that Office, as to ſome Magiſtracy or ſecular Dignity, for the ſake of Honour and Profit, who are deſtitute of Gifts neceſſary to the right exerciſe of it? And it would be much better if ſuch men repented of their Vow (if a purpoſe reſpecting only Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ought to be called a Vow) after they had found by experience how unfit they were for the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and ſet themſelves to ſome other employment, for which they were better qualified.

And at a feaſt time nothing ſhould be done ſorrowfully or by constraint. Or rather becauſe it is decent for Virgins to be married in the preſence of a great many, but not for Widows. For the first marriage is deſirable, but the ſecond is abominable.</hi> The laſt words are alledged by <hi>Grotius,</hi> than which nothing can be more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the buſineſs in hand; and our Author would not have done amiſs, if he had followed him, who is for the moſt part a faithful guide. <hi>Plutarch</hi> adds ſome things to which our Author refers, which I ſhall therefore tranſcribe: <gap reason="foreign">

But perhaps they were delivered firſt from the Pulpit, in a Diſcourſe to the People, and afterwards inſerted in his Annotations on the New Teſtament, but in an improper place.

               <p n="3">III. Nor is that confuſed heap of places out of <hi>Ignatius</hi> much to the purpoſe, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays nothing here about Biſhops, and becauſe ſuch times may happen wherein it would be a piece of madneſs to truſt Biſhops, as our Author acknowledges.

It was poſſible that in the time of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, of whom many had ſeen the Apoſtles, and many had their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for their Teachers, might be Men devoted to the Truth, and faithful Paſtors; and that induced him to inſiſt ſo much upon their Authority: but theſe are not leſſons for all times and places.</p>

In interpreting theſe words, two things are neceſſary to be done. Firſt, we muſt conſider the ſcope of the Speaker, and by that his words are to be underſtood rather than by the proper meaning of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Phraſe. The words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignify literally, as they are rendred in the <hi>Vulgar, nam ſi eis Jeſus quietem praeſtitiſſet, For if Jeſus had given them Reſt.</hi> But if they be ſo interpreted, the Apoſtle's reaſoning will be of no force: <hi>If</hi> Joſhua <hi>had conducted thoſe antient</hi> Jews <hi>into a quiet Habitation; the Scripture would not ſpeak of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, in which the Voice of God ought to be heard.</hi> Why not? Ought not the Men of the following Ages to be obedient to the Commands of God? Yes. But the meaning of the Sacred Writer in the words alledged is this, which I have expreſſed in the beginning of this Note, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſomething is to be ſupplied in the following words, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe what oppoſition could there be between <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>another day?</hi> If there were no other reſt, beſides that which <hi>Joſhua</hi> gave the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

                  <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> it would not thence follow there could not be <hi>another day</hi> or another time, in which the Voice of God could not be deſpiſed without danger. But we muſt ſupply here what I have alſo before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in which we ſhall be excluded out of God's Reſt, if we do not obey his Voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet two things ought to be carefully obſerved in ſuch Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Additions, <hi>Firſt,</hi> no Interpretation is to be admitted, which the deſign of the Speaker clearly underſtood does not require, and to which deſign the Writers reaſoning makes nothing, unleſs it be otherwiſe underſtood than the words properly ſignify. Our Author Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> has but little regard to the ſcope of this place, into which he brings his <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> by head and ſhoulders, when the ſcope requires no ſuch thing. I have endeavour'd to make directly towards it, and think I have not much erred from it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that which is ſupplied, muſt be taken, if I may ſo ſpeak, out of the very bowels of the Diſcourſe, ſo that what is expreſſed do naturally and purely ariſe from propoſitions that muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed to be underſtood. And what I have ſupplied ſeems to me to be ſuch, but what Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> adds, ſeems altogether foreign to this place, of which let the Reader be judg.</p>
               <p>Hence we may infer that the ſtile of this Writer is far from being formed by the Laws of Rhetorick; according to which our firſt care ſhould be to ſpeak properly and clearly what we would have clearly underſtood, that the Reader or Hearer may comprehend what we ſay without any pain; and the ſecond to omit nothing but what any one may eaſily ſupply. <hi>Nobis,</hi> ſay the Maſters of that Faculty, <hi>prima ſit virtus perſpicuitas, rectus ordo, non in longum dilata concluſio; nihil neque deſit, neque ſuperſtuat.

But the ſtile of the Jewiſh <hi>Midraſchim</hi> is nothing leſs than Rhetorical, and them the Writer of this Epiſtle follows, and not without great reaſon, becauſe he ſpake to a Nation accuſtomed to ſuch a ſtile. This by the way, which it may ſuffice to have ſaid once, tho we muſt carry it in our eye throughout this whole Epiſtle.</p>

               <p n="2">II. This being ſuppoſed the genuin and proper ſignification of the Verb, the ſeries of the Diſcourſe is clear, which otherwiſe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing intricate. The Apoſtolical Writer ſaith, that the <hi>Jews</hi> needed to be inſtructed in that part of the Chriſtian Doctrin, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Proſelytes; which yet he ſays he would not now ſet before them, deferring it to another time; then he ſubjoins the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. as if he had ſaid,
<q>I will not propoſe again that Doctrin, whereby Proſelytes uſe to be converted to the Chriſtian Faith, that ſo I may reduce thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who have apoſtatized from it; for this they know as well as other things, which I might ſay to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. By ſuch a Diſcourſe Men who have been once enlightned with divine Light, who had received the heavenly Gift of a quiet Mind, who had been endued with a power to work Miracles, who have had foretaſts in the Church of the promiſed Happineſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life, and nevertheleſs have revolted from Chriſt; by ſuch a Diſcourſe, I ſay, I cannot <hi>renew again</hi> ſuch Men ſo as that they ſhould repent.</q>
But why is it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>impoſſible to renew again</hi> ſuch Men? <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe whatever could be ſaid or done in order to that end, had been done and ſaid already. They had heard all, and had been ſenſible of all that was naturally apt to fix and engage them for ever to Chriſt. And yet they had not adhered to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Perſecutions. There was nothing more could be done to reduce them to a better Mind, unleſs thoſe things which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfectly underſtood, and perceived the efficacy of, were again repeated to them, which would have been to no purpoſe. The ſame
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:99486:287"/>
is the ſenſe of the following compariſon, and of that which is ſaid about this matter in <hi>Chap.</hi> x.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Now if any one enquire concerning the thing it ſelf, if he throughly conſider it, he will eaſily ſee that it is not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Apoſtolical Writer affirmed it to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, if not abſolutely <hi>impoſſible,</hi> as we now ſpeak with the Vulgar Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet at leaſt extremely difficult, and the hardeſt thing poſſible. The reaſon I before intimated, becauſe ſuch Men have abuſed all the Reaſons and Arguments which might have inſeparably united them to Chriſt. They are that <hi>Vine of God</hi> for which he had done all that could be done to make them bring forth good Fruit, and yet had brought forth wild Grapes: For which reaſon ſome of the Antients plainly affirmed that it was in vain to expect the Repentance of ſuch Men. As <hi>Hermas</hi> in Lib. iii. Simil. 6. <hi>His non eſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>per poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam regreſſus ad vitam; quoniam quidem adjecerunt ad reliqua peccata ſua, quod nomen Domini nefandis inſectati ſunt verbis; hujuſmodi homines morti ſunt deſtinati. Theſe Perſons cannot return by Repentance to Life; becauſe they have added to the reſt of their Sins, that of blaſpheming the Name of the Lord; ſuch Men as theſe are appointed to Death.</hi> See alſo <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in his Book entitl. <hi>Quis dives ſalvetur.</hi>
               </p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is no where in the Holy Scriptures taken for thoſe Church-Penalties which were impoſed upon Penitents before they were admitted again to Communion. Our Author ſhould have produced but one place to make himſelf believed. For it is not ſafe to reaſon about what was done in antient times from the ſtile of the Fathers, becauſe together with new Cuſtoms there were new Names alſo invented, and new ſignifications given to old ones. We have no reaſon to ſuppoſe that the manner of a publick Repentance was the ſame in the Apoſtles times, as afterwards. The Engliſh or German Articles are vainly alledged in this place: But our Author ſhould have cited the viith <hi>Can.</hi> of the <hi>Neocaeſarean</hi> Council, in which the phraſe he ſets down is, not the lii, for there are only xv <hi>Canons</hi> in all of that Council. Such another miſtake I have already elſewhere obſerved.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> here, there is not the leaſt mark or footſtep. The Apoſtolical Writer only makes mention of ſome that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from Chriſt, whether to the <hi>Heathens</hi> or the <hi>Jews.</hi> And ſuch Men joining themſelves to the perſecutors of the Chriſtians, which had formerly crucified Chriſt, did, as much as in them lay, the ſame; becauſe they approved the fact, and deſpitefully uſed Chriſt's Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. This agrees no more to the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> than to any Apoſtates.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="548" facs="tcp:99486:288"/>VI. I don't think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or others, rejected this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, becauſe of this place, as contrary to their Cuſtom; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe the Author of it was not certainly known. Nor was it admitted becauſe this Paſſage began to be better underſtood, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at length the moſt judicious Perſons eaſily obſerved that the ſtile and reaſonings of this Epiſtle were agreeable to the Apoſtles times; in which alſo and no other there could be an Epiſtle written to the Jewiſh Brethren, apart from the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; for in the following Age there was no difference between the Members of the Chriſtian Church, nor any remembrance of Circumciſion and Uncircumciſion. In the antient Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears from <hi>Herma,</hi> there was the ſame opinion about the difficulty of Repentance, in thoſe who after they had been throughly inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion, and been zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for it, ſhamefully apoſtatized from it. Beſides, that manner of Repentance which was afterwards inſtituted, not having been known in the Primitive times, not to ſay that there is no mention made of it in this place, an Epiſtle could not be rejected as contrary to a Cuſtom which had not yet prevailed.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. It is very true that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> often ſignifies what it is not lawful to do, but here it ſeems to ſignify that which is very difficult; for which reaſon a very antient Greek and Latin Copy of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, kept at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Library of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> has in this place, <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile,</hi> tho the Tranſlation is uſually literal: So <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is taken in <hi>Mat.</hi> xix.26. I ſhall not add any thing about the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> whom our Author here ſeeks for, becauſe I have often confuted him.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Note</hi> c. Our Author here thinks that in this place the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of a Similitude are confounded; for which reaſon the Apoſtolical Writer ſpeaks of the Earth, as he would ſpeak of Men. And indeed there ſeems to be ſome ground for this ſuppoſition, if the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be rendred, as uſual, <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a bleſſing from God.</hi> But that mixture of the parts of a Similitude being very improper, I had rather interpret <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſo, as that the <hi>conſequent</hi> ſhould be expreſſed by the <hi>antecedent,</hi> and that the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould not ſignify <hi>to receive,</hi> but to <hi>uſe</hi> the bleſſing received from God, that is, Rain, Sunſhine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the ſenſe will be very proper: <hi>for the Earth which drinketh in the Rain that cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth Herbs meet for them for whom it is dreſſed, uſes the Bleſſing which it receives from God; but that which beareth Thorns and Briers, is reprobate and near a Curſe, whoſe end is to be burnt</hi>; that is, which is of no uſe, except that the Briers and Thorns which grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it are burned, or ſerve to make Fires. It is common for the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:99486:288"/>
to be taken for the conſequent: See <hi>S. Glaſſius</hi> Rhetor. Sacr. <hi>Tract.</hi> 1. c. 1. <hi>de Metonymia Cauſae.</hi> I might otherwiſe interpret theſe words, <hi>is ſaid to have received a bleſſing from God.</hi>

               <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Note</hi> e. I. I don't underſtand what our Author means when he ſays that <hi>it was perhaps taken into the Heathen Oracles from</hi> the Prophets, <hi>that about that time among the</hi> Romans <hi>the dignity of the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate was joined with the Imperial.</hi> What Oracles are thoſe? When and where deliver'd? Was there any need of inferring from the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Prophets, contrary to all the rules of Logick, that a thing was done at <hi>Rome,</hi> which every one knew? But perhaps he meant to ſpeak of the time to come, tho his words ſignify a thing paſt. However that be, either thoſe Oracles were none at all, or only counterfeited; and our Author dared not, or could not produce them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Even from the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> it was decreed, that if he begat a Son, he ſhould be High-Prieſt. Of which ſee <hi>J.

Where <hi>nulli majores</hi> are ſuch, whoſe Names and Exploits through length of time are forgotten. And ſuch were the Parents of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedek,</hi> for which reaſon he is ſaid to have been <hi>without Father</hi> and <hi>without Mother,</hi> &amp;c. If we conſider this attentively, we ſhall eaſily perceive that before the time of Chriſt no Man could, without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, have imagin'd from the Story of <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> there would hereafter come an Eternal Prieſt, who was to be Succeſſor to none, nor have any to ſucceed him. Nor could any Man after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, gather by mere reaſoning, grounded upon critical Rules, that <hi>Melchiſedeks</hi> Parents and Death were omitted in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with this deſign, that by ſuch a ſilence he might be an Image of Chriſt. Whoever ſhould have pretended this, might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by a bare Negation. Why therefore, you will ſay, did the Apoſtolical Writer inſiſt ſo much upon that Story with the <hi>Jews?</hi> For it's plain he does not ſay here he had any revelation made to him of that matter, nor require credit to be given to his bare Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I anſwer, the Allegorical Writers of the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time, accommodated innumerable places to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> not relying upon any Grammatical Interpretation, but a certain old Cuſtom of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture in that manner. So becauſe they interpreted <hi>Pſalm</hi> cx. of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Sacred Writer makes uſe of that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to his purpoſe; and becauſe they acknowledged the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ought to be <hi>like Melchiſedek,</hi> he reaſons againſt them from their own Conceſſion; not againſt other Men who might have denied what he aſſumed. And he uſed this way of diſputing with the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo much the more willingly, becauſe nothing followed from ſuch an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation contrary to thoſe things which he knew were true concerning Chriſt; yea he might, according to the Jewiſh Cuſtom, compare <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Melchiſedek.</hi> Otherwiſe, if the thing be conſider'd in it

a <hi>periphraſis</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The reaſon he alledges for this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of no moment, becauſe here is not a mere repetition. The ſenſe is:

Our learned Author would have done much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if he had followed <hi>Grotius,</hi> what he here ſays being either wreſted or affirmed without reaſon. To begin with his laſt words, I will not ſay that the authority of the Writers of Liturgies, whoever they be, is of little moment to the explication of particular places of Scripture; becauſe they had ſcarce any tincture of Critical Learning, as every one knows. But I will ſay that our Author ſuppoſes here two things, which may be called into queſtion. Firſt, that a bloody Sacrifice was offer'd up by <hi>Abel,</hi> which is uncertain, as I have ſhewn on <hi>Gen.</hi> iv.4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that all the Sacrifices were <hi>Types,</hi> that is, in the language of our modern Divines, Prefigurations of the Sacrifice of Chriſt; which if denied, can be proved by no Argument: tho I acknowledg there was ſome likeneſs between them, in which ſenſe they might be called <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, becauſe of their Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, not becauſe of a deſign to preſignify one by the other, which no one knew of. Yet our Author, in his Paraphraſe, attributes his own opinion to the Writer of this Epiſtle, who has nothing at all here about that matter. See my Note on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x.3.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The efficacy of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Sacrifice is not compared here with the efficacy of <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacrifice; but the thing which <hi>Abel</hi> called for (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his own, or the Blood of Sacrifices) with the thing which Chriſt demands. And therefore the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>better things,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be referred to efficacy, and reſpects nothing but what Chriſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. But it is ſaid, the deſign of this Epiſtle is to ſhew the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of the Goſpel above the Law. I do not deny it, but every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular word does not tend to that deſign; for there are alſo a great many things intermix'd in it foreign to that deſign. So that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with moſt Interpreters, look upon theſe words as an alluſion to what is ſaid of <hi>Abel</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> xi.4. which opinion is manifeſtly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

Thoſe who ſat there, were eſtimated by nothing but the name of Chriſtians, and were admitted into thoſe Aſſemblies becauſe they were Chriſtians, and not becauſe they were Rich.

And therefore I rather think what the Apoſtle here ſays is to be underſtood of the laſt Judgment, which he ſpeaks of as near at hand, becauſe it was unknown when it was to be, and therefore every Age ought to look upon it as nigh. And it's certain as to particular Perſons, Chriſt may truly be ſaid to come, when he calls them by Death to Judgment.</p>

So that what our Author here ſays about the Abſolution of the Church, is foreign to this place. Whoever ſeriouſly endeavours to reform his paſt Life, and to make continual progreſs in Holineſs, does not need the forgiveneſs of a Prieſt; on which Chriſt has no

It is ridiculous to ſay that the Prayers of an Elder praying <hi>ex officio,</hi> are more effectual, than the Prayers of any good Man whatſoever that fears God; as if God grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the thing requeſted of him, for a Mans Office, and not for his Piety. And there is the ſame abſurdity in ſaying that a Prieſt particularly laying open the Sins of his Brother to God, is the more likely by that means to prevail with him; as if God did not know what a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtands in need of, or had promiſed more to ſuch Prayers than to general ones. And little better is that which is added about <hi>direction,</hi> as if it were certain that Elders uſe to give better or more faithful advice in this matter, than any other pious and learned Men; when experience teaches us that they have no more diſcretion than others, and often uſe Religion only as a means to enrich themſelves, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Authority.</p>

                  </gap>, for <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>keepers</hi> are all one. So that the Divinity is ſaid to have called the Men that lived before the Flood to Repentance, together with the Angels, who admoniſhed <hi>Noah</hi> to exhort them to a better Life. I ſhould render this place thus: <hi>and being quickned by the Spirit, by which he went with the Spirits that watch, and preached to the unbelieving,</hi> &amp;c. When God is about to do any thing among men, he is repreſented as coming down from Heaven attended with a guard of Angels, of which I have ſpoken on <hi>Gen.</hi> i.27. and xi.7. and <hi>Exod.</hi> xx.1. For this reaſon coming down with the Angels, to admoniſh <hi>Noah</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to call men to repentance, he is ſaid <hi>to have gone with the Spirits that watch:</hi> and beſides, to have done that which <hi>Noah</hi> did in his name and by his command. The Example out of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> ii.17. clearly ſhews, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> might ſpeak in this manner.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Note</hi> g. I. All that is here ſaid by our Author are vain Conjectures, which have no foundation either in things themſelves, or in the uſe of Scripture; tho he often repeats them, and that as very probable. (1) The Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies, <hi>not to believe, not to obey</hi>; which is a heinous ſin, where the thing to be believed or done is of great importance; and a ſmall one where it is a matter of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moment. Here it ſignifies a great ſin, becauſe the men of the old world would not obey God, calling them by the Miniſtry of <hi>Noah</hi> to a better life. (2) Tho we can ſay nothing particularly of the ſins of the men who lived before the Flood; yet we may deny that it can be gather'd from the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> that they were corrupted with the ſin of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and other ſuch like. Tho they are joined with the <hi>Sodomites</hi> for their wickedneſs and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it does
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:99486:310"/>
not therefore follow that they were both guilty of the ſame kind of Impieties, different ſorts of wicked men being often joined together, and the ſame puniſhments ſuffered for divers crimes. (3) The Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  </gap>, <hi>intemperance,</hi> becauſe it is a more general name which comprehends under it the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, not that thoſe words are ordinarily confounded. (4) It is true that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſometimes have thoſe ſignifications, which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> attributes to them, as alſo the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſchibheth,</hi> uſed by <hi>Moſes</hi>; but they likewiſe ſignify in general any kind of depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or change for the worſe, in which ſenſe I ſhall take the word in <hi>Moſes,</hi> till it be evidently proved that a general ſignification, in him, can have no place. (5) The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> no more ſignifies <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> than any other ſort of Injuſtice, as I have ſhewn on <hi>Gen.</hi> vi.13. So that what our Author builds upon that ſignification is vain, as all the reſt of his Conjectures which rely upon this foundation. Our learned Author often forges an Interpretation, by heaping together a parcel of very ſlight Conjectures; afterwards he raiſes what Superſtructure he pleaſes upon that interpretation; and then laſtly ſpeaks of the Conſectaries he thence deduces as ſo many certain Truths. But we ought not only to ſet bounds to our Conjectures, but eſpecially to the Conſequences we deduce from them, if we would not be in perpetual danger of erring. That danger no body here will be in, who ſhall ſuppoſe that the men of the old World were very wicked men; there being in that no conjecture, becauſe it is affirmed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in plain words: but whoever ſhall attempt particularly to explain what <hi>Moſes</hi> has ſaid in general, and give way in this matter to Conjectures, will find himſelf in the dark. And this may ſuffice to have been ſaid briefly againſt a way of interpreting Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten takes.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>Note</hi> a. OUR Author here ſays that Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s phraſe in verſ. 6. of this Chapter is <hi>hard,</hi> and I do not deny it; but I ſay alſo that he is a <hi>hard</hi> Interpreter, if ever any one deſerved that name. For here, as one ſaid, <hi>lapides loquitur, he ſpeaks ſtones,</hi> not words to mollify hard phraſes. The whole ſenſe of this verſe depends upon a particular Elegancy ariſing from the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of the phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to ſuffer in the fleſh,</hi> or <hi>to the fleſh</hi>; which being uſed of Chriſt, ſignifies <hi>that he ſuffered and died in his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or <hi>for the ſake of our humane nature,</hi> i. e. of men. But when <hi>we</hi> are ſaid to <hi>die</hi> or <hi>ſuffer to the fleſh,</hi> we are underſtood to be no longer devoted to the fleſh, or to the vices of the fleſh: and accordingly St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s meaning is this; ſeeing I ſay that Chriſt <hi>has ſuffer'd to the fleſh,</hi> ye alſo who ought to imitate him as far as ye are able, know that <hi>you muſt ſuffer to the fleſh,</hi> in a ſenſe which is agreeable to you, to wit, wholly renounce it: for he that <hi>has ſuffered to the fleſh, has ceaſed from ſin.</hi> Juſt ſuch another ſort of reaſoning we have in <hi>Rom.</hi> vi.10, 11. in the place parallel to this. <hi>For in that he died</hi> (inſtead of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> here ſays <hi>ſuffered</hi>) he DIED UNTO SIN <hi>once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be</hi> DEAD <hi>indeed</hi> UNTO SIN, <hi>but alive unto God.</hi> Inſtead of <hi>to die unto ſin,</hi> here is <hi>to ſuffer to the fleſh</hi>; but both theſe phraſes have the ſame ambiguity in them. <hi>Theſe</hi> places ſhould have been compared, not <hi>verſe</hi> 6. with this, which have no affinity with one another.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="595" facs="tcp:99486:311"/>
And I do not deny but this might be done by them, but there having been among the Jews every where a great number of Proſelytes, of which many embraced the Chriſtian Religion, I rather think St. <hi>Peter</hi> has a reſpect here to theſe, who had formerly been Idolaters.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was the ſame as to <hi>die to the fleſh,</hi> who could digeſt any impropriety, tho never ſo great, in his own ſtile. But it is much more natural to interpret it; <hi>ſo that they were condemned indeed in the fleſh, according to men</hi>; that is, put to death by the judgment of men, as to the body; <hi>but live according to God in the Spirit,</hi> that is, their Souls were made partakers of eternal life by God. This is the uſual ſignification of the words, which ought not to be changed without reaſon.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Note</hi> f. This is all forced, the meaning is evidently this: <hi>If ye are reproached for the name of Chriſt</hi> (that is, becauſe ye will be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtians) <hi>happy are ye; becauſe the Spirit of glory and of God reſteth with you</hi>; that is, thoſe reproaches are ſo far from being a ſign that the Spirit hitherto beſtowed upon you by God, and which has brought ſo much glory to the Goſpel, departs from you, that on the contrary it ſo much the more <hi>reſteth,</hi> or will more conſtantly abide with you, as long as ye ſtedfaſtly profeſs the Chriſtian Religion.

            <head>ANNOTATIONS ON THE Second Epiſtle General of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AT the end of the <hi>Premom.</hi>] For my part, as I profeſs my ſelf to be of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Opinion as to the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s being the Writer of this Epiſtle; ſo I cannot forbear ſaying that our learned and pious Author deals a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairly with <hi>Hugo Grotius.</hi> I. He ſuſpects here and elſewhere, without reaſon, that the Poſthumous Annotations of <hi>Grotius</hi> had not paſt his review before they were publiſhed, as alſo that there were ſome things mixed with them by another hand, contrary to his real ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But it appears both by <hi>Grotius</hi> his Epiſtles, lately publiſhed, and others, that the learned <hi>J. Mercer,</hi> a man of unqueſtionable integrity, received all theſe things from <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf, and his Widow, to be ſet forth, and publiſhed them as he had received them. But <hi>Grotius</hi> is here and elſewhere miſtaken. As if that Learned man had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all danger of error! It's plain all theſe things have one and the ſame ſtyle, and are written in the ſame ſtrain; and I do not think it would have been an eaſy matter in <hi>France,</hi> or elſewhere, to find a man that could have obtruded his own works inſtead of <hi>Grotius</hi>'s upon the more judicious ſort of Readers. II. Beſides, why did Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> not take notice that there are other reaſons, for which both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and later Writers have ſuſpected this Epiſtle, drawn from the ſtile, which is not like that of the former Epiſtle? Did not he know that <hi>Joſ. Scaliger</hi> alſo, who was afterwards followed by <hi>Cl. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius,</hi> thought this Epiſtle to be ſuppoſititious? Methinks all this may much extenuate <hi>Grotius</hi> his error, who only ſtudied for new arguments to confirm the opinion of thoſe great men. III. What our Author alledges out of Chap. iii.1. to prove that this is a ſecond Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is of no force, if that Chapter it ſelf be a ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>Simeon,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> conjectures, whom he ought to have confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. IV. The comparing of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Annotations on <hi>Mat.</hi> xvii. with thoſe he has on <hi>Chap.</hi> i.17. of this Epiſtle, does not prove
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:99486:313"/>
that theſe were written by another hand;<note place="margin">Chapter I.</note> becauſe <hi>Grotius</hi> might have changed his Opinion, as he plainly here acknowledges. If Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> had lived longer, and carefully reviewed his own An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations, I doubt not but he would have alter'd a great many things which I have corrected in him.

They that have rejected this Epiſtle as falſly attributed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> have not ſtuck to ſay that the Perſon of that Apoſtle is here ill repreſented, <hi>Scaliger</hi> having adventured to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that it is <hi>commentum veteris Chriſtiani otio ſuo abutentis, The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſome antient Chriſtian who did not know how to employ his time better.</hi> VI. <hi>Grotius</hi> did not infer from <hi>Simeon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Epiſtle, as he ſuppoſed, that it was written after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; but on the contrary, from its being written after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that City, that we muſt find out ſome Writer who ſurvived it, to whom this Epiſtle might be attributed, and whom he thought to be this <hi>Simeon,</hi> becauſe of the likeneſs of the name. VII. It cannot be denied that the Chriſtians, who had read <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiv. did not expect the conſummation of all things before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; but it did not therefore follow that the laſt Day of all the World was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to follow that Deſtruction. So that tho the Chriſtians were here commanded to wait patiently for the laſt Judgment, it would not follow that this Epiſtle was written after the demoliſhing of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> This I had rather ſay, than deny there is any mention here made of the laſt Judgment, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> does with the greateſt confidence, in oppoſition to moſt other Interpreters. VIII. Our Author followed, as he ordinarily does, <hi>Caeſ. Baronius,</hi> as to the year of Chriſt in which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſuffer'd Martyrdom. But <hi>Ant. Pagus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that it happen'd in the year of Chriſt LXV, and Dr. <hi>Pearſon</hi> in LXVIII, whom I chuſe to follow. But if we ſuppoſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> died at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Year which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks, and that he wrote this Epiſtle a little before his Death, it cannot be ſaid that the Jewiſh War was then approaching, which began in the xiith of <hi>Nero,</hi> and in the ii<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Ceſtius Florus</hi> Preſident of <hi>Judea,</hi> and of <hi>Christ</hi> LXVI, and in the Month of <hi>May.</hi> See Dr. <hi>Pearſon</hi>'s <hi>Annales Paulinae.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifying any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Manners, does ſometimes peculiarly denote what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor here ſuppoſes to be refer'd to. But I ſee in this place no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which ſhould oblige us to take thoſe words in any other than a general ſenſe.

It is uſed ſeveral times in this ſenſe in the Epiſtle of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as I have thereon obſerved. But I ſhould not compare the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, by which the Minds of the Evangelical Prophets were fitted to underſtand obſcure places of Scripture, with the Jewiſh <hi>Cabbala.</hi> For this without any regard had to the literal ſenſe, taken from the proper or metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical ſignification of words, and the ſeries and occaſion of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, deduces <hi>any thing out of any</hi> place of Scripture, and relies either upon trivial reaſonings to prove what it aſſerts, or very uncertain Tradition; ſo that if any deny it, there is no means left to convince them, and thoſe that believe it do ſo upon inſufficient grounds, and may be made to believe any thing, tho never ſo unreaſonable. But the Chriſtian Prophets, who received their Knowledg from <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> alledged nothing out of Scripture that was not in it, and could not be deduced out of it by Grammatical Reaſons. Otherwiſe Prophecies muſt have been explained by Prophecies, and the new Prophets atteſted to by Miracles, to make it believed, that ſuch a thing was contained in the Old Prophets, becauſe they affirmed it to be ſo, which otherwiſe no Man could have ſeen in them; which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of acting does not ſeem worthy of the Spirit of God, as I have ſhewn out of a learned Man on <hi>Matt.</hi> i.22.

                  </gap>: <hi>we dare ſay (for here is the Faith enlightned with Knowledg) that a true</hi> Gnoſtick <hi>knows all things, and underſtands all things, having a firm comprehenſion, even of thoſe things whereof we doubt; ſuch as were</hi> James, Peter, John, Paul, <hi>and the reſt of the Apoſtles.</hi> Then he adds, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>for Prophecy is full of knowledg, as having been given by the Lord, and by the Lord again manifeſted to the Apoſtles.

               <p n="4">IV. It is true indeed that in the Epiſtle of <hi>Barnabas</hi> many places of the Old Teſtament are explained Allegorically, and ſeveral Myſteries unfolded, which otherwiſe no one would have diſcerned in them.

               <p n="5">V.

               <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Note</hi> e. I.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the Day dawned, and the morning Star aroſe in your Hearts.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> here tells the Chriſtians, they did well that they read the Prophets, not as the only Rule of Faith, and a perfect and full Revelation of the Will of God; but as Books which they formerly, when they had nothing more clear and full, made uſe of with great Advantage, till Chriſt came and taught them all things. Our Author ſtrains this place in his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, whilſt he applies it to the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> g. I. It is true that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſignifies the Mind in Scripture, but it is not oppoſed here to <hi>Heaven,</hi> than which nothing could have been ſaid more flat; when the thing it ſelf ſhews, to any one of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, that the <hi>morning Star</hi> is to be underſtood in a metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

ſenſe. The <hi>morning Star,</hi> and the <hi>Day</hi> here ſignifie, the Doctrin of the Goſpel, compared with the Old Teſtament; which is ſaid to be <hi>riſen in our Hearts,</hi> when it is not only heard, but ſinks down into our Minds, ſo that we heartily believe it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. To incourage the Chriſtians to bear patiently the Perſecutions which they ſuffer'd in <hi>Judaea,</hi> in expectation that their Perſecutors ſhould be deſtroyed, it had been improper to propoſe to them the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament about that matter, which were very obſcure; when they had clear ones deliver'd by Chriſt, recorded in <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiv. and the parallel places of the other Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Tho I will not deny but the <hi>Day of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>the Day,</hi> are uſed for a time of Vengeance; yet wherever theſe Phraſes occur, we ought not preſently to apply them to that time, as our Author too often does. Becauſe he had interpreted ſome places of the New Teſtament not unhappily, about ſome vile Men whom he calls <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> there is ſcarce ever any thing ſaid about Impoſtors, or wicked Men, where he does not think the ſame Perſons to be ſpoken of. The like fault he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits almoſt wherever the Diſcourſe is about <hi>the Day,</hi> or about <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt,</hi> which he ſtrains to the Vengeance taken upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> overlooking all Circumſtances. For tho in his Paraphraſe the ſeries of the Diſcourſe ſeems to have a reſpect thereto, that is of no moment, becauſe he adds to the words of the Apoſtles what he pleaſes. In this place the <hi>morning Star</hi> and <hi>the dawning Day,</hi> are the Goſpel, <hi>until</hi> which the Law and the Prophets continued in force, which were like <hi>a Candle</hi> in the greateſt darkneſs wherein Mankind lay. Afterwards as the light of a Candle is quite obſcured by the light of the Sun, they were not of ſo great uſe, but yet not to be deſpiſed. The Goſpel is often compared to Light, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> iv.16. and <hi>John</hi> i.5. &amp; <hi>ſeqq.</hi> The condition alſo of the <hi>Jews</hi> before the Goſpel, is compared to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſame places.

I know our Author thinks there are two objections in this verſe, but doubtleſs he is miſtaken; for it is but one, conceived in theſe words, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming</hi>? which is confirmed by the following: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, FOR <hi>ſince the fathers fell aſleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the Creation.</hi> Which words do not contain a new objection, but an enforcement of the former; for becauſe no change had happened among mankind, generally conſidered, tho the Prophets were thought to have often foretold the laſt Judgment,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:99486:319"/>
therefore the Scoffers ſaid, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had ſpoken much more clearly of that coming, and oftner inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it than the Prophets; whereby it came to paſs, that the objection was with greater ſhew of ſtrength renewed againſt them. For which reaſon St. <hi>Peter</hi> here gives a particular and full ſolution to it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> b. I. Our Author ought in the firſt place, to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an example, by which it appeared that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies, <hi>except that,</hi> or ſomething like it; for no body will believe him barely affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what no one perhaps before ever obſerved.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Secondly, thoſe wicked men derided the promiſes of the divine Judgment, and ſo of the Reſurrection; becauſe ſince thoſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> to whom that promiſe was made, whoever they were ſuppoſed to be, not excepting <hi>Adam,</hi> were dead, there had been always the ſame ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men dying and being born, and no Generation hitherto, from the beginning of the World, had been ever raiſed from the dead, and called to Judgment. That perpetual ſucceſſion for ſo many ages had perſwaded them, as they ſaid, that it would always be ſo, and that the coming of Chriſt to judg Mankind was promiſed in vain. To that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection St. <hi>Peter</hi> firſt anſwers, that as the Earth had been of old crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with the water, which was mixed with it, and whereby wicked men had been puniſhed in the time of <hi>Noah</hi>: ſo it would once be that the Earth being diſſolved by means of Fire, which is in nature, bad men ſhould be puniſhed thereby. Which is juſt as if he had ſaid, that the change which will hereafter be made with fire, ought as eaſily to be believed, as that which had been of old made with water. This is clearly the ſenſe of this place, which ſhews the diſcourſe to be about the end of the whole World, not of the Jewiſh Commonwealth only.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If the Unbelievers, St. <hi>Peter</hi> oppoſes, had rejected only that which was ſaid concerning the ruin of the Jewiſh State, they would not have uſed ſuch an argument as this, that there had no change hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince the beginning of the World; becauſe no one was ſo ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as to deny that both many other Commonwealths had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and the Jewiſh State had been overthrown in the time of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> to omit other calamities that befel it. All, except a few furious Jews, were afraid of the deſtruction of that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by the Roman Power, which at that time not only lay heavy upon its neck, but was alſo an enemy to it. St. <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe would not have recurred to the Deluge to prove that the Jewiſh Commonwealth was to be deſtroyed, but to the Hiſtory of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and to the power of the Roman Empire, and the actions of the Romans. I need ſay no more in ſo clear a caſe.</p>

It is true that the <hi>whole</hi> is ſometimes expreſſed by <hi>all</hi> or <hi>ſome</hi> of its parts, by which no more is ſignified, than by the ſingle name of the whole. But I don't think that the <hi>heavens and the earth</hi> any where ſignifies either the earth alone, or this ſublunary region. At leaſt no place ever occurred to me in which theſe words were ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. See alſo my Note on <hi>Col.</hi> i.20.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Our Author in his Annotation ſays, that the words, <hi>heaven and earth,</hi> ſignify <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but in his Paraphraſe he makes no mention of their having any ſuch ſignification.

It is abſurd to ſpeak of a thing that is to come to paſs in a ſhort time, as if it were at the diſtance of ſeveral thouſand years, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> here would ſpeak, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s opinion.

When our Author refers us to his Premonition, for proof that St. <hi>Peter</hi> here ſpeaks of the exciſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not of the end of the World, he makes a mere circle; for what he ſays there is grounded upon theſe violent Interpretations, which if falſe, what he affirms in his Premonition muſt of neceſſity be falſe alſo. It is true indeed, that the Prophets,

when they deſcribe a great change in the Affairs of an Empire or Commonwealth, make, if I may ſo ſpeak, <hi>Heaven and Earth meet together (coelum terrae miſcent)</hi> and uſe ſuch like Phraſes.

                  </gap>, when it is alone, is ambiguous, and may be underſtood as well of the lower regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as of the upper: but when it is joined with the Planets, or the Stars, it ceaſes to be ambiguous, and ſignifies the ſtarry Heaven; as on the contrary, when it is ſaid <hi>the birds of heaven,</hi> the word <hi>Birds</hi> ſhews it to ſignifiy the air. But it is the greateſt abſurdity imaginable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">III. Nor is there any better ground for what our Author ſays about the diſtinct ſignification of <hi>the heavens</hi> and <hi>the earth</hi>; for the ſtyle of the Prophets in this matter is ſuch, as he himſelf obſerves on <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. that every word has not a particular ſignification, but the whole diſcourſe one general meaning. But Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> when he has any thing to prove, often takes up every thing that lies in his way, not excepting thoſe things which elſewhere he himſelf has confuted.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Note</hi> h. I. I agree with Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in keeping here to the ordinary reading. But the reſt of what he ſays is ſo forced, that I wonder ſo learned a man could ſatisfy himſelf in that wherein he will ſatisfy no one elſe. It is a miſtake that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in moſt of his Epiſtles ſpeaks of the deſtruction of the Jews, as I have ſhewn againſt our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in ſeveral places; on the contrary, nothing is more true than that he ordinarily ſpeaks of the laſt judgment. It is falſe that in the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there was any thing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for what was there in it hard to be underſtood? Was it ſtrange that a ſinful nation ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by God, or that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be demoliſhed, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſuffered the like under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar?</hi> Was it difficult at that time to underſtand that the Jews were oppreſſed by the Romans, whoſe ſubjects they then were? To none certainly but Fools or Madmen. It is needleſs to confute what our Author here ſays, about the ſeries of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s diſcourſe from <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. which I have already ſhewn that he miſinterprets.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="614" facs="tcp:99486:321"/>II. As it is improbable, conſidering the thing it ſelf, that Chriſt did not know the point of time in which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was to be deſtroyed; ſo it is yet more improbable, that that Deſtruction was ſo very unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at the time when this Epiſtle was written, and the whole Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Nation had broke out into Rebellion, and divided themſelves into ſeveral Factions. Whoever reads <hi>Joſephus</hi> of the Jewiſh War, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> invented what he thought would ſerve to confirm his Hypotheſis, and did not take it out of Hiſtory. Of the place in <hi>Acts.</hi> i.7. conſult <hi>H. Grotius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Our Author perpetually ſpeaks of the Deſtruction of the <hi>Gnoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as a concomitant of the deſtruction of the Jews; which would be tolerable, if the diſcourſe were only of thoſe that were in <hi>Judea,</hi> and feigned themſelves to be Jews: But what was this to the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> that dwelt in other Provinces of the Roman Empire? What did the Calamities which befel <hi>Judea</hi> concern alſo the Chriſtians that lived elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, except that they ſaw the Prophecies of Chriſt accompliſhed in them? There was no need likewiſe of their being carefully admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the particular point of time was unknown wherein <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was to be burnt, becauſe from the diſturbances that were in <hi>Judea,</hi> they might eaſily conclude that it was near at hand. The only thing the Apoſtles could then do in this matter, was to admoniſh the Jews that had embraced the Chriſtian Religion, and lived elſewhere, that they ſhould not go into <hi>Judea,</hi> nor enter into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> unleſs they would incur the ſame danger as threatned <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and that City.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Many might abuſe thoſe Paſſages of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in which he deſcribes the laſt Judgment, as if it were near at hand, becauſe the time of it was uncertain. See 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> c. iv. and v. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. It was now ten years, or more, ſince he had wrote in that manner to the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>; from whence ſome might conclude that he was deceived, and ſo revolt from the Faith they had received from him.

               <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Note</hi> a.

I do not think: for theſe refuſed to be accounted the diſciples of the Apoſtles, nor did the Apoſtles join themſelves to them; and therefore St. <hi>John</hi> would not have confuted them, as he here does, for it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently manifeſt that he confutes men that lived among the Chriſtians. I rather think he has a reſpect to ſome Jews, who were not throughly ſenſible of the ſins they had committed whilſt they were Jews, and in which they ſtill lived after their converſion to the Chriſtian Religion. Theſe ought to acknowledg that they <hi>had ſin,</hi> that is, as St. <hi>John</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſpeaks, that they <hi>had ſinned,</hi> and ſo had deſerved puniſhment for their paſt ſins; which unleſs they did, <hi>they made</hi> Chriſt <hi>a liar,</hi> becauſe they denied they ſtood in need of his Redemption, when he had taught that he came to redeem all the World; for he that has not ſinned, is liable to no puniſhment for ſin, and needs not a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Beſides, upon that confeſſion of their ſins, it was conſequent that they ſhould renounce them, if they would <hi>have fellowſhip</hi> with Chriſt, as he ſpeaks in <hi>verſe</hi> 7. that is, be his true diſciples, whom he would make partakers with himſelf of eternal happineſs. By this we may underſtand why St. <hi>John</hi> ſays he writes theſe things to Chriſtians, <hi>that they ſin not.</hi> But tho he uſes this phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

And therefore I had rather he had omitted it, and reſerved it for a fitter place; for it is a deceitful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe, which aſſumes things that are neither expreſly contained in the words of the Apoſtle, nor neceſſarily deduced from them. Our Author every now and then impoſes his own conceptions upon the

               <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Note</hi> b. I. I had rather our Author had contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a more general Aſſertion, and ſaid that St. <hi>John</hi> here had a reſpect to divers <hi>falſe Chriſtians,</hi> which at that time had revolted from the Chriſtian Church, and the Doctrin of the Apoſtles, whether they were <hi>Simon</hi>'s Diſciples, or others. For this only being affirmed, there would have been no need of interpreting ſeveral words of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not ſo much as they truly ſignify, as according to the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he would have to belong to them, that he might find in them his own Opinion. Read what he ſays of the five things foretold by Chriſt, which he ſuppoſes to be ſpoken of in this Chapter as fulfilled; and compare it with St. <hi>John</hi>'s own words, and it will appear that a great many things muſt be ſupplied in them, to make out Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s interpretation.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Polycarpus</hi> is ſaid by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Lib. iii. c. 3. to have ſaluted <hi>Marcion</hi> when he met him once at <hi>Rome, primogenitum Satanae, The firſt-born of Satan.</hi> And to him, or rather to any Hereticks who did as he ſays, he ſeems to have had a reſpect, not to the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> only.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> e. I. I will not exclude indeed <hi>Simon</hi> and his followers out of the number of theſe <hi>Antichriſts</hi>; but that name ſignifying, as is well obſerved by our Author after <hi>Grotius,</hi> both thoſe <hi>that oppoſe Chriſt</hi> directly, whilſt they deny that <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or was a true Man; and thoſe who take upon themſelves <hi>to be Chriſts,</hi> or put themſelves in the <hi>place of Chriſt,</hi> I don't ſee why we ſhould think the Apoſtle here to have a reſpect to the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> more than to any others, who did either of thoſe things. It's true, thoſe <hi>Antichriſts</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>gone out</hi> of the Chriſtian Aſſemblies; but who knows whether others, beſides the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> that were half <hi>Jews,</hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Chriſtian Churches?

                  <hi>no Man can ſay that Jeſus is the Chriſt, but in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> In St. <hi>John</hi>'s words there are three things contained, <hi>firſt,</hi> that Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> who was called a <hi>Nazarene,</hi> was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> denied; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was come in the Fleſh, that is, was truly a Man, and ſubject to the inconveniencies of human Life, which many of the firſt Hereticks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, if we believe the Antients; <hi>thirdly,</hi> that they could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as Impoſtors, who ſaid that Chriſt was the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and a Man like us.

               <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Note</hi> a. I. IF I ſhould undertake to examine particularly all the foregoing medly, I ſhould be obliged, inſtead of ſhort Additions, to write a long Diſſertation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall touch only upon the chief things. I do not diſagree with our Author about the interpretation of the 6th <hi>verſe,</hi> but I wonder he ſpends ſo many words in endeavouring to make out the Connection of <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. with that, and the meaning of the words <hi>are one,</hi> or <hi>are to one,</hi> before he had ſhewn, or endeavoured to ſhew that this Verſe and thoſe words are genuin. Of ſuch an order in diſcourſing it may be ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But to paſs by this, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> does but wrangle with all the moſt learned Interpreters, who interpret <hi>are one</hi> of conſent. And the reaſon why they underſtand thoſe words of conſent, is, firſt, becauſe they are ſo taken in <hi>John</hi> x.30. &amp; xvii.21. ſecondly, becauſe here the Diſcourſe is about a unity of Teſtimony, and not about a unity of Nature. But why is this conſent other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:99486:324"/>
expreſſed in the following Verſe? I anſwer, for variety ſake, or alſo by mere accident; for in this ſimple ſtile words muſt not be ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly ſcanned or watched. All our Author here alledges beſides, is foreign to the purpoſe, and the ſcope of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As for his ſaying that tho the <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> and many other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Manuſcript Copies, omit the 7<hi>th Verſe,</hi> yet it is read in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manuſcripts, and all the printed Copies except one; that, to ſay no worſe of it, is not accurately ſaid. For in the old Greek Copies, that is, which were written ſeven or eight Ages ago and older, it is no where read, and ſeldom in thoſe that are later. In the moſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Latin Copies likewiſe it is not read, tho frequently in the New. <hi>Beza</hi> alledges a Britiſh Greek Copy, mention'd by <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Complutenſian Edition, and ſeveral Copies of <hi>R. Stephanus,</hi> which have this place. But beſides that theſe do not ſufficiently agree with one another, they are by no means to be equal'd with the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Copies, which with great conſent reject this Verſe; and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Authority of all the Greek and Latin Fathers until St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who never uſed this place againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> or other antient <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi>; tho they often make mention of the three Witneſſes on Earth, as learned Men have long ſince obſerved. For as for our Author's objecting St. <hi>Cyprian, Jerom,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> that is to no purpoſe, as we ſhall preſently ſee. There are more printed Copies than one, which omit this place; but tho they all had it, their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority would ſignify nothing againſt the Manuſcript Copies, and the conſent of Antiquity.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The conjecture about the omiſſion of ſome <hi>Scribe,</hi> becauſe of the repetition of the like words, as it takes place elſewhere, ſo it cannot here be allowed; <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe it muſt be ſupported by another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> becauſe it oppoſes all Antiquity. For who will believe that ſuch an omiſſion was admitted in all the Copies, which the Chriſtians uſed privately and publickly for ſeveral Ages; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was diſcovered by I know not whom, without the help of any antient Copy? Who but thoſe who have no regard to truth, and think that Truth may be defended by the help of Falſhood? Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's reaſonings againſt the ſuſpition of this place being ſuppoſititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are inſignificant, becauſe they cannot be oppoſed to the joint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the antient Copies, Fathers, and Interpreters. Beſides, who does not know, that tho Truth may be well defended, and relies upon ſolid grounds, yet the Orthodox, as well as others, invented innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable falſhoods to ſupport it? Whence came ſo many ſuppoſititious Books in antient times, but from this perverſe practice? But here it
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:99486:324"/>
is to be obſerved, that it might eaſily be that theſe words were inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Context, not out of any deſign to deceive; but ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy having in the Margin of his Copy, over againſt the 8<hi>th</hi> Verſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, was ſignified in this place, others afterwards put that into the Text; as is conjectured by <hi>Ric. Simon,</hi> who has ſet this matter in a clear light, in his <hi>Critical Hiſtory of the New Teſtament</hi> P. 1. c. 18. and his <hi>Diſſert. concerning the</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript <hi>Copies of the</hi> New Teſtament added to the 3<hi>d Part,</hi> to whom I refer the Reader. The places our Author here alledges to prove the Doctrin of the Trinity, might have been found in any Theological Syſtem, and in greater number: nor do they make any thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the ordinary reading, for every thing which is agreeable to the Chriſtian Faith, is not preſently the true Reading. Whereas he adds, that if this place had been corrupted by the Orthodox, the <hi>Arians</hi> would have taken notice of it; tho that ſhould be admitted as a forcible Argument, it would ſignify nothing to this place; which ſeems to have been inſerted very lately, ſeeing none of the antient Fathers, Greek or Latin, till the time of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ever alledged it againſt the <hi>Arians.</hi> Conſult the foremention'd Monſieur <hi>Simon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. The paſſage cited out of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> does not prove that he read this place, as we read it in the printed Copies, but only that he underſtood the words of the 8<hi>th Verſe,</hi> of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; which is ſo clearly demonſtrated by Mr. <hi>Simon,</hi> that a Man muſt be very obſtinate, after reading his reaſons, to aſſert the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Our Author produces a place out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in Lib. <hi>Contra Prax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eam,</hi> without adding the Chapter or Page; which is a very bad Cuſtom, in a thing eſpecially of ſuch great Moment. So that I was forced to read the greateſt part of that Book, to find out the place, which is in <hi>Cap.</hi> xxv. <hi>p.</hi> 515. of the <hi>Paris Ed.</hi> An. 1675. But <hi>Tertullian</hi> has not a reſpect to this place in the 1<hi>ſt Epiſtle</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> but to <hi>John</hi> x.30. For theſe are his words: <hi>Connexus Patris in Filio, &amp; Filii in Paracleto, tres efficit cohaerentes, alterum ex altero; qui tres unum ſunt, non unus, quomodo dictum eſt:</hi> ego &amp; pater unum ſumus; <hi>ad ſubſtantiae unitatem, non ad numeri ſingularitatem. The conjunction of the Father with the Son, and of the Son with the Comforter, makes three cleaving together one upon another; which three are</hi> (unum) <hi>one thing, not</hi> (unus) <hi>one</hi> as it is ſaid; I and my Father are (<hi>unum</hi>) one thing; <hi>as to unity of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not as to ſingularity of number.</hi> He no where alledges this place in 1 <hi>John,</hi> which yet in that diſputation he ought to have alledged, if it had been read at that time, as it is now; ſeeing he often alledges the place in <hi>John</hi> x. which is not ſo expreſs to his purpoſe. <hi>Praxeas</hi>
                  <pb n="622" facs="tcp:99486:325"/>
was of the opinion of <hi>Sabellius</hi> or <hi>Photinus,</hi> who thought that there was but one Perſon in the Godhead; ſo that perhaps he might have abuſed this place in St. <hi>John,</hi> and ſo have alledged it; or if this place had been thought to be contrary to him, it would have been alledged againſt him. St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s name is prefixed indeed to the Preface to the Catholick Epiſtles; but that it is not his Preface has been ſhewn by Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> in the 2<hi>d</hi> Part of his <hi>Critical Hiſtory</hi> of the New Teſtament, c. ix. and the Benedictine Monks, who have lately begun to ſet forth the Works of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> tho very great Adverſaries to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Simon,</hi> have confirmed his Arguments, ſo that they ſeem to have ſtopped the Mouth of Obſtinacy it ſelf; which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> alſo would have acknowledged,
<q>Si foret hoc noſtrum fato dilatus in aevum,</q>
                  <hi>If he had lived to this day.</hi> As for St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> it is not without intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Negligence that his words are not ſet down; becauſe Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> knew that he would not be believed in this matter. But really there is no where any ſuch thing in the true St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> And if ſuch a fault had been committed by <hi>F. Socinus,</hi> our Author would not have ſpared him ſo eaſily, as he forgave himſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">V. He would have done much better, towards the confirmation of the Truth, to adhere only to the Scripture, and not to recur to the Fathers, whoſe opinion was quite different from that which is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; as who, properly ſpeaking, affirmed that there were three conſubſtantial Gods, as has been ſhewn by <hi>Dyon. Petavius, Steph. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaeus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> and others. Our Author had read the Fathers upon this Head with a mind full of Prejudice, as it is very common for Perſons to do; and with little care, as appears by the choice of places which he produces. I ſhould not think it ſafe to cite <hi>Clemens</hi> upon the Authority of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> becauſe he might have taken the alledged words out of an Apocryphal and ſuppoſititious writing of <hi>Clemens,</hi> of which kind there were a great many of old, and are ſome ſtill at this day. For it is notorious that the Antients, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the rules of Criticks, often confounded ſuppoſititious Writings with genuin. And our Author imitates them, whilſt he alledges Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages out of the manifeſtly ſpurious Writings of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> as his, or at leaſt as if they were of ſome moment; for why otherwiſe did he produce them? Of the reſt I have nothing to ſay, but that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> could not ſtand by the Faith of the Fathers which he cites; who, to ſpeak the truth, were Tritheiſts rather than aſſertors of the

            <p n="2">II.

And then if it be not evident that in this Verſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> ſignifies the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it will not be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the <hi>common Salvation,</hi> ſpoken of in the Verſe before, is the deliverance of the Chriſtians out of the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by whom they were perſecuted.

            <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> b.

He could not be accounted a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that denied thoſe Doctrins. But he means a denying of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heathens, in caſe they were vehemently urged to it; ſo that it was only to avoid Perſecution that they denied themſelves to be
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:99486:327"/>
Chriſtians; which they thought they might very lawfully do: They no more believed <hi>Simon,</hi> or the Prieſts of the Heathens, than they did Chriſt, nor oppoſed him any more than others; but, according to the time and place they were in, feigned themſelves to believe what it was their Intereſt to appear to believe.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Note</hi> c. But there is another more proper, if, namely, we underſtand theſe Puniſhments of that <hi>Fire,</hi> with which, in St. <hi>Jude</hi>'s time, all the Coaſt of <hi>Sodom</hi> did ſtill burn; for which reaſon it is called eternal, becauſe it continued burning for ſo many Ages.

               </gap> being very frequently uſed among Greek Writers, to ſignify <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Empires,</hi> or Magiſtrates, it is better to follow here that notion.

            <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Note</hi> e. I. The words here attributed to <hi>Michael,</hi> being the very ſame that are found in <hi>Zachar.</hi> iii.2. it is with reaſon thought by Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in concurrence with other Interpreters, that St. <hi>Jude</hi> alludes to that Viſion. And becauſe the Angel there is repreſented as
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:99486:327"/>
diſputing with <hi>the Adverſary,</hi> about the reſtoring of the Jewiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, it is conſequent that the ſame is here ſignified by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>the body of Moſes,</hi> in St. <hi>Jude</hi>; which Phraſe St. <hi>Jude</hi> took from the uſe of the Apoſtles, who ordinarily call Chriſtians <hi>the body of Chriſt.</hi>

            <p n="2">II.

For it's true, among Men, not only Subjects honourably beſpeak their Rulers, but Princes alſo themſelves ſhew a mutual reſpect to each other; the Law of Nations requiring it ſhould be ſo, for many weighty reaſons between Nations enjoying an equal Power, leſt they ſhould be at perpetual variance among themſelves, conſtituted, like the Civil Law among Citizens. But there ſeems to be no ſuch Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and bad Angels, who are irreconcilable Enemies; the bad having rebelled againſt their common Lord, by whom <hi>being put in Chains they are reſerved unto the Judgment of the great Day.</hi> So that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which the Angel would not rail at, are ſome others; nor does <hi>Satan</hi> ſignify the Prince of the Devils. If we conſult the Hiſtory of the times, to which the Viſion ſeen by <hi>Zachariah</hi> refers, we ſhall find that the Governors of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who had the overſight of the Provinces ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on the Weſt of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> vehemently oppoſed the deſign of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> about reſtoring the Temple. And of theſe the chief were the <hi>Thatthenai</hi> and <hi>Schetharboznai,</hi> whoſe Enterpriſes and Calumnies are recorded in <hi>Eſdr.</hi> Chap. v. Now theſe things were repreſented to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> the Prophet in a Viſion, by which he underſtood that the <hi>Jews</hi> had indeed powerful Enemies with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> but that God by the Miniſtry of his Angels render'd their Calumnies and Attempts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. So that <hi>Satan</hi> are the <hi>Thatthenai</hi> and <hi>Schetharboznai,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Adverſaries of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were repreſented to the Prophet under the perſon of one Accuſer. So in <hi>Pſalm</hi> cix.5. <hi>Satan ſtanding at</hi> his <hi>Right hand</hi> is manifeſtly an Accuſer, and that word often ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies any Adverſary who endeavours to fruſtrate any ones deſigns.

            <head>ANNOTATIONS ON THE Revelation of St. <hi>John</hi> the Divine.</head>
            <p>AT the end of the <hi>Premon.</hi>] Tho I think Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> may as eaſily be defended as any other; yet ſome things he ſays here which ſeem to need correction, and which I ſhall briefly take notice of.</p>
            <p n="1">I. He repreſents to us the Chriſtians of <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> as being as much afraid of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> as if they had ſent Proconſuls into <hi>Aſia</hi>; or at leaſt the Roman Magiſtrates were ſo entirely in their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that the leaſt complaint they made of them would be pernicious to the Chriſtians. For unleſs this be true, the Chriſtians would have had no reaſon to be ſo much afraid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or to think they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from Perſecution by the Calamities of that People. But that the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſo much Power, or were in ſo great favour with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Magiſtrates, that at their inſtigation they dealt cruelly with the Chriſtians, does not appear by any Hiſtory. We find indeed in the <hi>Acts</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> exaſperated the Heathens as much as they could, and raiſed Seditions, and went to the Magiſtrates to accuſe the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but we find alſo that they were but derided by them: ſee <hi>Acts</hi> xviii.12. &amp; <hi>ſeqq.</hi> The Chriſtians that lived in <hi>Aſia Minor</hi> had moſt reaſon to fear the Statuaries, Painters, Prieſts, and other Men who made a gain of Idolatry, and any ſuperſtitious Perſons whatſoever; but not the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were as much hated by them as the Chriſtians: ſee the Story of the Tumult at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which is in <hi>Acts</hi> xix. So that what is foretold of the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> belongs primarily to them that lived in <hi>Judea</hi> and the neighbouring Countries, who were really to be delivered from the Perſecutions of the <hi>Jews</hi>; and ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily alſo to others, eſpecially thoſe which had gone over from Judaiſm to the Chriſtian Religion, and who would be glad to ſee the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Chriſt and the Apoſtles fulfilled, and be confirmed in their Faith by that means.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="631" facs="tcp:99486:329"/>II. I don't know why our Author thought the Edict of <hi>Claudius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chapter I.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout expelling the Chriſtians or Jews out of <hi>Rome,</hi> reached as far as <hi>Epheſus.</hi> For they that were only expelled out of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not forced to go out of other Cities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, unleſs it was ſo order'd in the Edict. By the word <hi>Rome,</hi> no body ever underſtood the reſt of the Cities of the Roman Empire: ſee Interpreters on the place in <hi>Suetonius,</hi> and on <hi>Acts</hi> xviii.2. If therefore St. <hi>John</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at that time, and tranſported from <hi>Epheſus</hi> to <hi>Patmos,</hi> it was not becauſe of the Edict of <hi>Claudius,</hi> but for ſome other reaſon. But the Chronology of thoſe times, the accounts of which are not taken out of the Writings of the Apoſtles, is very uncertain.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Our Author does not ſpeak accurately, where he ſays that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> was Governor of <hi>Rome, whilſt</hi> Veſpaſian <hi>was in</hi> Judaea; he ſhould have added, either in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>whilſt he was upon his Journey</hi>; for <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſian</hi> did not ſtay long in <hi>Judaea,</hi> after he was ſaluted Emperor.</p>

Which being ſo, I cannot ſee why the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of theſe Cities are ſuppoſed to have ruled over them with a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Power; not to ſay it is very uncertain whether there was in the beginning any Hierarchy conſtituted, according to the pattern of a Civil Government. For what later Writers ſay of that Age, is not ſufficiently certain; becauſe they ſpeak of it in the words of their own times, and call thoſe <hi>Metropolitans</hi> and <hi>Archbiſhops,</hi> which were ſtiled ſimply Biſhops. Such a way of ſpeaking is deceitful, and may
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:99486:330"/>
be apt to perſwade the unwary, that not only theſe Names, but alſo the Power that was joined with them in the following Ages, were known in the Apoſtles times. I had rather our Author, in his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe of the New Teſtament, had abſtained from them.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Note</hi> d. I. I wiſh Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> had alledged ſome Edict of the Roman Emperors or Magiſtrates obtained by the <hi>Jews,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Chriſtians were forbidden to meet together, before the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; for I do not remember that I ever read any in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Writers, or others: which yet if it be uncertain, or falſe, as I verily think, ſome of thoſe things which he ſays in the foregoing Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation muſt needs be falſe, or at leaſt uncertain. And from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the reign of <hi>Adrian,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were too odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous upon the account of their Seditions, to prevail with the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors or Magiſtrates to perſecute the Chriſtians, as our Author well proves in what follows.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> might ſhew that the Chriſtians <hi>reigned,</hi> as he ſpeaks, after all the hopes and power of the <hi>Jews</hi> were taken away, he is forced to extenuate thoſe ten noted Perſecutions; which it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome of the Antients too much aggravated, as has been ſolidly proved by Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> in his <hi>Diſſert.</hi> de <hi>Paucitate Martyrum.</hi> But tho I do not deny but that in the fourth and following Ages, the number of Martyrs was very much encreaſed; yet I do not ſee how the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian Church, in the ſecond and third Centuries, could be repreſented under the ſimilitude of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> unleſs that <hi>Kingdom</hi> be very faintly underſtood.

IT is not neceſſary we ſhould know who theſe Impoſtors were of which St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, there being ſo many other things in antient Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of much greater moment as the Travels and Martyrdoms of moſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, altogether unknown to us; either becauſe none committed them to writing, or becauſe the Records of them are loſt. And therefore I had rather confeſs my ignorance in this matter, than violently bring in here the <hi>Gnoſticks.</hi> I might with more probability ſay that the Apoſtle has a reſpect to ſome Jewiſh Deceivers, who boaſted that they had been familiar with Chriſt, and therefore <hi>ſaid that they were Apoſtles.</hi> It is not certain that <hi>Cerinthus</hi> called himſelf an <hi>Apostle,</hi> or pretended to have received what he aſſerted from <hi>a great Apostle.</hi> It is ſaid indeed by <hi>Gaius</hi> in <hi>Euſebius</hi> Lib. iii. cap. 28. that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus</hi> propoſed his Doctrins <gap reason="foreign">

What our Author here ſays about <hi>Elxai,</hi> out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> ſhews that ſome of the Jews (for <hi>Elxai</hi> was a Jew) were poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with an Opinion, before the Apoſtles time, that it was lawful to diſſemble their Religion, yea to renounce it, to avoid Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that whenever that Doctrine is oppoſed by the Apoſtles, we need not preſently think they have a reſpect to the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> the Followers of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> as our Author often inculcates, not without tiring his Reader.</p>
               <p n="2">II.

                  </gap>, &amp;c.] This Viſion, as almoſt all the reſt, has many things in it reſembling the Viſions of the Prophets of the Old Teſtament; and the Apoſtle often uſes Words and Phraſes borrowed from them: for the manner of God's revealing himſelf to men, was, to uſe Phraſes to which they were accuſtomed, rather than any other. And ſo becauſe the Chriſtians were uſed to the reading of the Old Teſtament, God deſcribes future things under the New by the ſame Images and Expreſſions by which he had repreſented them to the antient Prophets. This every one muſt have in his eye that undertakes to explain theſe Prophecies, that by the accompliſhment of the antient Predictions he may judg of the New; which if he does not, he will be apt to fall into very great miſtakes. For inſtance, we read this Prophecy in <hi>Joel</hi> ii.30, 31. <hi>I will ſhew wonders in the heavens above, and wonders in the earth beneath, blood and fire, and vapour of ſmoke. The Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and the Moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.</hi> Whoever ſhould underſtand theſe words properly, and according to the preſent way of ſpeaking, would be mightily deceived, and ready to think that they were yet to be fulfilled. But St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> ii. has told us, that they are to be underſtood figuratively, of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual change which the Goſpel was to make in the earth. And ſo when we read the like in this Book, we muſt have a care of thinking that the changes which are deſcribed as future, both in Heaven and Earth, before ſome things here foretold came to paſs, were really and literally to be accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> b. If it were certain that the privileges of Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans were known in that age, that the Apoſtles ſat in a lower place than the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Chriſtians at that time were as obſervant of that external order, as they were afterwards; Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s conjecture might be born. But now to ſpeak in the ſofteſt terms, all thoſe things being uncertain, it will not eaſily be believed by judicious perſons, that St. <hi>John</hi> here alludes to the Church of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> rather than any other Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Note</hi> c. The Sanhedrim of the Jews ſat in the form of a half circle, as is largely ſhewn by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> de <hi>Synedriis,</hi> lib. ii. c. 6. and the Head of the Council in the middle ſeat. And hence I rather think that the form of the heavenly Council repreſented to St. <hi>John</hi> was taken, both becauſe the Sanhedrim was an Aſſembly of Judges,
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:99486:332"/>
and becauſe it is not certain that in the Apoſtles times Chriſtians meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together ſecretly and in a private houſe, did ſo carefully obſerve that order in ſitting. Our Author often takes it for undoubted that the cuſtoms of the ſecond or third Century, or alſo later Ages were Apoſtolical, which he ought not to have done: Of the Epiſcopal ſeat in Churches, ſee <hi>Beveridge</hi> his Notes on <hi>Can.</hi> xi. of the firſt <hi>Nicene Council.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">☜</note> was taken from the Great <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> becauſe the number was not in both the ſame, and it is ſtrange he was not afraid leſt it ſhould be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, that it was altogether as unallowable to feign a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Biſhops, without the authority of antient Records. But tho this Image be ſaid to be taken from the Great Sanhedrim, it is not neceſſary there ſhould be a perfect ſimilitude between them. But, you will ſay, why are there only four and twenty, and not lxxii here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as ſitting in Council? If I ſhould ſay I don't know, Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s conjecture will not be therefore at all more probable. But it may be ſaid, that to deſcribe this Court, four and twenty Heads of the prieſtly Order were choſen out of the Sanhedrim, becauſe they were in a ſpecial manner conſecrated to God; beſides that the Prieſts only were of divine inſtitution, not the reſt of the members of the Sanhedrim.</p>

Much leſs do I think there is any reſpect here had to the Mitres of Biſhops, which I no more imagin to have been in that age than the reſt of the ornaments at this day uſed by them.

                  </gap> is taken in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. according to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s own Opinion. Yet I had rather place two living Creatures before the Throne, not on the Steps, but even with the ground, over againſt the middle of the Throne, and two on the ſides; for this reaſon, becauſe afterwards, in <hi>Chap.</hi> v.6. it is ſaid, that <hi>a Lamb ſtood in the midst of the throne, and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the Elders</hi>; by which it appears that there was ſome ſpace between the Throne and the living Creatures. From this place our Author diſputes indeed againſt <hi>Grotius,</hi> but ſo, as it appears that he did not know what himſelf meant.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Note</hi> g. I. He that ſits upon the Throne is repreſented as much greater than the four living Creatures, as being God himſelf, whom the living Creatures praiſe and worſhip, which are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the Angels. I am apt to think, if it were to be enquired, who reſembled them in the Sanhedrim; the only perſons that can be likened to them are the Officers that waited upon the Sanhedrim. But between theſe Miniſters of God and the Miniſters of the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim, there was almoſt as much difference as between God and the Prince of the Sanhedrim; and therefore there is no ſimilitude to be ſought for between them, but in this, that they might both be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This is much more likely than what is ſaid by our Author, who, to find out his own meaning, makes Apoſtles inferior to a Biſhop, which is utterly falſe: for the Apoſtles having received their Commiſſion from Chriſt himſelf, had an equal Authority over all Nations, and in all Cities; and therefore wherever they were, had the privilege of the firſt Seats, if any order was to be obſerved in ſitting. And they ought not to yield to the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whom they themſelves had ordained. What <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> ſays of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> juſt as if the Apoſtles out of modeſty had not aſpired to it, is, with that learned Writer's leave, not agreeable to things themſelves. It was not lawful for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to take upon them the Biſhoprick of any one City, becauſe
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:99486:333"/>
they were to ſpread the Goſpel through the whole World, according to the Command of Chriſt; nor could they, without diſparaging themſelves, ſeek a Dignity leſs than their own. Yet our Author ſeveral times alledges theſe inconſiderate words of <hi>Clemens,</hi> as if they were of ſome moment. But you will ſay, St. <hi>James</hi> having heard the reſt, at length in <hi>Acts</hi> xv. ſums up the Judgment of the Council, after all were agreed, which is the Office of a Preſident. But it does not therefore follow that he did that as Preſident, and ſo as a thing which of right belonged to him; but rather by the impulſe of the Holy Spirit, who might have pronounced that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree by the mouth of any that were there preſent. Thoſe holy men were not ambitious of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> like the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees; and therefore among Friends, and thoſe acted by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, every thing doubtleſs was done without ſtanding upon Order or Ceremonies, the effects of mens Pride and Contention. Nor do I any more think that St. <hi>James</hi> here acted as a Preſident, than that he ſat on a high Throne, with ſome four Apoſtles attending on him as <hi>Metropolitan</hi> and <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> as our Author calls him, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Judea</hi> ſitting round about: which yet muſt have been done, if this repreſentation of the heavenly Court was taken from thence; otherwiſe it has no more reſemblance with the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> than with any other Conſiſtory of Judges.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Objection our Author propoſes to himſelf is of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and might have been ſolved in one word, from what he ſays towards the end of his ſecond Anſwer: for it is viſible, that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochians</hi> ſent to enquire at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe there were there a great many Apoſtles, and other Diſciples, who had converſed with Chriſt on earth, and had received ſpiritual gifts from him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; who if they had been in the moſt obſcure Village in all <hi>Judea,</hi> would nevertheleſs have been there conſulted. They had no reſpect therefore to the Metropolitan Dignity of the City, which our Author here, without reaſon, makes a ſhew of, and which was a piece of Grandure not known in thoſe times. Of after Ages I ſay nothing, in which it was lawful for Biſhops to enter, as it were, into Covenant with one another, and attribute a greater dignity to ſome ſeats than to others; which Conſtitution ſeemed uſeful, and ought not to be changed where it has obtain'd, becauſe it may be beneficial to the ordinary ſort of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Note</hi> h. I. Theſe things are not only Conjectures, but moſt extravagant Fancies, in which I wonder our learned Author could acquieſce. There is not here ſo much as the leaſt indication
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:99486:334"/>
of the Standards or Standard-bearers of <hi>Iſrael</hi>;<note place="margin">Chapter V.</note> nor any ground to imagin them alluded to, beſides that which is ſaid by the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who are leſs acquainted with what was done of old than we, and whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions are juſtly ſaid by our Author to be abſurd. But why then did he believe them? I confeſs I don't underſtand.</p>
               <p n="2">II. On the contrary, here is a manifeſt alluſion to the Cherubims, who are the Miniſters of God, not God himſelf. And ſo it is they which are deſcrib'd, and not God; of whom ſee what I have ſaid on <hi>Exod.</hi> xxv.18. They are the Officers and Miniſters of God in executing his Judgments, which beſt of all agree to this place; and not Apoſtles, whoſe Office was not to puniſh obſtinate Offenders. What our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor here ſays out of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and about ſome particular Apoſtles, is as abſurd as the fictions of the <hi>Rabbins.</hi>

Our Author builds conjectures upon conjectures, and is not afraid leſt a ſtructure that leans upon ſuch weak props, ſhould fall to the ground. But it is the part of a careful Interpreter to be very ſparing in Conjectures, and in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matters to abſtain from Conſectaries; for the more uncertainties are heap'd together, the more that which is ſaid appears to be falſe, or at leaſt the Conjecturers are in greater danger of erring. But I confeſs ingenuouſly I do not underſtand theſe Prophecies; and tho I eaſily ſee what there is wanting in the conjectures of learned Men, to make them ſeem probable, I can my ſelf propoſe nothing better. For which reaſon I have in many places forborn to confute Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, becauſe I did not think it worth my while to ſhew that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were unfortunate in their Conjectures, when I my ſelf could produce nothing more certain. But here I thought fit to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about the Conjecture of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> concerning two ſorts of Biſhops in the Apoſtles time, in ſingle Cities; becauſe that may make for the illuſtration of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It appears indeed by <hi>Acts</hi> xv. and other places, that there was ſome diſagreement between the Jewiſh and Gentile Chriſtians, and that theſe latter had a Letter ſent them, which is there ſet down. But that there were two diſtinct Churches, and two ſorts of Biſhops, can
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:99486:337"/>
be gather'd from no ſign. Nor is it at all probable, that after this Apoſtolical Decree, the Jewiſh Chriſtians refuſed to unite with the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; eſpecially <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being deſtroyed, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> having written ſo many Epiſtles about the unprofitableneſs of the Moſaical Rites. There are no credible Records by which it may appear that <hi>Evodius</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> were together Biſhops of the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. In the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions <hi>Lib.</hi> vii. c. 46. it is ſaid indeed that <hi>Evodius</hi> was ordained by St. <hi>Peter</hi> (not by St. <hi>John,</hi> as it is ſaid by the <hi>Doctor</hi>) and <hi>Ignatius</hi> by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> But not to ſay that we cannot eaſily believe that Writer, as being a notorious Impoſtor; he does not ſay that they were made Biſhops at the ſame time, and of ſeveral Congregations, as is well obſerved on that place by <hi>J. Bapt. Cotelerius,</hi> who has alſo other things worth reading about this matter.</p>
               <p n="3">III. What is ſaid here about St. <hi>John</hi>'s ruling the Jewiſh Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> while St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and after him <hi>Timothy</hi> ruled the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is a mere invention of our Author. There is no footſtep of a twofold Epiſcopacy in thoſe places; and that <hi>Timothy</hi> was firſt Biſhop of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> is alſo very uncertain, becauſe he might be left theſe by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as an Evangeliſt, not as a Biſhop: for the late Catalogues are not worthy our regard, which reckon up the Biſhops of antient times, according to the opinion of the Age in which they were written, and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any certain knowledg. They tell us indeed that the Apoſtles themſelves were Biſhops, which is abſurd, tho Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> alſo ſpeaks in the ſame manner. But granting him that <hi>Timothy</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſtill there are two things that remain doubtful: One is, that <hi>John</hi> was at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or ſomewhere near it, when <hi>Timothy</hi> was left there by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And ſecondly, that both of them performed the Office of Biſhop in different Congregations; and that St. <hi>John</hi> did not come thither after <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination, and exerciſe only the Office of an Apoſtle, not of a Biſhop. It's plain the Writer of the <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Conſtitutions,</hi> whoſe Authority the <hi>Doctor</hi> elſewhere makes uſe of, ſays that <hi>Timothy</hi> was conſtituted Biſhop of that City by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> by St. <hi>John.</hi>

Then he adds, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; <hi>that all the Church under them was made up of believing Jews, who had continued from the Apoſtles to the Siege which then happen'd.</hi> By this it appears, that there were not two Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at that time in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; nor indeed does <hi>Euſebius</hi> mention thoſe fifteen Biſhops, as if ſome of them had been Biſhops together, but all one after another. That there were many Biſhops within a ſhort compaſs of time, may as well be attributed either to their being of a great age when they were elected, or the ſudden death wherewith ſome of them were overtaken, as to a multiplicity of Biſhops in one City.

               <p n="2">II. It is true indeed that <hi>Livy</hi> affirms, <hi>caput humanum aperientibus fundamenta Templi apparuiſſe: that a mans head was found by thoſe who dug up the foundations of the Temple,</hi> but is falſe that the Oracle was conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They conſulted an <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Prophet, as we are told by <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus</hi> lib. iv. <hi>Ed. Wechel.</hi> pag. 257. and he anſwered: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: <hi>that the Fates had determined, that that place, in which they had found the Head, ſhould be the Head of all Italy.</hi> Which is expreſſed in this manner by <hi>Livy</hi> lib. 1. c. 51. <hi>Quae viſa ſpecies haud per ambages, arcem eam Imperii, caputque rerum fore portendebat; idque ita cecinere vates, quique in urbe erant, quoſque ad eam rem conſultandam ex Etruria acciverant. Which ſight clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly portended that that place ſhould be the chief ſtrength of the Empire, and the Head of the World; and ſo it was interpreted by the Prophets, both thoſe that were in the City, and thoſe that were ſent for out of Etruria to be conſulted about that matter.</hi>

               <p n="3">III. That the deadly wound here given to the Beaſt may be rightly underſtood of the burning of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> appears, not only by what is ſaid by <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> but alſo by the opinion which the Records of the Heathens ſhew them to have had about ſuch an Event. For here we are not to conſider the thing it ſelf, but the mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from which the Chriſtians might rightly argue againſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. It was ordinarily therefore look'd upon as a Prodigy, if a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was touched from Heaven; and that Prodigy was ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by how much more magnificent or venerable the Temple was thought to be. <hi>Livy</hi> will ſupply us with a great many ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but ſee particularly lib. xxvii. c. 4. where among other Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies it is related, <hi>Jovis aedis culmen fulmine ictum, ac prope omni tecto nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datum: that the top of Jupiters Temple was ſtruck with a thunderbolt, and almoſt ſtript of all its covering.</hi> So alſo <hi>Cicero</hi> in the ſecond Book about his Conſulſhip, among the Prodigies portending <hi>Catilines</hi> Conſpiracy, made mention of this, as appears from lib. 1. de <hi>Divin.</hi> c. 12.

                  <hi>All thoſe things which were heretofore under the Conſulſhip of Torquatus and Cotta, foretold by Lydius the Etrurian Prophet, are now ratified, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; for Jupiter has ſometime ſince ſmitten his own Hills and Temples, and thrown fire into the Capitol.</hi> And therefore the burning of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol under <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was counted a very great calamity, as we may ſee by theſe tragical words of <hi>Tacitus</hi> in <hi>Hiſt.</hi> lib. iii. c. 72. <hi>Id facinus poſt conditam urbem, luctuoſiſſimum, foediſſimumque populo Romano acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; nullo externo hoſte, propitiis, ſi per mores noſtros liceret, Deis; ſedem Jovis Opt.

Arſerat &amp; ante Capitolium civili bello, ſed fraude privata; nunc palam obſeſſum, palam incenſum. Quibus armorum cauſis, quo tantae cladis pretio pro patria bellavimus?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This Action, ſince the first building of the City, was the most diſmal and ſhameful that ever happen'd to the People of</hi> Rome; <hi>that when we had no foreign enemy at our gates, and the Gods, for any thing we had done to provoke them, were propitious to us, the ſeat of the great and excellent</hi> Jupiter, <hi>ominouſly erected as a pledg of Dominion, which neither</hi> Porſena, <hi>when the City was delivered to him, nor the</hi> Gauls, <hi>who took it by Aſſault, had been able to break into, ſhould be deſtroyed by the fury of our own Princes. Once alſo before, the Capitol was burnt, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Civil War, but it was then by ſecret fraud; now it was openly beſet, and openly ſet on fire. Was it for this, and that ſo great a Calamity might befal us, that we have been engaged in ſo many Wars, and fought ſo long for our Country?</hi> How great the fame of this Accident was among neighbouring Nations, and how they interpreted it as a Prodigy, the ſame Writer tells us in <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 1. 4. c. 54. where having made mention of the Commotions that were in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Nihil aeque quam incendium Capitolii, ut finem Imperii adeſſe crederent, impulerat. Captam olim à Gallis urbem; ſed integra Jovis ſede manſiſſe Imperium. Fatali nunc igne, ſignum coeleſtis irae datum, &amp; poſſeſſionem rerum huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum Tranſalpinis-gentibus portendi ſuperſtitione vana Druidae canebant. Nothing had ſo much inclined them to think that the end of the</hi> (Roman) <hi>Empire was come, as the burning of the Capitol. That the City had been
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:99486:340"/>
formerly taken by the</hi> Gauls, <hi>but</hi> Jupiter'<hi>s Seat ſtanding ſafe, the Empire had continued. Now that by this fatal fire it appeared the Gods were incenſed against the</hi> Romans, <hi>and deſigned to confer the government of the World upon the Nations beyond the</hi> Alps, <hi>was the ſuperſtitious tone of the</hi> Druids. So that theſe Commotions being appeaſed, and the Capitol rebuilt, it might be ſaid that the deadly wound was healed.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Note</hi> e. It ſhould have been added, with <hi>Grotius,</hi> that the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Note</hi> f. I do by no means think, that S. <hi>John</hi> here has a reſpect to <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> as our Author's Countrymen ſpeak, but to the Perſecutors themſelves; to whom it is foretold, by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, that it ſhould be their lot to ſuffer the ſame things they inflicted upon others. See <hi>Grotius</hi> on this place. To this purpoſe is the Subject of <hi>Lactantius</hi> his Book <hi>de mortibus Perſecutorum.</hi> So that in this place their Opinion is neither approved nor condemned, who think it lawful to oppoſe force by force, provided there be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of doing it ſucceſsfully, and without too much bloodſhed. Nor is there any thing ſaid about this matter in the places which the Doctor cites; and it is a thing which it's probable he would not here have thought of, unleſs he had lived in the days of <hi>Cromwel.</hi> But thoſe things which pleaſe us, we bring to mind upon the leaſt occaſion.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>Note</hi> o. I. As I was rendring the foregoing Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Latin, I thought of a reaſon of the obſcurity that is in theſe Prophecies; which upon thorow conſideration I looked upon to be very probable, and therefore I ſhall here propoſe it, which is, that a great part of theſe Predictions being about things that were ſhortly to be fulfilled by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking of theſe as the enemies of God, by whom they were alſo ſuddenly to be deſtroyed, it was not ſafe either for himſelf, or for others to whom he communicated theſe Prophecies, that the matter of them ſhould be more clearly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; leſt the Book falling into the hands of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhould be a means to enrage them. But how could they be underſtood, you will ſay? and of what uſe were they, if they were not underſtood? To this I anſwer, I doubt not but St. <hi>John</hi> himſelf very well knew what every thing in them meant, and explained the contents of them to the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the wiſeſt part of ordinary Chriſtians, ſo far as it was nceceſſary for them to underſtand the accompliſhment of theſe Predictions. But their meaning not being thought fit to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently communicated to all, leſt the imprudence of ſome perſons ſhould bring the Apoſtle and the Churches into danger; the memory of their ſecret ſignification, eſpecially upon the intervening of Perſecution, was in a little time loſt, and it is no wonder that it did not deſcend to <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>

                  <pb n="656" facs="tcp:99486:342"/>II. The diſtance of ſo many Ages is no hindrance at all to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding theſe Prophecies, conſidered in it ſelf; but the want of Hiſtorical Records, that were perhaps heretofore written both by Chriſtians and Heathens, out of which, if they were extant, we might undoubtedly come to know many of the circumſtances which are here referred to. We ſhould make out the ſenſe better than the Antients themſelves, who did nothing by rule and method; for which reaſon moſt of their Interpretations of Scripture are impertinent, and do not ſute with their great reputation. I wonder that our learned Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Judgment of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> about the way of explaining this place, for ſuch ſilly reaſons; but perhaps after he had ſearched a great while and could find nothing himſelf, he had a mind to deter others from an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, which he thought would be to no purpoſe. It is a miſtake that the cuſtom of expreſſing a name by numbers was not known to the Greeks of that age, for what elſe can be meant by <hi>the number of the name?</hi> Does not <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived <hi>almoſt in the time</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> as he himſelf ſpeaks, mention it as a thing which was known? in lib. v. c. 3. Is there not ſome ſuch thing in the <hi>Books of the Sibyls,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> himſelf has before obſerved, which moſt Learned men ſuppoſe to have been counterfeited in the ſecond age? Does not alſo <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in lib. 2. c. 40, and 42. expreſly affirm that the <hi>Valentinians</hi> uſed the art of numbering the letters of names, for their numeral ſignification? But granting St. <hi>John</hi> to have taken what he ſays from the cuſtom of the Jews, yet why might not he apply to the Greek letters what was uſual in the Hebrew, ſeeing he wrote in Greek? For to ſuppoſe a man writing in Greek, and that to men who underſtand only that language, to think of the Hebrew names of the Idolatry of the Romans, is, in earneſt, too much to indulge Conjectures, and to conſider only what is <hi>poſſible,</hi> and not what is <hi>probable.</hi> So, 'tis certain, <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſearched for an Arithmetical myſtery in the Greek letters, in cap. ix. of his Epiſtle. What our Author ſays about two ways of expreſſing numbers among the Greeks (to grant now that the thing is well expreſſed by him) is nothing to the purpoſe. For however numbers are expreſſed, it is all one, if that number be but found in the name which is written with its letters. We may expreſs DC.LXVI. in Greek thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, a Δ incloſed in the like figure, and another Δ alone, and then laſt of all the letters 111. But neither way are the letters of the name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed otherwiſe than by their numeral ſignification. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> does not ſeem to have well underſtood what he meant, when he argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a twofold way of expreſſing numbers againſt <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>

As he raſhly affirmed that the Greeks, in that Age,<note place="margin">Chapter XIV.</note> were not acquainted with this way of expreſſing a name, by the number of the letters; ſo without reaſon he attributes the invention of it to the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi> who perhaps borrowed it themſelves from the Greeks.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and it is probable that that cuſtom would not have had a Greek name, if it had not been derived from the Greeks. I acknowledg indeed that the Rabbins did more frequently uſe this way of ſignifying names than the Greeks.<note place="margin">☜</note> [<hi>It ſhould ſeem by this that Mr.</hi> Le Clerc <hi>miſunderſtood Dr.</hi> Hammond, <hi>for the Doctor does not ſay, as he repreſents him, that the cuſtom of expreſſing names by numbers was not</hi> known <hi>at that time by the</hi> Greeks, <hi>but that it was not</hi> ordinary <hi>among them, and that it was very uſual among the Rabbins of that age, unleſs</hi> not ordinary, inuſitatum, <hi>as he tranſlates him, and</hi> not known, ignotum, <hi>be the ſame.</hi>] But this was owing to the vain fancies of the Jews, who made too much uſe of it.

               <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Note</hi> d.

It is abſurdly ſaid by Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> of <hi>Genſericus,</hi> that he <hi>robb'd the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus</hi> OR <hi>Olympius.</hi> For no body ever called <hi>Jupiter Capitolinus</hi> at Rome <hi>Olympius,</hi> nor is there any ſuch thing in <hi>Procopius.</hi> The Temple of <hi>Jupiter Olympius</hi> was at <hi>Olympia,</hi> not at <hi>Rome.</hi> I might perhaps alſo ſay that this is a Fable, and that it is not likely that the Capitolian Temple had ſtood untouch'd, under ſo many Chriſtian Emperors. But I leave the matter undecided. II. Our learned Author, having reckon'd <hi>Illyricum</hi> among the provinces which the Barbarians poſſeſſed, mentions alſo <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which ſhould have been left out; becauſe every one knows that <hi>Dalmatia</hi> is the ſame Country, which was before called <hi>Illyricum.</hi> III.

V.

So that if this Kingdom be to be extended to the thouſand following Years, it muſt not be thought conſiſt in ſanctity of Life, and purity of Doctrin; but only in the Liberty which the Chriſtians ſhould enjoy, in the greateſt part of the Roman Empire, ſo that they might be good and pious Men, without being envied or perſecuted by the Heathens.</p>

If this and the like things be to be applied to the Church in later times, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks, it muſt be remember'd that the praiſes here given to it, muſt be underſtood comparatively, ſo as for that Church to be oppoſed to the Jews and Heathens, in compariſon of which it is not unworthy of theſe Commendations. But we muſt not meaſure its Doctrins or Practices by the perfect Rule of the Goſpel, from which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> himſelf did not think but it had departed, tho he would not acknowledg it.</p>

It is ſomewhat uncertain whether all the ſides of this Square were twelve thouſand Furlongs in length, ſo as that the whole Circuit was forty eight thouſand Furlongs; as alſo the height of the Mountain joined with the height of the Walls; or whether a fourth part only of that number is to be aſſigned to each of the ſides, that is, three thouſand Furlongs. The former is moſt likely, ſo as that an exceeding great City ſhould be deſcribed, nothing but what is great and ſpacious being here to be thought on.</p>

The ſame he does afterwards, but being in haſt to make an end of this tedious work, I ſhall not particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin what he ſays, nor would it be worth while. For who but he could here miſtake? He deſcribes to us, for inſtance, the happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Chriſtians from <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> to the Year MCCC. living under the Diſcipline of Church-Governors, and a moſt pure Church during that interval, and moſt worthy of Chriſt. Which that we might believe, either the New Teſtament muſt have been many Ages ago loſt, or no footſteps at all of the Hiſtory of thoſe times remained. Our learned Author was taken up about ſomething elſe when he wrote this, and whilſt he ſerved an Hypotheſis, committed to writing what was inconſiſtent with his ſtated Sentiments.</p>
