            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is related of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> that when his Scholars had found him in a tradesmans shop, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were ashamed to enter. He told them, <hi>Quod neque tali loco dii de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt immortales,</hi> that the gods were as well conversant in such places as in others; Intimating that a divine power and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome might be discerned even in those common arts, which are so much despised; And though the manuall exercise and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of them be esteemed ignoble, yet the study of their generall causes and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, cannot bee prejudiciall to any other (though the most sacred) profession.</p>
            <p>It hath been my usuall custome in the course of my other studies, to propose di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Mathematicall or Philosophicall inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for the recreation of my leisure howers, and as I could gather satisfaction to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them into some form and method.</p>
            <p>Some of these have been formerly publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,


<pb facs="tcp:99132:4"/>
and I have now ventured forth this discourse; wherein besides the great <hi>delight and pleasure</hi> (which every rationall Reader must needs finde in such notions as carry with them their own evidence and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration) there is also much <hi>real benefit</hi> to be learned; particularly for such Gentlemen as employ their estates in those chargeable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of Drayning, Mines, Cole-pits, &amp;c. who may from hence learn the chief grounds &amp; nature of Engines, &amp; thereby more easily avoid the delusions of any cheating Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor: And also for such <hi>common artificers,</hi> as are well skilled in the <hi>practise</hi> of these arts, who may be much advantaged by the right understanding of their grounds and <hi>Theory.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Ramus</hi> hath observed, that the reason why <hi>Germany</hi> hath been so eminent for Mechanicall inventions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scho.

            <p>This whole Discourse I call <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Magick,</hi> because the art of such Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall inventions as are here chiefly insisted upon,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Agrippa, De Vanit. Scient. ca.</hi> 42.</note> hath been formerly so styled; and in allusion to vulgar opinion, which doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attribute all such strange operations

            <p>The second is styled by the name of <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalus,</hi> who is related to be one of the first &amp; most famous amongst the Ancients for his skil in making <hi>Automata,</hi> or self-moving En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines: both these being two of the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that did reduce Mathematicall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples unto Mechanicall experiments.</p>
            <p>Other discourses of this kind, are for the most part large and voluminous, of great price and hardly gotten; and besides, there are not any of them (that I know of) in our vulgar tongue, for which these Mechanicall arts of all other are most proper. These in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences are here in some measure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, together with the addition (if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake not) of divers things very considerable, and not insisted upon by others.</p>

And these arts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may truly be styled liberall, <hi>Quae liberum faciunt hominem,</hi>

               <p>To the second may be referred all that knowledge, which concerns the frame of this great Universe, or the usuall course of providence in the government of these created things.</p>
               <p>To the last doe belong all those inventions, whereby nature is any way quickned or advanced in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: These artificiall experiments being (as it were) but so many Essays, whereby men doe naturally attempt to restore themselves from the first generall curse inflicted upon their labours.</p>
               <p>This following Discourse, does properly appertain to this latter kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99132:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now Art may be said, either to <hi>imitate</hi> nature, as in limming and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; or to <hi>help</hi> nature, as in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; or to <hi>overcome,</hi> and <hi>advance</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in these Mechanicall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, which in this respect are by so much to be preferred before the other, by how much their end and power is more excellent. Nor are they therefore to bee esteemed lesse noble, because more practicall, since our best and most divine knowledge is intended for action, and those may justly be counted barren studies, which doe not conduce to practise as their proper end.</p>
               <p>But so apt are we to contemn eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing which is common, that the ancient Philosophers esteemed it a great part of wisdome to conceale their learning from vulgar apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or use, thereby the better to maintain it, in its due honour and respect. And therefore did they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally vail all their Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, under such mysticall expressions, as might excite the peoples wonder

               <p>Hence was it, that the ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians did place all their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in abstracted speculations, refusing to debase the principles of that noble profession unto Mechanicall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Insomuch, that those very Authors amongst them, who were most eminent for their inventions of this kind, and were willing by their own practise, to manifest unto the world, those artificiall wonders, that might be wrought by these arts, as <hi>Daedalus, Archytas, Archimedes, &amp;c.</hi> were notwithstanding so much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with this blind superstition, as not to leave any thing in writing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the grounds and manner of these operations.</p>

               <p>By which means, posterity hath unhappily lost, not onely the benefit of those particular discoveries, but also the proficiency of those arts in generall. For when once the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men did forbid the reducing of them to particular use, and vulgar experiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others did thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse these studies themselves, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but empty and uselesse speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               <p>But his Scholar <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other particulars, so likewise in this) did justly oppose him,<note place="margin">

               <p>According to ordinary significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the word is used in opposition to the liberall arts: whereas in propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of speech those employments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may be styled <hi>illiberall,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire onely some bodily exercise, as manufactures, trades, &amp;c. And on the

contrary that discipline, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the generall causes, effects, and properties of things, may truly be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed as a <hi>species</hi> of Philosophy.</p>
               <p>But here it should be noted, that this art is usually distinguished into a twofold kind:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Rationall.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Rationall</hi> is that which treats of those principles, and fundamentall notions, which may concern these Mechanicall practises.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cheirurgicall</hi> or <hi>Manuall,</hi> doth refer to the making of these instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the exercising of such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular experiments. As in the works of Architecture, Fortifications, and the like.</p>
               <p>The first of these, is the subject of this discourse, and may properly be styled <hi>liberall,</hi> as justly deserving the prosecution of an ingenuous minde. For if we consider it according to its birth and originall, we shall finde it to spring from honourable parentage, being produced by <hi>Geometry</hi> on the


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99132:13"/>
one side, and <hi>naturall Philosophy</hi> on the other. If according to its use and benefit, we may then discern that to this should be referred all those arts and professions, so necessary for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane society, whereby nature is not onely directed in her usuall course, but sometimes also commanded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her own law. The particulars that concern Architecture, Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Husbandry, Military affairs, &amp;c. are most of them reducible to this art, both for their invention and use.</p>
               <p>Those other disciplines of Logick, Rhetorick, &amp;c. doe not more protect and adorn the mind, then these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall powers doe the body.</p>
               <p>And therefore are they well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be entertained with greater industry and respect, then they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly meet with in these times; wherein there be very many that pretend to be masters in all the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall arts, who scarce understand any thing in these particulars.</p>
               <p>The subject of this art is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heavinesse of severall bodies,


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99132:13"/>
or the proportion that is required betwixt any weight in relation to the power which may be able to move it. And so it refers likewise to violent and artificiall motion, as Philosophy doth to that which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</p>
               <p>The proper end for which this art is intended, is to teach how by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the true difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>weight</hi> and the <hi>power,</hi> a man may adde such a fitting supplement to the strength of the power, that it shall be able to move any conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weight, though it should never so much exceed that force, which the power is naturally endowed with.</p>
               <p>The art it self may be thus descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to be a Mathematicall discipline, which by the help of Geometricall principles doth teach to contrive se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall weights and powers, unto any kind, either of motion or rest, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Artificer shall determine.</p>
               <p>If it be doubted how this may be esteemed a <hi>species</hi> of Mathematicks,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dav. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valtus praef. in lib. Archim. de centro gravitatis.</hi>
                  </note> when as it treats of weights, and not


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99132:14"/>
of quantity; For satisfaction to this, there are two particulars considerable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Mathematicks</hi> in its latitude is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually divided into <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>mixed.</hi> And though the <hi>pure</hi> doe handle on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>abstract quantity</hi> in the <hi>generall,</hi> as <hi>Geometry, Arithmetick</hi>: yet that which is <hi>mixed</hi> doth consider the quantity of some <hi>particular determinate</hi> subject. So <hi>Astronomy</hi> handles the quantity of heavenly motions, <hi>Musick</hi> of sounds, and <hi>Mechanicks</hi> of weights &amp; powers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Heavinesse or weight is not here considered, as being such a naturall <hi>quality,</hi> whereby condensed bodies do of themselves <hi>tend downwards</hi>; but rather as being an affection, whereby they may be measured. And in this sense <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe referres it amongst the other <hi>species</hi> of <hi>quantity,</hi>

               <p>Unto some of which, the force of all Mechanicall inventions must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be reduced. I shall speak of them severally and in this order.</p>
               <p>First, concerning the Ballance; this, &amp; the Leaver are usually confounded together, as being but one faculty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the generall grounds &amp; propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of eithers force is so exactly the same. But for better distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; more


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99132:15"/>
clear discovery of their natures, I shall treat of them severally.</p>
               <p>The first invention of the ballance is commonly attributed to <hi>Astrea,</hi> who is therefore deified for the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of justice; and that instrument it self advanced amongst the celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all signs.</p>
               <p>The particulars concerning it are so commonly known, and of such ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie experiment, that they will not need any large explication. The chief end and purpose of it, is for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of severall ponderosities; For the understanding of which, we must note, that if the length of the sides in the Ballance, and the weights at the ends of them be both mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equall, then the Beam will be in a horizontall situation. But on the contrary, if either the weights alone be equall, and not their distances, or the distances alone, and not the weights, then the Beam will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly decline.</p>
               <p>As in this following diagram.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99132:15"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Suppose an equall weight at <hi>C,</hi> unto that at <hi>B,</hi> (which points are both equally distant from the center <hi>A,</hi>) it is evident that then the beam <hi>BF,</hi> will hang horizontally. But if the weight supposed at <hi>C,</hi> be unequall to that at <hi>B,</hi> or if there be an equall weight at <hi>DE,</hi> or any of the other unequall distances; the Beam must then necessarily decline.</p>
               <p>With this kinde of Ballance, it is usuall by the help onely of one weight,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cardan. Subtil. l.</hi> 1.</note> to measure sundry different gravities, whether more or lesse, then that by which they are measured. As by the example here described, a man may with one pound alone, weigh any other body within ten pounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the heavinesse of any weight


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99132:16"/>
doth increase proportionably to its distance from the Center. Thus one pound at <hi>D,</hi> will equiponderate unto two pounds at <hi>B,</hi> because the distance <hi>AD,</hi> is double unto <hi>AB.</hi> And for the same reason, one pound at <hi>E,</hi> will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiponderate to three pound at <hi>B,</hi> and one pound at <hi>F,</hi> unto ten at <hi>B,</hi> because there is still the same disproportion betwixt their severall distances.</p>
               <p>This kind of Ballance is usually styled <hi>Romana, statera.</hi> It seems to be of ancient use,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mechan. ca.</hi> 21.</note> and is mentioned by <hi>Aristotle</hi> under the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Hence it is easie to apprehend, how that false ballance may be composed so often condemned by the wise man, as being an abomination to the Lord.<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99132:16"/>
as if they were exactly just and true, as in this description.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Suppose <hi>AC,</hi> to have 11 such parts, whereof <hi>AB,</hi> has but 10, and yet both of them to be in themselves of equall weight; it is certain, that whether the scoles be empty, or whether in the scole <hi>D,</hi> we put 11 pound, and at <hi>E,</hi> 10 pound, yet both of them shall equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate, because there is just such a disproportion in the length of the sides <hi>AC,</hi> being unto <hi>AB,</hi> as 11 to 10.</p>
               <p>The frequency of such cousenages in these days, may be evident from common experience: and that they were used also in former ages, may

               <p>So great care was there amongst the Jews for the preservation of commutative justice from all abuse and falsification in this kind, that the publike standards and originals, by which all other measures were to be tryed and allowed, were with much religion preserved in the sanctuary, the care of them being committed to the Priests and Levites, whose office it was to look unto <hi>all manner of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and size.</hi>

just measures, as were agreeable unto the publike standards that were kept in the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>The manner how such deceitfull ballances may be discovered, is by changing the weights into each other scole, and then the inequality will be manifest.</p>
               <p>From the former grounds rightly apprehended, it is easie to conceive how a man may finde out the just proportion of a weight, which in any point given, shall equiponderate to severall weights given, hanging in severall places of the Beam.</p>
               <p>Some of these ballances are made so exact, (those especially which the refiners use) as to be sensibly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the eightieth part of a grain: which (though it may seeme very strange) is nothing to what <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>THe second Mechanicall faculty, is the Leaver; the first invention of it is usually ascribed to <hi>Neptune,</hi> and represented by his Trident, which in the Greek are both called by one name,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>There is one main principle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, which is (as it were) the very sum and epitome of this whole art. The meaning of it is thus expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99132:18"/>
is, as the weight is to an equivalent power, so is the distance betwixt the weight and the center, unto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betwixt the center and the power, and so reciprocally. Or thus, the power that doth equiponderate with any weight, must have the same proportion unto it, as there is betwixt their severall distances from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or fulciment: as in this following figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Where suppose the Leaver to bee represented by the length <hi>AB,</hi> the center or <note n="*" place="margin">This <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> cals <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> prop at the point <hi>C,</hi> the weight to bee sustained <hi>D,</hi> the power that doth uphold it <hi>E.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the meaning of the foresaid principle doth import thus much; that the power at <hi>E,</hi> must bear the


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99132:19"/>
same proportion to the weight <hi>D,</hi> as the distance <hi>CA,</hi> doth to the other <hi>CB</hi>; which, because it is octuple in the present example, therefore it will follow that one pound at <hi>B,</hi> or <hi>E,</hi> will equiponderate to eight pounds at <hi>A,</hi> or <hi>D,</hi> as is expressed in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. The ground of which maxime is this, because the point <hi>C,</hi> is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be the center of gravity, on either side of which, the parts are of equall weight.</p>
               <p>And this kind of proportion is not onely to be observed when the power doth <hi>presse downwards,</hi> (as in the former example) but also in the other species of violent motion, as <hi>lifting, drawing,</hi> and the like. Thus if the prop or fulciment were supposed to be at the extremity of the Leaver,
<figure/>


                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:99132:19"/>
As in this Diagram at <hi>A,</hi> then the weight <hi>B,</hi> would require such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the strengths or powers that did sustain it, as there is betwixt the severall distances <hi>AC,</hi> and <hi>BC.</hi> For as the distance <hi>AB,</hi> is unto <hi>AC,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The right understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this doth much conduce to the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Pulley.</note> so is the power at <hi>C,</hi> to the weight at <hi>B</hi>; that is, the power at <hi>A,</hi> must bee double to that at <hi>C,</hi> because the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <hi>BC,</hi> is twice as much as <hi>BA.</hi> From whence it is easie to conceive, how any burden carried betwixt two persons, may be proportioned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their different strengths. If the weight were imagined to hang at the number 2, then the power at <hi>C,</hi> would sustain but two of those parts, whereof that at <hi>A,</hi> did uphold 16. If it be supposed at the figure (3) then the strength at <hi>C,</hi> to that at <hi>A,</hi> would be but as three to fifteen. But if it were situated at the figure (9) then each of the extremities would participate of it alike, because that being the middle, both the distances are equall. If at the number (12) then the strength at <hi>C,</hi> is required to be


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99132:20"/>
double unto that at <hi>A.</hi> And in the like manner are we to conceive of the other intermediate divisions.</p>
               <p>Thus also must it be, if we suppose the power to be placed betwixt the fulciment and the weight, as in this example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Where, as <hi>AC,</hi> is to <hi>AB,</hi> so is the power at <hi>B,</hi> to the weight at <hi>C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence likewise may we conceive the reason why it is much harder to carry any long substance, either on the shoulders, or in the hand, if it be held by either of the extreams, then if it be sustained by the middle of it. The strength that must equiponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at the nearer end, sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing the weight almost double to what it is in it self.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Imagine the point <hi>A,</hi> to bee the place where any long substance (as suppose a Pike) is sustained; it is evident from the former principle, that the strength at <hi>B,</hi> (which makes it lye levell) must be equall to all the length <hi>AC,</hi> which is almost the whole Pike.</p>
               <p>And as it is in the depressing, or elevating, so likewise is it in the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any weight, as a Coach, Plow, or the like.</p>

               <p>Let the line <hi>DB,</hi> represent the Pole or Carriage on which the burden is sustained, and the line <hi>AC,</hi> the crosse barre; at each of its extremities, there is a severall spring-tree <hi>GH,</hi> and <hi>IK,</hi> to which either horses or oxen may be fastned. Now because <hi>A,</hi> and <hi>C,</hi> are equally distant from the middle <hi>B,</hi> therefore in this case the strength must be equall on both sides; but if we suppose one of these spring-trees to bee fastned unto the points <hi>E,</hi> or <hi>F,</hi> then the strength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to draw on that side, will be so much more, as the distance <hi>EB,</hi> or <hi>FB,</hi> is lesse then that of <hi>AB</hi>; that is, either as three to four, as <hi>EB,</hi> to

               <p>THe former principle being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy explained, concerning artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and dead motions, it will not be altogether impertinent, if in the next place, wee apply it unto those that are naturall in living bodies, and examine whether these also are not governed by the same kinde of proportions.</p>
               <p>In all perfect living creatures, there is a twofold kind of motive instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:

But now for its own proper naturall strength, in the lifting any great weight; this is always propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned according to its extension from the body, being of least force when it is fully stretched out, or at arms end, (as we say) because then the shoulder joynt is as the center of


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99132:23"/>
its motion, from which, the hand in that posture, being very remote, the weight of any thing it holds must be accordingly augmented. Whereas the arm being drawn in, the elbow joynt doth then become its center, which will diminish the weight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, as that part is neerer unto it then the other.</p>
               <p>To this purpose also, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother subtle probleme proposed by <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mechan. c.</hi> 31.</note> concerning the postures of sitting and rising up. The quaere is this, Why a man cannot rise up from his seat, unlesse he first, either bend his body forward, or thrust his feet backward.</p>
               <p>In the posture of sitting, our legs are supposed to make a right angle with our thighs, and they with our backs, as in this figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:99132:24"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Where let <hi>AB,</hi> represent the back, <hi>BC,</hi> the thighs, <hi>CD,</hi> the legs. Now it is evident, that a man cannot rise from this posture, unlesse either the back <hi>AB,</hi> do first incline unto <hi>F,</hi> to make an acute angle with the thighs <hi>BC</hi>; or else that the legs <hi>CD,</hi> do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline towards <hi>E,</hi> which may also make an acute angle with the thighs <hi>BC</hi>; or lastly, unlesse both of them do decline to the points <hi>GH,</hi> where they may be included in the same perpendicular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99132:24"/>For the resolution of which, the Philosopher proposes these two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A right angle (saith he) is a kind of equality, &amp; that being natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cause of rest, must needs be an impediment to the motion of rising.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because when either of the parts are brought into an acute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, the head being removed over the feet, or they under the head; in such a posture the whole man is much neerer disposed to the form of standing, wherein all these parts are in one streight perpendicular line; then he is by the other of right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, in which the back and legs are two parallels; or that of turning these streight angles into obtuse, which would not make an erect po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture but declining.</p>
               <p>But neither of these particulars (as I conceive) doe fully satisfie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent quaere, neither doe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators, <hi>Monantholius,</hi> or <hi>Guevara,</hi> better resolve it. Rather suppose <hi>BC,</hi> to be as a Vectis or Leaver, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99132:25"/>
the middle of which is the place of the fulciment, <hi>AB,</hi> as the weight, <hi>CD,</hi> the power that is to raise it.</p>
               <p>Now the body being situate in this rectangular forme, the weight <hi>AB,</hi> must needs be augmented pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to its distance from the fulciment, which is about halfe the thighs; whereas if we suppose either the weight to be inclined unto <hi>F,</hi> or the power to <hi>E,</hi> or both of them to <hi>GH,</hi> then there is nothing to bee lifted up but the bare weight it self, which in this situation is not at all increased with any addition by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>For in these conclusions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Leaver, we must always i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that point which is touched by a perpendicular from the center of gravity, to be one of the tearms. So that the diverse elevation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the instrument, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a great alteration in the weight it self, as may more elearly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by this following Diagram.</p>

               <p>But now suppose this instrument to be altered according to the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>DE,</hi> then the weight <hi>D,</hi> will be diminished, by so much, as the perpendicular from its center of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99132:26"/>
                  <hi>HI,</hi> doth fall nearer to the prop or fulciment at <hi>A.</hi> And the power at <hi>E,</hi> will be so much augmented, as the perpendicular fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> its center <hi>(KE)</hi> does fall farther from the point at <hi>A.</hi> And so on the contrary in that other situation of the Leaver <hi>FG</hi>; whence it is easie to conceive the true reason, why the inclining of the body, or the putting back of the leg, should so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the facility of rising.</p>
               <p>From these grounds likewise may we understand,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Fran: Bacons Nat. Hist. Exp.</hi> 731.</note> why the knees should be most weary in ascending, and the thighs in descending, which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the weight of the body doth bear most upon the knee-joynts, in raising it self up, and most upon the muscles of the thighs when it stays it self in comming down.</p>
               <p>There are divers other naturall problemes to this purpose, which I forbear to recite. We doe not so much as goe, or sit, or rise, without the use of this Mechanicall Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

               <p>The force of this instrument doth consist in that dis-proportion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which there is betwixt the Semidiameter of the Cylinder <hi>AB,</hi> and the Semidiameter of the rundle with the spokes <hi>FA.</hi> For let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the line <hi>FB,</hi> to be as a Leaver, wherein <hi>A,</hi> is the center or fulciment, <hi>B,</hi> the place of the weight, and <hi>F,</hi> of the power.

               <p>Suppose <hi>AB,</hi> for the Semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Axis or Cylinder, and <hi>AC,</hi> for the Semidiameter of the rundle, with the spokes; then the power

               <p>The chief advantage which this

instrument doth bestow, above that of the Leaver, doth consist in this particular. In a Leaver, the motion can bee continued onely for so short a space, as may be answerable to that little distance betwixt the fulciment and the weight: which is always by so much lesser, as the disproportion betwixt the weight and the power is greater, and the motion it self more easie: But now in this invention, that inconvenience is remedied; for by a frequent rotation of the axis, the weight may be moved for any height or length, as occasion shall require.</p>
               <p>Unto this faculty may we referre the force of all those engines which consist of wheels with teeth in them.</p>

               <p>The lower Pulleys onely doe give force to the motion. If we suppose a weight to hang upon any of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rundles, it will then require a power, that in it selfe shall be fully equall for the sustaining of it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The Diameter <hi>AC,</hi> being as the beam of a ballance, of which <hi>B</hi> is the prop or center. Now the parts <hi>A,</hi> and <hi>C,</hi> being equally distant from this center, therefore the power at <hi>E,</hi> must be equall to the weight at <hi>D,</hi> it being all one as if the power and the weight were fastned by two severall strings at the ends of the ballance <hi>FG.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all the upper Pulleys being of the same nature, it must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, that none of them doe in themselves conduce to the easing of the power, or lightning the weight, but onely for the greater convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

of the motion, the cords by this means running more easily moved then otherwise they would.</p>
               <p>But now suppose the weight to be sustained above the Pulley, as it is in all those of the lower sort: and then the power w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> supports it, need be but half as much as the weight it self.</p>

               <p>Let <hi>AC,</hi> represent the Diameter of a lower Pulley, on whose center at <hi>B,</hi> the weight is fastned, one end of the cord being tyed to a hook at <hi>D.</hi> Now it is evident, that halfe the weight is sustained at <hi>D,</hi> so that there is but the other half left to be

               </p>
               <p>And this same subduple proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will still remain, though we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose an upper Pulley joyned to the lower, as in these two other figures.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:99132:31"/>Where the power at <hi>A,</hi> is equall to the weight at <hi>B:</hi> Now the weight at <hi>B,</hi> being but half the ponderosity <hi>C,</hi> therefore the power at <hi>A,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the addition of the upper rundle, must be equivalent to half the weight; and as the upper Pulley alone, doth not abate anything of the weight, so neither being joyned with the lower, &amp; the same subduple difference betwixt the power and the weight, which is caused by the lower Pulley alone, doth still remain unaltered, though there be an upper Pulley ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto it.</p>
               <p>Now as one of these under Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys doth abate halfe of that heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which the weight hath in it self, and cause the power to be in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duple proportion unto it, so two of them doe abate halfe of that which remains, and cause a subquadruple proportion betwixt the weight and the power; three of them a subsex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuple, four a suboctuple: and so for five, six, or as many as shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, they will all of them diminish


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99132:32"/>
the weight according to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
               <p>Suppose the weight in it self to be 1200 pound, the applying unto it one of these lower Pulleys, wil make it but as 600, two of them as 300, three of them as 150, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But now, if we conceive the first part of the string to be fastned unto the lower Pulley, as in this other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure at <hi>F</hi>;


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99132:32"/>
                  <figure/>
then the power at <hi>A,</hi> will be in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triple proportion to the weight <hi>E,</hi> because the heavinesse would be then equally divided unto the three points of the lower Diameter <hi>B, C, D,</hi> each


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99132:33"/>
of them supporting a like share of the burden. If unto this lower Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley there were added another, then the power would be unto the weight in a subquintuple proportion. If a third, a subseptuple, and so of the rest. For we must note, that the cords in this instrument are as so many pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the rundles as so many lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or ballances.</p>
               <p>Hence it is easie to conceive, how the strength of the power may bee proportioned according to any such degree, as shall be required; and how any weight given, may be moved by any power given.</p>
               <p>'Tis not materiall to the force of this instrument, whether the rundles of it be big or little, if they be made equall to one another in their severall orders; But it is most convenient, that the upper should each of them increase as they are higher, and the other as they are lower, because by this means the cords will bee kept from tangling.</p>
               <p>These Pulleys may be multiplyed


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99132:33"/>
according to sundry different situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not onely when they are subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as in the former examples, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so when they are placed collaterally.</p>
               <p>From the former grounds it is easie to contrive a ladder, by which a man may pull himself up unto any height. For the performance of this, there is required onely an upper and a lower rundle:
<figure/>


                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:99132:34"/>
To the uppermost of these at <hi>A,</hi> there should be fastned a sharp graple or cramp of iron, which may be apt to take hold of any place where it lights.

For though we suppose a wedge being laid on a piece of timber, to be pressed down with never so great a weight; nay, though we should apply unto it the power of those other Mechanicall engines, the Pulley, Screw, &amp;c. yet the effect would be scarce consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in comparison to that of a blow. The true reason of which, is one of the greatest subtilties in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor is it fully rendred by any of those who have undertaken the resolution of it. <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Aristotle, Cardan,</hi> and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> doe generally ascribe it unto the swiftnesse of that motion; But there seems to be something more in the matter then so; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it would follow that the quick stroak of a light hammer, should be of greater efficacy, then any softer and more gentle striking of a great


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99132:36"/>
sledge. Or according to this, how should it come to passe, that the force of an arrow or bullet discharged near at hand (when the impression of that violence, whereby they are carried, is most fresh, and so in probability the motion at its swiftest) is yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding much lesse then it would be at a greater distance. There is therefore further considerable, the quality of that instrument by which this motion is given, and also the conveniency of distance through which it passes.</p>
               <p>Unto this faculty is usually redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the force of files, saws, hatchets, &amp;c. which are as it were but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wedges fastned unto a Vectis or Leaver.</p>

It is usually distinguished into two seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinds: the male, which is meant in the former description, and the female, which is of a concave super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself doth not so much as mention this instrument, which yet notwithstanding is of greater force and subtilty, then any of the rest. It is chiefly applied to the squee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing or pressing of things downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99132:37"/>
as in the Presses for printing, for wine, oyl, and extracting the juice from other fruits. In the performance of which, the strength of one man may bee of greater force, then the weight of a heavy mountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is likewise used for the elevating or lifting up of weights.</p>
               <p>The advantage of this faculty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the rest, doth mainly consist in this: the other instruments doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire so much strength for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of the weight to be moved, as may be equall unto it, besides that other superadded power whereby it is out-weighed and moved; so that in the operations by these, a man does always spend himself in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued labour.</p>
               <p>Thus (for example) a weight that is lifted up by a Wheel or Pulley, will of it self descend, if there bee not an equall power to sustain it. But now in the composure of a Screw, this inconvenience is perfectly reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died; for so much force as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto this faculty, from the


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99132:37"/>
power that is applied unto it, is still retained by the very frame and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the instrument it self; since the motion of it cannot possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but from the very same place where it first began. Whence it comes to passe, that any weight lifted up, with the assistance of this engine, may likewise be sustained by it, without the help of any externall power, and cannot again descend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its former place, unlesse the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Screw (where the motion first began) be turned back: so that all the strength of the power, may be imployed in the motion of the weight, and none spent in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining of it.</p>
               <p>The chief inconvenience of this instrument is, that in a short space it will be screwed unto its full length, and then it cannot be of any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use for the continuance of the motion, unlesse it be returned back, and undone again as at the first. But this is usually remedied by another invention, commonly styled a <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99132:38"/>
screw,</hi> which hath the <hi>motion</hi> of a <hi>wheel,</hi> and the <hi>force</hi> of a <hi>screw,</hi> being both infinite.</p>

at the bottome was 12 foot, at the top 8. Its whole weight is reckoned to be 956148 pounds, besides the heavinesse of all those instruments that were used about it, which (as it is thought) could not amount to lesse then 1042824 pounds.

               <p>But now these later ages are much more active and stirring: so that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ambitious man may finde so much businesse for the present, that he shall scarce have any leisure to trouble himself about the future.

               <p>There was formerly more leisure and opportunity, both for the great men to undertake such works, and for the people to perfect them. Those past ages were more quiet and peaceable, the Princes rather wanting imployment, then being over-prest with it, and therefore were willing to make choice of such great designs, about which to busie themselves: whereas now the world is growne more politick, and therefore more

troublesome, every great man having other private and necessary businesse about which to imploy both his time and means. And so likewise for the common people, who then living more wildly without being confined to particular trades and professions, might be more easily collected about such famous imployments; whereas now, if a Prince have any occasion for an Army, it is very hard for him to raise so great a multitude, as were usually imployed about these magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent buildings.

               <p>ALL these magnificent works of the Ancients before specified, are scarce considerable in respect of art, if we compare them with the famous speeches and acts of <hi>Archimedes:</hi> Of whom it is reported that he was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wont to say, how that he could move, <hi>Datum pondus cum datâ potentiâ,</hi> The greatest conceivable weight with the least conceivable power: and that if he did but know where to stand and fasten his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he could move the world, all

this great globe of sea and land; which <hi>promises,</hi> though they were altogether above the vulgar appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension or belief, yet because his <hi>acts</hi> were somewhat answerable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, therefore the King of <hi>Syracuse</hi> did enact a law whereby every man was bound to beleeve, what ever <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> would affirm.</p>
               <p>'Tis easie to demonstrate the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall truth of those strange asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by examining them according to each of the forenamed <hi>Mechanick</hi> faculties, every one of which is of infinite power.</p>
               <p>To begin with the two first of them, the Ballance and the Leaver, (which I here joyn together, because the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of both are wholly alike) 'tis certain, though there should bee the greatest imaginable weight, and the least imaginable power, (suppose the whole world, &amp; the strength of one man or infant) yet if we conceive the same dis-proportion betwixt their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall distances in the former faculties from the fulciment or center of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99132:48"/>
they would both equiponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. And if the distance of the power from the center, in comparison to the distance of the weight, were but any thing more then the heavinesse of the weight is in respect of the power, it may then be evident from the former principles, that the power would be of greater force then the weight, and consequently able to move it.
<figure/>
Thus if we suppose this great globe at <hi>A,</hi> to

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain 2400000000000000000000000 pounds, allowing a hundred pound for each cubicall foot in it,<note place="margin">

               <p>Imagine the weight <hi>A,</hi> to be a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that point, wherein every Leaver touches either the weight or one another from the point where they touch the prop, to be but one

such part, whereof the remainder contains ten, then according to the former grounds 10000 at <hi>B,</hi> will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiponderate to <hi>A,</hi> which is 100000, so that the second Leaver hath but 10000 pounds to move. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this observes the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the other in the distances of its severall points, therefore 1000 pounds at <hi>C,</hi> will be of equall weight to the former. And the weight at <hi>C,</hi> being but as a thousand pound, that which is but as a hundred at <hi>D,</hi> will be answerable unto it; and so still in the same proportion, that which is but 10 at <hi>E,</hi> will be equall to 100 at <hi>D</hi>; and that which is but one pound at <hi>F,</hi> will also be equall to ten at <hi>E.</hi> Whence it is manifest, that 1 pound at <hi>F,</hi> is equall to 100000 at <hi>A</hi>; and the weight must always be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the same proportion as ten to one, because in the multiplication of these Leavers, the distance of the point, where the instrument touches the weight, from that where it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the prop, is but as one such

part, whereof the remainder contains ten. But now if wee imagine it to be as the thousandth part, then must the weight be diminished according to this proportion; and then in the same multiplication of leavers, 1 l. will be equall to 1000000000000000 pounds: so that though we suppose the weight to be never so heavy, yet let the disproportion of distances be greater, or the Leavers more, and any little power may move it.</p>

For the first axis is conceived to be but as the tenth part of its wheel, and therefore though the weight in it self be as 10000, yet unto a power that hath this advantage, it is but as 1000, and therefore this thousand unto the like power at the second wheel, will be but as 100, and this 100 at the third but as 10; and lastly, this ten at the ballance but as one. But the weight was before supposed to be 100, which to the first wheel will be but 10, to the second as one, to the third as a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,

or one tenth, to the sails as one hundreth part: so that if the hair be but strong enough to lift 1/10000 that is, one ten thousandth part of a man, or (which is all one) one hundreth part of a pound, it may as well serve by the help of this instrument for the drawing of him up. And though there be not altogether so great a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion betwixt the severall parts of a Jack, (as in many perhaps there is not;) and though a man may be heavier then is here supposed, yet 'tis withall considerable that the strength of a hair is able to bear much more then the hundreth part of a pound.</p>

               <p>But now by these Mechanicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, it were easie to have made one of <hi>Sampsons</hi> hairs that was sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved off, to have been of more strength, then all of them when they were on. By the help of these arts it is possible (as I shall demonstrate) for any man to lift up the greatest Oak by the roots with a straw, to pull it up with a hair, or to blow it up with his breath.</p>
               <p>Suppose the roots of an Oak to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a thousand foot square, (which is almost a quarter of a mile) and forty foot deep, each cubicall foot being a hundred pound weight; which though it be much beyond the exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any tree, or the weight of earth, the compasse of the roots in the ground (according to common opinion) not extending further then the branches of it in the air, and the

               <p>According to this supposition, the work of forcing up the Oak by the roots, will be equivalent to the lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of 4000000000 pound weight, which by the aduantage of such an engine, as is here described, may be easily performed with the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable power.</p>

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:99132:57"/>The whole force of this engine doth consist in two double Pulleys, twelve wheels, and a sail. One of these Pulleys at the bottome will diminish half of the weight, so that it shall be but as 2000000000, and the other Pulley will abate ¾ three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it: so that it shall be but as 1000000000. And because the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the string being fastned unto the lower Pulley, makes the power to be in a subquintuple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion unto the weight,<note place="margin">See cha. 7.</note> therefore a power that shall be as 1000000000, that is, a subquadruple, will be so much stronger then the weight, and consequently able to move it. Now suppose the breadth of all the axes and nuts, to be unto the Diameters of the wheel as ten to one; and it will then be evident, that to a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at the first wheel, the weight is but as 100000000. To the second as 10000000. To the third as 1000000. To the fourth as 100000. To the fifth as 10000. To the sixth as 1000. To the seventh as 100. To the eighth

So that if the strength of the straw, or hair, or breath, be but equall to the weight of one thousandth part of a pound, it may be of sufficient force to pull up the Oak.</p>
               <p>If in this engine we suppose the disproportion betwixt the wheeles and nuts, to be as a hundred to one, then it is very evident that the same strength of breath, or a hair, or a straw, would be able to move the whole world, as will be easily found by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. Let this great globe of sea and land bee imagined (as before) to weigh so many hundred pounds as it contains cubicall feet; namely, 2400000000000000000000000 pounds. This will bee to the first Pulley, 1200000000000000000000000. To the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 600000000000000000000000.

Without the right understanding of which, a man shall be exposed to many absurd mistakes, in attempting of those things, which are either in themselves impossible, or else not to be performed with such means as are applyed unto them. I may safely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that many, if not most mistakes in these Mechanicall designs, doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from a mis-apprehension of that difference, which there will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the slownesse or swiftnesse of the weight and power, in comparison to the proportion of their severall strengths.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that so many engines invented for mines and water-works doe so often fail in the performance of that for which they were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, because the artificers many times doe forget to allow so much time for the working of their engine, as may be proportionable to the difference betwixt the weight and power that


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99132:60"/>
belong unto them: whereas he that rightly understands the grounds of this art, may as easily find out the difference of space and time, required to the motion of the weight and power, as he may their different strengths; and not only tell how any power may move any weight, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in what a space of <hi>time</hi> it may move it any space or <hi>distance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it were possible to contrive such an invention, whereby any conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weight may be moved by any conceivable power, both with the same quicknesse and speed (as it is in those things which are immediately stirred by the hand, without the help of any other instrument) the works of nature would be then too much subjected to the power of art: and men might be thereby incouraged (with the builders of <hi>Babell,</hi> or the rebell Gyants) to such bold designes as would not become a created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And therefore the wisdome of providence hath so confined these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane arts, that what any invention


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99132:60"/>
hath in the <hi>strength</hi> of its motion, is abated in the <hi>slowness</hi> of it: and what it hath in the extraordinary <hi>quickness</hi> of its motion, must be allowed for in the great <hi>strength</hi> that is required unto it.</p>
               <p>For it is to be observed as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule, that the space of time or place, in which the weight is moved, in comparison to that, in which the power doth move, is in the same proportion as they themselves are unto one another.</p>
               <p>So that if there be any great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the strength of the weight and the power, the same kind of differences will there be in the spaces of their motion.</p>
               <p>To illustrate this by an example:


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99132:61"/>
                  <figure/>
Let the line <hi>GAB,</hi> represent a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance or leaver, the weight being supposed at the point <hi>G,</hi> the fulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>A,</hi> and the power sustaining the weight at <hi>B.</hi> Suppose the point <hi>G,</hi> unto which the weight is fastned, to be elevated unto <hi>F,</hi> and the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site point <hi>B,</hi> to be depressed unto <hi>C</hi>; 'tis evident that the arch <hi>FG,</hi> or (which is all one) <hi>DE,</hi> doth shew the space of the weight, and the arch <hi>BC,</hi> the motion of the power. Now


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99132:61"/>
both these arches have the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion unto one another, as there is betwixt the weight and the power, or (which is all one) as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their severall distances from the fulciment. Suppose <hi>AG,</hi> unto <hi>AB,</hi> to be as one unto four, it may then be evident that <hi>FG,</hi> or <hi>DE,</hi> will be in the same proportion unto <hi>BC.</hi> For as any two Semidiameters are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one another, so are the severall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferences described by them, as also any proportionall parts of the same circumferences.</p>
               <p>And as the weight and power doe thus differ in the spaces of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so likewise in the slownesse of it; the one moving the whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <hi>BC,</hi> in the same time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the other passes onely <hi>GF.</hi> So that the motion of the power from <hi>B</hi> to <hi>C,</hi> is four times swifter then that of the weight from <hi>G</hi> to <hi>F.</hi> And thus will it be, if we suppose the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions to be far greater, whether or no we conceive it, either by a <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation</hi> of the same instrument and


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99132:62"/>
faculty, as in the former example, or by a <hi>multiplication</hi> of divers, as in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, Wheels, &amp;c. By how much the power is in it selfe lesse then the weight, by so much will the motion of the weight be slower, then that of the power.</p>
               <p>To this purpose I shall briefly touch at one of the Diagrams expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before in the twelfth Chapter, concerning the multiplication of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>In which, as each instrument doth diminish the weight according to a decuple proportion, so also doe they diminish the <hi>space</hi> and <hi>slownesse</hi> of its motion. For if we should conceive the first Leaver <hi>B,</hi> to be depressed unto its lowest, suppose ten foot, yet the weight <hi>A,</hi> would not be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99132:62"/>
above one foot; but now the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Leaver at its utmost could move but a tenth part of the first, and the third Leaver but a tenth part of the second, and so of the rest. So that the last Leaver <hi>F,</hi> being depressed, will passe a <hi>space</hi> 100000 greater, and by a motion, 100000 swifter then the weight at <hi>A.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus are we to conceive of all the other faculties, wherein there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly the same disproportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwixt the weight and power, in respect of the spaces and slownesse of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as there is betwixt their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gravities. If the power be unto the weight, but as one unto a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, then the space through which the weight moves, will be a hundred times lesse, and consequently the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the weight a hundred times slower then that of the power.</p>
               <p>So that it is but a vain and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible fancy for any one to think that he can move a great weight with a litle power in a litle space; but in all these Mechanicall attempts, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99132:63"/>
which is gotten in the strength of the motion, must be still allowed for in the slownesse of it.</p>
               <p>Though these contrivances doe so extreamly increase the power, yet they doe proportionably protract the time. That which by such helps one man may doe in a hundred days, may be done by the immediate strength of a hundred men in one day.</p>

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:99132:64"/>Now it was before manifested that according to the difference betwixt the weight and power, so will the difference be betwixt the slownesse or swiftnesse of their motions; whence it will follow, that in such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, wherein the weight shall bee 42398437 pounds, and the power that doth equiponderate it, but the 42398437 part of a pound (which is easie to contrive) in this engine the power being supposed to move with such a swiftnesse, as may be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to a mile an hower, the weight will passe but the 42398437 part of a mile in the same space, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently will be proportionably slow unto the swiftnesse of the heavens.</p>
               <p>It is related by our Country-man <hi>I. Dee,</hi> that he and <hi>Cardan</hi> being both together in their travels,<note place="margin">Preface to <hi>Euclid.</hi>
                  </note> they did see an instrument which was at first sold for 20 talents of gold, wherein there was one wheel, which constantly moving round amongst the rest, did not finish one revolution under the space of seven thousand years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:99132:64"/>But if we farther consider such an instrument of wheels as was mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before in the 14 chapter, with which the whole world might bee easily moved, we shall then find that the motion of the weight by that, must be much more slow, then the heavens are swift. For though wee suppose (saith <hi>Stevinus</hi>) the handle of such an engine with 12 wheels to be turned about 4000 times in an how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">

                  </note> (which is as often as a mans pulse doth beat) yet in ten years space the weight by this would not be moved above 10512/2400 0000000000000000 parts of one foot, which is nothing near so much as a hairs breadth. And it could not passe an inch in 1000000 years, saith <hi>Mersennus.</hi>

               <p>The truth of which we may more easily conceive, if we consider the frame and manner of this 12 wheeld engine. Suppose that in each axis or nut, there were ten teeth, and on each wheel a thousand: then the sails of this engine must be turned a hundred times, before the first wheel, (recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99132:65"/>
downward) could bee moved round once, and ten thousand times before the second wheel can finish one revolution, and so through the 12 wheels, according to this multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proportion.</p>
               <p>So that besides the wonder w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> there is in the force of these Mechanical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the extream slownesse of them is no lesse admirable. If a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that a body should remaine in such a constant direct motion, that there could not bee one minute of time, wherein it did not rid some space, and passe on further, and yet that this body in many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, should not move so far as a hairs breadth.</p>
               <p>Which notwithstanding may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear from the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. For since it is a naturall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that there can be no penetration of bodies, and since it is supposed, that each of the parts in this engine doe touch one another in their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, therefore it must necessarily follow, that the weight does begin


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99132:65"/>
and continue to move with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and (however it is insensible) yet it is certain there must be such a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so extreamly slow, as is here spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. So full is this art of rate and incredible subtilties.</p>

As the greatnesse of the weight in respect of the power, and the great distance of the power from the fulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in comparison to that of the weight, does cause a slow motion: So the greatnesse of the power above the vveight, and the greater distance of the vveight from the center, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison to that of the power does cause a swift motion. And as it is possible to contrive a motion unto any kind of slownesse, by finding out an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable disproportion betwixt the weight and power: so likewise unto any kind of swiftnesse. For so much as the weight does exceed the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by so much will the motion of the weight be slower, and so much as the power does exceed the weight, by so much vvill the motion of the weight be swifter.</p>

yet it is attested by the experience of divers unquestionable witnesses: <hi>Barclay</hi> in his <hi>Icon animorum,</hi> a man of sufficient credit, affirms that he was an eye-witnesse, how one of these Bows with a little arrow did pierce through a piece of steel three fingers thick.

               <p>These were sometimes framed for the discharging of two or three ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows together, so that each of them might bee directed unto a severall aim.

               <p>Both these kinds of engines when they were used at the siege of any City, were commonly carried in a great wooden Turret (first invented by <note n="*" place="margin">Who was therefore styled <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorcetes.</hi> This kind of Turret was first u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at the siege of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> &amp; is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Diodorus Sicul.

               <p>Those strange effects of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Bow (mentioned before) so much exceeding the force of others, which yet require far greater strength for the bending of them, may probably be ascribed either to the naturall cause of <hi>attraction by similitude of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> conjectures.)

weight of the arrow, and the strength of the bow, which must needs much conduce to the force of it, and may perhaps be more exactly discovered in these, then it is commonly in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

From whence it may be inferred, that the force of these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99132:76"/>
does rather exceed then come short of our Gun-powder inventions.</p>
               <p>Add to this that opinion of a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man (which I cited before) that <hi>Archimedes</hi> in the siege of <hi>Syracuse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Walt. Raleigh. <hi>Hist. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. § 16. See <hi>Lipsius de militiâ Romanâ. l.</hi> 5.</note> did more mischief with his Engines, then could have been wrought by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cannons, had they been then in use.</p>
               <p>In this perhaps there may be some disadvantage, because these Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Engines cannot be so easily and speedily wound up, and so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly levelled as the other may.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the price or charges of both these, it may be considered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der three particulars:
<list>
                     <item>1. Their making.</item>
                     <item>2. Their carriage or conveyance.</item>
                     <item>3. Their charge and discharging.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In all which respects, the Cannons now in use, are of much greater cost then these other inventions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The making or price of these Gun-powder instruments is extreamly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive, as may be easily judged by the weight of their materials. A whole


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99132:77"/>
Canno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weighing commonly 8000 l. a half Cannon 5000, a Culverin 4500, a Demiculverin 3000; which whether it be in iron or brasse, must needs be very costly, only for the matter of them; besides the farther charges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the form and making of them, which in the whole must needs amount to severall hundred pounds. Whereas these Mathematicall inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions consisting chiefly of Timber, and cords, may be much more cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made; The severall degrees of them which shall answer in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the strength of those other, being at the least ten times cheaper; that is, ten Engines that shall be of equal force either to a Cannon or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micannon, Culverin or Demiculverin, may be framed at the same price that one of these will amount to: So that in this respect there is a great inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for their carriage or convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; a whole Cannon does require at the least 90 men, or 16 horses, for the draught of it; a half Cannon 56


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99132:77"/>
men, or 9 horses; a Culverin 50 men, or 8 horses; a Demiculverin 36 men, or 7 horses; Supposing the way to be hard and plain, in which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the motion wil be very slow. But if the passage prove rising and steep, or rotten and dirty, then they will require a much greater strength and charge for the conveyance of them. Whereas these other inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in themselves more light (if there be occasion for the draught of them) being easily taken asunder into severall parts. And besides, their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials are to be found every where, so that they need not be carried up and down at all, but may be easily made in the place where they are to be used.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The materials required to the charging of these Gun-powder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, are very costly. A whole Cannon requiring for every charge 40 pound of powder, and a bullet of 64 pounds; a half Cannon 18 pound of powder, and a bullet of 24 pounds; a Culverin 16 pounds of powder, and


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99132:78"/>
a bullet of 19 pounds; a Demicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verin 9 pounds of powder, and a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of 12 pounds: whereas those other Engines may be charged only with stones, or (which may serve for terrour) with dead bodies, or any such materials as every place will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford without any cost.</p>
               <p>So then, put all these together: If it be so that those ancient inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did not come short of these other in regard of force, and if they doe so much excell them in divers other respects; It should seem then, that they are much more commodious then these later inventions, and should be preferred before them. But this inquiry cannot be fully determined without particular experience of both.</p>

               <p>FOr the conclusion of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I shall briefly examine (as before concerning slownesse) whether it be possible to contrive such an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall motion, as may be equall unto the supposed swiftnesse of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. This question hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proposed and answered by <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Variet. Rerum l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 47.</note> where he applies it unto the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the moons orb; but that orb being the lowest of all, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of a dull and sluggish moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in comparison to the rest; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will perhaps be more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to understand the question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eight sphere or starry hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>For the true resolution of this, it should be first observed, that a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall substance is altogether incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99132:79"/>
of so great a celerity, as is usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ascribed to the celestiall orbs. (as I have proved elsewhere) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the quaere is not to be understood of any reall and experimentall,<note place="margin">The earth a planet, <hi>prop.</hi> 9.</note> but only notionall, and Geometrical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance.</p>
               <p>Now that the swiftnesse of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be thus increased, according to any conceivable proportion, will be manifest from what hath been formerly delivered, concerning the grounds and nature of slownesse and swiftnesse. For according as we shall suppose the power to exceed the weight: so may the motion of the weight be swifter then that of the power.</p>
               <p>But to answer more particularly: Let us imagine every wheel in this following figure to have a hundred teeth in it, and every nut ten:


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99132:79"/>
                  <figure/>
It may then bee evident, that one revolution of the first wheel, will turn the nut, and consequently the second wheel on the same axis ten times, the


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99132:80"/>
third wheel a hundred times, the fourth 1000 times, the fifth 10000 the sixth a hundred thousand times, the seventh 1000000 times, the eight 10000000 times the ninth 100000000 times, the sailes 1000000000 times: So that if we suppose the compasse of these sails to be 5 foot, or one pace: and that the first wheel is turned about after the rate of one thousand times in an hower: It wil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be evident, that the sails shall be turned 1000000000000. times, and consequently shall passe 100000000 miles in the same space. Whereas a star in the Aequator (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to common <hi>Hypothesis</hi>) does move but 42398437 miles in an how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and therefore it is evident that 'tis possible Geometrically to contrive such an artificiall motion, as shall be of greater swiftnesse, then the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed revolutions of the heavens.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Those that receive their motion from something that does belong to the frame it self, as clocks, watches, by weights, springs, or the like.</p>
               <p>Of both which sorts, there have been many excellent inventions: In the recitall of them, I shall insist chiefly on such as are most eminent for their rarity and subtilty.</p>

                  </gap> that receive their motion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some externall agent, those of more common use are Mils.</p>
               <p>And first, the Water-mils, which are thought to be before the other, though neither the first Author, nor so much as the time wherein they were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is fully known.

               <p>However 'tis certain, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention hath much abridged and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged the labours of men, who were before condemned unto this slavery, as now unto the Galleys.<note place="margin">

                  </note> And as the force of waters hath been usefull for this, so likewise may it be contrived to divers other purposes. Herein doth the skill of an artificer chiefly consist, in the application of these common motions unto various and beneficiall ends, making them serviceable not only for the grinding of corn, but for the preparing of iron or other oare, the making of paper, the elevating of water or the like.</p>
               <p>To this purpose also are the Mils that are driven by wind, which are so much more convenient then the other, by how much their situations


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99132:82"/>
may be more easie and common. The motions of these may likewise be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to as various uses as the other, there being scarce any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to the performance of which, an ingenious artificer cannot apply them. To the sawing of Timber, the plowing of land, or any other the like service, which cannot be dispatched the ordinary way, without much toil and tediousnesse. And it is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing to consider, how much mens labours might be eased and contracted in sundry particulars, if such as were well skilled in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and practises of these Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call experiments, would but thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply their studies unto the inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such inventions.</p>
               <p>There are some other motions by wind or air, which (though they are not so common as the other, yet) may prove of excellent curiosity, and singular use. Such was that musicall instrument invented by <hi>Cornelius Dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marcell. Vrankhein. Epist. ad Ioh. Erne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum.</hi>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> 2. <hi>Strabo</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that he had both seen and heard it.</note> would presently become silent. The reason of it was this: the warmth of the sun, working upon some moisture within it, and rarifying the inward air unto so great an extension, that it must needs seek for vent or issue, did therby give severall motions unto the instrument.</p>
               <p>Somewhat of this nature are the <hi>Aeolipiles,</hi> which are concave vessels, consisting of some such materiall as may indure the fire, having a small hole, at which they are filled with water, and out of which (when the Vessels are heated) the air doth issue forth with a strong and lasting vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. These are frequently used for the exciting and contracting of heat in the melting of glasses or metals. They may also be contrived to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for sundry other pleasant u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as for the moving of sails in a chimney corner, the motion of which sails may be applied to the turning of a spit, or the like.</p>
               <p>But there is a better invention to


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99132:83"/>
this purpose mentioned in <hi>Cardan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

In which contrivance there are these conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences above the Jacks of ordinary use.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It makes little or no noise in the motion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It needs no winding up, but will constantly move of it self, while there is any fire to rarifie the air.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is much cheaper then the other instruments that are commonly used to this purpose. There being required unto it onely a paire of sails, which must bee placed in that part of the chimnie where it begins to be straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and one wheel to the axis of which the spit line must be fastned, according to this following Diagram.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99132:83"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The motion of these sails may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be serviceable for sundry other purposes, besides the turning of a spit; for the chiming of bels or other musicall devices; and there cannot be any more pleasant contrivance for


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99132:84"/>
continuall &amp; cheap musick. It may be usefull also for the reeling of yarn, the rocking of a cradle, with divers the like domestick occasions. For (as was said before) any constant motion being given, it is easie for an ingenious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer to apply it unto various services.</p>
               <p>These sails will always move both day and night, if there is but any fire under them, and sometimes though there bee none. For if the air without be much colder then that within the room, then must this which is more warm and rarified, naturally ascend through the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to give place unto the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed and heavy, which does usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally blow in at every chink or cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as experience shews.</p>
               <p>Unto this kind of motion may be reduced all those representations of living creatures, whether birds, or beasts, invented by <hi>Ctesibius,</hi> which were for the most part performed by the motion of air, being forced up either by <hi>rarefaction,</hi> with fire, or else by <hi>compression,</hi> through the fall


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99132:84"/>
of some heavier body, as water, which by possessing the place of the aire, did thereby drive it to seek for some other vent.</p>
               <p>I cannot here omit (though it bee not altogether so pertinent) to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that late ingenious invention of the winde-gun, which is charged by the forcible compression of air, being injected through a Syringe; the strife and distention of the imprisoned air serving by the help of little fals or shuts within, to stop and keep close the vents by which it was admitted. The force of it in the discharge is almost equall to our powder-guns. I have found upon frequent trials (saith <hi>Mersennus</hi>) that a leaden bullet shot from one of these gunnes against a stone wall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matica, prop.</hi> 32.</note> the space of 24 paces from it, will be beaten into a thinne plate. It would be a considerable addition to this experiment which the same Authour mentions a little after, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he will make the same charge of air to serve for the discharge of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall arrows or bullets after one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99132:85"/>
by giving the air onely so much roome, as may immediately serve to impresse a violence in sending away the arrow or bullet, and then screwing it downe again to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer confinement, to fit it for another shooting. But against this there may be many considerable doubts, which I cannot stand to discusse.</p>

               <p>Of this kind they have frequently in <hi>Holland</hi> other little Vessels for one or two persons to go upon the ice, having sledges instead of wheels, being driven with a saile; the bodies of them like little boats, that if the ice should break, they might yet safely carry a man upon the water, where the sail would be still usefull for the motion of it.</p>
               <p>I have often thought that it would be worth the experiment to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no such a sailing chariot might not be more conveniently framed w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> movable sails, whose force may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest from their motion, equivalent to those in a wind-mill.

               <p>The chief doubt will be, whether in such a contrivance every little rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gednesse or unevennes of the ground, will not cause such a jolting of the Chariot as to hinder the motion of its sails.

               <p>The particular circumstances for which the <hi>Automata</hi> of this kind, are most eminent, may be reduced to these four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The lastingnesse of their motion, without needing of any new supply; for which purpose there have been some watches contrived to continue without winding up for a week toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or longer.</p>

                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:99132:92"/>2. The easinesse and simplicity of their composition; Art it self being but the facilitating and contracting of ordinary operations, therefore the more easie and compendious such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions are, the more artificial should they be esteemed. And the addition of any such unnecessary parts, as may be supplied some other way, is a sure sign of unskilfulnesse and ignorance. Those antiquated engines that did consist of such a needlesse multitude of wheels, and springs, and screws, (like the old <hi>hypothesis</hi> of the heavens) may be compared to the notions of a confused knowledge, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways full of perplexity and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and seldome in order; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the inventions of art are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, simple, and perspicuous, like the apprehensions of a distinct and thoroughly informed judgement. In this respect the manner of framing the ordinary <hi>Automata,</hi> hath been much bettered in these later times above the former, and shall hereafter perhaps be yet more advantaged.


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99132:93"/>
These kind of experiments (like all other humane arts) receiving additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from every days experiment.</p>
               <p>To this purpose there is an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion consisting only of one hollow orb or wheel, whereby the howers may be as truly distinguished, as by any ordinary clock or watch. This wheel should be divided into severall cavities, through each of which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively either sand or water must be contrived to passe; the heavinesse of these bodies (being always in the ascending side of the wheel) must be counterpoised by a plummet that may be fastned about the pulley on the axis: this plummet will leisurely descend, according as the sand by running out of one cavity into the next, doth make the severall parts of the wheel lighter or heavier, and so consequently there will be produced an equall and lasting motion, which may be easily applyed to the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of howers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The multitude and variety of those services for which they may

                  </note>Amongst these gradient <hi>Automata,</hi> that iron spider mentioned in <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> is more especially remarkable, which being but of an ordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, besides the outward similitude, (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was very exact) had the same kind of motions with a living spider, and did creep up and down as if it had been alive. It must needs argue a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full art, and accuratenesse, to contrive all the instruments requisite for such


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99132:95"/>
a motion in so small a frame.</p>
               <p>There have been also other motions contrived from Magneticall qualities, which will shew the more wonderful, because there is no apparent reason of their motion, there being not the least contiguity or dependence upon any other body that may occasion it; but it is all one as if they should move up and down in the open air. Get a glasse sphere, fill it with such liquors as may be clear of the same colour, immixable, such as are oyl of tartar, and spirit of wine: In which, it is easie so to poise a little globe or other statue, that it shall swim in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Under this glasse sphere, there should be a loadstone concealed, by the motion of which, this statue (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a needle touched within it) will move up and down, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to shew the hower or sign. See severall inventions of this kinde in <hi>Kircher de arte Magnetica, l.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>There have been some artificiall images, which besides their severall postures in walking up and downe,


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99132:96"/>
have been made also to give severall sounds, whether of birds, as Larks, Cuckoes, &amp;c. or beasts, as Hares, Foxes. The voices of which creatures shall be rendred as clearly and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, by these artificiall images, as they are by those naturall living bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which they represent.</p>
               <p>There have been some inventions also which have been able for the utterance of articulate sounds, as the speaking of certain words. Such are some of the Aegyptian idols related to be.<note place="margin">

               <p>Now the ground and reason how these sounds were contrived, may be worth our inquiry.</p>
               <p>First then, for those of birds or beasts, they were made from such pipes or cals, as may expresse the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99132:96"/>
tones of those creatures which are represented: these cals are so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known and used, that they need not any further explication.</p>
               <p>But now about articulate sounds there is much greater difficulty.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> thinks it possible entirely to preserve the voice, or any words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in a hollow trunk, or pipe, and that this pipe being rightly opened, the words will come out of it in the same order wherein they were spoken. Somewhat like that cold Countrey, where the peoples discourse doth freeze in the air all winter, and may be heard the next Summer, or at a great thaw. But this conjecture will need no refutation.</p>
               <p>The more substantiall way for such a discovery, is by marking how nature her self doth imploy the severall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of speech, the tongue, lips, throat, teeth, &amp;c.

               <p>That such a contrivance is feasible and may be effected, is beyond all question, because it hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99132:97"/>
experimented here in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Cornelius Dreble,</hi> but how to improve it unto publike use and advantage, so as to be serviceable for remote voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the carrying of any considerable number of men, with provisions and commodities, would be of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent use as may deserve some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquiry.</p>
               <p>Concerning which there are two things chiefly considerable:
<list>
                     <item>The many difficulties with their remedies.</item>
                     <item>The great conveniences.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The difficulties are generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to these three heads:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The letting out, or receiving in any thing, as there shall be occasion without the admission of water. If it have not such a convenience, these kind of voyages must needs be very dangerous and uncomfortable, both by reason of many noisome offensive things, which should be thrust out, and many other needfull things which should be received in. Now herein will consist the difficulty, how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99132:98"/>
the opening of this vessell so, that any thing may be put in or out, and yet the water not rush into it with much violence, as it doth usually in the leak of a ship.</p>
               <p>In which case this may be a proper remedy; let there be certain leather bags made of severall bignesses, which for the <hi>matter</hi> of them should be both <hi>tractable</hi> for the use and managing of them, and <hi>strong</hi> to keep out the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the <hi>figure</hi> of them being long and open at both ends. Answerable to these, let there be divers windows, or open places in the frame of the ship, round the sides of which one end of these bags may be fixed, the other end coming within the ship being to open and shut as a purse. Now if we suppose this bag thus fastned, to be tyed close about towards the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, then any thing that is to be sent out, may be safely put into that end within the ship, which being again close shut, and the other end loosened, the thing may be safely sent out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the admission of any water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:99132:98"/>So again, when any thing is to be taken in, it must be first received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that part of the bag towards the window, which being (after the thing is within it) close tyed about, the other end may then be safely opened. It is easie to conceive, how by this means any thing or person may be sent out, or received in, as there shall be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, how the water, which will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by degrees leak into several parts, may be emptyed out again, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the like advantages. Though if there should be any leak at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of this Vessell, yet very little water would get in, because no air could get out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second difficulty in such an Ark will be the <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>fixing</hi> of it according to occasion; The <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it to severall places, as the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age shall be designed, without which, it would be very uselesse, if it were to remain only in one place, or were to remove only blindfold, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certain direction; And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of this may seem very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99132:99"/>
because these submarine Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators will want the usuall advantages of winds and tides for motion, and the sight of the heavens for direction.</p>
               <p>But these difficulties may be thus remedied; As for the <hi>progressive</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, this may be effected by the help of severall Oars, which in the outward ends of them, shall be like the fins of a fish to contract and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. The passage where they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the ship being tyed about with such leather bags (as were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before) to keep out the water. It will not be convenient perhaps that the motion in these voyages should be very swift, because of those ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations and discoveries to be made at the bottome of the sea, which in a little space may abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense the slownesse of its progresse.</p>
               <p>If this Ark be so ballast as to be of equall weight with the like mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of water, it will then be easily movable in any part of it.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>ascent</hi> of it, this may be easily contrived, if there be some great


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99132:99"/>
weight at the bottome of the ship (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of its ballast) which by some cord within may be loosened from it; As this weight is let low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, so will the ship ascend from it (if need be) to the very surface of the water; and again, as it is pulled close to the ship, so will it <hi>descend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>direction</hi> of this Ark, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners needle may be usefull in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>latitude</hi> of places, and the course of this ship being more regular then others, by reason it is not subject to Tempests or unequall winds, may more certainly guide them in judging of the <hi>longitude</hi> of places.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the greatest difficulty of all will be this, how the air may bee supplyed for respiration: How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant fires may be kept in it for light and the dressing of food, how those vicissitudes of rarefaction and conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation may be maintained.</p>
               <p>It is observed, that a barrell or cap, whose cavity will contain eight cubicall feet of air, will not serve a Urinator or Diver for respiration, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99132:100"/>
one quarter of an hower; the breath which is often sucked in and out, being so corrupted by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of vapours, that nature rejects it as unserviceable. Now in an hower a man will need at least 360 respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, betwixt every one of which there shall be 10 second minutes, and consequently a great change and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of air will be necessary for many persons, and any long space.</p>
               <p>And so likewise for the keeping of fire; a close Vessell containing 10 cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicall feet of air, will not suffer a wax candle of an ounce to burn in it above an hower before it be suffocated, though this proportion (saith <hi>Mersen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) doth not equally increase for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lights, because four flames of an equall magnitude will be kept alive the space of 16 second minutes, though one of these flames alone in the same Vessell will not last above 25, or at most 30 seconds, which may be easily tryed in large glasse bottles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wax candles lighted in them, and with their mouths inverted in water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:99132:100"/>For the resolution of this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though I will not say that a man may by custome (which in other things doth produce such strange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible effects) be inabled to live in the open water as the fishes doe, the inspiration and expiration of water serving instead of air, this being usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with many fishes that have lungs; yet it is certain that long use and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome may strengthen men against many such inconveniences of this kind, which to unexperienced persons may prove very hazzardous: and so it will not perhaps be unto these so necessary, to have the air for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so pure and defecated as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for others.</p>
               <p>But further there are in this case these three things considerable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Vessell it self should be of a large capacity, that as the air in it is corrupted in one part, so it may be purified and renued in the other: or if the meer refrigeration of the air would fit it for breathing, this might be somewhat helped with


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99132:101"/>
bellows, which would cool it by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not altogether improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the lamps or fires in the middle of it, like the reflected beams in the first Region, rarefying the air, and the circumambient coldnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the sides of the Vessell, like the second Region, cooling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densing of it, would make such a vicissitude and change of air, as might fit it for all its proper uses.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or if neither of these conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures will help,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Harmon. l.</hi> 4. <hi>prop.</hi> 6. <hi>Monit.</hi> 5.</note> yet <hi>Mersennus</hi> tels us in another place, that there is in <hi>France</hi> one <hi>Barrieus</hi> a Diver, who hath lately found out another art, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man might easily continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water for six howers together, and whereas ten cubicall feet of air will not serve another Diver to breath in for half an hower, he by the help of a cavity, not above one or two foot at most, will have breath enough for six howers, and a lanthorn scarce above the usuall size to keep a candle burning as long as a man please, which


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99132:101"/>
(if it be true, and were commonly known) might be a sufficient help against this greatest difficulty.</p>
               <p>As for the many advantages and conveniences of such a contrivance, it is not easie to recite them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis <hi>private</hi>; a man may thus goe to any coast of the world invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, without being discovered or prevented in his journey.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis <hi>safe</hi>; from the uncertainty of <hi>Tides,</hi> and the violence of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests,</hi> which doe never move the sea above five or six paces deep. From <hi>Pirates</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> which do so infest other voyages; From ice and great frosts, which doe so much endanger the passages towards the Poles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be of very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage against a Navy of enemies, who by this means may be undermined in the water and blown up.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It may be of speciall use for the relief of any place that is besieged by water, to convay unto them invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble supplies: and so likewise for the surprisall of any place that is accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by water.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:99132:102"/>5. It may be of unspeakle benefit for submarine experiments and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries: as</p>
               <p>The severall proportions of swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse betwixt the ascent of a bladder, cork, or any other light substance in comparison to the descent of stones or lead. The deep caverns and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous passages where the sea-water in the course of its circulation, doth vent it self into other places, and the like. The nature and kinds of fishes, the severall arts of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, by alluring them with lights, by placing divers nets about the sides of this Vessell, shooting the greater sort of them with guns, which may be put out of the ship by the help of such bags as were mentioned before, with divers the like artifices and treacheries, which may be more successively practised by such who live so familiarly together. These fish may serve not only for food, but for fewell likewise, in respect of that oyl which may be extracted from them; the way of dressing meat by lamps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99132:102"/>
in many respects the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for such a voyage.</p>
               <p>The many fresh springs that may probably be met with in the bottome of the sea, will serve for the supply of drink and other occasions.</p>
               <p>But above all, the discovery of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine treasures is more especially considerable, not only in regard of what hath been drowned by racks, but the severall precious things that grow there, as Pearl, Corall, Mines, with innumerable other things of great value, which may be much more easily found out, and fetcht up by the help of this, then by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther usually way of the Urinators.</p>
               <p>To which purpose, this great Vessell may have some lesser cabines tyed about it, at various distances, wherein severall persons as Scouts, may be lodged for the taking of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, according as the Admirall shall direct them. Some of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently sent up to the surface of the water, as there shall be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:99132:103"/>All kind of arts and manufactures may be exercised in this Vessell. The observations made by it, may bee both written, and (if need were) printed here likewise. Severall Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies may thus inhabit, having their children born and bred up without the knowledge of land, who could not chuse but be amazed with strange conceits upon the discovery of this upper world.</p>
               <p>I am not able to judge what other advantages there may be suggested, or whether experiment would fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to these notionall conjectures. But however, because the invention did unto me seem ingenious and new, being not impertinent to the present enquiry, therefore I thought it might be worth the mentioning.</p>

after them, as being in themselves of excellent curiosity; yet there are some other inventions depend upon them of more generall benefit and greater importance. For if there be any such artificiall contrivances that can flye in the air, (as is evident from the former relations, together with the grounds here specified, and I doubt not, may bee easily effected by a diligent and ingenious artificer) then it will clearly follow, that it is possible also for a man to fly himself: It being easie from the same grounds to frame an instrument, wherein any one may sit, and give such a motion unto it, as shall convey him aloft through the air.

Though the truth is, most of these Artists did unfotunately miscarry by falling down and breaking their arms or legs, yet that may be imputed to their want of experience, and too much fear, which must needs possesse men in such dangerous and strange at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. Those things that seem very difficult and fearfull at the first, may grow very facil after frequent triall and exercise. And therefore he that would effect any thing in this kind, must be brought up to the constant practise of it from his youth. Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

first onely to use his wings in running on the ground, as an Estrich or tame Geese will doe, touching the earth with his toes; and so by degrees learn to rise higher, till hee shall attain unto skill and confidence.

These things may seem impossible to others, and it would be very dangerous for any one to attempt them, who hath not first gradually attained to these arts, by long practise and triall; and why may not such practise inable him as well for this other experiment, as for these things?</p>
               <p>There are others who have inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ways to walk upon the water, as regularly and firmly as upon the land. There are some so accustomed to this element, that it hath been almost as naturall to them, as to the fish; men that could remain for above an how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er together under water. <hi>Pontanus</hi> mentions one who could swim above a hundred miles together, from one shore to another, with great speed, and at all times of the year.<note place="margin">Treatise of custome.</note> And it is storied of a certain young man, a <hi>Sicilian</hi> by birth, and a <hi>Diver</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, who had so continually used himself to the water, that he could

not enjoy his health out of it. If at any time he staid with his friends on the land, he should be so tormented with a pain in his stomack, that he was forced for his health to returne back again to sea; wherein he kept his usuall residence, and when hee saw any ships, his custome was to swim to them for relief, which kind of life he continued till he was an old man, and dyed.</p>
               <p>I mention these things to shew the great power of practise and custome, which might more probably succeed in this experiment of flying (if it were but regularly attempted) then in such strange effects as these.</p>
               <p>It is a usuall practise in these times, for our <hi>Funambulones,</hi> or Dancers on the Rope, to attempt somewhat like to flying, when they will with their heads forwards slide downe a long cord extended; being fastned at one end on the top of some high Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the other at some distance on the ground, with wings fixed to their shoulders, by the shaking of which

to consider whether this might not be more probably effected by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the feet, which are naturally more strong and indefatigable: In which contrivance the wings should come down from the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on each side as in the other, but the motion of them should be from the legs, being thrust out and drawn in again one after another, so as each leg should move both wings, by which means a man should (as it were) walk or climbe up into the air: and then the hands and arms might be at leisure to help and direct the motion, or for any other service proportionable to their strength. Which conjecture is not without good probability, and some speciall advantages above the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the fourth and last way seems unto me altogether as probable, and much more usefull then any of the rest. And that is by a flying cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, which may be so contrived as to carry a man within it; &amp; though the strength of a spring might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99132:113"/>
be serviceable for the motion of this engine, yet it were better to have it assisted by the labour of some intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent mover as the heavenly orbs are supposed to be turned. And therefore if it were made big enough to carry sundry persons together, then each of them in their severall turns might successively labour in the causing of this motion; which thereby would be much more constant and lasting, then it could otherwise be, if it did wholly depend on the strength of the same person. This contrivance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much to be preferred before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the other, as swimming in a ship before swimming in the water.</p>

of these two <hi>Quaeres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether an engine of such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and weight, may be supported by so thin and light a body as the air?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the strength of the persons within it, may be sufficient for the motion of it?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the first; when <hi>Callias</hi> was required by the men of <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vitruvius Archit. l.</hi> 10 <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> to take up that great <hi>Helepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> brought against them by <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> (as he had done before unto some lesse which hee himselfe had made.) He answered that it could not be done. <hi>Nonnulla enim sunt que in exemplaribus videntur similia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">So <hi>Ramus Schol. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them. l.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>cum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem crescere coeperunt, dilabuntur.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those things that appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in lesser models, when they are increased to a greater proportion, doe thereby exceed the power of art. For example, though a man may make an instrument to bore a hole, an inch wide, or half an inch, and so lesse; yet to bore a hole of a foot wide, or two foot, is not so much as to bee


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99132:114"/>
thought of. Thus, though the air may be able to uphold some lesser bodies, as those of birds, yet when the quantity of them is increased to any great extension, it may justly be doubted, whether they will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the proportion that is naturally required unto such kind of bodies.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, that the engine can never be too big or too heavy, if the space which it possesses in the air, and the motive faculty in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument be answerable to its weight. That saying of <hi>Callias</hi> was but a groundlesse shift and evasion, wherby hee did endeavour to palliate his own ignorance and disability. The utmost truth which seems to be implyed in it, is this: That there may be some bodies of so great a bignesse, &amp; gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it is very difficult to apply so much force unto any particular instrument, as shall be able to move them.</p>
               <p>Against the example it may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and easily proved, that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually possible to bore a hole of any


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99132:114"/>
bignesse, as well great as little, if we suppose the instrument, &amp; the strength and the application of this strength to be proportionable; But because of the difficulty of these concurrent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in those greater and more unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall operations, therefore doe they falsly seem to be absolutely impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>So that the chief inference from this argument and example, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply onely thus much, that it is very difficult to contrive any such motive power, as shall be answerable to the greatnesse and weight of such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument as is here discoursed of, which doth not at all impair the truth to be maintained; For if the possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of such a motion be yeelded, we need not make any scruple of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the difficultie of it; It is this must adde a glory to the invention; and yet this will not perhaps seem so very difficult to any one who hath but diligently observed the flight of some other birds, particularly of a Kite, how he will swim up and down


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99132:115"/>
in the air, sometimes at a great height, and presently again lower, guiding himself by his train, with his wings extended without any sensible moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them; and all this, when there is only some gentle breath of air stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, without the help of any strong forcible wind. Now I say, if that fowl (which is none of the lightest) can so very easily move it self up and down in the air, without so much as stirring the wings of it: certainely then, it is not improbable, but that when all the due proportions in such an engine are found out, and when men by long practise have arrived to any skill and experience, they will be able in this (as well as in many other things) to come very near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the imitation of nature.</p>
               <p>As it is in those bodies which are carried on the water, though they be never so bigge or so ponderous,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sen. Nat. Qu l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 25.</note> (suppose equall to a City or a whole Island) yet they will alwaies swim on the top, if they be but any thing lighter, then so much water


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99132:115"/>
as is equall to them in bignesse: So likewise is it in the bodies that are carried in the air. It is not their greatnesse (though never so immense) that can hinder their being supported in that light element, if we suppose them to be extended unto a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable space of air. And as from the former experiments, <hi>Archimedes</hi> hath composed a subtle <hi>science</hi> in his Book, <hi>De insidentibus humido,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the weight of any heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in reference to the water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is: So from the particular triall of these other experiments, that are here inquired after, it is possible to raise a new science, concerning the extension of bodies, in comparison to the air, and motive faculties by which they are to be carried.</p>
               <p>We see a great difference betwixt the severall quantities of such bodies, as are commonly upheld by the air; not only little gnats, &amp; flies, but also the Eagle and other fowl of vaster magnitude. <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> doe unanimously affirm,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Subtil. l.</hi> 10. <hi>Exercit.</hi> 231.</note> that there is a


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99132:116"/>
bird amongst the Indians of so great a bignesse, that his beak is often u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make a sheath or scabbard for a sword.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Histor. Nov. Orb. l</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 37.</note> And <hi>Acosta</hi> tels us of a fowl in <hi>Peru</hi> called <hi>Condores,</hi> which will of themselves kill and eat up a whole Calf at a time. Nor is there any reason why any other body may not be supported and carried by the air, though it should as much exceed the quantity of these fowl, as they doe the quantity of a flie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcus Polus</hi> mentions a fowl in <hi>Madagascar,</hi> which he cals a <hi>Ruck,</hi> the feathers of whose wings are 12 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or threescore foot long, which can with as much ease, soop up an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, as our Kites doe a Mouse. If this relation were any thing credible, it might serve as an abundant proof for the present quaere. But I conceive this to be already so evident, that it needs not any fable for its further confirmation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other doubt was, whether the strength of the other persons within it, will be sufficient for the


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99132:116"/>
moving of this engine? I answer, the main difficulty and labour of it will be in the raising of it from the ground; neer unto which, the earths attractive vigor, is of greatest effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But for the better effecting of this, it may be helped by the strength of winds, and by taking its first rise from some mountain or other high place. When once it is aloft in the air, the motion of it will be easie, as it is in the flight of all kind of birds, which being at any great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the earth, are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their motion for a long time &amp; way, with little labour or wearinesse.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain from common relation and experience that many birds doe cross the seas for divers hundred miles together:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 23.</note> sundry of them amongst us, which are of a short wing and flight, as Blackbirds, Nightingales, &amp;c. doe flie from us into <hi>Germany,</hi> and other remoter Countries. And Mariners doe commonly affirm that they have found some fowle above sixe hundred miles from any land.


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99132:117"/>
Now if we should suppose these birds to labour so much in those long journies, as they doe when they flie in our sight and near the earth, it were impossible for any of them to passe so farre without resting. And therefore it is probable, that they do mount unto so a high a place in the air, where the naturall heavinesse of their bodies does prove but little or no impediment to their flight; Though perhaps either hunger, or the sight of ships, or the like accident, may sometimes occasion their descending lower, as we may ghesse of those birds, which Mariners have thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and divers others that have been drowned and cast up by the sea.</p>
               <p>Whence it may appear, that the motion of this chariot (though it may be difficult at the first) yet will still be easier as it ascends higher, till at length it shall become utterly devoid of gravity, when the least strength will be able to bestow upon it a swift motion: as I have proved


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99132:117"/>
more at large in another discourse.<note place="margin">World in the Moon, c. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But then, (may some object) If it be supposed that a man in the aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall air does lose his own heavinesse, how shall he contribute any force to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the motion of this instrument?</p>
               <p>I answer, The strength of any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature in these externall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is something really distinct from, and superadded unto its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gravity: as common experience may shew, not only in the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of blows or violent motions, as a river hawk will strike a fowl with a far greater force, then the meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent or heavinesse of his body could possibly perform. But also in those actions which are done without such help, as the pinching of the finger, the biting of the teeth, &amp;c. all which are of much greater strength then can proceed from the meer heavines of those parts.</p>
               <p>As for the other particular doubts, concerning the extream thinnesse, and coldnesse of this aethereall air, by reason of which, it may seem to be


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99132:118"/>
altogether impassible, I have already resolved them in the above cited dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>The uses of such a Chariot may be various: besides the discoveries which might be thereby made in the lunary world; It would be servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble also for the conveyance of a man to any remote place of this earth: as suppose to the <hi>Indies</hi> or <hi>Antipodes.</hi> For when once it was elevated for some few miles, so as to be above that orb of magnetick virtue, which is carried about by the earths diurnall revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it might then be very easily and speedily directed to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place of this great globe.</p>
               <p>If the place which we intended were under the same parallel, why then the earths revolution once in 24 howers, would bring it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, so that it would be but descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a straight line, and wee might presently be there. If it were under any other parallel, it would then only require that we should direct it in the same Meridian, til we did come to that


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99132:118"/>
parallel; and then (as before) a man might easily descend unto it.</p>
               <p>It would be one great advantage in this kind of travelling, that one should be perfectly freed from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of ways or weather, not having any extremity of heat, or cold, or Tempests to molest him. This ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereall air being perpetually in an equall temper and calmnesse. <hi>Pars superior mundi ordinatior est nec in nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem cogitur,</hi>

               <p>As for the manner how the force of a spring, or (in stead of that) the strength of any living person, may bee applyed to the motion of these wings of the Chariot, it may easily be apprehended from what was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly delivered.</p>
               <p>There are divers other particulars


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99132:119"/>
to be more fully enquired after, for the perfecting of such a flying Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot;<note place="margin">As well too long as too short, too broad as too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, may be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by making it more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, slow and flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</note> as concerning the proportion of the wings both for their length and breadth, in comparison to the weight which is to bee carried by them, as also concerning those speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all contrivances, whereby the strength of these wings may be severally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed either to ascent, descent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive, or a turning motion; All which, and divers the like enquiries can onely be resolved by particular experiments.

               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:99132:119"/>He that would regularly attempt any thing to this purpose, should observe this progresse in his experiments, he should first make enquiry what kind of wings would bee most usefull to this end; those of a Bat being most easily imitable, and perhaps nature did by them purposely intend some intimation to direct us in such expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments; that creature being not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a bird, because not amongst the <hi>Ovipara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After this he might try what may be effected by the force of springs in lesser models, answerable unto <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chytas</hi> his Dove, and <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> his Eagle: In which he must be carefull to observe the various proportions betwixt the strength of the spring, the heavinesse of the body, the breadth of the wings, the swiftnesse of the motion, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>IT is the chief inconvenience of all the <hi>Automata</hi> before mentioned, that they need a frequent repair of new strength, the causes whence their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does proceed, being subject to fail and come to a period; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be worth our enquiry, to examine, whether or no there may be made any such artificiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, which might have the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of moving from it self: so that the present motion should constantly be the cause of that which succeeds.</p>
               <p>This is that great secret in <hi>art,</hi> which like the Philosophers stone in <hi>nature,</hi> hath been the businesse and study of many more refined wits, for divers ages together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it may well be questioned, whether either

of them as yet, hath ever beene found out, though if this have, yet like the other, it is not plainly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of by any Authour.</p>
               <p>Not but that there are sundry dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses concerning this subject, but they are rather <hi>conjectures</hi> then <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.</hi> And though many inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this kind, may at first view bear a great shew of probability, yet they will fail being brought to triall, and will not answer in practise what they promised in speculation. Any one who hath beene versed in these experiments must needs acknowledge that hee hath been often deceived in his strongest confidence; when the imagination hath contrived the whole frame of such an instrument, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that the event must infallibly answer its hopes; yet then, does it strangely deceive in the proof, and discovers to us some defect, which we did not before take notice of.</p>
               <p>Hence is it, that you shall scarce talk with any one who hath never so little smattering in these arts, but he


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99132:121"/>
will instantly promise such a motion, as being but an easie atchievement, till further triall and experience hath taught him the difficulty of it. There being no enquiry that does more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice with the <hi>probability,</hi> and deceive with the <hi>subtilty.</hi> What one speakes wittily concerning the Philosophers stone, may be justly applyed to this, that it is <hi>Casta meretrix,</hi> a chaste whore. <hi>Quia multos invitat, neminem admittit,</hi> because it allures many, but admits none.</p>
               <p>I shall briefly recite the severall ways whereby this hath been attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or seems most likely to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, thereby to contract and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the enquiries of those who are addicted to these kind of experiments; for when they know the defects of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inventions, they may the more easily avoid the same, or the like in their own.</p>
               <p>The ways whereby this hath been attempted, may be generally reduced to these three kinds:

               <p>But more especially remarkable, is that relation celebrated by so many Authours, concerning <hi>Olybius</hi> his lamp, which had continued burning for 1500 years. The story is thus: As a rustick was digging the ground by <hi>Padua,</hi> he found an Urne or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pot, in which there was another urne, and in this lesser, a lamp clearly burning; on each side of it, there were two other Vessels, each of them full of a pure liquor, the one of gold, the other of silver. <hi>Ego Chymiae artis, (si

               <p>The lesser urn was thus inscribed:

               <p>THere are two opinions to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, which doe utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the chiefe consequence from these relations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some think that these lights so often discovered in the ancient tombs, were not fire or flame, but only some of those bright bodies which do usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally shine in dark places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others grant them to be fire, but yet think them to be then first enkindled by the admission of new air, when these sepulchres were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are divers bodies (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) which shine in the dark,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De anima. l</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> as rotten wood, the scales of some fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, stones, the glow-worm, the eyes of divers creatures.<note place="margin">

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99132:128"/>
a candle, by which alone in a darke night, one may both write and read; By these the Indians (saith he) use to eat their feasting Suppers.</p>
               <p>It is commonly related and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that a Carbuncle does shine in the dark like a burning coal, from whence it hath its <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Carlo Pyropus. Historia Animal. l.</hi> 8</note> name. To which purpose there is a story in <hi>Aelian,</hi> of a Stork, that by a certain woman was cured of a broken thigh, in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to whom, this fowl afterwards flying by her, did let fall into her lap a bright Carbuncle, which (saith he) would in the night time shine as clear as a lamp. But this and the like old relations are now generally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeved and rejected by learned men: <hi>Doctissimorum omnium consensu, hujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi gemmae non inveniuntur,</hi> (saith <hi>Boetius de Boot</hi>) a man very much skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in,<note place="margin">

               <p>Some have thought that the light


<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99132:128"/>
in ancient tombs hath been occasioned from some such bodies as these.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet. de lucern. l.</hi> 2.</note> For if there had been any possibility to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve fire so long a space, 'tis likely then that the <hi>Israelites</hi> would have known the way, who were to keep it perpetually for their sacrifices.</p>
               <p>But to this opinion it might bee replyed, that none of these <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> or night-shining bodies have been observed in any of the ancient sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, and therefore this is a mere imaginary conjecture; And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, some of these lamps have been taken out burning, and continued so for a considerable space afterwards. As for the supposed conveniency of them, for the perpetuating of the holy fire amongst the Jews, it may as well be feared lest these should have occasioned their idolatry; unto which that nation was so strongly addicted, upon every sleight occasion; nor may it seem strange, if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God should rather permit this fire sometimes to goe out, that so by their earnest prayers, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

renued from heaven, (as it <note n="*" place="margin">Levit. 9.24. 2 Chron. 7.1. 1 King. 18.38. <hi>De jure Mani. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 32.</note> som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was) the peoples faith might be the better stirred up and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by such frequent miracles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the opinion of <hi>Gutherius,</hi> that these lamps have not continued burning for so long a space, as they are supposed in the former relations, but that they were then first enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the admission of new air, or such other occasion, when the sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres were opened: as we see in those fat earthy vapours of divers sorts, which are oftentimes enkindled into a flame. And 'tis said, that there are some Chymicall ways, whereby iron may be so heated, that being closely luted in a glasse, it shall constantly retain the fire for any space of time, though it were for a thousand years or more; at the end of which, if the glasse be opened, and the fresh aire admitted, the iron shall be as red hot as if it were newly taken out of the fire.</p>
               <p>But for answer to this opinion, 'tis considerable that some urns have had


<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99132:129"/>
inscriptions on them, expressing that the lamps within them were burning, when they were first buried. To which may be added the experience of those which have continued so, for a good space afterwards; whereas the inflammation of fat and viscous vapours does presently vanish. The lamp which was found in the Isle <hi>Nesis,</hi> did burn clearly while it was inclosed in the glasse, but that being broken, was presently extinguished. As for that Chymicall relation, it may rather serve to prove, that fire may continue so many ages, without consuming any fewell.</p>
               <p>So that notwithstanding the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site opinions, yet 'tis more probable that there have been such lamps, as have <hi>remained burning,</hi> without any new supply, for many hundred years together; which was the first particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to be explained.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the reason,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cur sint.</hi>
                  </note> why the Ancients were so carefull in this particular, there are divers opinions. Some think it to be an expression of


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99132:130"/>
their beleef, concerning the souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, after its departure out of the body, a lamp amongst the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> being the <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of life. And therefore they that could not procure such lamps, were yet carefull to have the image and representation of them ingraved on their Tombes.</p>
               <p>Others conceive them to be by way of gratitude to those infernall deities, who tooke the charge and custody of their dead bodies, <hi>remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> always with them in their Tombs, and were therefore called <hi>Dii manes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others are of opinion, that these lamps were onely intended to make their sepulchres more pleasant and lightsome, that they might not seem to be imprisoned in a dismall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable place. True indeed, the dead bodie cannot be sensible of this light, no more could it of its want of buriall; yet the same instinct which did excite it to the desire of one, did also occasion the other.</p>

in Camphire, and some other bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous substances.

As others (saith he) have contrived as great a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in appearance, from the naturall virtue of another stone, making an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron image seem to hang in the air, by


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:99132:133"/>
reason of two load-stones, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed in the seeling, the other in the floor.</p>
               <p>Others are of opinion that this may be effected in a hollow vessell, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luted or stopped up in all the vents of it. And then, if a lamp be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to burn in it, but for the least moment of time, it must continue so always, or else there would be a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which nature is not capable of; If you ask, how it shall be nourished, it is answered, that the oyl of it being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into smoak &amp; vapours, will again be converted into its former nature; For otherwise, if it should remaine rarified in so thin a substance, then there would not be room enough for that fume which must succeed it; and so on the other side, there might bee some danger of the <hi>penetration</hi> of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which nature doth as much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor. To prevent both which, as it is in the chymicall circulations, where the same body is oftentimes turned from liquour into vapour, and from vapour into liquour again; so


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:99132:133"/>
in this experiment, the same oyl shall be turned into fume, and that fume shall again convert into oyl. Always provided, that this oyl which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes the lamp, bee supposed of so close and tenacious a substance, that may slowly evaporate, and so there will be the more leisure for nature to perfect these circulations. According to which contrivance, the lamp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this vessell can never fail, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways supplyed with sufficient nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment. That which was found in the Isle <hi>Nesis,</hi> inclosed in a glasse viall, mentioned by <hi>Baptista Porta,</hi> is thought to be made after some such manner as this.</p>
               <p>Others conceive it possible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract such an oyl out of some mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, which shall for a long space serve to nourish the flame of a lamp with very little or no expence of its own substance.<note place="margin">

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99132:134"/>
(perhaps for ever, or at least) for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages together, without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed. For if gold it self (as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shews) be so untameable by the fire, that after many meltings, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent heats, it does scarce diminish, 'tis probable then, that being dissolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an oylie substance, it might for many hundred years together conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue burning.</p>
               <p>There is a little chymical discourse, to prove that <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> is to be made by art; the Authour of this Treatise affirms that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.16. where God tels <hi>Noah, a window shalt thou make in the Ark,</hi> to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unfitly rendred in our translation a window, because the original word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies properly splendor or light; and then besides, the air being at that time so extreamely darkned with the clouds of that excessive rain, a window could be but of very little use in regard of light, unlesse there were some other help for it; From whence he conjectures that both this splendor, and so likewise the Urim


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:99132:134"/>
and Thummim were artificiall, chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall preparations of light, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to these subterraneous lamps; or in his own phrase, it was <hi>the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall spirit fixed in a transparent body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the opinion of <hi>Licetus</hi> (who hath more exactly searched into the subtilties of this inquiry) that fire does not need any humour for the nourishment of it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Lucer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, c.</hi> 20, 21</note> but onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it from flying upwards. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self one of the chief elements (saith he out of <hi>Theophrastus</hi>) it were absurd to think that it could not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist without something to feed it. As for that substance which is consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by it, this cannot be said to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or preserve the same fire, but onely to generate new. For the better understanding of this, we must observe, that there may be a threefold proportion betwixt fire, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or matter of it. Either the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour does exceed the strength of the fire, or the fire does exceed the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and according to both these, the flame doth presently vanish. Or


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99132:135"/>
else lastly, they may be both equall in their virtues, (as it is betwixt the radicall moisture and naturall heat in living creatures) and then neither of them can overcome or destroy the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Those ancient lamps of such long duration were of this later kind. But now, because the qualities of heat or cold, drinesse or moisture in the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent air, may alter this equality o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> proportion betwixt them, and make one stronger then the other; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent this, the Ancients did hide these lamps in some caverns of the earth, or close monuments: And hence is it, that at the opening of these, the admission of new air un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lamp does usually cause so great an inequality betwixt the flame and the oyle, that it is presently extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>
               <p>But still the greatest difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, how to make any such exact proportion betwixt an unctuous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and such an active quality, as the heat of fire, or this equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:99132:135"/>
made, it is yet a further difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how it may bee preserved. To which purpose, <hi>Licetus</hi> thinkes it possible to extract an inflamable oyl from the stone <hi>Asbestus, Amiantus,</hi> or the metall gold, which being of the same pure and homogeneous nature with those bodies, shall be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned unto the heat of fire, that it cannot be consumed by it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once inflamed should continue for many ages, without any sensible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution.</p>
               <p>If it be in the power of Chymistry to perform such strange effects, as are commonly experimented in that which they call <hi>aurum fulminans,</hi> one scruple of which shall give a lowder blow, &amp; be of greater force in descent, then half a pound of ordinary gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder in ascent; why may it not be as feasible by the same art to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract such an oyl as is here enquired after: Since it must needs be more difficult to make a fire which of its owne inclination shall tend downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, then to contrive such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:99132:136"/>
liquour, wherein fire shall be maintained for many years without any new supply.</p>
               <p>Thus have I briefly set down the relations and opinions of divers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men concerning these perpetuall lamps; of which, though there have been so many sundry kinds, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ways to make them, (some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to resist any violence of weathers, others being easily extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by any little alteration of the air, some being inclosed round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout within glasse, others being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen;) yet now they are all of them utterly perished amongst the other ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of time; and those who are most versed in the search after them have onely recovered such dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, from which a man cannot clearly deduce any evident principle that may encourage him to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular triall.</p>

               <p>But amongst all these kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, that is most likely, wherein a loadstone is so disposed, that it shall draw unto it on a reclined plane, a bullet of steel; which steele, as it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99132:137"/>
neer to the loadstone, may be contrived to fall down through some hole in the plane, and so to return unto the place from whence at first it began to move; and being there, the loadstone will again attract it upwards, till coming to this hole it will fall down again: and so the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be perpetuall, as may be more easily conceivable by this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:99132:138"/>Suppose the loadstone to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented at <hi>AB,</hi> which though it have not strength enough to attract the bullet <hi>C,</hi> directly from the ground, yet may doe it by the help of the plane <hi>EF</hi>; Now when the bullet is come to the top of this plane, its own gravity (which is supposed to exceed the strength of the loadstone) will make it fall into that hole at <hi>E:</hi> and the force it receives in this fall, will carry it with such a violence unto the other end of this arch, that it will open the passage which is there made for it, and by its return will again shut it, so that the bullet, (as at the first) is in the same place, whence it was attracted, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently must move perpetually.</p>
               <p>But however this invention may seem to be of such strong probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, yet there are sundry particulars which may prove it insufficient; For,</p>

to be answerable unto <hi>A</hi> in the stone, and to <hi>B</hi>; In the attraction <hi>CD,</hi> must always be directed answerable to <hi>AB,</hi> and so the motion will be more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, by reason there can be no rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or turning round of the bullet, but it must slide up with the line <hi>CD,</hi> answerable to the axis <hi>AB.</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

the sphere of its activity and strength would be so increased when it approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches much neerer, that it would not need the assistance of the plane, but would draw it immediately to it self, without that help, and so the bullet would not fal down through the hole, but ascend to the stone, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cease its motion. For if the loadstone be of force enough to draw the bullet on the plane, at the distance <hi>FB,</hi> then must the strength of it be sufficient to attract it immediately unto it selfe, when it is so much neerer as <hi>EB.</hi> And if the gravity of the bullet be supposed so much to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the strength of the Magnet, that it cannot draw it directly when it is so near, then will it not be able to attract the bullet up the plane when it is so much further off.</p>

               <head>CAP. XIV. The seeming probability of effecting a continuall motion by solid weights in a hollow wheel or sphere.</head>
               <p>THe third way whereby the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a perpetuall motion hath been attempted, is by the naturall affection of gravity; when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinesse of severall bodies is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that the same motion which they give in their descent, may bee able to carry them up again.</p>
               <p>But against the possibility of any such invention, it is thus objected by <hi>Cardan</hi>; All sublunary bodies have a direct motion either of ascent or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, which,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Subtil. l.</hi> 17 <hi>De Var Rerum l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 48.</note> because it does refer to some tearm, therefore cannot be perpetuall, but must needs cease, when it is arrived at the place unto which it naturally tends.</p>
               <p>I answer, though this may prove


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99132:140"/>
that there is no naturall motion of any particular heavy body, which is perpetuall, yet it doth not hinder but that it is possible from them to contrive such an artificiall revolution as shall constantly be the cause of it self.</p>
               <p>Those bodies which may be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to this purpose, are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable into two kinds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Solid and consistent, as weights of metall, or the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Fluid or sliding, as water, sand, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Both these ways have been attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by many, though with very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no successe. Other mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures in this kind you may see set down by divers Authours.<note place="margin">

I shall onely mention two new ones, which (if I am not over partiall) seem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as probable, as any of these kinds that have been yet invented; and til experience had discovered their defect and insufficiency, I did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99132:140"/>
conclude them to be infallible.</p>
               <p>The first of these contrivances was by solid weights being placed in some hollow wheel or sphere, unto which they should give a perpetuall revolution. For (as the Philosopher hath largely proved) only a circular motion can properly be perpetuall.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arist. Phys. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But for the better conceiving of this invention, it is requisite, that we rightly understand some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in <hi>Trochilicks,</hi> or the art of wheel-instruments; As chiefly, the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the parts of a wheel, and those of a ballance: the severall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions in the Semidiameter of a wheel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arist. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan. c.</hi> 2. <hi>De ratione librae ad circulum.</hi>
                  </note> being answerable to the sides in a ballance, where the weight is multiplyed according to its distance from the center.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:99132:141"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Thus suppose the center to be at <hi>A,</hi> and the Diameter of the wheel <hi>DC,</hi> to be divided into equall parts (as is here expressed) it is evident ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former ground, that one pound at <hi>C,</hi> will equiponderate to five pound at <hi>B,</hi> because there is such a proportion betwixt their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall distances from the Center. And it is not materiall whether or no these severall weights be placed hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontally, for though <hi>B</hi> do hang lower


<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99132:141"/>
then <hi>C,</hi> yet this does not at all concern the heavinesse, or though the plummet <hi>C,</hi> were placed much higher then it is at <hi>E,</hi> or lower at <hi>F,</hi> yet would it still retain the same weight which it had at <hi>C,</hi> because these plummets (as is the nature of all heavy bodies) doe tend downewards by a streight line: So that their severall gravities are to be measured by that part of the horizontall Semidiameter, which is directly either below or above the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus when the plummet <hi>C,</hi> shall be moved either to <hi>G</hi> or <hi>H,</hi> it wil lose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of its former heavinesse, and bee equally ponderous as if it were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the ballance at the number 3, and if we suppose it to be situated at <hi>I</hi> or <hi>K,</hi> then the weight of it will lie wholly upon the Center, and not at all conduce to the motion of the wheel on either side. So that the streight lines which passe through the divisions of the diameter, may serve to measure the heavinesse of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weight in its severall situations.</p>
               <p>These things throughly considered,


<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99132:142"/>
it seems very possible and easie for a man to contrive the plummets of a wheel, that they may be always hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier in their fall, then in their ascent; and so consequently that they should give a perpetuall motion to the wheel it self: Since it is impossible for that to remain unmoved, as long as one side in it is heavier then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>For the performance of this, the weights must be so ordered, 1. That in their descent they may fall from the Center, and in their ascent may rise neerer to it. 2. That the fall of each plummet may begin the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which should succeed it. As in this following Diagram.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:99132:142"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Where there are 16 plummets, 8 in the inward circle, and as many in the outward, (the inequality being to arise from their situation, it is therefore most convenient that the number of them be even.) The eight inward plummets are supposed to be in themselves so much heavier then the other, that in the wheel they may be of equall weight with those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them, and then the fall of these will bee of sufficient force to bring


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:99132:143"/>
down the other. For example, if the outward be each of them 4 ounces, then the inward must be 5, because the outward is distant from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 5 of those parts, whereof the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is but 4. Each paire of these weights should be joyned together by a little string or chain, which must be fastned about the middle betwixt the bullet and the center of that plummet, which is to fall first, and at the top of the other.</p>
               <p>When these bullets in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent are at their farthest distance from the center of the wheel, then shall they be stopped, and rest on the pins placed to that purpose; and so in their rising, there must be other pins to keep them in a convenient posture and distance from the center, lest approaching too neere unto it, they thereby become unsit to fall, when they shall come to the top of the descending side.</p>
               <p>This may be otherwise contrived with some different circumstances, but they will all redound to the same


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:99132:143"/>
effect. By such an engine it seemes very probable, that a man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a perpetuall motion. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the plummets from the center increasing their weight on one side, and their being tyed to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, causing a constant succession in their falling.</p>
               <p>But now, upon experience I have found this to be fallacious, &amp; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may sufficiently appear by a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the heavines of each plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, according to its several situation; which may easily be done by those perpendiculars that cut the diameter, (as was before explained, and is here expressed in five of the plummets on the descending side.) From such a calculation it will be evident, that both the sides of this wheel will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiponderate, and so consequently that the supposed inequality, whence the motion should proceed, is but imaginary and groundlesse. On the descending side, the heavinesse of each plummet may be measured according to these numbers, (supposing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:99132:144"/>
of the wheel to be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to twenty parts, and each of those subdivided into four.)</p>

               <p>THat which I shall mention as the last way, for the triall of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, is by contriving it in some water instrument; which may seem altogether as probable and easie as any of the rest, because that element by reason of its fluid and subtle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (whereby of its own accord it searches out the lower and more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row passages) may be most pliable to the mind of the artificer. Now the usuall means for the ascent of water is either by <hi>Suckers</hi> or <hi>Forces,</hi> or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing equivalent thereunto; Neither of which may be conveniently applied unto such a work as this, because there is required unto each of them so much or more strength, as may be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to the full weight of the water that is to be drawn up; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they move for the most part by fits and snatches, so that it is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily conceivable, how they should conduce unto such a motion, which by reason of its perpetuity must bee regular and equall.</p>

               <p>Where you see there is a Cylinder <hi>AA,</hi> and a spirall cavity or pipe twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about it, according to equall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions <hi>BB.</hi> The axis and centers of its motions are at the points <hi>CD,</hi> upon which being turned, it will so happen that the same part of the pipe which was now lowermost, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently become higher, so that the water does ascend by descending; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending in comparison to the whole instrument, and descending in respect


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:99132:147"/>
of its severall parts. This being one of the strangest wonders amongst those many, wherein these Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall arts doe abound, that a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy body should rise by falling down, and the farther it passes by its own naturall motion of descent, by so much higher still shall it ascend; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> though it seem so evidently to contradict all reason and Philosophy; yet in this instrument it may be manifested both by demonstration and sense.</p>
               <p>This pipe or cavity for the matter of it, cannot easily be made of metall, by reason of its often turnings; but for triall, there might bee such a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, cut in a columne of wood, and afterwards covered over with tinne plate.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That there must be an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity observed betwixt the breadth of the pipe, and the distance of its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall circumvolutions.</p>

                  </note> If the Hypotenusall, or Screw be 5, the perpendicular or elevation must be 3, and the basis 4.</p>
               <p>However (with his leave) neither of these proportions are generally necessary, but should be varied accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to other circumstances. As for the breadth of the pipe in respect of its revolutions, it is left at liberty, and may bee contrived according to the quantity of water which it should contain. The chief thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered is the obliquity or closenesse of these circumvolutions. For the nearer they are unto one another, the higher may the instrument be erected; there being no other guide for its true elevation but this.</p>
               <p>And because the right understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this particular is one of the principall matters that concerns the use of this engine, therefore I shall endeavour with brevity and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity to explain it. The first thing


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99132:148"/>
to be inquired after is what kind of inclination these Helicall revolutions of the cylinder have unto the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, which may be thus found out.</p>

then the inclination of the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, will be increased by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>EDH,</hi> though these revolutions will still remain in a kind of ascent, so that water cannot bee turned through them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:99132:149"/>But now, if the Screw be placed so far declining, that the angle of its inclination <hi>FBG,</hi> be lesse then the angle <hi>ECD,</hi> in the triangle, as in this other Diagram under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; then the revolutions of it will descend to the Horizon, as does the line <hi>EC,</hi> and in such a posture, if the Screw be turned round, water will ascend through its cavity. Whence it is easie to conceive the certain declination wherein any Screw must bee placed for its owne convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of water upwards. Any point betwixt <hi>H</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> being in descent, but yet the more the Screw declines downwards towards <hi>D,</hi> by so much the more water will be caried up by it.</p>
               <p>If you would know the just quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water which every revolution does contain and carry, according to any inclination of the cylinder, this may be easily found by ascribing on it an <hi>Ellipsis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this in <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldus de Cochlea, l.</hi> 2 <hi>Prop.</hi> 25.</note> parallel to the Horizon; which <hi>Ellipsis</hi> will shew how much of the revolution is empty, and how much full.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:99132:149"/>The true inclination of the Screw being found, together with the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain quantity of water which every <hi>helix</hi> does contain; it is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, that the water by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument does ascend naturally of it self without any violence or labour, and that the heavinesse of it does lie chiefly upon the centers or axis of the cylinder, both its sides being of equall weight (saith <hi>Vbaldus</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. l.</hi> 3. <hi>prop.</hi> 4.</note>) So that (it should seem) though we suppose each revolution to have an equall quantity of water, yet the Screw will remain with any part upwards (according as it shall be set) without turning it self either way. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the least strength being added to either of its sides, should make it descend, according to that common maxime of <hi>Archimedes</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos.</hi> 3.</note> any addition will make that which equiponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with another, to tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>But now, because the weight of this instrument, and the water in it does leane wholly upon the axis,


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:99132:150"/>
hence is it (saith <hi>Vbaldus</hi>) that the grating and rubbing of these axes against the sockets wherein they are placed, will cause some ineptitude and resistency to that rotation of the cylinder, which would otherwise ensue upon the addition of the least weight to any one side; But (saith the same Authour) any power that is greater then this resistency which does arise from the axis, will serve for the turning of it round.</p>
               <p>These things considered together, it wil hence appear, how a perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may seem easily contrivable. For if there were but such a water-wheel made on this instrument, upon which the stream that is carried up, may fall in its descent, it would turn the Screw round, and by that means convey as much water up, as is required to move it, so that the motion must needs be continuall, since the same weight which in its fall does turn the wheel, is by the turning of the wheel carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up again.</p>
               <p>Or if the water falling upon one


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:99132:150"/>
wheel would not be forcible enough for this effect, why then there might be two or three, or more, according as the length and elevation of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will admit; By which means the weight of it may bee so multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the fall, that it shall bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to twice or thrice that quantity of water which ascends. As may be more plainly discerned by this following Diagram.</p>

many other wheeles, as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is capable of. So that besides the greater distance of these three streams from the center or axis, by which they are made so much heavier, &amp; besides, that the fal of this outward water is forcible and violent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ascent of that within is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; Besides all this, there is thrice as much water to turn the Screw, as is carried up by it.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, if all the water falling upon one wheel, would be able to turn it round, then half of it would serve with two wheels; and the rest may be so disposed of in the fall, as to serve unto some other usefull delightfull ends.</p>
               <p>When I first thought of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, I could scarce forbear with <hi>Archimedes</hi> to cry out <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; It seeming so infallible a way for the effecting of a perpetuall motion, that nothing could bee so much as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably objected against it: But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on triall and experience I finde it altogether insufficient for any such


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:99132:152"/>
purpose, and that for these two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The water that ascends will not make any considerable stream in the fall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This stream (though multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) will not bee of force enough to turn about the Screw.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The water ascends gently and by intermissions, but it fals continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and with force; each of the three vessels being supposed full at the first, that so the weight of the water in them might adde the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter strength and swiftnesse to the streames that descend from them; Now this swiftnesse of motion will cause so great a difference betwixt them, that one of these little streams may spend more water in the fall, then a stream six times bigger in the ascent, though wee should suppose both of them to be continuate; How much more then, when as the ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding water is vented by fits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissions, every circumvolution voiding onely so much as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:99132:153"/>
in one <hi>Helix</hi>? And in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, one that is not versed in these kind of experiments, may bee easily deceived.<note place="margin">O</note>
               </p>
               <p>But secondly, though there were so great a disproportion, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the force of these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward streams, might well enough serve for the turning of the Screw, if it were so that both its sides would equiponderate the water being in them (as <hi>Vbaldus</hi> hath affirmed.) But now upon farther examination, we shall find this assertion of his, to be utterly against both reason and experience. And herein does consist the chief mistake of this contrivance. For the ascending side of the Screw is made by the water contained in it so much heavier then the descending side, that these outward streams thus applied, will not be of force enough to make them equiponderate, much lesse to move the whole. As may be more easily discerned by this figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:99132:153"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Where <hi>AB,</hi> represents a Screw covered over, <hi>CDE,</hi> one <hi>Helix</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of it, <hi>CD,</hi> the ascending side, <hi>ED</hi> the descending side, the point <hi>D</hi> the middle. The Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall line <hi>CF,</hi> shewing how much of the <hi>Helix</hi> is filled with water, <hi>viz.</hi> of the ascending side, from <hi>C</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Helix</hi> to <hi>D</hi> the middle of it; and on the descending side, from <hi>D</hi> the middle, to the point <hi>G,</hi> where the Horizontall does cut the Helix. Now it is evident that this later part <hi>DG,</hi> is nothing neare so much, and consequently not so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy as the other <hi>DC.</hi> And thus is it in all the other revolutions, which as they are either more or larger, so


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:99132:154"/>
will the difficulty of this motion bee increased. Whence it will appeare, that the outmard streams which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, must be of so much force as to countervail all that weight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ascending side in every one of these revolutions does exceed the other; And though this may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by making the water-wheels larger, yet then the motion will be so slow, that the Screw will not be able to supply the outward streams.</p>
               <p>There is another contrivance to this purpose mentioned by <hi>Kircher de Magnete, l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 4. depending upon the heat of the sun, and the force of winds, but it is liable to such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of exceptions, that it is scarce worth the mentioning, and does by no means deserve the confidence of any ingenuous artist.</p>
               <p>Thus have I briefly explained the probabilities and defects of those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle contrivances, whereby the making of a perpetuall motion hath been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. I would be loath to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the enquiry of any ingenuous

artificer, by denying the possibility of effecting it with any of these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall helps;<note place="margin">Treated of before, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi>
                  </note> But yet (I conceive) if those principles which concern the slownesse of the power in comparison to the greatnesse of the weight, were rightly understood, and throughly considered, they would make this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment to seem (if not altogether impossible, yet) much more difficult then otherwise perhaps it will appear. However, the inquiring after it, cannot but deserve our endeavours, as being one of the most noble amongst al these Mechanicall subtilties. And (as it is in the fable of him who dugge the Vineyard, for a hid treasure, though he did not finde the money, yet hee thereby made the ground more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, so) though we doe not attaine to the effecting of this particular, yet our searching after it may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover so many other excellent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, as shall abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense the labour of our enquiry.</p>
               <p>And then besides, it may be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encouragement to consider the
