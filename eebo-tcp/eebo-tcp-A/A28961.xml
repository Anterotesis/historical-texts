            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TIS thought fit the Reader ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, That the inſuing Tract (about the <hi>Effects of Languid Motions</hi>) was deſign'd to be a Part of the Authour's Notes about the <hi>Origine of Occult Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:104480:3"/>
and ſhould have come abroad together with the Papers about the <hi>Effluvia of Bodies</hi> (moſt of which are already publiſh'd.) And accordingly it was printed ſeven or eight years ago: which Circumſtance is here mention'd, to give a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſeveral Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were omitted in the Body of the Diſcourſe, that will be found annex'd to the End of it. For theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the Authour whilſt he curſorily read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Tract it ſelf, when
<pb facs="tcp:104480:3"/>
it was upon the point to be made publick, 'twas thought fit rather to ſubjoin them by way of a ſhort <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> than to let any thing be loſt that ſeem'd pertinent to ſo difficult and unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated a Subject, as That they belong to.

                  <p>HOW ſuperficially ſoever the <hi>Local Motion</hi> of Bodies is wont to be treated of by the Schools, who admit of divers other Motions, and aſcribe almoſt all ſtrange things in Phyſicks to <hi>Subſtantial Forms</hi> and <hi>Real Qualities;</hi> yet it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Us, who endeavour to reſolve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature into Matter

and Local motion, (<hi>guided,</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of things, immediately, and ſince <hi>regulated,</hi> according to ſettled Laws, by the Great and Wiſe Author of the Univerſe,) to take a heedfull notice of its kinds and operations, as the true Cauſes of many abſtruſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. And though the induſtry of divers late Mathematicians and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have been very laudably and happily exerciſed on the nature and general Laws of this Motion; yet I look upon the Subject in its full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be of ſuch importance, and ſo comprehenſive, that it can never be too much cultivated, and that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes ſome parts that are yet ſcarce cultivated at all. And therefore I am not ſorry to find my ſelf obliged, by the deſign of theſe Notes, (writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as you know, to facilitate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating of <hi>Occult</hi> Qualities) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to improve ſome neglected Corners of this vaſt field, and to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Whether, beſides thoſe effects of Local motion which are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, as being produced by the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104480:6"/>
manifeſt ſtriking of one body againſt another, where the bulk, &amp;c. of the Agent, together with its Celerity, have the chief Intereſt; there may not be divers effects, wont to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Occult Qualities, that yet are really produced by <hi>faint</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeded</hi> Local motions of bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another, and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>But, before I enter upon particulars, this I muſt premiſe in general, (which I have elſewhere had occaſion to note to other purpoſes,) that we are not to look upon the bodies we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with, as ſo many Lumps of Matter, that differ onely in bulk and ſhape, or that act upon one another merely by their own diſtinct and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular powers; but rather as bodies of peculiar and differing internal Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well as external Figures: on the account of which ſtructures, many of them muſt be conſidered as a kind of Engines, that are both ſo framed and ſo placed among other bodies, that ſometimes Agents, otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104480:7"/>
may have notable operations upon them, becauſe thoſe operations being furthered by the Mechaniſm of the body wrought on, and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which other bodies and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Cauſes have to it, a great part of the effect is due, not preciſely to the external Agent, that 'tis wont to be aſcribed to, but in great meaſure to the action of one part of the body it ſelf (that is wrought on) upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aſſiſted by the concurring action of the neighbouring bodies, and perhaps of ſome of the more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Agents of Nature. This No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Conſideration being in other Papers particularly confirmed, I ſhall not now inſiſt upon it, truſting that you will not forget it, when there ſhall be occaſion to apply it in the following Notes.</p>
                  <p>There may be more Accounts than we have yet thought of, upon which <hi>Local motions</hi> may perform conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things, either without being much heeded, or without ſeeming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then faint, at leaſt in relation to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104480:7"/>
the conſiderableneſs of the Effects produced by them. And therefore I would not be underſtood in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive ſenſe, when in the following Diſcourſe I take notice but of a few of the above-mentioned Accounts; theſe ſeeming ſufficient, whereto, as to Heads, may be conveniently enough referred the Inſtances I allot to this Tract.</p>
                  <p>And concerning each of theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, I hold it requiſite to intimate in this place, that I mention it onely, as that whereon ſuch effects of Local motion, as I refer to it, do principally depend: for, otherwiſe, I am ſo far from denying, that I aſſert, that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers caſes there are more Cauſes than one, or perhaps than two of thoſe here treated of apart, that may notably concur to <hi>Phaenomena</hi> directly referred to but one or other of them.</p>
                  <p>To come then cloſer to our ſubject; I ſhall take notice, That among the ſeverall things, upon whoſe account men are wont to overlook or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104480:8"/>
the efficacy of Local motions, that are either Unheeded or thought Languid, the chief, or at leaſt thoſe that ſeem to me fitteſt to be treated of in this Paper, are thoſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to the following Obſervations.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WHat a rapid Motion may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Body to doe, may be judged by the powerfull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Effects of Bullets ſhot out of Cannons, in compariſon of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Engines of the Ancients, which, though I know not how many times bigger then the Bullets of whole Cannon, were not able to batter down Walls and Towers like Bullets, whoſe bulk compared with theirs is inconſiderable. Other examples
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104480:8"/>
of a like nature might be without impertinency alledged on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but, becauſe the latter part of our Propoſition contains that which I chiefly aim at, I ſhall proceed to Inſtances fit to prove That.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes cauſed a skilfull Turner to turn for me an oblong piece of Iron or Steel, and placing my naked hand at a convenient diſtance to receive the little fragments, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for the moſt part leſſer then ſmall pins heads, as they flew off from the rod, they were, as I expected, ſo intenſely heated by the quick action of the Tool upon them, that they ſeemed almoſt like ſo many ſparks of fire; ſo that I could not endure to continue my hand there. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that once asking an expert workman, whether he (as I had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done) did not find a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome heat in the little fragments of Braſs that were thrown off when that metall was turning? He told me, that heat was ſometimes very offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to his eyes and eye-lids. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104480:9"/>
when I asked, whether it was not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Duſt caſt into them, than from their Heat; he replied, that beſides the ſtroke, he could ſenſibly feel a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome heat, which would make even his Eye-lids ſore: And that ſometimes, when he employed a rough Tool, that took off ſomewhat greater Chips, he had found the heat ſo vehement, that not onely 'twould ſcorch his tender Eye-lids, but the thick and hard skin of his hands: for proof whereof he ſhewed me in one of his hands a little bliſter, that had been ſo raiſed, and was not yet quite gone off.</p>
                  <p>And inquiring about theſe matters of a famous Artiſt, imployed about the finiſhing up of caſt Ordnance, he confeſs'd to me, That, when with a ſtrong as well as peculiar Engine he and his aſſociates turned great Guns very ſwiftly, to bring the ſurface to a competent ſmoothneſs, the tools would ſometimes throw off bits of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of a conſiderable bigneſs, which, by reaſon of their bulk and their rapid motion, would be ſo heated as to burn
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104480:9"/>
the fingers of the Country-people that came to gaze on his work, when he, for merriment ſake, deſired them to take up ſome of thoſe pieces of metall from the ground. Which I thought the more remarkable, becauſe by the Contact and Coldneſs of the ground I could not but ſuppoſe their Heat to have been much allayed. Not to mention, that I learnt from an experienced Artificer, that in turning of Braſs the little fragments of that metall acquire an intenſer Heat than thoſe of Iron.</p>
                  <p>I remember alſo, that, to vary the Experiment mentioned juſt before this laſt, by making it with a bodie far leſs ſolid and heavy than Braſs or Iron, I cauſed an Artificer to turn very nimbly a piece of ordinary wood, and holding my hand not far off, the powder, that flew about upon the operation, ſtruck my hand in many places with that briskneſs, that I could but uneaſily endure the Heat which they produced where they hit. Which Heat whether it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated

from the little, but much heated, fragments to my hands, or produced there by the brisk percuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on my hand, or were the joint effect of both thoſe Cauſes; it will however be a good Inſtance of the power of <hi>Celerity</hi> even in very ſmall bodies, and that move but a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way.</p>
                  <p>'Tis conſiderable to our preſent purpoſe, that by an almoſt momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany percuſſion, and that made with no great force, the parts, even of a vegetable, may be not onely intenſely heated, but brought to an actuall Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; as we have ſeverall times tried, by ſtriking a good Cane (of that ſort which is fit for ſuch Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments) with a ſteel, or even with the back of a knife. For, upon this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſion, it would ſend forth ſparks of fire like a flint.</p>
                  <p>To the ſame purpoſe may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that, by but dextrouſly ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping good loaf-ſugar with a knife, there will be made ſo brisk an agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts, that ſtore of ſparks
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104480:10"/>
will be produced. But that is more conſiderable, which happens upon the colliſion of a flint and a ſteel: For, though Vitrification be by Chymiſts eſteemed the ultimate action of the fire, and though, to turn ſand or ſtones, though very finely poudered, into glaſs, 'tis uſually required that it be kept for divers hours in the intenſe fire of a glaſs-houſe; and though, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the glaſs-men complain, that they cannot bring flints or ſand to fuſion without the help of a good proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Borillia</hi> or ſome other fixed ſalt: yet both actuall Ignition and Vitrification are brought to paſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in a moment by the bare vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of that motion that is excited in the parts of a flint when it is ſtruck with a ſteel: For thoſe ſparks that then fly out, (as an Ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note place="margin">Mr. Hooke</note> has obſerved, and as I have often ſeen with a good Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope,) are uſually real and permanent parcels (for the moſt part globulous) ofſtone vitrified and ignited by the vehemence of the motion. And that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104480:11"/>
this vitrification may be of the ſtone itſelf, though ſteel be a metal of a far more fuſible nature then a flint, I am induced to think, becauſe I have tried, that not only flints with ſteel, but flints with flints, and more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pieces of Rock Cryſtal between themſelves, will by colliſion ſtrike fire. And the like effect of colliſion I have found my ſelf in ſome precious ſtones, harder than Cryſtall. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inquiring of an ingenious Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer that cuts Diamonds, Whether he had not obſerved the like, when Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds were grated on by the rapid motion of his mill? He replied, that he obſerved Diamonds to ſtrike fire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like Flints; which afterwards was confirmed to me by another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced cutter of Gems; and yet having made divers trials on Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds with fire, he would not allow that fire itſelf can bring them to fuſion.</p>
                  <p>Nor are fluid Bodies, though but of ſmall Dimenſions, to be altogether excluded from the power of making conſiderable impreſſions on ſolid
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104480:11"/>
bodies, if their celerity be great.</p>
                  <p>Whether the Sun-beams conſiſt, according to the Atomical Doctrine, of very minute Corpuſcles, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually iſſuing out of the body of the Sun, ſwiftly thruſt on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Phyſically-ſtraight Lines; or whether, as the <hi>Carteſians</hi> would have it, thoſe beams be made by the brisk action of the Luminary upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous fluid, and propagated every way in ſtraight lines through ſome Ethereal matter harboured in the pores of the Air; it will be agreeable to either <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, refracted or reflected by a burning-glaſs to a <hi>focus,</hi> do there, by their concourſe, compoſe a ſmall portion of fluid matter; and yet the <hi>Celerity,</hi> wherewith the ſoft and yielding ſubſtance is agitated, enables ſo few of them as can be circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by a Circle, not a quarter of an inch in Diameter, to ſet afire green wood in leſſe than a minute, and (perhaps in as little time as that) to melt not onely Tinn and Lead thinly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104480:12"/>
beaten, but, as I have tried, foliated Silver and Gold.</p>
                  <p>The operation of ſmall portions of fluid matter on ſolid bodies will be farther exemplified in the IV. <hi>Chapter,</hi> by the effects of the blown flame of a Lamp on glaſs and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls; ſo that I ſhall here need but to point in general at the wonderfull effects that <hi>Lightning</hi> has produced, as well by the Celerity of its motion, as by the matter whereof it conſiſts. Of which Effects, Hiſtories and the writings of Meteorologiſts afford good ſtore; and I have been an admiring obſerver of ſome of them, one of the laſt of which was the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of metal by the flame in its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which probably laſted but the twinckling of an Eye.</p>
                  <p>And even a ſmall parcel of Air, if put into a ſufficiently-brisk motion, may communicate a conſiderable motion to a ſolid body; whereof a notable Inſtance (which depends chiefly upon the Celerity of the ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy corpuſcles of the Air) is afforded
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104480:12"/>
by the violent motion communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a bullet ſhot out of a good wind-gun. For, when this Inſtrument is well charged, the ſtrongly-compreſt Air being ſet at liberty, and forcibly endeavouring to expand it ſelf to its wonted laxity, its corpuſcles give a multitude of impulſes to the bullet, all the while that it continues moving along the barrel, and by this means put it into ſo rapid a motion, that I found by trial, the bullet would in a moment be flatted, almoſt into the figure of a Hemiſphere, by being ſhot off againſt a metalline plate.</p>
                  <p>And farther to ſhew, How ſwift that motion muſt have been, and with what Celerity a vehement agitation may be communicated to the parts of a Solid body, I ſhall add here (though the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> might be referred to the V. <hi>Chapter,</hi>) that, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of the Bullet and the metalline plate laſted probably but a phyſical moment; yet the minute parts of the bullet were put into ſo various and brisk an agitation, that making haſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104480:13"/>
to take it up before it ſhould cool, I found it too hot to be with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much eaſe held between my fingers.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104480:13"/>
ſoftneſs of the air and the <hi>Effluvia</hi> that ſwim in it, have been ſometimes able to blow down not onely timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, but houſes and ſteeples, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firmeſt Structures. But the motions I intend to ſpeak of in this Chapter are ſuch, as we do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately either ſee or feel; and though theſe be exceeding rare, yet the operation of <hi>Sounds,</hi> even upon ſolid bodies, and that at a diſtance from the ſonorous ones, afford me ſome Inſtances to my preſent purpoſe, which I ſhall now proceed to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It has been frequently obſerved, that, upon the diſcharge of Ordnance and other great Guns, not onely the ſound may be diſtinctly heard a great way off; but that, to a good diſtance, the tremulous motion of the Air that produces ſound, without producing any ſenſible wind, has been able ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to ſhake, and ſometimes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to break, the glaſs-windows of houſes and other buildings, eſpecially when the windows ſtand in the way
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104480:14"/>
wherein the propagation of the ſound is directly made. 'Tis true, that theſe obſervations are moſt frequent, when the place, where the Artillery is placed, ſtands upon the ſame piece of ground with the Houſes whoſe windows are ſhaken; and ſo it may be ſuſpected, that the Shake is firſt communicated by the Cannon to the earth or floor on which they play, and is afterwards by that propagated through the intermediate parts of the ground to the foundations of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſo to the windows. And I readily grant, and may elſewhere ſhew, that a violent impulſe upon the ground may reach to a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than men uſually imagine: But in our preſent Caſe I ſee no neceſſity of having recourſe to any thing but the wave-like motion of the Air for the production of our Phaenomenon, ſince the like may be produced by Local Motion tranſmitted by Fluids, as may appear by the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>I was once invited by an Engineer,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104480:14"/>
to ſee triall made of a ſtrange Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had to ſink ſhips, though great ones, in a few minutes; and though an unlucky Accident kept me from arriving there 'till near a quarter of an hour after the triall had been made on an old fregat, with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſſe than my Philanthropy allowed me to wiſh; yet cauſing my ſelf to be rowed to the place, where the great veſſell was newly ſunk, the odneſs of the effect, which was performed upon the water by a ſmall Inſtrument outwardly applied, made me inquiſitive, what noiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion had been made: And I was informed partly by the Engineer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and partly by ſome acquaintances of mine, who among a great number of Spectators ſtood aloof off in ſhips and other veſſels lying at anchor, to ſee the event; that, upon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine's operating, the exploſion was ſo great, that it made a kind of ſtorm in the water round about, and did ſo rudely ſhake veſſels that lay at no inconſiderable diſtance, as to make
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104480:15"/>
thoſe that ſtood on them to ſtagger.</p>
                  <p>In the late great Sea-fight between the Engliſh Fleet commanded by his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Dutch Admiral <hi>Opdam,</hi> (who therein loſt the Victory and his Life,) though the Engagement were made very many Leagues from the <hi>Hague,</hi> yet the noiſe of the Guns not onely reached to that Place, but had a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect there; of which when I enquired of the Engliſh Embaſſadour that as yet reſided there, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to aſſure me, that it ſhook the windows of his Houſe ſo violently, that not knowing what the Cauſe was, he was ſurprized and much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed, apprehending, that ſome rude Fellows were about to break his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to affront him. And if there be a greater diſpoſition in ſome other bodies than there is in Glaſs-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to receive ſtrong impulſes from the Air agitated by Sounds, theſe may be ſenſibly, though not viſibly, wrought upon, and that at a good diſtance, by the noiſe of a ſingle
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104480:15"/>
piece of Ordnance; as may appear by that memorable Circumſtance of an odd Caſe about a Gangrene men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the experienced <hi>Simon Pauli</hi> in his ingenious Tract <hi>de Febribus malignis,</hi> pag. 71. <hi>Atqui aeger ille Gallus brachio truncatus, octiduum quidem ſuperfuit, ſed horrendis totius corporis convulſionibus correptus; qui quoque, (ut &amp; illa addam obſervatione dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſima,) dum in Domini ſui aedibus ad plateam Kiodmoggerianam, Romanè</hi> Laniorum <hi>appellares, decumberet, ac, me ac aliis aliquandiu ad Lectum illius conſidentibus quidem, ſed nobis non at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendentibus, exploderentur tormenta bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica ex Regiis ac Praetoriis navibus, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrâ truncum dextri brachii fovens ac complectens, toties quoties exploderen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ſingula exclamabat, Au, au, me mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerum! Jeſu, Maria, contundor penitús: adeò permoleſta &amp; intolerabilis illi erat Tormentorum exploſio, &amp; quidem ex loco ſatis longinquo, terrâ non firmâ aut contiguâ, verùm ſuper ſalo aut mari Balthico, inſtituta.</hi> By this it appears, that the Guns, whoſe diſcharge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104480:16"/>
theſe painfull motions in the Patient, reſted upon a floating body. And I remember, that an illuſtrious Commander of a very great Man of war, being asked by me, whether of the many wounded men, he had in his ſhip in a very long Sea-fight, none of them were affected by that noiſe of the Enemy's Cannon diſcharged in ſhips at a diſtance? He anſwered me, that ſome, whoſe bones were broken, would ſadly complain of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were put into by the ſhake they felt at the going off of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy's Cannon, though they were too much accuſtomed to the report of great Guns, to be, as 'twas a bare noiſe, offended by it. If after all this ti be ſurmized, that theſe motions were not conveyed by the air, but propagated by the water, (and, in ſome caſes, ſome part of the ſhoar) from the ſhips, where the Guns were fired, to the Houſes where the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were ſhaken, or the places where the wounded men lay: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that, if this could be made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104480:16"/>
it would accommodate me with very eminent Inſtances for the Chapter of the <hi>Propagable</hi> nature of Motion: And though it be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to find ſuch examples of ſhakes excited by ſounds as are not liable to the mentioned objection; becauſe the ſonorous bodies here below do all either ſtrike, or lean, upon ſuch groſs and viſible bodies as the Earth and Water; yet there is one kind of Sound, that muſt be confeſſed to be propagated by the Air, as being made in it; and that is <hi>Thunder,</hi> whoſe noiſe does ſometimes ſo vehemently affect the Air, though without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any ſenſible wind, that both others and I have obſerved it very ſenſibly to ſhake great and ſtrong Houſes, notwithſtanding the diſtance of the clouds where the noiſes were firſt produced. And I remember, that, having inquired of ſome Sea-Captains, that in ſtout veſſels ſailed to the <hi>Indies,</hi> whether they had nor in thoſe hot Regions obſerved their ſhips, though very much leſs tall then
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104480:17"/>
houſes, to be ſhaken by vehement Thunders? I perceived, that ſome of them had not much heeded any ſuch thing; but a couple of others told me, they had obſerved it in their ſhips; and one of them told me, that once, when the claps of thunder were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary great, ſome of them ſhook his ſhip ſo rudely as to make the unwonted motions diſorder his great Guns. All which I the leſs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, when calling to mind, what I have mention'd in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and elſewhere of the power of the Celerity of motion, I conſider, that there is no Celerity that we know of here below, that is near ſo great, as that wherewith a Sound is propagated through the air. For, whereas the diligent <hi>Merſennus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that a bullet ſhot out of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non or a Musket does not overpaſs two hundred and forty yards in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or ſixtieth part of a minute; I have more than once diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the motion of <hi>Sound</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes above four hundred yards in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104480:17"/>
ſame time of a Second here in <hi>England;</hi> which I therefore add, becauſe <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſennus</hi> relates, that in <hi>France</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a Sound to move in that time many yards more; which may poſſibly proceed from the differing conſiſtence of the Engliſh air and the French.</p>
                  <p>The great Loudneſs of theſe ſounds, and the vehement percuſſion that the Air receives in their formation, will probably make it be eaſily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that 'twas onely the Impetuoſity of the motion of the <hi>Medium,</hi> that gave the ſhake to the windows and other ſolid bodies that I have been mentioning to have been made to tremble by the report of Cannon or Thunder: But yet I will not on this occaſion conceal, that perhaps it may without abſurdity be ſuſpected, that Some of thoſe tremulous motions of ſolid bodies might either depend upon, or at leaſt be promoted by, ſome peculiar diſpoſition, that Glaſſe (which is endued with ſpringineſs,) and ſome other bodies that perhaps are not quite devoid of that Quality,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104480:18"/>
may have to be moved by certain congruous Sounds (if I may ſo call them) more than they would by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though perchance more loud. But though this ſurmize ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; yet it would not render the lately-recited Inſtances improper for the deſign of this Diſcourſe, but onely would make ſome of them fit to be referred to another <hi>Chapter;</hi> to which I ſhall advance, as ſoon as I ſhall have annexed an odd Obſervation of the experienced <hi>Platerus,</hi> which argues, that, where there is a peculiar Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, even in a firm body, it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive conſiderable impreſſions from ſo languid a motion (though in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood not peculiarly modified) of the air as is not ſenſible to other bodies of the ſame kind.</p>

                  <p>MOſt men, when they think at all of the <hi>effluvia</hi> of bodies and their motions, are wont to think of them as if they were but much finer ſorts of Duſt, (whoſe grains, by reaſon of their ſmalneſs, are inviſible,) which, by the various agitation of the Air, are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104480:19"/>
as 'twere by ſome faint wind blown againſt the ſurfaces of the bodies they chance to meet in their way, and that they are ſtopped in their progreſs without penetrating into the interior parts of the bodies they invade. And according to this Notion, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that men ſhould not fancy, that ſuch minute bodies paſſing, as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, no further than the ſurfaces of thoſe on which they operate, ſhould have but faint operations upon them.</p>
                  <p>But we may have other thoughts, if we well conſider, that the Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles we ſpeak of, are, by their minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, aſſiſted, and oftentimes by their figure inabled, to pierce into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt receſſes of the body they invade, and diſtribute themſelves to all, or at leaſt to multitudes of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute parts, whereof that body conſiſts. For this being granted, though we ſuppoſe each ſingle <hi>effluvium</hi> or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be very minute; yet, ſince we may ſuppoſe, even ſolid bodies to be made up of particles that are ſo too, and the number of invading particles
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104480:19"/>
to be not much inferior to that of the invaded ones, or at leaſt to be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly great, it need not ſeem incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a multitude of little Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles in motion (whoſe motion, may, for ought we know, be very ſwift) ſhould be able to have a conſiderable operation upon particles either qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcent, or that have a motion too ſlow to be perceptible by ſenſe. Which may perhaps be the better conceived by the help of this groſs example:</p>
                  <p>If you turn an Ant-hill well ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with Ants-eggs, upſide down, you may ſometimes ſee ſuch a heap of eggs mingled with the looſe earth, as a few of thoſe Inſects, if they were yoaked together, would not be able at once to draw after them; but if good numbers of them diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and range up and down, and each lay hold of her own egge, and hurry it away, 'tis ſomewhat ſurprizing to ſee (as I have with pleaſure done) how quickly the heap of eggs will be diſplaced, when almoſt every little egge has
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104480:20"/>
one of thoſe little Inſects to deal with it.</p>
                  <p>And in thoſe caſes, wherein the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading Fluid does not quite disjoin and carry off any great number of the parts of the body it invades, its operation may be illuſtrated by that of the wind upon a tree in <hi>Autumn:</hi> for, it finds or makes it ſelf multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of paſſages, for the moſt part crooked, not onely between the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and twigs, but the leaves and fruits, and in its paſſing from the one ſide to the other of the tree, it does not onely variouſly bend the more flexible boughs and twigs, and perhaps make them grate upon one another, but it breaks off ſome of the ſtalks of the fruit, and makes them fall to the ground, and withall carries off divers of the leaves, that grew the leaſt firmly on, and in its paſſage does by its differing parts act upon a multitude of leaves all at once, and variouſly alters their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</p>
                  <p>But to come to cloſer Inſtances:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104480:20"/>
ſuppoſe we caſt two lumps, the one of Sugar, the other of Amber, into a glaſs of beer or water, they will both fall preſently to the bottom. And though perhaps the Amber may be lighter than the Sugar, (for, I have found a notable difference in the ſpecific gravity of pieces of Amber,) yet the aqueous particles are far from being able to diſplace the Amber or any ſenſible part of it, or exerciſe any viſible operation upon it: But the ſame minute particles of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor being of a figure that fits them to inſinuate themſelves every way into the pores of the Sugar, though the lump conſiſted of very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Saccharine Corpuſcles, yet the multitude of the aqueous particles, to which they are acceſſible, is able in no long time to diſperſe them all, and carrying them along with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, make the whole lump of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in a ſhort time quite diſappear.</p>
                  <p>The point above diſcourſed of, may be more nimbly exemplified in ſome Chymical operations, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

If, by a due degree of fire, you abſtract from running Mercury four or five times its weight of good Oil of Vitriol, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at the bottom a dry and brittle ſubſtance exceeding white; and, if upon this Heap of Mercurial and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line bodies, which ſometimes may be coherent enough, you pour a good quantity of limpid water, and ſhake them together, you may ſee in a trice the multitude of little white grains, that make up the maſſe, pervaded, and manifeſtly altered, by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed Corpuſcles of the water; as will plainly appear by the change of the <hi>Calx</hi> or <hi>Precipitate</hi> from a white maſſe into one of a fine Limon-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                  <p>But to give inſtances in Fluid bodies, (which I ſuppoſe you will think far the more difficult part of my task,) though you will eaſily grant, that the flame of Spirit of wine, that will burn all away is but a viſible ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of ſuch <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The power of extreamly-minute parts of a fluid body, even when but in a moderate number they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to conſpire to the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, may be eſtimated by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104480:22"/>
motions of Animals, eſpecially of the larger and more bulky ſorts, as Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Bulls, Rhinocerots and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. For, though the animal ſpirits be minute enough to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and to flow through ſuch tender paſſages, that prying Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have not been able in diſſected Nerves to diſcern ſo much as the channels through which they paſs; yet thoſe Inviſible Spirits, conveyed (or impelled) from the Brain to the Nerves, ſerve to move in various manners the Lims, and even the unwieldy bodies themſelves of the greateſt Animals, and to carry them on in a progreſſive motion for many hours together, and perhaps enable them to ſpring into the Air, and move through it by leaping; though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of theſe Animals weigh many hundred, and others ſeveral thouſand of pounds.</p>
                  <p>I will not here conſider, whether the following Experiment may at all illuſtrate Motions that are produced by the fluid parts of Animals in ſome
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104480:22"/>
of the conſiſtent ones: But I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, it may confirm the Obſervation maintained in this Chapter, if I add, what I have tried of the conſiderable force of a number of aqueous particles, as flexible and as languid as they are thought to be, inſinuating themſelves into the pores or Intervals of a rope that was not thick. For in moiſt weather I ſometimes obſerved, that the aqueous and other humid parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſwimming in the air, entering the pores of the hemp in great numbers, were able to make it ſhrink, though a weight of fifty, ſixty, or even more pounds of lead were tied at the end to hinder its contraction, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the weights viſibly being raiſed in wet weather above the place it reſted at in dry.</p>
                  <p>But to return to what I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpeaking of the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the motion of Fluids; I ſhall, on this occaſion, obſerve, that, though the wind or breath, that is blown out at a ſmall crooked pipe of metal or glaſs, ſuch as Tradesmen for its
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104480:23"/>
uſe call a Blow-pipe, ſeems not to have any great celerity, eſpecially in compariſon of that of the parts of flame; and is it ſelf of little force; yet, when by this wind the flame of a Lamp or Candle is directed ſo as to beat with its point upon a body held at a convenient diſtance from the ſide of the flame, the burning fluid, determined, and perhaps excited by this wind, acquires ſo great a force, that, as we have often tried, it may be made, in a few minutes, to melt not onely the more fuſible Metals, but ſilver, or even copper it ſelf; which yet may be kept for many hours unmelted in a Crucible kept red-hot, or even in the flame of the Lamp or Candle, unaſſiſted by the blaſt.</p>
                  <p>And if we can ſo contrive it, that a flame does not come to invade onely the ſurface that inveſts a body, but comes to be intermingled with the ſmaller (though not the ſmalleſt) parts it conſiſts of, as with its filings or its powder; the flame will then have a far more quick and powerfull
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104480:23"/>
operation than the body expoſed to it. This I exemplify (in other Papers) and in this place it may ſuffice to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, whereas a pound or two of Tartar may coſt you ſome hours to calcine it to whiteneſs, if the flame have immediate acceſs onely to the outward parts; you may calcine it in a very ſmall part of that time, if, mixing with its groſs powder an equal weight of good Salt-peter, you fire the mixture, and keep it ſtirring, that the parts of the kindled Nitre may have acceſs at once to very many parts of the Tartar, and have opportunity to calcine them. And by ſomewhat a like artifice, I elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where teach, how Nitre it ſelf may without Tartar be ſpeedily reduced to a <hi>Calcinatum,</hi> not unlike that newly mentioned. But it may be ſaid, that ſome of the foregoing Inſtances (for it cannot be truly ſaid of all) may indeed illuſtrate what we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of, but will not reach home to our purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore conſider the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104480:24"/>
                     <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> which you acknowledge to act by the emiſſion of Inſenſible particles. For, though Iron and Steel be ſolid and ponderous bodies, and Magnetical <hi>effluvia</hi> be corpuſcles ſo very minute, that they readily get in at the pores of all kind of bodies, and even of Glaſs it ſelf; yet theſe Magnetical <hi>effluvia,</hi> entring the ſteel in ſwarms, do in a trice pervade it, and a multitude even of Them, acting upon the Corpuſcles of the metal, do operate ſo violently on them, that, if the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> be vigorous enough, and well capped, it will attract a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table proportion of ſteel, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the gravity of that ſolid metal, which I have found to exceed, when the ſtone has been very good and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, above fifty times the weight of the Magnet by whoſe <hi>effluvia</hi> it was ſupported: For, to theſe I rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Magnetical attraction and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, than to the impulſe or preſſure of the ambient air, to which many Corpuſcularians have recourſe; becauſe I have found by trial (which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104480:24"/>
I elſewhere relate) that the preſſure of the ambient air is not abſolutely neceſſary to Magnetical operations.</p>
                  <p>I remember, that, to help ſome friends to conceive, how ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly-minute particles as Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>effluvia,</hi> may, by pervading a hard and ſolid body, ſuch as Iron, put its inſenſible Corpuſcles into motion, and thereby range them in a new manner, I took filings of Steel or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron freſhly made, that the Magnetical virtue might not be diminiſhed by any ruſt, and having laid them in a little heap upon a piece of paper held level, I applied to the lower ſide of the paper, juſt beneath the Heap, the pole of a vigorous Load-ſtone, whoſe Emiſſions traverſing the paper, and diffuſing themſelves through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent metall, did in a trice mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly alter the appearance of the Heap; and, though each of the filings might probably contain a multitude of ſuch ſmall Martiall Corpuſcles as Steel may be divided into by Oil of Vitriol or Spirit of Salt; yet the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104480:25"/>
                     <hi>effluvia,</hi> immediately perva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our metalline heap, did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a good part of the filings that compoſed it, as to produce many erected aggregates, each of which conſiſted of ſeveral filings placed one above another, and appearing like little needles, or rather like the ends of needles broken off at ſome diſtance from the point. And as theſe little temporary needles ſtood all of them erected (though more or leſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their diſtance from the Pole of the Magnet) upon the flat paper; ſo they would, without loſing their figure or connexion, be made as it were to run to and fro upon the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, according as the Load-ſtone, that was held underneath it, was moved this way and that way; and as ſoon as that was taken quite away, all this little ſtand of pikes (if I may ſo call it) would (almoſt in the twinkling of an eye) relapſe into a confuſed heap of filings.</p>
                  <p>There are two ways of explicating the turning of Water into Ice; one
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104480:25"/>
or other of which is approved almoſt by all the Corpuſcularian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. The firſt is that of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſians,</hi> who give an account of Glaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by the receſſe of the leſs ſubtile particles of the Etherial matter, without which the finer parts were too ſmall and feeble to keep the Eel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like particles of water flexible, and in the form of a liquour. The <hi>Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> on the other ſide aſcribe the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of water to the ingreſs of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>frigorifick</hi> Corpuſcles, as they call them, which, entering the water in ſwarms, and diſperſing themſelves through it, crowd into the pores, and hinder the wonted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its parts, wedging themſelves (if I may ſo ſpeak) together with them into a compact body. But which ſoever of theſe two <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> be pitched upon, the Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non it ſelf will afford me a notable Inſtance to my preſent purpoſe. For, the Particles of water, and much more the Corpuſcles of cold, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be ſingly too ſmall to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104480:26"/>
viſible, and their motions are not ſaid to be ſwift, but may rather be judged to be ſlow enough; and yet thoſe minute aqueous, or more minute fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorifick particles, becauſe of their number, produce in the glaciation of the liquour ſo forcible a motion outwards, as to make it break bottles, not onely of glaſs and earth ſtrongly baked, but, as I have ſeveral times tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of metal it ſelf, that being full of the liquour were firmly ſtopped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſupervening of the Cold. And the expanſive endeavour of freezing water is not onely capable of doing this, but of performing ſo much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, which I elſewhere relate, that my trials have made me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doubt, whether we know any thing in nature, except kindled Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, that bulk for bulk moves more forcibly, though the motion ſeems to be very ſlow.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſervat. IV.</hi> Men are not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aware, how propagable Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, even through differing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, and Solid bodies.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere are four principal Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on which I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that men are wont to think the Communicating of Motion much more difficult than indeed it is.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> there are many, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving how uſually thoſe bodies that hit againſt hard ones rebound from them, eaſily perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that Motion can ſcarce be tranſmitted or diffuſed through Solid bodies. But though it be true, that oftentimes in ſuch caſes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive motion of the body or the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104480:27"/>
Solid, that is ſtruck or impelled, be either inconſiderable, or, perhaps, not ſo much as ſenſible; yet the impulſe may make a conſiderable impreſſion, and may be communicated to a great ſhare of the particles of that matter, whereof the ſolid maſs conſiſts; as we ſee in the ſtriking of a timber-beam at one end, the motion, though perhaps it were not ſtrong at the firſt, may become ſenſible at the other. Though Bell-metal be ſo hard a body, that it is reckoned harder than iron it-ſelf, inſomuch that oftentimes it reſiſts even files of Steel, which readily work on Iron; yet this ſolidity hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not but that, as I have found, conveniently ſhaped veſſels of Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metal, though thick, will be ſenſibly affected by a motion that neither is ſtrong, nor touches them in more than a ſhort line, or perhaps than a Phyſical point. The truth of this I have found by trial on more than one ſuch veſſels and particularly on one that was hemiſphaerical, which being placed or held in a convenient
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104480:27"/>
poſture, if I did but gently paſs the point of a pin for a little way along the brim of it, it would ſenſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, and that (to a very attentive ear) ſo long, and in ſuch a ringing manner, as made it highly probable, that the parts, immediately touched (and not ſo much as ſcratched) by the point of a pin, were not onely put into a vibrating motion themſelves, but were enabled to communicate it to thoſe that were next them, and they to thoſe that were contiguous to them; and ſo the tremulous motion was propagated quite round the bell, and made divers ſucceſſive Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before it quite ceaſed to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. And if, in ſtead of drawing a Line on the brim of the veſſel, I ſtruck it, though but faintly, with the point of a pin, though the part immediately touched would be but a phyſical point, yet the motion would be, like the former, propagated ſeveral times quite round; as was argued by the ringing and duration of the produced ſound, though this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104480:28"/>
metalline veſſel were ſeven inches in Diameter, and of a conſiderable thickneſs. Nor was a ſolidity like that of Braſs requiſite to produce theſe effects. For I found them to inſue much after the ſame manner, when I employed onely a ſhort and ſlender thread of Glaſs, which though little, if at all, thicker than a pin, was yet hollow quite through. Now if it be true, as 'tis highly probable, that Sound, as it belongs to the air, conſiſts in an undulating motion of the Air, and ſo in our caſe requires a vibrating motion in the ſonorous body to impart that motion to the Air; we muſt grant in our Inſtances a wonderfull propagableneſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even when 'tis not violent, in Solid bodies themſelves; ſince the point of a pin, gently ſtriking a part, no bigger than it ſelf, of a maſs of very ſolid metal, could thereby communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a ſenſible motion, and that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times circulated, to millions of parts equall to it in bulk, and much exceeding it in hardneſs. And ſince
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104480:28"/>
the effect was more conſiderable, when the trial was made in a much greater, than in a ſmaller veſſel; 'tis probable, that, if I had had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of experimenting on a large and well-hung Bell, the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> would have been more notable; as it alſo ſeemed to be on our veſſel, if, in ſtead of ſtriking it with the point of a pin, we caſt, though but faintly, againſt the lower part of it a grain of ſhot, leſs than a ſmall pins-head, or let a little grain fall, from about one foot high, upon the inſide of the inverted Hemiſphere. And to ſhew, that even ſoft and yielding bodies, and but faintly moved, are not to be excluded from a power of putting ſuch hard ones into motion; I ſhall add, that I found almoſt the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to thoſe above mentioned, by paſſing the pulp of my finger a little way along the lower part of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Nay, that fluid bodies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may communicate ſuch an inteſtine and propagable motion, to harden ſolid ones, I may have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104480:29"/>
an occaſion to ſhew by the effects of a ſmall Flame, and the Sun-beams on glaſs and ſteel. And I ſhall here on this occaſion add this word about the Propagation of Motion produced in ſolid bodies by heat, that it much depends upon the particular Textures of the bodies. For I found, that when I heated a piece of glaſs or of a fire-ſtone, I could without inconvenience hold my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hand upon parts that were very near (ſuppoſe within an inch off) the ignited portions of them. But, if we take a rod of Iron, for inſtance, and heat one end red-hot, the heat of that end will be ſo propagated towards the other, that it will offend one's hand at ſeveral times the diſtance, at which one might conveniently hold the rod, if it were of glaſs.</p>
                  <p>In many buildings it may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (and is thought a ſign of the firm Coheſion of their parts,) that a ſtamp of one's foot, nay or bare treading, or ſome ſuch other leſſe brisk impulſe, made in one room,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104480:29"/>
will have a ſenſible effect in all or moſt of the others. And it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that, by the haſty ſhutting of a door, the whole houſe is made to tremble; whence we may argue, that, even among ſolid bodies, motion made in one place may be readily propagated to many others: And if, as to the latter of the Inſtances, the ſudden impulſe and compreſſion of the Air, made by the door ſuppoſed to be haſtily ſhut, have any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhare in the effect, the Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non will ſerve to ſhew the efficacy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of ſuch a motion of a fluid body, as we cannot directly feel upon divers large and firmly connected ſolid bodies.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Earthquakes</hi> the tremulous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſometimes extends ſo very far, that, though it ſeems highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the ſhake that is given to one part of the Earth by the firing and exploſion of ſubterraneal exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, (if that be the true and onely cauſe of Earthquakes) is not capable of reaching near ſo far as divers
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104480:30"/>
Earthquakes have done, but that the fire paſſes through ſome little ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal clefts, or channels, or hidden conveyances, from one great Cavity or Mine to another; yet 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable but that the vehemently tremulous motion does oftentimes reach a very great way beyond the places where the exploſions were made. Since, though <hi>Seneca</hi> would confine the extent of<note place="margin">Natur. Quaeſt. Lib. VI. Cap. 25.</note> Earthquakes to two hundred miles, yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations made in this and the laſt Century warrant us to allow them a far greater ſpread. The Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">Lib. III. Cap. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Joſephus Acoſta</hi> affirms, that in the Kingdom of <hi>Peru</hi> in the year 1586 an Earthquake reached along the ſhoar of the Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick ſea 160 Leagues; and adds, that ſometimes it has in thoſe parts run on from South to North 300 Leagues. And in the beginning of this our age (<hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1601) good writers relate a much larger Earthquake to have happened, ſince it reached from
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104480:30"/>
                     <hi>Aſia</hi> to that Sea that waſhes the <hi>French</hi> Shoars, and, beſides ſome <hi>Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick</hi> Regions, ſhook <hi>Hungary, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a great part of <hi>Europe.</hi> And if that part of the Narrative be certain, which relates, that this laſted not much above a quarter of an hour, it will be the more likely, that this Earthquake ſhook great Tracts of Land beyond thoſe places, to which the fired matter, paſſing from one cavity to another, could reach in ſo ſhort a time: As you will the more eaſily gueſſe, if you try, as I have done, that in trains of Gunpowder it ſelf the fire does not run on near ſo ſwiftly as one would imagine. But though I have been in more Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes then one; yet, ſince they were too ſudden and too ſhort to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me any conſiderable obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall ſay no more of them; but proceed to take notice, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the motion of a Coach or Cart, that paſſed at a good diſtance from the place that I was in, has made the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104480:31"/>
buildings ſo ſenſibly ſhake, that I could not but wonder, that ſo great a portion of ſo firm and ſluggiſh a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as the Earth, could, by a cauſe that ſeemed very diſproportionate to ſuch an effect, be made to tremble it ſelf, and manifeſtly to ſhake firm buildings that were founded on it. And this obſervation made me the more inclinable to give credit to their Relations, who tell us, that in a calm night, the march of a troup of horſe may be felt, by attentive Scouts watching at a great diſtance off, by the ſhake that the ground receives from the trampling of the horſes; though I formerly ſuſpected much, and do yet a little, that the impulſe of the air conveyed along the reſiſting ſurface of the ground, might mainly contribute to the effect that is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed onely to the motion of the ſoil.</p>
                  <p>Before I advance to the <hi>Second</hi> Member of this Chapter, it may not be impertinent to note, that in peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly diſpoſed bodies, and eſpecially in Organical ones, a very <hi>languid</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:104480:31"/>
motion may have a far greater effect, than it could produce by a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of it ſelf. For it may ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the motion of the Spirits or other active parts of the body it works on, as to make multitudes of them act as if they conſpired to perform the ſame motions. As when a tickliſh man, by having the pulp of one's finger paſſed gently along the ſole of his foot or the palm of his hand, has divers muſcles and other parts of his body and face put into preternatural or unuſual motions. And moſt men by being lightly tickled with the end of a feather or ſtraw, within their Noſtrils, have their heads and many parts of their bodies put into that violent Commotion, wherein <hi>Sneezing</hi> conſiſts. And I remember, that having for ſome time been, by a diſtemper, (from which God was graciouſly pleaſed a while after to free me,) quite deprived of the uſe of my hands; it more than once hapned to me, that ſitting alone in a Coach, if the wind chanced to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104480:32"/>
blow a ſingle hair upon my face in the Summer-time, the tickling or itching, that it produced, was ſo uneaſy to me, 'till by calling out to a footman I could get it removed, that, though I could well bear it as long as I was wont to do, when, having the uſe of my hands, I could relieve my ſelf at pleaſure; yet if I were forced to endure the itching too long, before any came to ſuccour me, the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was ſo great, as to make me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend falling preſently either into Convulſions or a Swoon. But 'tis time to proceed to the <hi>ſecond</hi> Member of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>2. Others there are, that cannot believe, that Local motion, eſpecially if it be <hi>languid,</hi> can be propagated through differing Mediums, each of which, ſave that wherein the Motion is begun, muſt, they think, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, or check and dead it. To theſe I ſhall recommend the Conſideration of an Experiment, I remember I made before ſome Learned men in our Pneumatick Engine. For, having
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104480:32"/>
cauſed a large and thick glaſs Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be ſo blown, that it had a glaſs button in the inſide of that part which upon the Engine was to be placed upwards; I cauſed a Watch to be ſuſpended by a little Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chain faſtned to that button by as ſlender and ſoft a body, as I thought would be ſtrong enough to ſupport my watch; and then, the Glaſs being cemented on cloſe to the Receiver, to prevent a Commerce between the Cavity of it and the Air, the watch, that hung freely near the middle of the Cavity of the Receiver, made it ſelf to be heard by thoſe attentive Liſtners, that would hold their ears directly over the ſuſpended watch, whoſe motions were thereby argued to have been propagated, either through the included air, or along the ſtring to the concave part of the Glaſs, and through the whole thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Glaſs to the convex part, and thence, through the interpoſed air to the Ear. And this mention of watches minds me of what I often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104480:33"/>
in a ſmall ſtriking watch, that I have worn in my pocket. For, when it ſtruck the Hours, and in ſome poſtures when the balance did but move, I could plainly feel the brisker motions of the Bell, and ſenſibly the languid ones of the balance, through the ſeveral linings of my Breeches, and ſome other interpoſed ſoft and yielding bodies; and this, though the watch (as I ſaid) was ſmall, and the balance included in a double caſe, and though the outwardmoſt were of (what they call) Chagrine, and the innermoſt of Gold; which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention, becauſe that cloſeſt of metals is obſerved more to dead ſounds and motions than harder me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as Silver, Copper, and Iron.</p>
                  <p>That Motion may be propagated through differing Mediums, may ſeem the more probable by the ſhakings that are often felt by men lying on beds that ſtand in rooms cloſe ſhut, when loud claps of thunder are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced (perhaps at a great diſtance off) in the clouds. And whether it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104480:33"/>
will be fit to add to this Inſtance that which you have lately met with in the III. Chapter of a wounded Frenchman at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> I leave you to conſider.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether it will be very proper to take notice on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an odd <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> recited by the experienced <hi>Agricola</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De nat. eorum quae effi. è Terra Lib. IV. Cap. 7.</note> in theſe words. <hi>Si animal dejicitur in antrum Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgenſe, quod eſt in Carelia, Regione Scandiae, erumpit, ut perhibent, ſonus intolerabilis magno cum flatu: Si leve pondus in ſpecum Dalmatiae, quamvis, inquit Plinius, tranquillo die, turbini ſimilis emicat procella.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. As thoſe of whom I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at the beginning of this Chapter, are backward to allow, that Motion may be conſiderably propagated through <hi>ſolid</hi> bodies; ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there are others that are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to think, that 'tis near ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagable as indeed it is through <hi>fluid</hi> bodies; becauſe they preſume, that the eaſy ceſſion of the parts of fluids
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104480:34"/>
will dead the impulſe received by thoſe of them that are firſt acted on by the impelling body. And</p>
                  <p>4. There is yet another ſort of Naturaliſts, who, though they may be brought to grant, that Motion may by propagated even through a ſoft and yielding Medium, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it ſhould through ſuch a Medium be propagated to any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable diſtance; being perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this opinion by obſerving, that, though a body ſomewhat broad as well as ſolid, as the Palm of one's hand or a battledore, be moved through the Air ſwiftly enough to make a wind; yet that wind will not be ſtrong enough to be felt any more than a very little way off. Wherefore, becauſe the Inſtances, to which I aſſign the remaining part of this Chapter, may be for the moſt part applicable to the removal of both theſe prejudices; It may for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake be expedient to conſider them both together.</p>
                  <p>If Luminous bodies act on our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104480:34"/>
Eyes, not by a ſubſtantial diffuſion of extreamly minute particles, as the <hi>Atomiſts</hi> would have it, but by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated Pulſion of ſome Subtile mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contiguous to the ſhining body, (as the <hi>Carteſians</hi> and many other Philoſophers maintain;) 'twill be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that a body leſs than a ſmall pin's head may give a brisk motion to a portion of fluid matter many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of times greater than it ſelf; ſince in a dark night a ſingle ſpark of fire may be ſeen in differing places, whoſe diſtance from it exceeds ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand times the ſpark's <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</hi> Not to mention the great remove, at which the flame of a ſmall taper may not onely be ſeen, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear greater than near at hand. And if we compare the <hi>Diameter</hi> of that bright Planet <hi>Venus,</hi> which yet ſhines but with a borrowed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected Light, with its <hi>diſtance</hi> from the Earth, we may eaſily conclude, that the fixed Stars, which probably are ſo many Suns that ſhine by their own native Light, muſt impell a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104480:35"/>
proportion of Etherial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be able at that immenſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to make ſuch vivid Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they do, upon our Eyes. But to deſcend to Inſtances leſs remote and diſputable, I ſhall, in order to the removal of the two lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned prejudices, proceed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; that, though it be true, that Fluid bodies do eaſily yield to Solid ones that impell them, and thereby oftentimes quickly dead the motion of thoſe Solids; yet the motion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt onely in regard of the ſolid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is not loſt, but tranſmitted and diffuſed in reference to the fluid. As when a log of wood, or any ſuch body ſpecifically lighter than water, is let fall in the middle of a pond, though its progreſs downwards be checkt, and it be brought to reſt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly on the ſurface of the water; yet its motion is not loſt, but communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the parts of the water it firſt ſtrikes againſt, and by thoſe to others, 'till at length the curls or waves produced on the ſurface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104480:35"/>
ſpread themſelves, till they arrive at the brinks, and would perhaps be farther expanded, if theſe did not hinder their progreſs. From which inſtance we may learn, that, though the nature of fluid bodies, as ſuch, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that their parts be actually diſtinct and ſeparately moved; yet the particular Corpuſcles that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, being (at leaſt here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) touched by divers others, the new motion that is produced in ſome of them by an impellent Solid, muſt needs make them impell the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Corpuſcles, and theſe thoſe that chance to lie next to them, and ſo the impulſe may be propagated to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; which you will the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe may be great, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with me, both that in a fluid body the Corpuſcles, being already in the various motion requiſite to fluidity, yield more eaſily to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellent, and alſo that being fully, or very near it, counterpoiſed by others of the ſame fluid, a ſcarce imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly little force may ſuffice to impell
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104480:36"/>
them; inſomuch that, though the braſs Scale of a balance, of divers inches in Diameter, may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to outweigh many myriads of ſuch particles as compoſe water, wine, &amp;c. yet, (as I elſewhere more fully relate) when ſuch a ſcale was duly counterpoiſed with another like it, I could eaſily put it into various motions onely with the inviſible <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia</hi> of no great piece of Amber. And if we conſider that obvious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſwelling Circles made by caſting a ſtone into a Pond or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtagnant water, we ſhall be the more eaſily perſwaded, that, even in a heavy fluid, a motion may reach a far greater way, than men are uſually aware of, beyond the parts on which it was firſt impreſt.</p>
                  <p>On this occaſion I muſt not omit a ſtrange Obſervation given me by a very experienced Navigator, that much frequents the Coaſt of <hi>Groen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other <hi>Arctick</hi> Regions, to fiſh for whales. For this perſon being diſcourſed with by me about the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104480:36"/>
of the breaking of thoſe vaſt piles of Ice, that are to be met with in thoſe parts, aſſured me, that not onely he had often heard the Ice make in breaking terribler noiſe than the loudeſt claps of thunder with us, but that ſometimes, when the Sea-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had, as it were, undermined the foundation of the mountainous piece of Ice, he has known it at length ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fall into the ſubjacent Sea with ſo much violence as to make a ſtorm at a great diſtance off; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that once, when he lay two Leagues off of the place where this ſtupendious maſs of Ice fell, it made the waves goe ſo high as to waſh clear over the ſtern of the ſhip, with danger enough to ſome of his men, and to ſink ſeveral of his ſhallops that were riding by, though ſcarce any ſmall veſſels in the world uſe to be ſo fitted for rough Seas as thoſe about <hi>Groenland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas, though the Air be a much thinner fluid, we are apt to think it indiſpoſed to propagate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104480:37"/>
far, give me leave to tell you, that we may take wrong meaſures, if we think, that, (for inſtance) the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulating motion, into which the Air is put by the action of ſonorous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, reaches but a little way, as we are apt to preſume it does, becauſe we judge of it by the effect it has on our ears when the ſound is made in diſadvantageous places. For one, that, for inſtance, hears a Lute or a Viol plaid on in a room furniſhed with hangings, will be apt to think the ſound faint and languid in compariſon of what it would appear to him, if the ſame Inſtrument were plaid on after the ſame manner in an arched room without hangings; theſe ſoft and yielding bodies being apt to dead the ſound, which the figure and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Vaulted room would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect. And ſo, when a man ſpeaks aloud in the free Air, we are not wont to take any notice of a progreſs made by the motion of the Air beyond the place we are in, when our ears receive the ſound; but if the place happen
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104480:37"/>
to be furniſhed with an <hi>Echo,</hi> though at many times that diſtance from the ſpeaker, we may then eaſily take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the motion of the Air was carried on, and that with good vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, to a far greater diſtance than elſe we ſhould have obſerved. And I have often thought, that, even by the better ſort of our Echoing places, we are not informed, to near how great a ſphere the motion, which the Air is put into by Sounds, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf, where its diffuſion and vigour are not hindred nor weakned by bodies either placed too near, or indiſpoſed to promote its operation.</p>
                  <p>What has been lately ſaid of the great diffuſion of Sounds, if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be loud and great, will appear highly probable, by what is related by the Learned <hi>Fromundus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">From. Meteor, Lib. II. Art. 9.</note> who being Profeſſour of Philoſophy at <hi>Lovain,</hi> in the Year 1627, had opportunity enough to know the Truth of what he relates; namely that, at the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Siege of <hi>Oſtend</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104480:38"/>
thunder of the great Ordnance was heard at above thirty Dutch Leagues, which, according to the vulgar rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, amounts to a hundred and twenty of our Engliſh miles. And that is yet, as he truly obſerves, more ſtrange, and makes more for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, which he adds concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the diffuſion of the ſound of a Drum, which, he ſays, was, upon a time, heard at Sea twelve Leagues off.</p>
                  <p>But to return to what I was ſaying of <hi>Echo's,</hi> to confirm my conjecture about them, I ſhall think it needleſſe to offer you any other Argument, than that which you will draw your ſelf from the Notable Relation I met with in the Learned <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renius</hi>

                  <p>IN this Obſervation I expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>the diſpoſed bodies of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> to intimate, that there is a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar aptitude required in thoſe Animals, or ſome particular parts of them that are to be ſenſibly affected by ſuch motions as we are treating of, which would otherwiſe be too languid to have any ſenſible operation on them.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems the leſs ſtrange to me, that continuing Sounds, and other ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what durable Impulſes of the Air or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fluids, ſhould have a manifeſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon Solid bodies, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104480:39"/>
the multitude of ſtrokes that may in a very ſhort and perhaps ſcarce ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable time, be ſuppoſed to be given by the parts of the fluid to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent body. For, though each of theſe ſingle would perhaps be too languid to have any ſenſible effect at all; it being opportunely and frequently repeated by the ſucceſſive parts of the fluid, as by ſo many little ſwimming hammers or flying bullets, they may well have a notable effect upon the parts of a body expoſed to their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: As may be argued from the great ſwing that may be given to Pendulums by a very languid force, if it ſucceſſively ſtrike the ſwinging body, when having finiſhed its excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, 'tis ready to return towards the Perpendicular; as alſo from the tremulous motion that is imparted even to the metalline ſtring of a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtrument, by the congruous motion the Air is put into by another trembling ſtring, (as there may be hereafter occaſion to declare.)</p>
                  <p>I remember, <hi>Scaliger</hi> tells a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104480:40"/>
ſtory of a Knight of <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> whom the ſound of a Bagpipe would force preſently to make water; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that a Perſon diſobliged by this man, and reſolving to be merrily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on him, watched a time when he ſate at a Feaſt ſo as he could not well get out, and brought a Bagpiper to play unawares behind him; which he did ſo unluckily, that the Muſick had preſently its wonted effect upon the poor Knight, to his great Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the laughter of the Company. On which occaſion I ſhall add, that I know a very Ingenious Gentleman, who has confeſſed to me, that the noiſe of a running Tap is wont to have almoſt the like operation upon Him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a common Obſervation, that the noiſe that an ungreaſed cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel makes in grating againſt the axel-tree, and the ſcraping of a knife upon a plate of ſilver or pewter, and ſome other ſuch brisk and acute Sounds, do ſo affect divers parts of the Head, as to produce that effect
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104480:40"/>
that is commonly called <hi>ſetting the Teeth on edge;</hi> which whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any commerce between the Auditory Nerves, and thoſe that are inſervient to the motion we have mentioned, I leave Anatomiſts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. But theſe effects of acute ſounds are much leſs conſiderable than that which I elſewhere relate of an Ingenious Domeſtick of mine, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times complained, that the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of brown paper made his Gums bleed: which argued that the ſound had an operation not onely upon the nervous and membranous parts, but the bloud and Humours themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Blunt,</hi> in his voiage to the <hi>Levant,</hi> giving an account of what he obſerved in <hi>Egypt,</hi> has, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remarkable things, this paſſage: Many rarities of Living creatures I ſaw in <hi>Gran Cairo,</hi> but the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious was a neſt of four-legged Serpents of two foot long, black and ugly, kept by a Frenchman, who when he came to handle them, they would not endure him, but ran and hid
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104480:41"/>
in their hole; then would he take his Cittern and play upon it: They, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Muſick, came all crawling to his feet, and began to climbe up him, till he gave over playing, then away they ran.</p>
                  <p>This recalls to my mind, what ſome men of repute, and particularly the Learned <hi>Kircherus,</hi> relate concerning a great Fiſh, in or about the Streights that ſever <hi>Sicily</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> which is ſaid to be much affected with a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar kind of Tune, (harſh enough to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ears) by which the Mariners are wont to allure it to follow their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. And it may much ſtrengthen the Concluſion maintained in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if there be any certainty in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tradition, that the Lion is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and made to run away by the crowing of a Cock: I ſay, <hi>if,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though I doubt not but ſome peculiar kinds of Sounds, as well as of other ſenſible objects, may be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and exceedingly ungratefull to the Senſories of this or that peculiar kind of Animals, and conſequently
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104480:41"/>
to the ears of Lions; yet a late French Traveller into the <hi>Levant</hi> gives me cauſe much to queſtion the matter of fact, affirming, that row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the brink of <hi>Tigris</hi> or <hi>Euphrates,</hi> (for I do not punctually remember which,) they were, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours in the night, terrified by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that attended them along the brink of the River, and would not at all be frighted by the frequent crowing of the Cocks that chanced to be in the paſſengers Boat. Of which unconcernedneſs of the Lions, our obſerving traveller took much more notice than the Lions appeared to do of the crowing of the Cocks. I might on this occaſion ſay ſomething of the received Tradition, that many ſleeping perſons will be more eaſily waked by being called upon by their own uſual names, than by other names, though uttered with a louder voice. But this it may ſuffice to have mentioned; nor will I here inſiſt on that more certain example of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of a Sound, which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104480:42"/>
by the ſtarting of men or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Animals, upon a ſurprizing, though not vehement, noiſe; though this oftentimes puts ſo many of the Spirits and Muſcles into motion, that the whole bulk of the Animal is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly raiſed from the ground, which perhaps it could not be by the bare counterpoiſe of ſome hundreds of pounds: This, I ſay, I will not in this place inſiſt on, becauſe the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi> ſeems to depend rather upon the loudneſs or acuteneſs of the ſound, than upon any determinate modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it, particularly relating to the <hi>Animal</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But the eminenteſt Inſtance of the efficacy of peculiarly modified Sounds upon diſpoſed bodies, is afforded by what happens to thoſe which are bit by a <hi>Tarantula.</hi> For though the bitten perſon will calmly hear divers other tunes, yet when a peculiarly congruous one comes to be plaid, it will ſet him a dancing with ſo much vigour as the ſpectators cannot but wonder at, and the dancing will
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104480:42"/>
ſometimes continue many hours, if the Muſick do ſo, and not otherwiſe. I know there are ſome that queſtion the truth of the things related of theſe <hi>Tarantati,</hi> (as the <hi>Italians</hi> call them,) and I eaſily grant, that ſome Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may have been ſuffered to paſs under the countenance of ſo ſtrange a Truth. But beſides the affirmations of ſome Learned men, (as well Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians as others) my Doubts have been much removed by the Accounts I have received from an Ingenious Acquaintance of mine own, who at <hi>Tarentum</hi> it ſelf, whence the Inſect takes its name, and elſewhere, ſaw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bitten perſons in their dances, ſome in publick and ſome in private pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and amongſt the reſt a Phyſician, on whom the tune that fitted his diſtemper had the ſame operation as on the other Patients. And the Learned <hi>Epiphanius Ferdinandus,</hi> who practiſed Phyſick in <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi> for many years, not onely delivers upon his own perſonal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ſeveral Narratives of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104480:43"/>
effects of Muſick upon the <hi>Tarantati,</hi> but invites any that may doubt of the truth of ſuch Narratives to repair to him at a fit ſeaſon, undertaking to convince them by ocular Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
                  <p>I know a very honeſt and ſober Muſician, who has divers times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to me, that he could at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by playing a certain Tune, (which he acquainted me with, and which did not much move others) make a perſon (whom he named to me) weep, whether ſhe would or no. And I might add, that when I have been taking Phyſick, or am any thing feveriſh, the repetition of two verſes of <hi>Lucan</hi> ſeldom fails (as I have often tried) of producing in me a chilneſs, almoſt like that, but fainter, that begins the fit of an ague. But on this Inſtance I look not as a ſtrong proof of the Phyſical efficacy of Sounds; becauſe thoſe two verſes having been emphatically read, when divers years agoe I lay ſick of a ſlow fever, and could not reſt, they made
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104480:43"/>
ſo ſtrong an impreſſion on me, that whenever I am under a Diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure any thing near like that, that then troubled me, thoſe verſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, as 'twere, in my brain and ſome other parts that diſpoſition, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indiſpoſition, with which my firſt hearing of thoſe verſes was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied.</p>
                  <p>It may be the leſs admired, that the vibrating motion of the Air, that produces ſounds, ſhould have ſuch effects upon diſpoſed Organical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſince Light it ſelf, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiſts of briskly moving <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia</hi> far more ſubtile than aerial corpuſcles, or is propagated by the pulſe of a far more ſubtile body than Air, may have a notable ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon diſpoſed bodies. For we commonly obſerve, that the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, by beating upon the face or eyes of ſome that come ſuddenly out of a ſhaded place into the Light, preſently make them ſneeze; which you know is not done without a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement motion of divers parts of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104480:44"/>
the body. And though Colour be but a modification of Light; yet, beſides that 'twas anciently a practice, as the Hiſtory of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> informs us, to ſhew red objects to Elephants, to make them more fierce, 'tis a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar obſervation, that red cloaths do offend and irritate Turky-cocks. And that is more remarkable, which is related by the very Learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian <hi>Valeſius,</hi> of a perſon that he knew, who, if he looked upon red objects, would not onely have his Eyes offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but was ſubject to an effuſion of Humours in the neighboring parts.</p>

                        <hi>Obſervat. VI.</hi> Men ſuſpect not what efficacy the Inviſible motions of Fluids may have, even upon inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical bodies, upon the ſcore of ſome determinate Congruity or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt a peculiar Texture of the one, and the peculiar modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the others motion.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THough the Experiments deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have, I preſume, ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, that the modification given to the motions of the Air by ſono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bodies may have conſiderable effects upon Animals, in whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized bodies the curiouſly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved parts have an admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with, and relation to, one another, and to the whole Symmetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fabrick they make up; yet, I fear, it will ſcarce ſeem credible, that ſonorous motions of the Air, not very loud, ſhould find, even in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104480:45"/>
bodies Inanimate and Inorganicall, ſuch congruous Textures and other Diſpoſitions to admit their action, that even more languid Sounds, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly modified, may ſenſibly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon them, and much more than ſounds that are louder and more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, but not ſo happily modified. To make this good by particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, I ſhall begin with that, which, though the effect may ſeem inferiour to that of moſt of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I judge fitteſt to manifeſt, that the produced motion depends upon the determinate modification of that of the impellent Fluid.</p>
                  <p>That a certain impulſe of Air, made by one of the Uniſon-ſtrings of a Muſical Inſtrument, may ſuffice to produce a viſible motion in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is now become a known expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; of the Cauſe and ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved Phaenomena of which I elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more fully diſcourſe. But, that it may not be ſuſpected in this caſe, that the ſhake of the untouched ſtring is communicated to it by the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104480:45"/>
propagated motion of the Inſtrument it ſelf, to which the ſtring, that is ſtruck, is alſo faſtned; I ſhall add, that, according to what I elſewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, I found by trial purpoſely made, that a ſtring of Wire, (which you will grant to be a more ſolid body than an ordinary Gut-ſtring,) may be without another ſtring brought to tremble by a determinate Sound made at a diſtance, which produced but ſuch an impulſe of the Air, as could neither be ſeen nor felt by the By-ſtanders, nor would communicate any ſenſible motion to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtrings. 'Tis true, that in this caſe the ſtring, in which the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling was produced, was a ſingle, long, ſlender and ſpringy body, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at both ends to a ſtable one; and therefore it may ſeem altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groundleſs to expect, that any thing like this effect ſhould be by the ſame cauſe produced in bodies that do not appear ſo qualified. But, as we elſewhere ſhew, that a certain degree or meaſure of tenſion is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104480:46"/>
to this Phaenomenon the principal Qualification, without which all the other would be unavailable; perhaps 'twill not be abſurd to enquire, <hi>whether,</hi> in bodies of a very differing appearance from ſtrings, the various Textures, Connexions, and Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that Nature or Art, or both, may make of the parts, may not bring them to a ſtate equivalent to the Tenſions of the ſtrings of Muſical Inſtruments, whereby divers of the mentioned parts may be ſtretched in the manner requiſite to diſpoſe them to receive a vibrating motion from ſome peculiar Sounds: And <hi>whether</hi> theſe trembling parts may not be nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous enough to affect their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and make, in the body they belong to, a tremulous motion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible, though not by the Eye, yet by ſome other ſenſe. This conjecture or inquiry you will, I hope, have the leſs unfavourable thoughts of, when you ſhall have conſidered the following Experiments.</p>
                  <p>I remember, that many years agoe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104480:46"/>
I found by trial, that, if a ſomewhat large and almoſt hemiſpherical Glaſſe, though not very thin, were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently placed, a determinate ſound, made at a convenient diſtance from the concave ſurface of the Glaſſe, would make it ſenſibly ring, as a Bell does a while after it has been ſtruck. But this noiſe was the effect of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſound; for, though the voice were raiſed to a higher tone, or if the ſound were made louder, the ſame effect would not inſue. I remember alſo, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, ſome years after, I obſerved, that large empty drinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes of fine white metal had each of them its determinate Tenſion, or ſome diſpoſition that was equivalent as to our purpoſe. For, cauſing the ſtrings of a Muſical Inſtrument to be variouſly ſcrewed up, and let down, and briskly ſtruck, we found, as I expected, that the motion of one ſtring, when 'twas ſtretched to a certain note or tone, would make one of the Glaſſes ring, and not the other; nor would the ſound of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104480:47"/>
ſame ſtring, tuned to another note, ſenſibly affect the firſt Glaſſe, though perhaps it might have its operation upon another. And this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is not, on this occaſion, to be omitted, that, after we had found the tone proper to one of the Glaſſes, and ſo tuned the ſtring, that, (I ſay) when that was ſtruck, the Glaſſe would reſound. Having afterwards broken off a part of the foot of the glaſs, yet not ſo much but that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſtand upright, the ſame ſound of the ſtring would no longer be anſwered by the Veſſel, but we were obliged to alter the tenſion of the ſtring, to produce the former ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The Learned <hi>Kircherus,</hi> as I have been informed, ſomewhere mentions a correſpondence between ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours and ſome determinate ſounds; which I ſuppoſe may be true, though the triall did not ſucceed with me, perhaps for want of ſuch accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations for ſo nice an Experiment as I could have wiſhed, but could not procure: But if you can, you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104480:47"/>
me to make the trials ſo as to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your ſelf and me, whether the agitation of the liquour be cauſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by the motion of the Air, or be communicated by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tremblings of the Veſſel.</p>
                  <p>An Artiſt famous for his skill in making Organs, anſwered me, that, at ſome ſtops of the Organs, ſome ſeats in the Church would tremble. But, becauſe I ſuſpected by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that the greatneſs of the ſound chiefly effected it, becauſe, when that Pipe, which they call the open <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> ſounds, the chair or ſeat, on which the Organiſt ſits, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the neighbouring part of the Organ trembles; I ſhall add, that I have divers times obſerved certain ſounds of an excellent Organ to make not onely the ſeat, I ſate on in the Church, tremble under me, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an odd tremulous motion in the upper part of my Hat, that I could plainly feel with my hands. And that, which makes me apt to believe that this effect depends upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104480:48"/>
tone, rather than upon the loudneſs of the ſound, is, that I have oftentimes felt, and diligently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch a kind of motion in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of my Hat, upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of ſome words in ordinary diſcourſe; in which caſe the effect could not with probability be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the greatneſs of the Sound, but its peculiar fitneſs to communicate ſuch a motion to a body ſo diſpoſed.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it onely in ſuch ſmall and yielding bodies, as Hats and Strings, that Sounds that are not boiſterous may produce ſenſible effects, for, if they be congruous to the Texture of the body they are to work on, they may excite motions in it, though it be either ſolid or very bulky: of which I ſhall here ſubjoyn a couple of inſtances.</p>
                  <p>An ancient Muſician affirmed to me, that, playing on a Baſe-viol in the chamber of one of his Scholars, when he came to ſtrike a certain Note on a particular ſtring, he heard an odd kind of jarring Noiſe, which he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104480:48"/>
thought at firſt had either been caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or proceeded from ſome fault in the ſtring; but, having afterwards frequent occaſion to play in that ſame room, he plainly found, that the Noiſe, he marvelled at, was made by the tremulous motion of a Caſement of a window, which would be made to tremble by a determinate ſound of a particular ſtring, and not by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notes, whether higher or lower.</p>
                  <p>To this firſt Inſtance I ſhall add the ſecond, which, I confeſſe, I was not forward to believe, till trial had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of the Truth; and I ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled it the rather, becauſe, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of determinate Sounds ſhould appear to proceed from the peculiar kind of tremulous motion into which the parts of the reſonant body are put, it may incline men to ſo great a Paradox, as to think, that ſuch a motion of the Air as our Bodies do not feel, may produce a trembling in ſo ſolid a body as a Stone-wall of a great thickneſs. The Experiment or Obſervation it ſelf I ſhall give you
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104480:49"/>
in the ſame words I ſet it down ſome hours after I made it, which were theſe.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday I went to ſatisfy my ſelf of the truth of what had been told me by an ancient Muſician, to whom I had been relating what I had obſerved of the effects of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Sounds even upon Solid bodies, and of whom I enquired, if he had met with any thing of the like nature: taking him along with me, I found, that though the place be but an Arch, yet it would not anſwer to all notes indifferently, when we ſtood in a certain place, but to a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Note, (which he afterwards told me was <hi>Ce fa ut</hi> a little flatted,) to which note it anſwered very reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly, and not ſenſibly to others, which we made trial of, whether higher or lower than it; and, (which added to the ſtrangeneſs,) when I made him raiſe his voice to an Eighth, as conſonant as thoſe two Sounds are wont to be in all other caſes, the vaulted Arch did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104480:49"/>
to us affected with the Note. The Muſician added, that he had tried in moſt Arches all about the City, and could not find ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity in them, as being to be made reſonant by all Notes or Sounds indifferently that were ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and alſo, that as this Arch for this hundred years has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have this property, ſo an ancient and experienced Builder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that any Vault that were exquiſitely built, would peculiarly anſwer to ſome determinate Note or other.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THis Obſervation will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſeem paradoxicall. For, when an intire Body, eſpecially if it be of a ſolid Conſiſtence, and ſeem to be of an homogeneous or uniform matter, appears to be moveleſſe, we are wont to take it for granted, that the parts, which that body is made up of, are perfectly at Reſt alſo. But yet this will ſcarce be thought a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuppoſition, if we do but rightly conſider ſome obvious <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which may teach us, that, whilſt a whole Body, or the ſuperficies that includes it, retains its figure, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions and diſtance from other ſtable Bodies that are near it, the Corpuſcles that compoſe it may have
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104480:50"/>
various and brisk motions and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours among themſelves. As, when a bar of iron or ſilver, having been well hammered, is newly taken off of the Anvill; though the Eye can diſcern no motion in it, yet the touch will readily perceive it to be very hot, and, if you ſpit upon it, the brisk agitation of the inſenſible parts will become viſible in that which they will produce in the liquour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, when the Lath of a Croſs-bow ſtands bent, though a man do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Eye nor the Touch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any motion in the ſpringy parts, yet if the ſtring be cut or broken, the ſudden and vehement motion of the Lath, tending to reſtore it to the figure it had before it was bent, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers a ſpringineſs; whence we conclude it was before in a ſtate of violent Compreſſion. And, though the ſtring of a bent Bow do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appear to be in a ſtate of Reſt; yet, if you cut it aſunder, the newly made extreams will fly from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſuddenly and forcibly enough

to manifeſt, that they were before in a violent ſtate of Tenſion. And on this occaſion I could add divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances taken not onely from the works of Art, but thoſe of Nature too, if they did not belong to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paper: But, one ſort of Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations 'twill be proper to ſet down in this place; becauſe in thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, the bow and ſtring were brought into a violent ſtate by the meer and immediate force of man. I ſhall therefore add, that there are divers bodies, in which, though no ſuch kind of force appears to have antecedently acted on them, we may yet take notice of a ſtate of violent Compreſſion or Extenſion, and a ſtrong endeavour or tendency of the parts, that to the Eye or the Touch ſeem at reſt, to ſhrink or to fly out; and this endeavour may in ſome Caſes be more laſting and more forcible than one would eaſily ſuſpect or believe. But examples of this kind you muſt not expect that I ſhould give you out of <hi>Claſſick</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104480:52"/>
ſince in them 'tis like you have not met with either an Inſtance or a Conjecture to this purpoſe; but ſome few things that I tried my ſelf, and ſome others that I learnt by Inquiry from ſome Tradeſmen, whom I judged likelieſt to inform me, I ſhall briefly acquaint you with.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes obſerved my ſelf, and have had the Obſervation confirmed to me by the ingeniouſer Traders in Glaſs; That a Glaſs, that ſeemed to have been well baked, or nealed, (as they call it) would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, many days or weeks, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps months, after it is taken from the fire, crack of its own accord; which ſeems for the moſt part to happen upon the ſcore of the ſtrong, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall, ſhrinking of the parts of the Glaſſe. And the Glaſs-men will tell you, that, if they take their Glaſſes too haſtily from the fire, not allowing them leiſure to cool by degrees, they will be very apt to crack. But I remember, that, to ſatisfy ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104480:53"/>
men, I deviſed a way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting a much more quick and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of that kind. Having made then, by a way I elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where teach, a flat Lump of metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Glaſs, two or three or four times as thick as an ordinary Drinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, I obſerved, as I expected, that, though it had been melted in a very gentle fire, its very fuſible nature needing no other, and though it were removed but very little from the fire, it was ſo diſpoſed to ſhrink upon a ſmall degree of Refrigeration, or rather abatement of Heat, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ſenſibly cold, it would crack with a noiſe in ſo vehement a manner, that, notwithſtanding the ponderouſneſs of the matter; which had been purpoſely laid upon a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, parts of a conſiderable bulk, weighing perhaps ſome Drams, would fly, to a not inconſiderable diſtance from one another. And this Experiment I took pleaſure to make more than once. And if you will be content with an Inſtance
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104480:53"/>
which, though otherwiſe much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, may not be unwelcome, for its being eaſily and readily made; I ſhall offer you one that I have often repeated. Take a piece of Copper, (if the Plate be thick, 'tis ſo much the better,) and, having throughly brought it to a red or white Heat among kindled Coals, take it from the fire, and when it begins to cool a little, hold it over a ſheet or two of white Paper, and you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good ſtore of flakes to fly off, not without ſome little noiſe, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other, and ſometimes perhaps as far as the farthermoſt edges of the paper; which flakes or ſcales ſeem by their brittleneſs and colour, to be but parts of the ſurface of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal vitrified by the vehement action of the fire, and afterwards by a too haſty refrigeration ſhrinking ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, as to crack and leap from one another, like the contiguous parts of the ſtring of a Viol or other Muſical Inſtrument, that breaks by the moiſture of the Air. And on
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104480:54"/>
this occaſion I ſhall add, that, having afterwards inquired of an expert Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, that made metalline Concaves, about the ſhrinking of his mixtures of metalls, he confeſſed to me, that he uſually obſerved them to ſhrink upon Refrigeration. And the like I my ſelf have obſerved in Iron of a great thickneſs, and purpoſely fitted to a hollow body of metall, which it would not enter when it was ignited, though it would when 'twas cold. But to ſhew you by a notable Inſtance or two, both that Metals may ſhrink, and that they may doe ſo with a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable force, I ſhall add, that I found by inquiry, that the lately mentioned Artificer, after he had made ſome large Concaves of an unfit mixture of metals, and having removed them from the fire, had been very carefull to keep the cold Air from them, leſt they ſhould cool too haſtily, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved yet to his great loſs, that, when they came to be further refrigerated, they would (perhaps after three hours) crack with a great noiſe,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104480:54"/>
though this metalline mixture were perchance harder than Iron, and three or four times as thick as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Looking-glaſſes. But the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of another Tradeſman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me a yet more conſiderable <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> For this excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, whom I often employ, and with whom I was a while ſince diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of theſe matters, complain'd to me, that, having lately caſt a kind of Bell-metall upon a very ſtrong ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Inſtrument of Iron of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſuperficial <hi>Area,</hi> though the metal were ſuffer'd in a warm room to cool, from about eight a clock on Saturday night till about ten or twelve on Monday morning, and were then (which is to be noted) conſiderably hot to the touch; yet it cool'd ſo far, that, ſhrinking from the Iron that would not ſhrink with it, the Bell-metall cracked in divers places with noiſes loud as the Report of a Piſtoll, though the metall, he affirm'd to me, was an inch and half, or two inches thick. And the ſame
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104480:55"/>
perſon ſhewed me a large Cylinder of Iron, about which, for a certain purpoſe, a Coat of Bell-metall had been caſt ſome days before, on which (Bell-metall) there was a crack near one end made by the coldneſs of the Iron, though the thickneſs of the Bell-metall, as near as I could mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it, exceeded an inch, and (as the Workman affirmed) an inch and a quarter.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it onely in ſuch mixtures as Bell-metall, which, though very hard, may be very brittle, but even in a metal that is malleable when cold, that the like Phaenomenon may be met with, as I have been aſſured by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ingenious Artificer, of whom I inquired, whether he had taken notice of the ſhrinking of metalls; who affirm'd to me, that, having had occaſion to caſt about a Cylinder of Iron a ring or hoop of Braſs, he found to his trouble, that, when the metall began to cool, the parts ſhrunk from one another ſo as to leave a gaping crack, which he was fain to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104480:55"/>
fill up with ſoulder quite croſſe the breadth of the ring, though this were above an inch thick.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould not, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> have in this Chapter entertained you with more Experiments of others than of my own, if I had the conveniency of living near Founders of metalls, as the Tradeſmen had whoſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have rectied, and whoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in them I had no cauſe to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And both their Experiments and mine ſeem to teach, that a body may be brought into a ſtate of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as well by being expanded and ſtretch'd by the action of the fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the minute parts, as by the action of an external Agent upon the intire body. And, to ſpeak more generally, the ſtate of violent Contraction and Compreſſion may not unfitly be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by a Bow that is bent. For, as the Bow it ſelf is brought to a ſtate of Compreſſion by the force of the Archer, that bent it; ſo by the Elaſtical force of the bent Bow, the ſtring is brought into a violent ſtate
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104480:56"/>
of Tenſion, as may be made evident by the cutting off the ſtring in the middle; for then both the Bow will fly ſuddenly outwards, and the parts of the ſtring will ſwiftly and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhrink from one another. And according to this Doctrine, the effect of other bodies upon ſuch as are thus brought into, what men call, a Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſtate, is not to be judg'd barely according to uſual meaſures, but with reſpect to this latent Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Patient: as, for inſtance, though the ſtring of a Viol not ſcrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, will not be hardned by the vapours that imbue the Air in moiſt weather; yet a neighbouring ſtring of the ſame Inſtrument, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps much ſtronger, being ſcrew'd up, and thereby ſtretched, will be ſo affected with thoſe vapours, as to break with noiſe and violence. And ſo when one part of a piece of Glaſs is made as hot as can be, without appearing diſcolour'd to the Eye, though a drop or two of cold water have no effect upon the other part of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104480:56"/>
the ſame Glaſſe, yet if it touch the heated part, whoſe wonted extenſion (as I have elſewhere proved) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by the fire that vehemently agitates the component particles, the cracking of the Glaſs will almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſently enſue.</p>
                  <p>If againſt theſe Inſtances it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that it is poſſible to aſſign an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other cauſe of the ſeemingly ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous breaking of the bodies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in this Chapter, than that which I have propos'd, it will not much concern this Diſcourſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Allegation; for, whatever the latent Cauſe of the Phaenomena may be, the manifeſt Circumſtances of them ſuffice to ſhew, that bodies, which, as to ſenſe, are in a natural ſtate of Reſt, may be in a violent one, as of Tenſion, and may have, either upon the ſcore of the contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the parts among themſelves, or upon that of ſome interfluent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile matter, or ſome other Phyſical Agent, a ſtrong endeavour to fly off or recede from one another; and that,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104480:57"/>
in divers bodies, the cauſe of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour may act more vigorouſly than one would eaſily believe: and this ſuffices to ſerve the turn of this Diſcourſe. For I preſume that a perſon of your Principles will allow, that Local Motion muſt be produc'd by Local Motion, and conſequently, that, without a very ſtrong, though inviſible and unheeded one, ſuch hard and ſolid bodies as thick pieces of metall could not be made to crack.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether I may on this occaſion acquaint you with an odd Relation I had from a very honeſt and credible, as well as experienced, Artiſt, whom I, for thoſe reaſons, have ſeveral times made choice to deal with about precious Stones, and other things belonging to the Jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Goldſmiths trades. For, conſidering with him one day a large lump of matter, which contained ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stones that he took for courſe Agats, and which were joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a Cement, that in moſt places was harder than moſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104480:57"/>
Stones, I perceived that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained divers pretty large cavities in this Cement, which ſeemed to have contained ſuch Stones as thoſe that yet made parts of the lump. Upon which occaſion he affirmed to me, that ſeveral of the Stones grew whilſt they were lodg'd in thoſe cavities. And when I told him, that, though I had been long of an opinion, that Stones may receive an increment after their firſt formation, yet I did not ſee how any ſuch thing appeared by thoſe we were looking upon: He gave me in many words an account of his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I reduced to this, that the Stones he ſpoke of, did, after they were firſt formed, really tend to expand themſelves by virtue of ſome Principle of growth, which he could not intelligibly deſcribe; but that theſe Stones being lodg'd in a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extreamly hard, and therefore not capable of being forced to give way, their expanſive endeavour was rendered ineffectual, but not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo that when afterwards theſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104480:58"/>
Stones came to be taken out of the Cement wherein they were bedded, and to whoſe ſides 'tis like they were not exquiſitely congruous, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt Stones, having their ſides now no longer wedged in by the harder Cement, quickly expanded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if 'twere by an internal and violently compreſt ſpring, and would preſently burſt aſunder, ſome into two, and ſome into more pieces: of which he preſented many to his friends, but yet had reſerved ſome, whereof he preſented me one, that I have yet by me, together with ſome of the maſs, whoſe Cement I find to bear a better poliſh than mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to be very much harder than it. And, in anſwer to ſome queſtions of mine, he told me, that he had taken up theſe Stones himſelf, naming the place to me, which was not very far off, and that he obſerved all that he told me himſelf, and more than once or twice, and that I needed not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as I ſeemed to doe, that 'twas the ſtrokes employed to force the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104480:58"/>
Stones out of their Beds, that made them break. For, beſides that many of them, which (it ſeems) were not compreſt enough, did not break, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of thoſe, that did, were taken out, without offering them any ſuch violence, as that their burſting could with any probability be imputed to it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſervat. VIII.</hi> One main cauſe why ſuch Motions as we ſpeak of are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd, is, That we are ſcarce wont to take notice but of thoſe motions of Solid bodies, wherein one whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy drives away another, or at leaſt knocks viſibly againſt it, whereas many effects proceed from the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine motions produced by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Agent, in, and among, the parts of the ſame body.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis Obſervation is like to be much more readily underſtood than granted, and therefore I ſhall offer by way of proof the following Experiments.</p>
                  <p>We cauſed in a large braſs Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock the movable part to be nimbly turned to and fro in the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cavity of that part that was made to receive it, in that part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument that is wont to be kept fixt. And though this motion of the Key
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104480:59"/>
were made onely by the bare hand, yet in a ſhort time the mutual attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the contiguous parts of the Inſtrument made ſo brisk an agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the other parts, that the inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcence made the metal it ſelf to ſwell, inſomuch that the Key could no more be turned, but remained fixt, as if it had been wedged in, ſo that, to make it work as before, it was neceſſary by cooling it to make it ſhrink a little, and ſo take off the mutual preſſure of the Key, and the other part of the Stop-cock. Nor is this to be looked on as a caſual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment; for, beſides that it was made more than once, and is very analogous to ſome other trials of mine; I found, that a maker of ſuch Inſtruments complained to me, that he was ſeveral times forced to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his work, and plunge his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in cold water, before he could, by grinding, adjuſt the Key to the cavity it ought to fit.</p>
                  <p>I preſume I need not take notice to you, that this Experiment confirms
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104480:60"/>
what I elſewhere mention of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation of metals themſelves by Heat, and therefore I proceed to the next Inſtance.</p>
                  <p>This is afforded by the known Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of paſſing one's wetted fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon the orifice of a Drinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs almoſt fill'd with water. For, though the Eye does not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern any motion, that, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the preſſure of the finger, is made by one part of the glaſs upon another; yet, That a vibrating moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thereby produced, may be argued by the dancing of the water, eſpecially that which is contiguous to the preſt ſides of the glaſs, by which 'tis oftentimes ſo agitated, that numerous drops are made to leap quite over, and others are toſſed up to a good height into the Air. And that there may be conſiderable motions in the ſides of the glaſs, whilſt it does not break in pieces, we may probably gueſs by this, that, in Drinking-glaſſes artificially cut by a ſpiral line, both I, and others, have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104480:60"/>
often found by trial, that, a glaſs being dextrouſly inverted and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the parts will vibrate up and down ſo manifeſtly, as ſometimes to lengthen the glaſs, by my eſtimate, a quarter of an inch or more, and yet, the glaſs being ſet again upon its foot, it appeared that it had not been hereby at all injured.</p>
                  <p>That two pieces of Iron or Steel, by being ſtrongly rubbed againſt one another, will at length acquire a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Heat, is not hard to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but that an edg'd Tool of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened Steel ſhould, by having its edge rubbed againſt, have a manifeſt and permanent change made in its Texture, you did not perhaps ſuſpect; and yet, having had the Curioſity to cauſe ſome metals, and particularly Iron and Steel, to be turned by an excellent Artificer, I learned partly by his experience, and partly by my own, that the edge of the Steel-tool, with which he by degrees ſhaved off the protuberant parts of the metal, would be ſo heated and agitated,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104480:61"/>
that, in no long time, if care were not taken to prevent it, the tool would be brought to look of blewiſh and yellowiſh colours, and, permanently loſing its former temper, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo ſoft, as to be uſeleſſe for its former work, unleſſe it were again artificially hardened: and therefore, to prevent the trouble of tempering his tools again, this Artiſt, from time to time, dipt it, when it began to grow too hot, into a certain liquour, which he affirms, upon much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to have a peculiar fitneſs for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it always neceſſary that the body, that makes the parts of an inanimate body work conſiderably on one another, ſhould be either very hard, or impetuouſly moved. For, I remember, that, having once by me ſome ſhort bars of fine Tin, I reſolved to try whether, meerly with my naked hands, (which you know are none of the ſtrongeſt or hardeſt,)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could not procure a conſiderable internal Commotion among the parts;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104480:61"/>
and accordingly, laying hold on the two ends of the bar with my two hands, I ſlowly bent the bar towards me and from me two or three times, and having by this means broke or cracked it in the midſt, I perceived, as I expected, that the middle parts had conſiderably heated each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>What uſe may be made of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in the ſearch of the hidden cauſe of Elaſticity, would be leſs properly conſidered in this place than in another. But ſince I have named that Quality, I ſhall take this riſe to intimate, that if the reſtitution of a ſpringy body, ſorcibly bent, proceed onely (as ſome Learned Moderns would have it) from the endeavour of the compreſt parts themſelves to recover their former ſtate, one may not impertinently take notice of the Elaſticity that Iron, Silver and Braſs acquire by hammering, among the Inſtances that ſhew what in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may be done by a motion wherein the parts of the ſame body are, by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104480:62"/>
an almoſt unheeded force, put to act upon one another. But if Springi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depend chiefly upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of a ſubtile matter, as the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſians</hi> would have it, then the Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will properly belong to another Subject.</p>
                  <p>§ The foregoing Examples may alſo ſuffice to make out (what I am unwilling to refer to another Head) this ſubordinate Obſervation, That men are more uſually than juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with an opinion, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſiderable is to be expected from the motion of a body againſt another, unleſs the former do make a manifeſt percuſſion or truſion of the latter. But, becauſe this prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion eſpecially prevails in caſes where the body that is by friction or attrition to affect the other, is it ſelf ſoft or yielding, I ſhall on this occaſion add a few Inſtances to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Prejudice.</p>
                  <p>An Artiſt, eminent for grinding of Optical glaſſes, confeſſed to me, that ſometimes when he went about
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104480:62"/>
to poliſh his broader glaſſes, though but upon a piece of Leather ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with Puttee, that friction did ſo heat or otherwiſe agitate the parts of the glaſs, as, to his great loſs, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> make it crack from the edge to the middle; which ſeemed the more ſtrange, becauſe we fee, what intenſe degrees of Heat glaſſes will endure without cracking, if the fire be but gradually applied, as this Artiſt's glaſſes muſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> have been gradually heated.</p>
                  <p>But I think it worth inquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this caſe the whole work be performed by meer Heat, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there intervene not a peculiar kind of motion, into which ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are diſpoſed to be put by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar kind of friction, which ſeems fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to produce in manifeſtly ſpringy bodies, and perhaps in ſome others, (of which divers may be ſpringy that are not commonly taken to be ſo,) ſuch a vibrating or reciprocal motion, as may have ſome notable effects, that are not wont to be produced by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104480:63"/>
moderate Heats, nor always by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe ones themſelves. The trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the parts of a Drinking-glaſs, and the viſible vibration of the long and great ſtrings of a Baſe-viol, upon peculiar ſounds, may give ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to this conjecture. And that in ſome bodies there may be ſuch a tremulous motion produced, by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them upon ſo ſoft a thing as Wool, or upon a piece of Cloath, I tried by this Experiment:</p>
                  <p>We caſt into a hollow Veſſel, very ſmooth within, and of an almoſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpherical figure, ſeverall ounces of good melted Brimſtone, and having ſuffered it to cool, and taken it out, the Convex ſurface, as had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, came off well poliſhed; then this conveniently ſhaped lump, which had (if I well remember) four or five inches in Diameter, being briskly rubbed in the ſame line forwards and backwards, upon a Cuſhion or ſome ſuch woollen thing, in a place free from other noiſes, I could, by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my ear to it, and attentively li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104480:63"/>
plainly hear a crackling noiſe made by the agitated parts, which continued a brisk, and, as I ſuppoſed, a vibrating motion for ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the friction was ended.</p>
                  <p>That there may be a conſiderable Commotion produced among the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts of bodies, by rubbing them even againſt ſoft bodies, I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times obſerved, by the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous ſteams that I could ſmell, if, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having a little rubbed a lump of good Sulphur upon my Cloaths, I preſently held it to my noſe. Which brings into my mind, that I have had the like effect from much harder and cloſer bodies than Sulphur, when they were rubbed upon bodies that were ſo too. For having purpoſely taken hard Stones cut out of mens Bladders, and rubbed a couple of them a little againſt one another, they quickly afforded, as I expected, a rank ſmell of ſtale Urin.</p>
                  <p>That Diamonds themſelves will, by rubbing upon woollen cloaths, be made Electrical, ſeems to argue, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104480:64"/>
even Their parts are ſet a moving: And that the Commotion reaches to the internal parts, I am the more apt to think, becauſe I have a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, that, if I rub it well and luckily againſt my Cloaths, will, for a little while, ſhine or glimmer in the dark; which is the ſame Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon that I elſewhere relate my ſelf to have produced in the King's larger Diamond, by giving it one brisk ſtroke with the point of a bodkin, where the Light that preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Gem, ſeemed not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable to any thing ſo likely as the ſudden Commotion made in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts of that peculiarly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Stone.</p>
                  <p>What a peculiar modification of motion, diſtinct from its degrees of <hi>Impetus,</hi> may doe in Fluid bodies, we have formerly in this Eſſay taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. But perhaps it may be worth while to enquire, what kinds there are of it, and what effects they may have in the parts of Solid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies themſelves. For I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104480:64"/>
that though thoſe Stones that the <hi>Italian</hi> Glaſs-men uſe are very hard, and, if I miſremember not, have ſeveral times afforded me ſparks of fire by Colliſion; yet, by rubbing them a little one againſt another, I found, that ſuch an agitation was made in their parts, as to make them throw out ſtore of foetid exhalations: And 'tis poſſibly to the ſtony Ingredient that Glaſs owes the Quality I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it, and elſewhere mentioned, of emitting offenſive ſteams. And 'tis remarkable to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that, though ſo vehement an agitation of the parts, as is given to Glaſs by Heat, when 'tis made almoſt red-hot in the fire, does not make it ſenſibly emit odours; yet barely by dextrouſly rubbing two ſolid pieces of Glaſs againſt one another, one may, in a minute of an hour, make thoſe fixed bodies emit ſuch copious ſteams as I found, not onely ſenſibly, but rankly, foetid; though one would think thoſe ſtinking exhalations very indiſpoſed to be forced off, ſince they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104480:65"/>
were not expelled by the vehement fire, that the Glaſs long endured in the furnace where 'twas kept mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>There are few things that ſhew better, both how the parts of Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical bodies communicate their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating motions to one another, and how brisk thoſe motions are, than that which happens upon the ſtriking of a large Bell with a Clapper or a Hammer. For though the ſtroak be immediately made but upon one part; yet the motion, thereby produced, is propagated to the oppoſite, and the ſucceſſive vibrations of the ſmall parts do, even in ſo ſolid and cloſe a body as Bell-metal, run many times round; as may appear by the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the ringing noiſe, which ſeems plainly to proceed from the circularly ſucceſſive vibrations of the parts, which, unleſs they briskly tremble themſelves, can ſcarcely be conceived to be fitted to give the Air that tremulous motion, whoſe effect on the Ear, when the firſt and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104480:65"/>
loud noiſe, made by the percuſſion, is paſt, we call Ringing. And this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts of the ſounding Bell may be further argued by this, that, if the finger, or ſome other ſoft body, be laid upon it, the ſound will be checked or deaded, and much more, if a broad ſtring, though of a ſoft ſubſtance, be tied about it. And not onely an attentive Ear may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten make us gueſs, that the ringing ſound is produced by a motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated circularly in the Bell, but this vibrating motion may ſometimes be alſo felt by the tremulous motion communicated by the trembling parts of the Bell to the finger, that is wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to it. That this motion paſſes in a round, from one ſide of the Bell to the other, ſeems manifeſt by the great difference of ſound, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in regard of ringing, that may be obſerved in a ſound Bell, and in a crack'd one; where yet all the matter and the former figure are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, onely the intireneſs or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, which is neceſſary to the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104480:66"/>
(if I may ſo call it) of the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous motion, is at the Crack ſtopt or hindred. And that the motion of the parts is very brisk, may be gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed partly by what has been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; but much more if that be true, which, not onely is traditionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by many, but has been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to me by ſeveral Artificers that deal in Bells, who averred, as an experienced thing, That if a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſized Bell were bound about, any thing hard, with a broad ſtring, and then ſtruck with the uſual force, that it would otherwiſe bear very well; that percuſſion would break it, giving a diſorderly check to the brisk motion of the parts of the Bell, whereof ſome happening to be much more (and otherwiſe) agitated than others, the force of their motion ſurmounts that of their Coheſion, and ſo produces a Crack.</p>
                  <p>But, in regard great Bells are not eaſie to be procured, nor to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged when one has acceſſe to them, I ſhall add, that I took the Bell of a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104480:66"/>
large Watch, or very ſmall Clock made of fine Bell-metall, which had no handle or other thing put to it, ſave a little Bodkin or skiver of wood, whoſe point we thruſt into the hole that is uſually left in the middle of the <hi>Baſis;</hi> and this ſharp piece of wood ſerving for a handle to keep the Bell ſteady enough, we placed in the cavity of it, near the edges, (for that Circumſtance muſt not be omitted,) ſome black mineral Sand, or, in want of that, ſome ſmall filings of Steel or Copper, or ſome other ſuch minute and ſolid Powder, which yet muſt not be too ſmall, and then ſtriking moderately with the Key againſt the ſide of the Bell, we obſerved, (as we expected) that, whilſt it continued briskly ringing, it made many of the filings to dance up and down, and ſometimes to leap up, almoſt like the drops of Water, formerly mentioned to skip, when the brim of the Glaſs was circularly preſt by the wetted finger. Which prompts me to add, that, having put a middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſized
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104480:67"/>
drop of water (for in this caſe the quantity is a conſiderable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance) near the lower edge of the Bell, 'twas eaſie to make it viſibly tremble, and be as it were covered over with little waves, by a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what brisk ſtroke of the Key on the oppoſite ſide. And this effect was more conſpicuous, when a very large drop of water was placed near the edge, on the convex ſide of a hand-Bell, whoſe Clapper was kept from any where touching the inſide of it. And to obviate their jealouſie, that, not having ſeen the manner of the above-mentioned motion of the Sand, might ſuſpect that 'twas produced by the impulſe which the Bell, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire body, received from the percuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made by the Key, we ſeveral times forbare putting-in the filings, till after the ſtroke had been given; which ſatisfied the Spectatours, that the dancing and leaping of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute bodies proceeded from the ſame drisk vibrations of the ſmall parts of the Bell, which, at the ſame time
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104480:67"/>
ſtriking alſo the Air, produced a ringing ſound, which might very well, as it did, out-laſt the skipping of the filings; the exceedingly minute par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Air being much more eaſily agitable, than the compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively groſs and heavy Corpuſcles of the Powder.

                  <head>THE Preface.</head>
                  <p>HAving heretofore had occaſion to draw together under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Heads, divers unpubliſh'd Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and Experiments of my own, and ſome of other men, by way of <hi>Memorials for a Natural Hiſtory of the Air;</hi> I thought fit by more largely treating of two or three of the Subjects diſtinctly mention'd in my Scheme of Titles, to give a Semplar or <hi>Specimen</hi> of what may be done upon the other Heads of the deſigned Hiſtory. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="tcp:104480:71"/>
I treated ſomewhat largely of the <hi>Salubrity and Inſalubrity of the Air,</hi> as a Subject, which for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of it to Mens healths and lives, I thought deſerv'd to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conſider'd, and have its Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes diligently inquir'd into. And having obſerv'd that among the ſix principal Cauſes of the healthfulneſs or inſalubrity of the Air, namely the <hi>Climate,</hi> the <hi>Soil,</hi> the <hi>Situation</hi> of the <hi>Place,</hi> the <hi>Seaſons</hi> of the Year, the <hi>raigning winds</hi> and <hi>Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> (whether more or leſs frequent) and eſpecially <hi>Subterraneal Steams,</hi> having I ſay obſerv'd that among theſe Cauſes there was <hi>one,</hi> viz. the laſt nam'd, about which, I thought I could offer ſomething, that I had not met with in the Books of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians that treat of it; I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by invited to ſet down my Thoughts and Obſervations by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, which I was made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve would appear uncommon, and
<pb facs="tcp:104480:71"/>
would not prove uſeleſs. Theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and Reflexions I referr'd for clearneſs and diſtinctions ſake to four Propoſitions. But when I had gone thorough the three firſt, and made ſome progreſs in the fourth, being hinder'd by divers Avocations to make an end of it, I laid by the whole Diſcourſe in a place which I thought a ſafe one, but when afterwards I had ſome oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to diſpatch what remain'd, I found all the diligence I us'd to retrieve the entire Manuſcript unſucceſsfull. At this ſurprizing Accident I confeſs I was ſomewhat troubled; becauſe whatever may be thought of the diſcurſive part of thoſe Papers, the Hiſtorical part contain'd divers matters of Fact, that I did not meet with in Books, nor can now diſtinctly remember, and will not perhaps be lighted on by even Phyſicians, or ſuch Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts as derive their knowledge one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:104480:72"/>
from them. 'Tis upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that having afterwards met with many Papers that belong'd to moſt parts of the unhappy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I thought fit to put them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the beſt order I could, that I might not looſe what might give ſome light to ſo important a Subject as the Theory of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And this courſe I the rather pitch'd upon, becauſe before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers about the Salubrity of the Air, I miſs'd two other of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, whereof the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Cellection of Medicinal things, and the ſecond a defence of the Mechanical way of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophizing about Natural Things, as it reſpects Religion. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd that having formerly loſt a Manuſcript I was much concern'd for, I purpoſely made a noiſe of it, whence I ſuppos'd the Plagiary would conclude himſelf unable to make it paſs for his. And in effect
<pb facs="tcp:104480:72"/>
the Book was in a while after pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately brought back, ſo that I found it laid in a By-place, where I had before as fruitleſly as carefully ſought it.</p>

                  <head>AN Experimental Diſcourſe Of ſome Unheeded CAUSES OF THE <hi>Inſalubrity</hi> and <hi>Salubrity</hi> OF THE AIR, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>THE ſixth and laſt thing upon which the Salubrity and Inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrity of the Air depends, is the impregnation it receives from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal <hi>Effluvia.</hi> And, though this be a cauſe not wont to be much heeded by Phyſicians themſelves; yet I take it to be oftentimes one of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104480:74"/>
the moſt conſiderable in its effects.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Effluvia</hi> that paſs into the Air, may be diſtinguiſh'd into ſeveral ſorts, according to their reſpective Natures, as has been elſewhere ſhewn; wherefore I ſhall now only take notice of the differences that may be taken from <hi>place</hi> and <hi>time;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account we may conſider, that ſome of them ariſe from the <hi>Cruſt</hi> (if I may ſo call it) or more ſuperficial parts of the <hi>Earth;</hi> and others have a deeper Original, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending out of the lower parts, and as it were <hi>Bowels,</hi> of the <hi>Terraque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Globe. And to this difference taken from place, I muſt add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, perhaps no leſs conſiderable, afforded by Time; which difference relates chiefly to the ſecond ſort of Steams newly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Of the Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia,</hi> ſome are almoſt conſtantly or daily ſent up into the Air, and thoſe I therefore call <hi>Ordinary Emiſſions;</hi> and others aſcend into the Air but at times, which are not ſeldom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104480:74"/>
enough from one another, and thoſe I call <hi>Extraordinary Emiſſions;</hi> whether they come at ſtated times, and ſo deſerve the title of <hi>Periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> or elſe uncertainly, ſometimes with far greater, ſometimes with far ſmaller intervals, and ſo may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>fortuitous</hi> or <hi>irregular.</hi> But, though I thought it might render what I am about to ſay more clear, if I made and premiſed the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſtinctions, yet becauſe in many caſes, Nature does not appear ſolicitous to obſerve them, but at the ſame time imbues the Air with Steams referable to divers Members of theſe diſtinctions, I ſhall ſeveral times, though not always, take the liberty to imitate her, and conſider the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the <hi>Terraqueous Globe,</hi> in the more general Notion, that they are ſo.</p>
                  <p>I know 'tis frequently obſerved, and uſually granted, that <hi>Marriſh</hi> Grounds, and <hi>wet</hi> Soils are wont to be <hi>unhealthfull,</hi> becauſe of the moiſt and crude vapours, that the ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104480:75"/>
waters ſend up too copiouſly into the Air. And on the other ſide, <hi>dry</hi> Soils are, becauſe of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, generally lookt upon as <hi>healthy.</hi> Nor do I deny, that theſe Obſervations do moſt commonly hold true; but yet I think, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what can be juſtly aſcribed to the moiſt vapours, or dry Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we have been ſpeaking of; in many places the healthfulneſs and inſalubrity of the Air may be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to other ſorts of <hi>Effluvia</hi> from the Soil, than thoſe that act merely, or perhaps principally, as theſe are either <hi>moiſt</hi> or <hi>dry.</hi>

                     <head>PROPOSITION I.</head>
                     <p>TO deliver my Thoughts about this matter ſomewhat more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, I ſhall lay them down in the four enſuing Obſervations or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, whereof the firſt ſhall be this: <hi>It ſeems probable that in divers places, the Salubrity or Inſalubrity of the Air conſidered in the general, may</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104480:75"/>
                        <hi>be in good part due to ſubterraneal Expirations, eſpecially to thoſe that I lately call'd Ordinary Emiſſions.</hi> For in ſome places the Air is obſerv'd to be much more healthy, than the manifeſt qualities of it would make one expect: and in divers of theſe Caſes I ſee no Cauſe to which ſuch a happy Conſtitution, may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be aſcrib'd, than to friendly <hi>Effluvia</hi> ſent up from the Soil into the Air; which Particles either by promoting <hi>tranſpiration</hi> (that great inſtrument of health and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;) or by hindering the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or checking the Activity, of Morbifick ferments; or by mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſabling ſome noxious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that would otherwiſe infeſt the Air, or by other ways, that I ſhall not now ſtay to enumerate; may not a little contribute to keep the Bodies of thoſe that live in that Air, in that regular and deſirable ſtate, we call <hi>Health.</hi> I know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that 'tis generally thought, and often true, that Mineral Bodies do
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104480:76"/>
ſend up Exhalations, hurtfull not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Plants, but to Men; but when we mean Subterraneal things inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, though (Men are wont to look upon them but ſlightly under a general confuſed Notion) we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a word more comprehenſive than moſt men are aware of, there being a great variety, as well as mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Bodies, that Nature has lodg'd in her dark Store-houſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſurface of the Earth. And of theſe differing ſorts of Bodies, though 'tis probable that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part are ſuch whoſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> are unhealthfull to Men, yet there may be others whoſe Emanations may be friendly to him; I have known it obſerv'd that over ſome Tin Mines in the Weſtern parts of <hi>England,</hi> not only Trees, but far more tender Plants, as Graſs, are wont to proſper and flouriſh, and (if I much miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not) I have ſeen verdent Trees growing juſt over a vein of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſort of Mineral, that lay near the ſurface of the Earth: And 'tis
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104480:76"/>
likewiſe obſervable about thoſe that conſtantly dig in thoſe Tin-Mines, that they do not lead a ſhort and ſickly life as in many others, but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a great and vigorous Age. And an Ancient Poſſeſſor of ſome of theſe Mines being askt by me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongſt the otherwiſe differing Exhalations that aſcended into the Air, he did not find a difference as to ſmell bad or good; he anſwer'd, that though moſt of thoſe viſible fumes had a ſmell that participated enough of Sulphur or Bitumen to be offenſive, yet ſome others were ſo far from being ungratefull, that they were well ſcented. And on this occaſion I remember, that not long ſince, a Friend of mine, and another <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> being Partners in a chargeable Attempt to diſcover a Mine, in digging deep for it, they accidentally broke into a vaſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Cavern, into which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Diggers would not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to deſcend, one of theſe curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gentlemen cauſed himſelf to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104480:77"/>
let down, and there found the Air very temperate and refreſhing, and that he long breath'd it with delight, and on the floor, or Soil (which reach'd farther than he could diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) he found many and various Minerals moſt of them embryona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or imperfectly form'd, and ſtore of a kind of Mineral Earth, whoſe ſmell was fragrant and very pleaſant both in his Judgment, and that of ſome Ladies. And though, when ſome of thoſe Minerals were brought to me, a ſmall lump of this Earth that was among them, had been kept ſo long in the Air, as to ſpend moſt of its Odoriferous Particles, yet the ſmell it ſtill retain'd, was, though but faint, yet pleaſing.</p>
                     <p>That from Foſſiles that lye hid under the ſurface of the Earth, and have a conſiderably large Spread, there may aſcend ſtore of wholſome <hi>Effluvia</hi> into the Air, ſeem'd to me the more probable by what I noted at my laſt being in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where, being invited by a Brother of mine
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104480:77"/>
to paſs ſome time in a Countrey houſe of his, to which there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd a very large Sheep-walk that produc'd ſhort, but excellent Graſs; I learn'd (and was eaſily perſwaded by ſome things I took notice of) that this place was juſtly reputed very healthfull, and this Salubrity of the Air, together with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Graſs, ſome circumſtances invited me to aſcribe to <hi>this;</hi> That the Soil was ſuſtain'd by a large tract of Limeſtone, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to emit continual exhalations into the Air; which conjecture will perhaps with the leſs ſcruple be aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, if I add that it has been long and generally obſerv'd, that as far as the Limeſtone extends, that tract of ground makes the Snow <hi>that</hi> falls on it thaw, or melt much ſooner, than it does on the Neighbouring Lands.</p>
                     <p>After I had made this Obſervation, I mention'd it in diſcourſe to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive Perſon, that had ſeen and been employed about ſeveral Mines; and I asked him whether he had met
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104480:78"/>
with any thing of this kind; to which he anſwer'd me, that in <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhire,</hi> at a place which he nam'd to me, he and others had obſerv'd, that a large tract of Limeſtone land was ſo warm (as they ſpeak) as to diſſolve the Snow that fell on it, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much ſooner than another great ſcope of Land, which was divided from it but by a glin, where the Soil did not cover Limeſtone, but Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, diſcourſing of this Subject with an ingenious Perſon, that had viſited the <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and <hi>Bohemian</hi> Mines; he told me, that during his ſtay among the former, he often walked abroad with the Overſeer of them, a famous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd Mineraliſt, who delighted to breathe the freſh morning Air upon ſome Hills abounding with Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; that his Guide made him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that when they were over a tract of Land that afforded much of that noble Oar (which by a <hi>German</hi> Name he called <hi>Rot-gulden ertz</hi>) he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104480:78"/>
found the ſmell to be pleaſing, and the Air refreſhing. And whereas, in paſſing over ſome other Mines, he found himſelf moleſted by offenſive fumes; he felt no ſuch effect, when he was upon that ſcope of ground under which there lay veins of <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar,</hi> or, if you pleaſe, a Mine of <hi>Quick-ſilver Our:</hi> And his ancient Guide told him, that next the <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulden ertz</hi> before mentioned, the Soil containing theſe Cinnabarine veins, was that whoſe incumbent Air was the moſt eligible for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs and Salubrity. And I the leſs wonder, that in ſome places the ſubjacent Foſſiles ſhould impregnate the Air with wholſome <hi>Effluvia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I remember I had the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ride many Miles, (though in the depth of Winter,) to ſee a ſcope of ground that was famous for a good Pottery; where, beſides many other Mineral Earths that I took notice of, there was a Pit or Groove, that reach'd, if I miſtake not, fifteen or twenty foot beneath the ſurface of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104480:79"/>
ground; whence they dug up a kind of white Clay, ſo richly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with ſubtile and noble parts, that it afforded a Chymiſt or two of my Acquaintance (for I had my ſelf no opportunity to diſtill it) good ſtore of a Subtile Spirit, of a Volatile and Saline Nature, which upon trial they highly extoll'd for it's Cordial, and other Virtues in Phyſick; and which, by ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Mechanical trials I made with it, I concluded to abound with a Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt, not unlike that of Urine or Hartſhorn. And ſince by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we ſee, that ſome unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Foſſiles may be enrich'd with Medicinal and Fugitive Salts and Spirits; it may reaſonably be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that theſe aſcending into the incumbent Air, may highly conduce to the Salubrity of it. And the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity I have had to examine Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically ſome Boles, and other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are wont to be unregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly compriz'd under the confus'd notion of <hi>Earths,</hi> makes me ſuſpect,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104480:79"/>
that there may be far more <hi>Species</hi> of Salubrious Foſſiles than many have yet taken notice of.</p>
                     <p>But peradventure you will much the more eaſily admit in general, that Subterraneal Tracts of great extent may for a very long time ſend up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air copious Expirations, not diſcernable by any of ourſenſes, nor commonly ſuſpected to be found in that Body, if you pleaſe to conſider with me (what I do not remember to have been taken notice of to this purpoſe) that the common Air we live in, and breathe, does always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and for many Ages has been impregnated, with the Copious Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Earth; which our induſtrious <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and after him ſome learned Jeſuits and others, have proved to be a great, though faint <hi>Magnet;</hi> and whoſe emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they conſtantly ſtream through the Air, I have elſewhere by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Experiments ſhewn to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of paſſing through the Pores of Glaſs it ſelf, and acting almoſt inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104480:80"/>
and yet manifeſtly, upon Bodies hermetically ſeal'd up in it. But, <hi>though</hi> from what has been ſaid it may be inferr'd, that 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable the Salubrity of the Air in ſome places may be chiefly, or at leaſt in part, due to the wholſome Expirations of Subterraneal Bodies; <hi>yet,</hi> generally ſpeaking, the Air is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd, in far more places than it is improv'd, by being impregnated with Mineral Expirations. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, beſides that, among the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals known unto us, there are many more that are <hi>noxious,</hi> than that are <hi>wholſome;</hi> the power of the former to doe miſchief is wont to be far more efficacious, than that of the latter to doe good; as we may gueſs by the ſmall benefit men receive in point of health by the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of any Mineral, or other Foſſile, known unto us, in compariſon of the great and ſudden miſchief that is often done by the Expirations of Orpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sandarach, and white Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick; for, though that ſold in Shops
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104480:80"/>
is <hi>factitious,</hi> being made of Orpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſublim'd with Salt, yet it is found <hi>Natural</hi> in ſome <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and other Mines. On which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I remember that the ingenious Perſon lately mention'd to have with his Guide taken the Air upon the Hills of that Mineral Countrey, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd me, that, when his Guide and he walk'd over ſome veins of theſe noxious Minerals, he met with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Odorous Steams, which, though differing from one another, agreed in this, that they were all offenſive to him; and particularly, ſome of them by their unwelcome ſharpneſs, and others by giving him a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome difficulty of reſpiration. I will not here urge thoſe ſulphureous ſteams, that ſo ſuddenly deprive Dogs of ſenſe and motion, in the Neapolitan <hi>Grotta de Cani;</hi> becauſe there the Exhalations are too much included, and as it were pent up: But it is very proper to allege for my preſent purpoſe the <hi>Aorni</hi> or <hi>Averni,</hi> which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104480:81"/>
by good Authours to be found, ſome in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and ſome in other Countries; for in theſe places there aſcend out of the Earth ſuch noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and plentifull exhalations, as kill thoſe Animals that draw in the Air they infect; and ſome of them are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to precipitate, even the Birds that fly over the Caverns that emit them. But there are a multitude of Places, where 'tis not ſo manifeſt that hurtfull exhalations aſcend into the Air, and yet they really do ſo: There being in many places whole tracts of Land, that near the ſurface of the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with Marchaſitical Minerals, as theſe do with a ſharp vitriolate Salt, which, together with the ill condition'd Sulphur that they alſo plentifully contain, aſcend into the Air, and render it corroſive. On which occaſion I remember, that for Curioſities ſake I took ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſhining Marchaſite; and caus'd a pound of it to be diſtill'd in an Earthen Veſſel with a good fire, by which means, notwithſtanding it's
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104480:81"/>
dryneſs, I obtain'd two or three ſpoonfuls of a Limpid Liquor, that ſmell'd very ſtrongly, like that which the <hi>Helmontians</hi> call <hi>Gas Sulphuris;</hi> and which appear'd manifeſtly to be of an acid Nature, both by the taſte, and by it's readily corroding, and diſſolving unbeaten Coral, even in the cold, to mention here no other Tryals that I made with it. And the Mineral afforded me, together with this Liquor, about an ounce and three quarters of inflammable <hi>Sulphur,</hi> part whereof aſcending (as may be gueſs'd) in the form of very agile Corpuſcles, theſe faſten themſelves all about to the inſide of the Receiver, and there compos'd divers thin Coats, or Films, as 'twere, of Sulphureous matter ſticking to one another; which at their firſt taking off, and for ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, might be bent or folded like leaves of paper, but afterwards har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Air. Mineraliſts, and ſome other good Authours, mention divers Places as abounding with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasitical
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104480:82"/>
Foſſiles, but I am apt to think, they are far more common than is vulgarly taken notice of; for I have met with them where one would little expect them. And, though in <hi>England</hi> all our Vitriol (which is now plentifully vended into Foreign parts) be made of Vitriolate Stones, or Bodies that paſs for ſtones; yet that is not true which our Mineraliſts are wont thence to conclude, that there is no other Vitriolate or Marchaſitical matter in <hi>England:</hi> for a famous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in Foſſiles, having found a Mine, which he knew not what to make of, and therefore carefully conceal'd, addreſs'd himſelf to me, becauſe, he ſaid, he knew I would not betray or ſupplant him: and having at his deſire taken a private view of what he had diſcover'd, I preſently found it to be a vein, that lay at ſome depth under ground, and ran along (how far I know not) like a vein of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Oar, (and for ſuch upon that account he miſtook it) conſiſting of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104480:82"/>
a black and heavy ſtuff, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a few eaſie trials I quickly found to be of a Vitriolate Nature; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that, ſomewhat to my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I was able to make it yield in few hours ſtore of pure Vitriol, without any troubleſome or artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preparation.</p>

                     <p>That theſe <hi>Endemical,</hi> or (if we may ſo call them) <hi>Topical</hi> Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, do in <hi>many places</hi> proceed from ſome exceſſive Heat, Moiſture, or other manifeſt quality of the Air; from bad Diet, vulgar Intemperance, and other Cauſes that have little or no connexion with <hi>Subterraneal Reeks,</hi> I readily grant.

                     <list>
                        <item>1. There are ſome places, in which the Endemical Diſeaſe cannot be probably imputed to any manifeſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104480:83"/>
Cauſe; as he may perceive that ſhall conſider how often it happens, that the Cauſes which are aſſign'd of ſuch Diſeaſes, if they were the true ones, muſt produce the like Diſtempers in many other places, where yet it is notorious that they are not <hi>Endemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. That Subterraneal Bodies may ſend up copious Steams, of different kinds, into the Air, has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made out.</item>
                        <item>3. It has been alſo ſhewn, that the Matters that ſend up theſe <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> may be of a large extent. And I remember on this occaſion that I have ſometimes obſerv'd, and that in more Countries than one, a whole tract of Land that abounded with Minerals of one kind; and within no great diſtance, as perhaps a Mile or a League, another large tract of Land, whoſe Subterraneal part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with Minerals of a very differing ſort.</item>
                        <item>4. We have alſo above declar'd, and 'tis highly probable from the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104480:84"/>
nature of the thing it ſelf, that thoſe copious ſteams (Saline, Sulphureous, Arſenical, Antimonial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the Air, may very much conduce to make it hurtfull to a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, in the way requiſite to produce this or that determinate Diſeaſe: as I not long ſince related from the Chymiſt that viſited the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Mines, that in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he found the Reeks aſcending from them into the Air (though in an elevated place, and expos'd to the Winds) make him as it were Aſthmatical, and give him a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome difficulty of Reſpiration. And here let me add an Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which perhaps will not be thought fit to be ſlighted by Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians: namely, that ſome parts of the ſubſtance of the Air (for I ſpeak not of its Heat, Coldneſs, or other ſuch Qualities) do not onely affect humane bodies, or at leaſt many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals among them, as they are taken in by Reſpiration, but as they outwardly touch the Skin: and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104480:84"/>
Skin being (as I have elſewhere ſhewn) full of Pores, and thoſe perhaps of different ſizes and figures, thoſe Corpuſcles that get in at them may have their operation, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt inward parts of the body. To make this more clear and probable, becauſe 'tis a thing of importance, I deſire theſe things may be obſerv'd.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. That when I ſpeak of the Air, I do not in this place underſtand that Air, which I elſewhere teach to be more ſtrictly and properly ſo call'd, and to conſiſt of <hi>ſpringy</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; but the Air in its more vulgar and laxe ſignification, as it ſignifies the Atmoſphere, which abounds with vapours, and exhalations, and in a word with Corpuſcles of all ſorts, except the larger ſort of ſpringy ones; and many of them may be ſo ſmall, and ſo ſolid, or ſo conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhap'd, as to get entrance at ſome of the numerous Orifices of the minute or miliary Glandules of the Skin, or at other Pores of it.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104480:85"/>
Thus, though paper be not pervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the uncompreſs'd elaſtical parts of the Air, yet it may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penetrated by other Corpuſcles of the Atmoſphere: for I remember, I have for Curioſities ſake prepar'd a dry body, out of a ſubſtance belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Animal Kingdom, which being lapt up in paper, would, without wetting or diſcolouring, or any way ſenſibly altering it, paſs in a trice through the Pores of it in ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to have not onely a viſible, but a manifeſt operation on bodies plac'd at ſome diſtance from it. And though a bladder almoſt full of Air, having its neck well tyed, be held near the fire in various poſtures, the elaſtical Air, though rarefied, or attenuated by the heat, will rather burſt the bladder, (as I have more than once found) than get out at the Pores, yet we have often made a certain ſubſtance, belonging to the Mineral Kingdom, that, if a bladder were wet or moiſt, (as the Skins of living Men are wont to be) would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104480:85"/>
pervade it, and have a ſenſible operation, even upon ſolid bodies plac'd within it. This Experiment (that I can repeat when I will) is therefore the more conſiderable to our preſent purpoſe, becauſe in the bladder of a dead <hi>Animal,</hi> the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity may be well ſuppos'd to be much leſs than it was in the Animal when alive; in which ſtate the parts of the humane body are much more perſpirable than one would eaſily believe, partly becauſe of the heat that is continually diffus'd from the heart, and partly becauſe of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious ſteams that are in perpetual motion, and keep the parts warm, moiſt and ſupple: And it is not to be pretermitted in our preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the bladder of Urine conſiſts not of a ſingle Membrane, and is probably of a ſtronger tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by reaſon of the ſubtile ſalt liquor it is inſtituted to contain, than many another Membranes of the body, or the Epidermis. And this is the firſt thing I would have noted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:104480:86"/>The next is, that, whereas in the Inſtances newly recited, and ſome others that are by and by to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, the effects were produc'd when the ambient Air, impregnated with Mineral Corpuſcles, had but a very ſhort time (perhaps not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minutes) to work upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies expos'd to it: In thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that are very ſubject to Endemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſeaſes, the Inhabitants are wont to live all the year long, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps during their whole life, expos'd to the action of the vitiated Air: and how much a far ſhorter time will ſerve, to make the Corpuſcles that rove in the Air, penetrate into bodies of no very cloſe contexture, may be gueſs'd by the breaking even of the bigger ſtrings of Lutes and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, by the numerous (though invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) vapours, that get into them in rainy weather; and much more by the effects of ſuch vapours, when inſinuating themſelves in ſwarms into the Pores of a Rope, they ſhorten it ſo forcibly, as to enable it, by ſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104480:86"/>
it ſelf to lift up and keep ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended conſiderable weights, as I have elſewhere ſhewn by tryals pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made. Theſe things may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it probable, that, <hi>though</hi> in a ſmall compaſs of time the noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> that rove in the Air, may be too thinly diſpers'd in it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate themſelves in any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number at the Pores of the Skin; <hi>yet,</hi> by reaſon of the continual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of the Air, (eſpecially as to the Face, Hands, and ſome other parts) which may laſt day and night for many months, or perhaps years, there may be opportunity for a conſiderable number of morbifick Particles, to inſinuate themſelves into the cutaneous Pores.</p>
                     <p>3. And thus having once got en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, they may by the capillary Veſſels that reach to, or terminate at the Skin, paſs on to ſomewhat lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Veſſels; and ſo may get into the maſs of bloud, and by its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation be carried to all the parts of the body; and ſo be enabl'd both to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104480:87"/>
deprave the bloud, and other juices themſelves, and to gain acceſs to any determinate part of the body, which their peculiar ſhapes, figures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> qualifies them to produce ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diſtemper in. This whole Doctrine may be made more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by what experience ſhews of the virtues of certain <hi>Plaſters,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Mercurial ones,</hi> in Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that are not at all, or at leaſt are not chiefly <hi>Cutaneous;</hi> and (which comes more home to our Argument) of the efficacy of <hi>Periaptae,</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſa,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Piony-root, Bloud-ſtone, Lapis Nephriticus, Quick-ſilver</hi> in a Quill, a <hi>dry'd Toad</hi> in a Ceſnet Bag, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> whereof, though many anſwer not the Characters that are wont to be given of them, yet ſome of them, experience has convinc'd me to be of greater efficacy than I expected: And much more activity may be preſum'd to be, in divers noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> from <hi>Subterraneal Bodies;</hi> as may be gather'd from the effects of the Mercurial Girdles, that ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104480:87"/>
perſons wear to cure the Itch; and from what I elſewhere relate of the fits of the <hi>Colicque,</hi> often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in a Friend of mine by the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of maſſes of <hi>Loadſtone.</hi> And this laſt example may ſerve for a proof of another part of our <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> by ſhewing that <hi>Mineral Effluvia,</hi> may not onely be noxious in a general way, but may produce this or that determinate Diſeaſe. That <hi>Arſenical Appenſa,</hi> though much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd by divers <hi>Phyſicians</hi> themſelves, and ſold dear by <hi>Empyricks,</hi> as (if worn near the Heart) wonderfull <hi>Amulets</hi> againſt the <hi>Plague,</hi> have (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in ſome perſons and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) produc'd ſome of the noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects of <hi>Arſenical Poyſons,</hi> and particularly caus'd in ſome great faintneſs and diſpiritedneſs, I find by the Teſtimony of divers eminent Phyſicians. To which I ſhall add a remarkable one, which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be referr'd partly to this third Obſervation, as well as to what I lately deliver'd about the bad effects
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104480:88"/>
of <hi>Mineral Exhalations,</hi> breath'd in with the Air they vitiated: and I the rather mention this Caſe, becauſe 'tis not onely an odd one, but is a conſiderable Argument to ſhew, that noxious <hi>Mineral Expirations</hi> may manifeſtly produce a determinate Diſtemper in unlikely parts of the body. The Obſervation is this; I knew, and on ſome occaſions em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, a <hi>Chymical Laborant</hi> that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi'd that he could make a rare Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine out of <hi>red Arſenick,</hi> (as ſome call what others ſtyle <hi>Sandarach,</hi>) which is thought to differ little from common <hi>Orpiment,</hi> ſaving its being much higher colour'd: this <hi>Laborant</hi> then working long and aſſiduouſly upon this Mineral, and rubbing it frequently in a Mortar, came divers times to me; and complain'd of a <hi>diſaffection</hi> he thence contracted in the <hi>Organs of Reſpiration;</hi> for which I gave him ſomething that happen'd to relieve him; which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd him to complain to me of another Diſtemper, that, though
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104480:88"/>
not ſo dangerous, did often very much moleſt him: which was, that when he was very aſſiduous in the preparation of his <hi>Sandarach,</hi> it would give him great <hi>Pains,</hi> and (if I miſremember not) ſome <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> too, in his <hi>Teſticles:</hi> And this, for ought I know, happen'd to him as long as he was earneſt about that Proceſs; for the Medicines that had reliev'd him in his other Diſtemper, did not remove this: and I having occaſion to go for a while into the Countrey, found him gone at my return. It may ſtrengthen the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture lately propos'd, of the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſinuation of <hi>Effluvia</hi> that rove in the Air, at the Pores of the Skin, if I add that I have had the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to enquire of more than one Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, that had viſited the famous <hi>Pico</hi> of <hi>Tenarif</hi> (at whoſe upper part there are found ſcatter'd parcels of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and divers manifeſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of a <hi>Vulcan</hi>) whether the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Steams</hi> (that I ſuppos'd to be copious near the top of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104480:89"/>
Mountain) did not work upon the <hi>ſilver</hi> Money they had in their Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and diſcolour it: to which he anſwer'd that 'twas no uncommon Obſervation, to find at mens return from viſiting the top of the Hill, that the Money they carried about them was blackn'd, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had particularly obſerv'd it to be ſo: which might eaſily gain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with me, who have divers times made a preparation of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which, even in the cold, ſends out exhalations ſo penetrant, that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for tryals ſake put ſome pieces of Coyn (which ought not to be Golden) into a Leather Purſe; they were able, and that in not very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minutes, to diſcolour manifeſtly the Money, in ſpite of the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Purſe that contain'd it. But I had a more conſiderable inſtance of the efficacy of the Sulphureous Expirations of the <hi>Pico</hi> of <hi>Tenarif,</hi> by a ſober Perſon that is one of the chief Directours of the famous <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>-Company of <hi>London;</hi> who,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104480:89"/>
being queſtion'd by me about ſome circumſtances of his Journey to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the top of that ſtupendious Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, anſwer'd me, that among other effects the Sulphureous Air had upon him, (who is of a very fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion) he found at his return to the bottom, that his light-colour'd Hair had manifeſtly changed colour, and was in many places grown for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at the ends. Theſe Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may make it probable, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Exhalations</hi> may not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect humane Bodies, as they are drawn into the Lungs with the Air they ſwim in, but as they inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Pores of the Skin.</p>
                     <p>One conſiderable Objection I foreſee may be made, againſt the Propoſition I have been all this while endeavouring to render pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; namely, that 'tis ſcarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, that in ſo many Ages as <hi>Endemical Diſeaſes</hi> have afflicted ſome Countries, the Subterraneal Matter, to which I do in great part im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſome of them, ſhould not be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104480:90"/>
waſted and ſpent. I might perhaps on this occaſion move a doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have had ſuch continued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the temperature of the Air, of all the Countries where Diſeaſes are now <hi>Endemical,</hi> as to know that they have been always ſo; and that ſome of thoſe Diſeaſes have not been worn out here or there, and ſome others have not of later Ages begun to appear in this or that place. But contenting my ſelf at preſent to have hinted this Queſtion, I ſhall not ſtay to diſcuſs it; but proceed to offer three things, by way of direct anſwer to the Objection.</p>
                     <p>1. And firſt, I think it very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that divers Subterraneal Bodies that emit <hi>Effluvia,</hi> may have in them a kind of propagative or ſelf mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying power: I will not here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, whether this proceed from ſome ſeminal Principle, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chymiſts and others aſcribe to Metals, and even to ſtones, or (which is perhaps more likely) to ſomething analagous to a Firment, ſuch as in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104480:90"/>
Vegetables enables a little ſour dough to extend it ſelf through the whole Maſs; or ſuch, as when an Apple or Pear is bruis'd in one part, makes the putrify'd part by degrees to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute the ſound into it's own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or elſe ſome maturative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereby an inanimate Body may gradually admit of ſuch a change, or acquire ſuch Qualities, as may be in Mens eſtimate perfective of it, and perhaps give it a new denomination; as <hi>Anana</hi>'s in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and Medlars, and ſome other fruits here in <hi>Europe,</hi> do after they are gathered, acquire (as it were, ſpontaneouſly) in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, a conſiſtence and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſometimes Colour and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and in ſhort ſuch a ſtate as by one word we call <hi>maturity</hi> or <hi>ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> and ſo ſome Metalline Ores, and ſome Mineral Earths themſelves, have been obſerv'd by Mineralogiſts, to acquire in tract of time ſuch a change, as to afford ſome Metal or other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which either it did not afford before, or at leaſt did not afford
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104480:91"/>
ſo copiouſly, or ſo well qualify'd. This I have purpoſely made out in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paper: and the Obſervation particularly holds as to <hi>Niter,</hi> which is thought to be the moſt Catholick Foſſile we have; and to be at leaſt one of thoſe Foſſiles, that do the moſt plentifully emit <hi>Effluvia</hi> into the Air.</p>
                     <p>2. When I conſider, that even in thoſe Mines that are accounted deep ones, the Spades of Men are not wont to reach to the ten thouſandth part of the thickneſs of the Earth, between its Surface, and its Centre, which yet is but its Semi-diametre; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but confeſs, that we know very little of the Nature or Conſtitution of the lower part of the Terreſtrial Globe; ſince we know little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing experimentally, of what lyes beneath that Comparatively very thin Cruſt or Scurf, (if I may ſo call it) that Humane Induſtry has been hitherto confin'd to. And upon this account I do not think it abſurd to ſuſpect, that from the lower Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104480:91"/>
Regions there may be, either continually, or periodically, emitted into the Region of Mines (if I may ſo call it) great ſtore, and variety of Mineral Exhalations, which may continually repair the loſs of thoſe, that from time to time aſcend out of the Foſſile Region (as I may alſo call that of Mines) into the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. But the things I could alledge to Countenance this Conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, muſt not be inſiſted on in this place. Therefore I proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
                     <p>3. That Bodies ſo heavy, and conſequently ſo abundant in parts of ſolid matter crouded together, as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and other Foſſiles are wont to be, may well be ſuppos'd capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without deſtructively waſting themſelves to emit ſtore of ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Particles as <hi>Effluvia,</hi> for an exceeding long time. This will be eaſily granted by him that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the particulars laid together in a ſmall Tract, that I purpoſely writ, about the admirable Subtilty
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104480:92"/>
of <hi>Effluvia.</hi> And 'twill be the more eaſily believ'd, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd how long ſome Load-ſtones, ſever'd from their Mine, have been kept in the Air without any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or perhaps ſo much as ſenſible diminution of their Virtue. And this brings into my mind what an eminent Phyſician, who was skill'd in Perfumes, affirm'd to me about the durableneſs of an Effluviating power, that was not natural to a Metal, but adventitious, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by Art: for he aſſur'd me that he had a Silver Watch-caſe, that had been ſo well perfum'd, that though he uſually wore the Watch in his Pocket, it continued to be well ſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſixteen years. The ſame Perſon had a way of perfuming factitious Marble quite thorough, whoſe grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scent he affirm'd would laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; and of this perfum'd Marble he preſented me a Ball, which having been ſome months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gotten from me by a great Lady, I was diſabled from obſerving the durableneſs of the fragrancy.</p>

                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:104480:92"/>I might perhaps be thought wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to my Cauſe, if, before I diſmiſs the Propoſition I have been all this while diſcourſing of, I ſhould not obſerve, that Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia</hi> may contribute to <hi>Endemical Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> not only as they vitiate the Air, that Men breathe in, or are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately touch'd by; but as they may impregnate or deprave the Aliments that men feed upon. For firſt, they do mingle themſelves with the <hi>water,</hi> which either men drink it ſelf alone, (as is the Cuſtome with many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of ſome men in moſt Nations; or make of it their Bear, Ale, or other factitious drinks, prepar'd of <hi>Water</hi> and Barley, Oats, Rice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That divers Springs, and other Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are imbued with Mineral Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, may be judg'd by <hi>ſome</hi> of the Medicinal Springs: for, though divers <hi>Acidulae</hi> and <hi>Thermae</hi> afford good ſtore of palpable Sulphur or Salt, yet all do not; and having purpoſely examin'd a famous one, I could with a pair of nice Scales
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104480:93"/>
ſcarce diſcover any ſenſible diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all between the <hi>Medicinal Water,</hi> and the <hi>common Water</hi> that was to be met with thereabouts. And that which impregnated this, and which I found by tryal on my ſelf, and ſome other Bodies, enabl'd it to work very manifeſtly like a Mineral Water, was a ſort of Corpuſcles ſo minute and ſubtile, that if the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles were not kept well ſtopt, they would in a ſhort time vaniſh, and leave the Liquor diſpirited. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has aſſur'd me, that there are ways of making common water violently and hurtfully operative upon Humane Bodies, though its ſenſible qualities would not make one ſuſpect any change in it: but the ill uſe that bad men may make of ſuch Liquors, makes me forbear to expreſs my ſelf more clearly: nor is it neceſſary that I ſhould add any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing to confirm the propos'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, ſave what may be inferr'd from theſe two Particulars; the firſt whereof is the ſcarce at all ſenſible
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104480:93"/>
change that may be made in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſome other Liquors, that are made ſtrongly Emetick by <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Metallorum,</hi> and by Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vitrify'd without addition: and the ſecond may be taken from thoſe <hi>Averni,</hi> whence there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually aſcend ſuch pernicious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, as in ſome places intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or kill even the Birds that fly over thoſe poyſonous vents; for if ſuch Exhalations, or even far leſs deadly ones, ſhould (as they may be reaſonably ſuppos'd, ſometimes to do) meet with either running or ſtagnant Waters in their aſcent, there is little doubt to be made, but they will impregnate them, and make them noxious. And on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we may pertinently recall to mind, what I have formerly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd about a place upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Mud of a Ditch is ſo copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly impregnated with Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Exhalations, (whether they be bituminous, ſulphureous, or of ſome
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104480:94"/>
unknown kind) that they may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be fir'd at the ſurface of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Earth, and made to burn like a Candle, as an ingenious man did at my Requeſt ſucceſsfully try.</p>
                     <p>But there is another account, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the lower parts of the Earth may have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtroke in producing of Endemical Diſeaſes; namely, as they mingle with the Water, and other Liquors that are neceſſary to the nutrition and growth of Plants; and, by depraving thoſe juices, make the vegetables that are nouriſh'd by them unhealthy for the men that eat them, or make drinks of them: and theſe noxious Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be ſuppos'd in many places to impregnate the juices of the Earth, much more copiouſly than they do the running or ſtagnant Waters lately ſpoken of: becauſe the difficulty of pervading the Earth in their aſcent, may ſo long check them, as to make them very numerous in a ſmall ſpace, and perhaps make them convene into Bodies, ſo far of a Saline Nature as to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104480:94"/>
be diſſoluble either in common Water, or ſome other Subterraneal Liquor; by whoſe help, as by vehicles, they may inſinuate themſelves into the roots of Plants, and be thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to other parts. Divers things might be alledg'd to keep this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture from being improbable, if I had leiſure to inſiſt on them: but I I ſhall now only mention two things that on this occaſion come into my mind: the firſt whereof is, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of a famous Chymiſt, who liv'd in a Countrey abounding with Mines of Vitriol, whether he did not obſerve, that the Oaks growing over them were more ſolid, or heavy, than thoſe Trees are elſewhere wont to be; he anſwer'd me, that he did, and that the difference was remarkable: The other is, that the parts of ſome Minerals, (probably by reaſon of the ſmallneſs and ſolidity of the Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they conſiſt of) are capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating themſelves very plentifully into the pores of growing Vegetables, without being really ſubdu'd by what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104480:95"/>
Philoſophers are pleas'd to call the <hi>Concocting Faculty</hi> of the Plant; and, inſtead of being aſſimilated by the Vegetable, they retain their own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Nature, and upon the receſs or evaporation of the juice that ſerv'd them for a vehicle, may ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their being Mineral, even to an unaſſiſted Eye. For I remember I have ſeen a piece of a Vine, that grew not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> which being broken, I perceiv'd a multitude of the internal Pores of the root, and, if I miſtake not, part of the Trunk alſo, to be ſtuff't with Corpuſcles of a Marchaſitical Nature; as manifeſtly appear'd by their Colour, and their ſhining luſtre, and alſo by their weight.</p>
                     <p>There goes a Tradition among learned Men, that the leaves of Vines that grow in ſome places of <hi>Hungary,</hi> whoſe Mines afford Gold, are as it were gilt on the lower ſide, by aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Exhalations of a Golden Nature: whether this be true or no, I ſhall not take upon me to determine: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that having made enquiry
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104480:95"/>
about the truth of it, of a very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Traveller, whoſe Curioſity led him to viſit heedfully thoſe famous Mines: he told me, that he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he had obſerv'd what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported about the Leaves of the Vine: but he knew very well that at <hi>Tockay</hi> (a place that affords the famouſeſt Wine of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and indeed the beſt I have drunk) very many of the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of the Grapes would appear guilt over, as it were, with leaf gold. To what has been already diſcours'd, may be added, that ſince men are not wont to feed upon either Beaſts, or Birds of prey, as carnivorous Animals uſually are, but upon ſuch as live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Graſs, or Seeds, or other vegetable ſubſtances, and drink nothing but fair water; the noxious exhalations that make vegetables, and water unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, may by <hi>their</hi> means have a very bad influence upon Sheep, Cows, Deer, Pigeons and other Animals that ſeed upon ſuch deprav'd vegetables, and drink ſuch noxious waters; and conſequently may be very hurtfull to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104480:96"/>
thoſe men that feed upon ſuch Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and may by the deprav'd aliment they afford, determine them to an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Diſeaſe, ſuch as that vitiated nutriment is fitted to produce.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it will not ſeem improper to add on this occaſion, that 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that in certain places the latent Minerals may be of ſuch a Nature, as that their <hi>Effluvia</hi> may, inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting, hinder the Production of ſome particular Diſeaſe, whether E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical or Endemical in the Bodies of them that inhabit thoſe Places. For as Phyſicians obſerve that the more manifeſt morbifick cauſes of ſome ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, are quite contrary to thoſe of others, ſo I think it not improbable, that there may alſo be a mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety, between thoſe latent morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick cauſes, that are ſent up by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Agents. And therefore it need to be no wonder, if ſome of theſe ſhould either diſable thoſe to which they are Hoſtile, or ſhould at leaſt work in Humane Bodies a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition to admit their hurtfull
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104480:96"/>
Operations, which methinks thoſe Phyſicians and Chymiſts ſhould eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, who with a boldneſs that I do not applaud, preſcribe Amulets, wherein Arſenick, or ſome other poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Drug is employ'd, as preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from the Plague, againſt which, I doubt the chief Succours they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, proceeds from the Confidence or Fearleſneſs they give thoſe that wear them. But to return to our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal <hi>Effluvia,</hi> ſince there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers whole Countries, or leſſer pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that are either altogether, or in great part, free from this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diſeaſe; as in ſeveral parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> from Agues, eſpecially if I miſtake not Quartans, are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent, inſomuch that a learned Phyſician anſwer'd me, that in divers years practice he met not with above three or four, and in ſeveral large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the exceſſive heat of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the Plague is very rare: ſince (I ſay) theſe things are ſo, it ſeems not altogether improbable that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104480:97"/>
ſteaws may contribute to this advantage, by impregnating both the Air, the Earth, and the Water, with Corpuſcles endow'd with Qualities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to theſe Diſeaſes, which ſeems to be ſomewhat the more credible, becauſe it has been obſerv'd that ſome vaſt Tracts of Land will neither breed nor maintain venemous Creatures, as is undoubtedly believ'd of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where I confeſs I neither did ſee any alive, nor met with any other that did; for as to Spiders, though they breed in that Countrey, where I have ſeen many of them, and ſometimes even upon <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wood, yet they are unanimouſly believ'd not to be poyſonous there: And ſome Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tell us, how truly I know not, of ſome other Countries, to which they affirm the like Privilege to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. But there is one inſtance affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us by <hi>Begninus,</hi> who travel'd much to viſit Mines, which if it be ſtrictly true, is very notable for my preſent purpoſe. <hi>Dignum admiratione eſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>quod quamvis in vicinia Hydriae</hi>

                        <p>It is Likely, that divers Epidemical Diſeaſes are in great part produc'd by Subterraneal Effluvia.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Am very well aware, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Diſeaſes that extraordinarily invade great numbers of people at the ſame time; (and were therefore, by the Greeks called <hi>Epidemical</hi>) may be rationally refer'd to <hi>manifeſt Intemperateneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> in point of Heat, Cold, Moiſture, or ſome other <hi>Obvious Quality.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Propoſition</hi> ſpeaks but of <hi>ſome Epidemical Diſeaſes,</hi> and imputes thoſe it ſpeaks of to <hi>Subterraneal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia,</hi> not as <hi>total,</hi> but as <hi>partial,</hi> and ſometimes as <hi>principal, Agents</hi> in the production of them.</p>
                     <p>In favour of the propos'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture thus explain'd, I ſhall offer two things to Conſideration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:104480:99"/>I. And firſt, it ſeems not very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that divers of thoſe <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick Exceſſes</hi> (eſpecially if they be <hi>ſudden</hi>) that are obſerv'd in the <hi>Air,</hi> may proceed from the unuſually copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſcent of hurtfull <hi>Exhalations</hi> that mingle with the Air, and diffuſe themſelves through it. We are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Strangers than we commonly take notice of, to the <hi>Subterraneat</hi> part of the Globe we inhabit: and if I had leaſure, and thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, I could ſhew, that there are a great many odd and ſurprizing things to be met with in the Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diſpoſition even of thoſe parts of the Earth, that lie but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way beneath the ſurface of it, and partly have been, and partly may eaſily enough be, actually pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the induſtrious Labours of men. And as for the deeper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Regions, we are ſo much more unacquainted with them, that we are ſcarce fit ſo much as to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,</hi> how far they extend, or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104480:99"/>
what kind of Materials they contain, and what is the groſs, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) the Mechanical Fabrick of the greater Maſſes, whether ſolid or fluid, they conſiſt of: And leaſt of all can we determine what Motions, whether periodical, or others, theſe Maſſes, or other Portions of deeply lodg'd Matter, may have.</p>
                     <p>On ſuch grounds as theſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it poſſible, that, among the many and various Effluviating Bodies, that the terreſtrial Globe may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal in its Bowels, there may be ſome, whoſe reeks aſcending plentifully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air, may occaſion in it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Heat, Cold, Moiſture, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſome other manifeſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that ſometimes (not to ſay many times) even thoſe manifeſt Intemperateneſſes of the Air, to which an Epidemical Diſeaſe is wont to be wholly imputed, (though perhaps not very juſtly) may in part proceed from Subterraneal Bodies; for I elſewhere ſhew, that theſe by their Conflicts, or Mutual Actions on
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104480:100"/>
one another, may excite great and ſudden Heats, and on that account ſend up ſuch copious Steams into the Atmoſphere, as may produce there ſudden and exceſſive Heats, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Thunders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I ſhall now add (what perhaps will appear ſomewhat ſtrange) that I think ſudden and unſeaſonable Refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Air, may proceed from the action of Subterraneal Bodies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another: for Tryal purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made has inform'd me, that there are certain Minerals, whereof ſome may be employed in their crude Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and the other requires but a ſlight Preparation, ſuch as it may have in the Bowels of the Earth; which Minerals being put together, will produce by their Reaction an intenſe degree of Cold, not onely as to ſenſe, but when examined by a ſeal'd Weather-glaſs.</p>
                     <p>The Changes of the Air that produce <hi>Epidemical Diſeaſes</hi> are ſometimes ſo great and ſudden, that they cannot, in my Opinion, with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104480:100"/>
probability be imputed to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Sun,</hi> or the <hi>Moon,</hi> (which are cauſes that act in too general, and too uniform a way, to have thoſe <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>anomalous</hi> Effects at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Them;) as probably as they may be to <hi>Subterraneal</hi> Bodies, that often act with more ſuddenneſs and impetuoſity, and without any regularity, at leaſt that is known to us. The difference we find in Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that bear the ſame name, and ſhould be alike in temperature<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, is oftentimes very great, and ſometimes alſo very laſting. It is proverbially ſaid in <hi>England,</hi> that a <hi>Peck of March Duſt is worth a King's Ranſom:</hi> So unfrequent is dry Weather during that Month, in our Climate. And yet in ſome years, and particularly the laſt, 'twas a rare thing to have a ſhower either in <hi>March, April,</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> ſometimes in the Month laſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, there are Heats greater than in the Dog-days of that ſame Year; though uſually here in <hi>England,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Mornings of that Month are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104480:101"/>
cold, and ſome of them froſty. And now and then I have obſerv'd in the ſame Months and Days, at no great diſtance from one another, that the Weather has been ſultry hot, and has alſo produc'd a great Snow. We have ſeen Summers like that which is remember'd for the Siege of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> that for almoſt the whole Seaſon, where more dark and rainy, than ſeveral Winters have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be. To which purpoſe I remember, that when I was about to write the Hiſtory of Cold, I was fain to watch almoſt a whole Winter to find two or three froſty days, to make an Experiment or two I had need of, that requir'd not a Cold that was either laſting or very intenſe. But Inſtances of this kind are ſo obvious, to thoſe that are at all heedfull Obſervers, that I may ſafely paſs them by, and inculcate that the Sun being in the ſame Signs, at the ſame Times of the Year, it does not appear, how He ſhould produce ſo great a diſparity
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104480:101"/>
of the temperature of the Air in Seaſons of the ſame denomination; (as the Winters or the Summers of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and yet perhaps immediately conſecutive, Years.) And therefore I do not ſo much wonder, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Learned Writers fly to Aſtrology for an account of theſe irregular <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi> and aſcribe them to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of certain Stars; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what divers eminent Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and ſome great Aſtronomers too, have ſaid to prove the vanity of Judiciary Aſtrology.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not now ſtay to diſcuſs the Queſtion, <hi>whether the Stars have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny influence diſtinct from their Light and Heat:</hi> becauſe, my Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it being ſomewhat peculiar, I have diſcourſed of it in a Paper by it ſelf. But this I ſhall now ſay, that the fixt Stars being but general, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) indefinite Agents, almoſt unimaginably remote from us, 'tis nothing near <hi>ſo</hi> likely that ſuch Effects as (beſides that they happen very ſuddenly and irregular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104480:102"/>
are oftentimes confin'd to a Town, or ſome other narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, ſhould be produc'd by certain Stars: <hi>as</hi> that they ſhould be ſo by Subterraneal Bodies, which are near at hand, of very various natures, and ſubject to many irregular and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Motions, commixtures, reacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other alterations. I have known a great Cold in a day or two invade Multitudes in the ſame City, with <hi>violent,</hi> and as to many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>fatal</hi> Symptomes; when I could not judge, (as others alſo did not) that the bare coldneſs of the Air could ſo ſuddenly produce a Diſeaſe ſo Epidemical and hurtfull: and it appear'd the more probable, that the cauſe came from under ground, by reaſon that it began with a very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Fog.</p>
                     <p>That there may be many Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Bodies, which by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures may produce a ſudden Heat, will be eaſily granted by thoſe that know, (what I elſewhere purpoſely make out) that there are Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104480:102"/>
                        <hi>Menſtruums;</hi> and are acquainted with Chymical Operations, ſuch as the great efferveſcence made, when Oil of Vitriol is put upon filings of Iron, or Spirit of Niter upon But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Antimony; to which I might add many other of the like kind that I have tryed, as when Spirit of Niter is put upon filings, either of Iron, Copper, or Tin, or upon crude Quickſilver; which I ſhall content my ſelf to have nam'd, becauſe I have another Inſtance that comes clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to our preſent purpoſe. For whereas I have ſhewn above, that there is in many places great ſtore of Marcaſitical matter beneath the ſurface of the Earth, and ſometimes very near it; I ſhall now add that I have purpoſely tryed, that putting a little Spirit drawn from Niter, (with which Salt the Earth in many places abounds) or a litle Oil of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, upon powder'd Marcaſites (which being hard Stones are more difficultly wrought upon, than many other Subterxaneous marcaſitical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104480:103"/>
of a looſer texture) there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently enſued a ſtrong reaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Liquid and the Solid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whereby was produc'd much heat, not without viſible fumes, and Strongly Scented, though not viſible, Exhalations. And ſuch kind of Odorous <hi>Effluvia</hi> were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, upon the putting a little Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt upon our Powder'd Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſites. And becauſe Sulphur is a mineral that (either pure, or copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly mix'd with others) is to be plentifully met with in the Bowels of the Earth, and in many places burns there, I ſhall add, that I have found acid Spirit of Sulphur (made the common way) to work ſenſibly upon marcaſitical matter, hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough coagulated. An experienc'd German Chymiſt relates, that in ſome parts of his Country he met with Vitriol Stones, or Marcaſites, that, by the action of mere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water reſting a competent time upon them, will grow ſo hot as to enable the Liquor to retain a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104480:103"/>
ſenſible Heat, when it had paſs'd a pretty way from them. And, <hi>as</hi> I elſewhere ſhew, that many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents may occaſion the breaking out of Waters, or the change of their courſe in Subterraneal Places; <hi>So,</hi> that common Water may produce in a very ſhort time conſiderable degrees of Heat in Mineral Bodies, may appear by mixing with two or three pounds of fine Powder of common Brimſtone a convenient quantity, (for now I remember not well how much I took) of filings of Iron, for this mixture being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly drench'd with common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did in a ſhort time grow intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hot, and ſend up ſuch a thick Smoke as good quicklime is wont to doe, whilſt men Slake it with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable to our preſent purpoſe, what account was given me by a Domeſtick of mine, that liv'd in the North part of England, of a certain Mineral Groove which he had often occaſion to reſort to: for,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104480:104"/>
when I ask'd whether the Damp that place was moleſted with, did frequently recurr; he anſwer'd me, that at the time he was there it would annoy the workmen, (if they did not take good care of themſelves) more than once in one day. And by Enquiries that I made of others that were converſant in Mines, I learn'd, that in divers places they were moleſted with Damps, that came not at ſtated Periods, but irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly; ſometimes with much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſometimes with far leſſer, Intervals between them: the times of their duration being alſo not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unequal. So that, ſuppoſing ſuch noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> to be plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully emitted from the lower parts of the Soil, it need be no wonder, that an <hi>Epidemical</hi> Diſeaſe ſhould be riſe in this or that particular Town or part of a Country, without ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much farther; and that it ſhould begin ſuddenly in places where it was not expected: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that theſe ſwarms of <hi>Effluvia,</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:104480:104"/>
being produc'd by caſual concourſes of Circumſtances, may oftentimes be excited, and invade this or that place, without giving the Inhabitants any warning, beſides this, I ſay, 'tis not always neceſſary that theſe noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> ſhould be generated juſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the places they moleſt, ſince the motion of the Air, eſpecially when the Wind ſits favourably, may ſuffice to carry them to the Town or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place that feels their ill effects: and yet they may ſeem to be almoſt confin'd to thoſe places; ſometimes becauſe the neighbouring places are not inhabited enough to make their ill qualities taken notice of; but more frequently becauſe, by being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd thorough a greater tract of Air, they are more and more diſperſt in their paſſage, and thereby ſo diluted (if I may ſo ſpeak) and weakn'd, as not to be able to doe any notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous miſchief.</p>
                     <p>And here I Conſider too, that 'tis not always neceſſary that the harm that is done by theſe morbid
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104480:105"/>
Conſtitutions of the Air, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed onely or preciſely from theſe Subterraneal Exhalations we are ſpeaking of, by virtue onely of their own qualities, which they bring with them from under ground. For 'tis very poſſible, that theſe <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia</hi> may be in their own nature either innocent enough, or at leaſt not conſiderably hurtfull, and yet may become very noxious, if they chance to find the Air already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu'd with certain Corpuſcles fit to aſſociate with them: for, though theſe ſorts of Particles were perhaps neither of them a-part conſiderably hurtfull, yet there may from their Combinations reſult Corpuſcles, of a new and very morbifick nature.</p>
                     <p>This may be ſomewhat illuſtrated by conſidering, that the ſpirituous ſteams of Salt-peter are not wont ſenſibly to work on Gold, nor yet the ſpirituous Parts that the Fire rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from <hi>Sal-armoniac;</hi> and yet when theſe two ſorts of Particles convene, there reſults from their Coalitions
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104480:105"/>
certain Corpuſcles of a new nature, that compoſe the Liquor Chymiſts call <hi>Aqua Regis;</hi> which by its fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting quality corrodes and diſſolves Gold. By Analogy to this we may conceive, that ſometimes the Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal <hi>Effluvia</hi> may find the Air al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready impregnated with ſuch Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, that by aſſociating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therewith they may compoſe Corpuſcles far more capable, than themſelves were whilſt apart, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ill Effects upon the Maſs of Bloud, or ſome determinate Parts of Humane Bodies, and conſequently of produceing Diſeaſes there.</p>
                     <p>And this Inſtance may appear the more appoſite; becauſe it may be ſaid, that <hi>as,</hi> though Silver and Gold, and Diamonds and Rubies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be put together, and <hi>Aqua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> be pour'd upon them, it will leave all the reſt uncorroded, and fall onely upon the Gold; <hi>ſo</hi> the newly produc'd Corpuſcles that I have been ſpeaking of, whether brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in with the Air in Reſpiration,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104480:106"/>
or carried up and down by the Bloud, or other Liquors of the Body, may paſs by other parts of it without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them any ſenſible harm, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking this or that determinate part, produce there ſome Diſeaſe ſuch as the fabrick and ſituation of that part peculiarly diſpoſe it to be affected with.</p>
                     <p>And I ſhall add on this occaſion, that in our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> we may render a probable reaſon, why in ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical Diſeaſes, ſome perſons may eſcape much better than other, that ſeem likely to be, at beſt, as obnoxious to them, without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the peculiar Conſtitutions of the Bodies of differing Perſons; for it may be conjectur'd, that the noxious Corpuſcles that infeſt the Air, may (eſpecially in windy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) be very unequally diſperc'd through the Air, and many fly in far greater or leſſer numbers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in equal ſpaces of Air; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Perſons, that have the ill luck to be in the way of the more
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104480:106"/>
numerous ſwarms of morbifick Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, may be much more prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them than others, though of weaker conſtitutions, who happen to be attaqu'd but by few of them.</p>
                     <p>On which occaſion, I remember, that a great many Trees in ſome Land that belongs to me, having been ſuddenly much endamag'd by a wind, that was not able to doe it by it's bare ſtrength; I had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to view ſomewhat heedfully a Tree that ſtood in the Garden, and perceiv'd that all the conſiderable miſchief was done to that ſide of the Tree, which reſpected the corner whence the hurtfull Wind blew, the Leaves of the other ſide continuing freſh and verdant, as being by the other part of the ſame Tree fenc'd from the Wind: and it was farther obſerv'd, that even the expos'd ſide of the Tree was not every-where endamag'd; for there were divers parts, where the Leaves continued ſound and green, though neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Leaves were ſome more, ſome
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104480:107"/>
leſs (for all that were prejudic'd were not totally) blaſted: the ſound Leaves and the diſcolour'd being ſo odly mingled, that I conjectur'd the cauſe of the miſchief to have been this; that ſome Arſenical or other corroſive or poiſonous Exhalations, being ſuddenly emitted from the Subterraneal parts into the Air, were by the Wind they chance to meet with there, hurry'd along with it, and blown againſt the Bodies that ſtood in it's way, moving in the Air, like Hail-ſhot diſcharg'd out of a Gun, here in a cloſer, and there in a more ſcattering order, ſo that as more or fewer of them happend to fall upon the ſame Branch or Leafe, they left more, or leſs marks of their paſſage, by deſtroying the texture and colour in the Leaves or parts of them they chanc'd to beat upon. And this may poſſibly be the cauſe of ſome of thoſe ſudden and ſometimes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Effects, that I have known in ſome places the people talk much of, complaining, that ſuch a one had his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104480:107"/>
Eyes, or his Face, or onely one ſide of it blaſted, by a malignant Wind, of which I thought I ſaw an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a Domeſtick of my own, whilſt in ſuch a Wind he was riding after me, who (thanks be to God) had no ſuch miſchief done me.</p>
                     <p>But the Vulgar have entertain'd ſuch ſtrange Conceits and Stories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe Blaſtings, on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſome of them ſay that Men are <hi>Planet-ſtruck</hi> that the fabulous things mingled with thoſe that are poſſible, have made intelligent Perſons reject them all.</p>
                     <p>One thing more I ſhall take notice of in favour of our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> which is, that it well agrees with what has been obſerved, not without ſome wonder, of the very ſhort duration of ſome Epidemical Diſeaſes, in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Times and Places. For this may proceed from hence, either that all the Morbifick Expirations aſcended into the Air almoſt at once, or at leaſt within a ſhort time, and ſo were eaſily ſpent, that is by diffuſion or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104480:108"/>
diſperſion ſo weakned, as to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from doing much miſchief: or elſe the Subterraneal Commotion that produc'd them may paſs on from one place to another, and ſo ceaſe to afford the Air incumbent on the firſt place, the ſupplies neceſſary to keep it impregnated with noxious Exhalations. And it agrees well with this Conjecture, that ſometimes we may obſerve certain Epidemical Diſeaſes to have as it were a progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Motion, and leaving one Town free paſs on to another. Of which ſome Obſervations that I have made, encline me to think, that if Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians would heedfully mind it, they might take notice of ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p>One thing more may be added, as conſonant to our <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> namely, that ſometimes an Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſeaſe ceaſes in this or that place, almoſt as ſudden as it invaded, or at leaſt in a much ſhorter time than Phyſicians expected. For according to our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it may well happen,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104480:108"/>
that after one ſort of Exhalations, whoſe peculiar Qualities make them Morbifick, have deprav'd the Air incumbent on a particular place; there may by a new or farther Commotion of Subterraneal Bodies, be ſent up into the Air ſtore of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations of another kind, which meeting with thoſe that formerly impregnated it, may either precipitate them, and ſo free the Air from them; or by other operations on them, and ſometimes even by Coalitions with them, ſo alter their nature as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them from doing any farther miſchief.</p>
                     <p>This I ſhall illuſtrate, if not confirm, by that very remarkable <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> that is yearly obſerv'd at <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> for, (though I know not whether or no the Corpuſcles that produce it ariſe from under Ground, the affirmative part of the Queſtion being not improbable) it appears, that by the intermixture of adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Corpuſcles, with the formerly Peſtilential Air, 'tis ſo alter'd and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104480:109"/>
corrected, that within one day or two, if not within a leſſer compaſs of time, there is a ſtop put to the progreſs of the Plagues; that in that favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time of year, namely about the middle of Summer, ſcarce ever miſſes of raging in that populous City: and, which is more admirable, theſe ſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Corpuſcles (if I may ſo call them) operate ſo powerfully, that of thoſe that are already ſeiz'd by that fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of Diſeaſes, the <hi>Plague,</hi> few or none die of it, after once theſe Antidotal Particles have ſufficiently impregnated the Air. I confeſs ſo great and ſudden a change is very wonderfull, and I ſhould ſcarce think it credible, if I had not had the means and curioſity to enquire about it of divers perſons, ſome of them very intelligent, that either curiouſly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, or alſo made ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtay in, that great City; and found them agree in the main about the truth of the matter of fact; which is much confirm'd to me by ſo eminent a Teſtimony as that of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104480:109"/>
learned <hi>Proſper Alpinus,</hi> who for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years practis'd Phyſick in <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> and as an Eye-witneſs delivers what he relates more authentically, as well as more particularly, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I have met with. And, though he endeavours to give ſeveral reaſons of this ſtrange and ſudden ceſſation of the malignity of the Plague, yet I doubt they are not ſufficient for ſo wonderfull an effect; unleſs we take in ſome new Exhalations, that then impregnate and correct the Air.</p>
                     <p>And we ſhall ſcarce doubt of the great intereſt theſe have in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect produc'd, if we give credit to what the recenteſt Writer I have met with of Voyages into <hi>Egypt,</hi> has lately publiſh'd about the annual Peſtilence at <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> a City he much frequented. This Authour, in the account he gives of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of <hi>Egypt,</hi> relates that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after the middle of our <hi>June</hi> (and uſually upon the very ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day) there begin to fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the laſt quarter of the night,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104480:110"/>
near the morning, certain drops of a kind of Dew, which cauſes the River to be fruitfull, and purifies the Air from all the Infection of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſims,</hi> by which I preſume he means the <hi>Peſtilence:</hi> for after ſome lines interpos'd he ſubjoins, <hi>The Drops or Dew purifies the Air, for as ſoon as it falls the Plague ceaſes to be mortal, none dies of it; the Air is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, all Diſtempers ceaſe, and if any perſon grows ſick, he never dies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then, he adds, <hi>This Dew gives life to every thing; and when it falls upon the Wheat, it cauſeth it to continue many years without corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Worms, and is far more nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than that Corn on which it never falls. For this cauſe they never houſe the Corn of the Grand Seignior in the Barns, till this Dew is fallen upon it, that it might keep the longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Worms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As well this Conjecture, as ſome other things deliver'd here and there in this Paper (about the <hi>Salubrity of the Air,</hi>) may probably gain the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104480:110"/>
more credit, if I here ſubjoin what I learn'd by inquiry from a very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Gentleman, who was owner of one or more of the Mines, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> I am to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which is this, That in the Tin-mine Countreys in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> it ſometimes happens, (as perhaps I may have elſewhere noted to another purpoſe,) that upon a ſudden, a Spot of ground, and that not always nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, will be as 'twere blaſted by the aſcending hurtfull Fumes; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that not onely the Graſs, Fern and other more tender Vegetables, will be turned black, and as it were burnt or ſcorched up; but now and then Trees alſo, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Oaks themſelves will be blaſted and ſpoil'd by the powerfull Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe ſubtil and poiſonous <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will probably be here expected, that among the Epidemical Diſeaſes that our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> derives from Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia,</hi> I ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly treat of the cauſe of <hi>Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential</hi>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:104480:111"/>
                        <hi>Fevers,</hi> and the <hi>Plague</hi> it ſelf. But, though ſome ſuch <hi>Fevers</hi> may not improbably be in great part im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the noxious Expirations of the Globe we inhabit; yet, as to the true <hi>Plague</hi> it ſelf, I freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I am at a loſs about it's Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
                     <p>The ſacred Writings expreſly teach, that ſome Plagues, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that which in <hi>David</hi>'s time ſwept away in three days 70000 Perſons, have been in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner inflicted by God. And to me it appears either ſcarce poſſible, or far more difficult than thoſe that have not attentively enough conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the matter, are wont to think it; To deduce the abſtruce Origine, ſtrange Symtomes, and other odd <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of ſome Plagues that are recorded in Hiſtory, from merely Corporeal Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, it ſeems unphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical, and perhaps rather ſeems than is very pious, to recur with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an abſolute neceſſity to Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104480:111"/>
Cauſes, for ſuch Effects as do not manifeſtly exceed the power of Natural ones: though the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner of their being produc'd, is perchance more than we are yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble clearly to explicate. And I think it the more queſtionable, whether all Plagues are Supernatural Exertions of God's Power and Wrath againſt the Wicked, becauſe I obſerve that <hi>Brutes</hi> (which are as well uncapable of moral Vice, as moral Vertue) are yet oftentimes ſubject to <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rains,</hi> ſuch as may without incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity be lookt upon as the <hi>Peſtilences of Beaſts.</hi> And 'tis the leſs likely, that theſe ſweeping and contagious Maladies ſhould be always ſent for the puniſhment of impious men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I remember to have read in good Authours, that, as ſome Plagues deſtroy'd both Men and Beaſts, ſo ſome other did peculiarly deſtroy Brute Animals, of very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration or uſe to Men, as Cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:104480:112"/>Upon theſe and the like Reaſons I have ſometimes ſuſpected, that in the Controverſie about the Origine of the Plague, namely, Whether, it be Natural, or Supernatural; neither of the contending Parties is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the right: ſince 'tis very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that ſome Peſtilences may not break forth, without an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, though perhaps not Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, interpoſition of Almighty God, provok'd by the Sins of Men: and yet other Plagues may be produc'd by a Tragical concourſe of merely Natural Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>though</hi> the difficulties that incumber each of the oppoſite Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, keep me both from Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically aſſerting, that All Plagues have a Supernatural Origine; and from denying that Any have it: <hi>yet,</hi> to ſay ſomething on ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, though I can ſpeak but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heſitantly, I ſhall venture to add, that, whether or no the true Plague be ſaid to deſcend to the Earth from a higher Sphere than that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104480:112"/>
of Nature; yet its Propagation and Effects are (at leaſt for the moſt part) carry'd on mainly by a malignant diſpoſition in the Air; without which ſome Plagues could never have been ſo catching as they were, nor ſo ſuddenly mortal; and that in divers Peſtilences this malignant Diſpoſition in the Air, may probably be in great part imputed to ſome kinds of Subterraneal Expirations, I am prone to think; and that chiefly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two Accounts.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> thing that induces me to this Conjecture, is, that not any of the ſeveral Cauſes to which the Plague is wont to be imputed ſeems to me to be ſufficient. Thoſe that fetch it from the malevolent aſpects and influence of the Celeſtial lights, beſides that they ſuppoſe ſome things very difficult to be prov'd, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Agents too remote, too general, and too indeterminate, to be acquieſc'd in as the Cauſes of ſuch particular Symtomes and <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> as oftentimes accompany Peſtilences.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104480:113"/>
And as for thoſe other Sects of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians that confidently derive the Plague, ſome from Internal Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and others from exceſſive Heats, noiſome Stinks, Corrupt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments, and ſuch other Celebrated Cauſes; though each party alledges plauſible Reaſons for its own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet their objections againſt their adverſaries are much ſtronger than their arguments are for themſelves. And the Learned <hi>Diemer-broeck,</hi> though his own Hypotheſis ſeem to be more Theological than Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical, has much enervated the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought for the ſeveral opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions lately nam'd, and by him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons he employs to refute all the receiv'd opinions about the Origine of the Plague, except his own, are divers of them worthy of ſo learned a man; to whom, though I had leiſure to tranſcribe them, I ſhould refer the Curious: my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſign being onely to deliver ſome few things that ſeem more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104480:113"/>
to my Conjectures, than to his Opinion, and were ſuggeſted to me, partly by my own Thoughts, and partly by the informations, that, to examine thoſe Thoughts, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by conſulting ſome uncommon Authours, and asking Queſtions of great Travellers and Navigatours. By this means I came to learn, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers great Countries are uſually free from the Plague, that according to the vulgar <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> ought to be as much ſubject to it, if not more, than <hi>England, France, Italy,</hi> and thoſe other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> where that fatal Diſeaſe rages from time to time in the parched Regions of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> to which the Exceſſive Heats would make one expect, that the Plagues ſhould make far more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits than to our temperate European Countries; <hi>Leo Africanus</hi> informs us, that ſome parts are ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom afflicted with that dreadfull Diſeaſe, that it uſually ſpares the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants 29, or 30 years together.

[<hi>Peſtis morbus eſt Indiarum Incolis incognitus</hi>] <hi>The Plague is a Diſeaſe unknown amongſt the Indians.</hi> And of the Countries that lie yet more remote, as the great Empire of <hi>China,</hi> and the Kingdoms of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> and of <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> that great Traveller <hi>Alexander de Rhodes,</hi> who ſpent 30 years in thoſe parts, affirms, that the Plague is not ſo much as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of there. And yet the ſame Jeſuit does, upon grounds probable enough, eſtimate the number of the people of <hi>China</hi> alone to be two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty millions; [a number I take to exceed by far that of all the Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi>] Now when I conſider, how vaſt Tracts of Land are compriz'd in thoſe Countries, ſome of which the Plague does not at all, and others but exceeding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently, invade; this Immunity ſeems to me very unfavourable to moſt, if not all, the opinions receiv'd among Phyſicians, as alſo that of <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> himſelf who derives the Plague from a <hi>Supernatural Cauſe,</hi>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:104480:115"/>
                        <hi>the wrath of God againſt the ſins of men.</hi> For in Regions of ſuch extent, and divers of them very populous, which are ſeated under very differing Climats, and which are ſome of them inhabited by Nations, that make war with numerous Armies, fight bloudy battels, leave heaps of unbury'd Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies expos'd to the putrefying heat of the Sun; are ſometimes forc'd, as well as others to live upon very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted and unwholſome foods; that worſhip ſtocks and ſtones, and beaſts, and ſome of them Devils, whom they know to be ſuch; that are at leaſt as guilty as Europeans, of Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinats, Poiſonings, Rapes, Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sodomy, and other crying Sins: in theſe Regions, I ſay, 'tis not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable but that great Intemperatures of the Air, eſpecially, in point of Heat, Stench of dead Bodies kill'd in fights, unwholſomneſs of Aliments, malevolent aſpects of Celeſtial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, high provocations of the divine Juſtice, and in ſhort, all the Cauſes, to one or other of which the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104480:115"/>
parties of Phyſicians are wont to refer the Plague, ſhould be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any more than in our <hi>Europe;</hi> and yet the Plague which is preſum'd to be the Effect of one or other of thoſe Cauſes, is not here obſerved to be produc'd.</p>
                     <p>I know that it may be ſaid, that the Hiſtorical things I have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing, do not onely oppugn the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral receiv'd Opinions of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans about the cauſe of the Plague, but disfavour my Conjectures too. But if this be ſaid, I deſire it may alſo be conſider'd, that my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about the Plague conſiſts of two Parts; <hi>One,</hi> that 'tis exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficult to aſſign the true and adequate Cauſe of the Origine of the Peſtilence; and the <hi>Other,</hi> that whatever be the Cauſe of its Firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, its Propagation and divers of its Symptomes, may be probably enough refer'd to the depravation of the Air by Subterraneal Steams, and their Effects. If this be duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd the Hiſtorical Obſervations
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104480:116"/>
will appear not to overthrow the <hi>Firſt</hi> member of our Hypotheſis, but rather to confirm it: and 'tis upon this account that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd them in this place. And as to the <hi>Second</hi> member it may be ſaid, that ſince in the Eaſt <hi>Indies</hi> and the other Countries, I have nam'd, as privileg'd from this raging Diſeaſe, it is not obſerv'd to break out: as it cannot be ſaid that Subterraneal <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia</hi> do in thoſe Countries promote the Propagation of it; ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prov'd that they could not doe it, incaſe the Plague were begun by other Cauſes. But in regard I think it not improbable that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Plague is not onely fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but begun by noxious Expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Terreſtrial Globe, I ſhall add that this ſuppoſition, though I confeſs it be ſomewhat disfavour'd by ſome of the lately mention'd Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, yet is not abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with them. For Firſt, it may be ſaid that ſome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries I ſpeak of, may be deſtitute of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104480:116"/>
thoſe noxious minerals to which we impute ſome Plagues, it holding true in Minerals as well as in Plants. <hi>Non omnis fert omnia tellus,</hi> and to omit what I have not without ſome wonders obſerv'd, of the Limits of differing ſorts of Mines and Mineral Veins in very bordering parts of the ſame tract of Land, I cannot but here take notice, that though Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur be in many Countries uſually found, and that in plenty where there are other Metalline Veins, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Chymiſts make it one of the three Principles of all Metals, yet in the Mines of <hi>England</hi> more ſtrictly ſo call'd, I do not remember I ever met with ſo much as an Ounce of Native Sulphur, and I could not find by divers Mineraliſts, of whom I purpoſely ask'd the queſtion that they had met with any among the various Mines they had frequented. It may alſo happen that there may be hurtfull Minerals in a Countrey, and yet not capable of often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing or promoting Peſtilences
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104480:117"/>
there, even upon moderate Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes. For 'tis poſſible that theſe Orpimental or other Noxious Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals may have their Beds or Veins lying ſo deep in the Earth, that they are not ordinarily able to ſend up <hi>Effluvia,</hi> ſtrong and copious enough to make a Peſtilential depravation of the Air, and even in leſſer Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes the commotion or agitation of the ground, eſpecially if the Earth-quakes proceed (as one may ſuſpect that divers of them do) from the ſudden fall of ponderous Maſſes in the hollow parts of the Earth and the ſhakings of the ground thereby produc'd, and ſometimes ſpreading far, may not reach ſo far downwards as much to affect theſe very deep Mines, and yet ſome other more violent Earthquakes, may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect even theſe; upon which ground one may give ſome tolerable account why the Plague in ſome parts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> has been obſerv'd to rage but once in thirty or once in an hundred years; for there may be periodical
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104480:117"/>
Paroxyſms, if I may ſo call them, or grand and vehement Commotions in Subterraneal Parts, though men have not yet, for want of ſufficient Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity or Curioſity obſerv'd them. On which occaſion, I remember that a late judicious French Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an recounts that in part of the laſt age, and part of this, a very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Diſeaſe of the nature of a Colick raign'd in <hi>France</hi> every tenth year for a long tract of time. And the Experienc'd <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2. P. M. 323.</note> 
                        <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> relates, that at <hi>Baſil,</hi> where with great ſucceſs he practis'd Phyſick fifty ſix years, the City was afflicted with furious Plagues once about every tenth year for ſeventy years together, of each of which Peſtilences he gives a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account in his uſefull obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It may alſo farther be ſaid, that thoſe Exhalations in the Eaſt <hi>Indies, &amp;c.</hi> that would otherwiſe be peſtiferous, may be corrected by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expirations that may be either of benign nature, or of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104480:118"/>
as though noxious in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may fit them by combining with thoſe that would be peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to diſable them to be ſo, as I elſewhere obſerv'd out of <hi>Beguinus,</hi> that a Countrey abounding in veins and maſſes of Cinnabar, which is the Ore of Quickſilver, was preſerv'd from the Plague, when the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Regions were waſted by it; and I ſhall illuſtrate this matter ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what farther by taking notice, that though Corroſive Sublimate be ſo miſchievous a Mineral Compoſition, that a few grains may kill a man, yet the fumes of this combin'd with thoſe of <hi>Crude,</hi> common Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which are themſelves unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome enough, make <hi>Mercurius dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> which is a mixture ſo innocent, that being well prepar'd, and well adminiſtred, it is both ſafely and uſefully given even to Children.</p>
                     <p>If what has been ſaid will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I ſhall propoſe another poſſible way of accounting for the immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome Countries from the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104480:118"/>
Plague. For one may conceive that in ſuch Regions the Soil, and other aſſiſting Cauſes may conſtantly produce in the Air ſuch a Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is found in the Air of <hi>Egypt,</hi> during the time of the increaſe, and overflowing of <hi>Nile,</hi> which uſually laſts every year for ſeveral weeks, for during this time the Air is ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipeſtilential, that not only the Plague does not make a new Eruption; but is either wonderfully check'd or quite ſuppreſs'd in thoſe houſes that it has already invaded, ſo that its mortal infection reaches no farther, and that it may not be thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible that ſome Countries may have, if I may ſo ſpeak, an antido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Nature, in reference to ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Evils, I ſhall repreſent that there are ſome whole Countries which are privileg'd from producing Vipers, Toads, and other venemous Creatures, as is vulgarly known con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> where I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee any ſuch, nor find by Enquiry of either the Natives, or Engliſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104480:119"/>
that they had met with any in that Kingdom, where 'tis an uncontroll'd tradition, that if Poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Creatures have been carefully brought there from other Parts, they have died almoſt as ſoon as they came thither. There are ſome other Iſlands to which a like hoſtility to vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Animals is aſcrib'd: and as it ſeems not inpoſſible that ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſhould have a Soil that ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnats the Air as to make it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or quite enervate many differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorts of Poyſons, ſo others may by their Conſtitution be qualify'd to maſter or reſiſt poiſonous Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or wandering Corpuſcles that elſewhere are wont to produce the Plague. And this may ſuffice for the firſt thing whereon we ground our Hypotheſis.</p>
                     <p>The Second thing that invited me to the above propos'd Suſpicion or Conjecture, is, That it affords a not improbable account of ſome conſiderable things, relating to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104480:119"/>
Production and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Plague.</p>
                     <p>(1.) As <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'tis obſerv'd that ſometimes the Plague breaks out, when there has not preceded any ſuch immoderate diſtemper of the Air, or any caſual Enormity capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of producing ſo great and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous an Effect. Nay, which is more, it has been obſerv'd, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and unuſual intemperateneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Air have ſeveral times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and divers notable and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Aſpects of the Stars have been noted by good Writers without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing follow'd by the Plague. The celebrated <note n="*" place="margin">De abditis rerum cauſ. lib. 2. c. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Fernelius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that near the time he writ this Obſervation, that Year, which of all thoſe that had paſs'd in the memory of Man, was all the World over the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately hot, and was yet moſt healthfull. And the ſame Authour reports the Plague to have begun in the midſt of Winter, and to have gone off in Summer, and that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104480:120"/>
times ardent Summers have been altogether free from the Plague: which I alſo have noted to be true. <hi>Johannes Morellus</hi> obſerves, that in his Countrey after a dry Winter, and wherein the North Wind reign'd, though it were ſucceeded by a moſt temperate and healthfull Spring, yet this brought in the Plague, and that, when the North Wind was predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the Air pure and ſincere. Which I the leſs ſcruple to believe, becauſe I obſerv'd ſomething very like it in the Conſtitutions of the Air, that preceded and accompany'd the dreadfull <hi>London</hi> Plague that broke out in the year 1665. Which <hi>Phaenomena</hi> much disfavour their Opinion that impute the Plague to the exceſſes of the manifeſt Qualities of the Air; but are agreeable to our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> ſince by what has been formerly deliver'd, we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Noxious Subterraneal Fumes may be ſuddenly, and without any warning belch'd up into the Air, and, by depraving it, produce
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104480:120"/>
fatal Diſeaſes in many of thoſe that are conſtantly ſurrounded by it, and draw it in, almoſt every moment, with their breath.</p>
                     <p>Of the deadly Hurtfulneſs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Subterraneal Expirations, at their firſt Eruption, there are many Hiſtories extant in approv'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours: And we have obſerv'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of that ſort, in the Times and Countries we live in. But, becauſe all Poiſonous, and even mortal, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations are not therefore truly Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiferous, but may, like many other Poiſons, kill the Perſons they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately invade, without qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to infect others; I ſhall add a Paſſage out of that Excellent Hiſtorian <q>
                           <hi>Monſieur de Mezeray</hi> who relates in the life of <hi>Philip de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois,</hi> that the Plague that happened in <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1346. was ſo contageous and deſtructive, that ſcarce a Village, or even a Houſe, eſcap'd uninfected by it. He adds, that this Peſtilence, than which none had been obſerv'd more furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104480:121"/>
and ſpreading, began two years before in the Kingdom of <hi>Cathay,</hi> by a vapour that was moſt horribly ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which brake out of the Earth like a kind of Subterraneal fire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd and devour'd above 200 Leagues of that Countrey, even to the very Trees and Stones, and infected the Air in a wonderfull manner. <hi>From Cathay,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>it paſs'd into Aſia and Greece, thence into Africk, afterwards into Europe, which it ranſack'd throughout.</hi>
                        </q> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtances, of Peſtilences begun by noxious Subterraneal Fumes, I have met with in good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours;<note place="margin">See <hi>Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broeck de Peſte, lib. 1. cap.</hi> 8.</note> but cannot now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the Particulars to mind, and therefore ſhall paſs on to the ſecond Obſervation.</p>
                     <p>(2.) In the next place then; whereas 'tis noted by diligent Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that there is a wonderfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in ſeveral Countries, and even in the ſame Countrey at ſeveral diſtant times, of thoſe raging Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, that Phyſicians agree in calling
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104480:121"/>
the Plague, (whence it happens that ſuch Medicins or Methods of curing as are in one Plague ſuccesfull, as Phlebotomy, Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in another prove dangerous, if not mortal) whereas (I ſay) this great variety has been obſerv'd in Plagues; it may be fairly accounted for, by the great number and diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that has been actually found, or may be reaſonably ſuppoſ'd, in the numerous Minerals, and other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that nature has lay'd up in the Subterraneal Regions: eſpecially if we conſider, that the number of ſuch Bodies may be much increas'd and diverſified, by the various com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations which may be made of them, not onely by caſualties, but by the action of Subterraneal Fires, and <hi>aeſtuaries,</hi> and <hi>menſtruums,</hi> ſuch as I have elſewhere ſhewn to be lodg'd beneath the turf or <hi>ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the Earth. And the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Corpuſcles of thoſe Mineral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, being moſt of them ſolid and ſubtile, may produce in the Bloud;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104480:122"/>
and ſo in the Body, far more odd, and violent Symtomes, than the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Humours that uſe to beget or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Diſeaſes. Which may be one reaſon, and perhaps the chief, why the ancient Heathens, and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> himſelf, acknowledg'd in Peſtilential Diſeaſes <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Divine, ſurpaſſing ordinary Nature.</p>
                     <p>What theſe Mineral Subſtances are, whoſe ſteams produce ſuch odd and diſmal Symtomes, I think exceeding hard to determine. Yet, if I were to name <hi>one</hi> ſort, I ſhould perhaps think the leaſt unlikely to be Orpiment. For, of the Poyſonous Minerals we are acquainted with, I know not any of which there is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantity in the Bowels of the Earth; eſpecially taking that name, in the latitude allowed it, by thoſe skilfull men, that make three ſorts of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Yellow, Red and White Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piment, divers of whoſe miſchievous Effects ſeem to agree well enough with the Symtomes of ſome Plagues,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104480:122"/>
and may be gueſſed to have at leaſt a conſiderable intereſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of them. But yet, to ſpeak candidly, I do not think that theſe Minerals are the cauſes, even of all thoſe Peſtilences whoſe efficients may come from under the Ground: For ſeveral reaſons, and ſome drawn from Experience, make me think that the Subterraneal Regions have many kinds of very miſchievous foſſiles, of which Phyſicians, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Chymiſts, have no knowledge, and for which they have not any diſtinct names; and that the various aſſociations of theſe, which Nature may by Fire and <hi>menſtruums</hi> make under Ground, and perhaps in the Air it ſelf; may very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number, and variety of hurtfull Matters, and alſo heighten their hoſtility to Humane Bodies: as I think may be argued from the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious White Arſenick that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſold in Shops, which though uſually made of Orpiment, by the addition of ſo innocent a Body as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104480:123"/>
common Salt, (which is found in great plenty under Ground,) is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be far more poyſonous than Orpiment it ſelf. And I remember that a skilfull Chymiſt, having in my preſence taſted ſome prepar'd, and, as was thought, ſomewhat cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Arcenick; was quickly inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſuch Symtomes, as he thought would preſently kill him. But, through God's bleſſing, I quickly put him out of danger, though not out of pain, by early preſcribing him ſtore of Oil of ſweet Almonds, and ſomething made of Lemmons, that I chanc'd to have by me: But to return to what I was ſaying; Sanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach ſeems to be, but Orpiment whoſe yellow Colour is deepn'd to Redneſs: and native Arſenick, (for I have ſeen ſuch a thing, though it rarely comes into <hi>England,</hi>) ſeems to be little other than pale or white Orpiment. And indeed in <hi>Hungary,</hi> all three may be found not far from one another in the ſame Mine; As I learn'd by Inquiry from an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104480:123"/>
Eye-witneſs, by whoſe means, and of another Chymiſt, divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Orpimental Minerals (to ſay nothing of Realgar) becauſe it is a Factitious combination of Orpiment and Sulphur, came to my hands. And as this ſort of Foſſiles comprizes more numerous and various ones, than is vulgarly noted, ſo the very noxious effects of the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Orpiment, are not unknown to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Phyſicians: and the Learned <hi>Sennertus</hi> gives a particular<note place="margin">Senn. <hi>M. P. E. vi. p.</hi> 65.</note> inſtance of it in a Painter, who upon opening a Box where Orpiment, which men of his Profeſſion uſe as a Pigment, had been long kept, had his face all ſwell'd, and was caſt into fainting Fits. And as White Arſenick is of a more piercing and corroſive nature, ſo it were not difficult to ſhew out of the Writings of eminent Phyſicians that <hi>its effects have</hi> divers times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very hurtfull, and ſometimes mortal. When but externally worn in Amulets, eſpecially if the Pores
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104480:124"/>
of the Skin were open by exerciſe and ſweat; and the nature of the Symptomes produced ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our Hypotheſis, ſince the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that wore theſe Arſenical Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets were affected, ſome with great anxieties about the Heart, ſome with inflammation, ſome with burning Fevers, ſome with exulceration of the Breaſts, ſo ſome with Pusſles like thoſe of the Plague, and theſe were ſometimes black, as if made with a Cauſtick: moſt Patients were affected with great weakneſs and faintneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if they had ſwallowed Poiſon; and of one young Man 'tis recorded, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heated himſelf in a Tenniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court with an Amulet upon his Breaſt, the virulence of its Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles made him fall down ſtark dead upon the Spot. And 'tis a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Circumſtance in theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, that ſeveral Patients were cur'd of the Symptomes that ſeem'd to be Peſtilential ones by the ſame Remedies that are Alexipharmacal
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104480:124"/>
againſt the Plague, whence it may alſo be made probable, that the Plague it ſelf many times is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, though a dreadfull and anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Diſeaſe, ſince its Effects and Symptomes ſo much reſemble thoſe of acknowledg'd Poiſons, and have been cur'd by Antidotes effectual againſt other Poiſons.</p>
                     <p>I have not time to mention what I have my ſelf try'd and obſerv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bad effects of Orpiment, and its kinds. But I remember, that enquiring of an ingenious Man, who ſometimes viſited a Mine which was known to abound with Orpimental Foſſils; he anſwer'd me, that when he walked over the neighbouring Grounds, he found himſelf much diſorder'd, eſpecially in his <hi>Thorax</hi> by the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and that the Mine-men and Diggers were ſubject to a malignant anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and dangerous ſort of Fevers, though he ſaid he was apt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, I know not how truly, ſome part of their obnoxiouſneſs
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104480:125"/>
to it, to their drinking too much ſtrong Wine. But though 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Orpimental Bodies may have a great intereſt in ſeveral Plagues, yet, I ſtrongly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that many others may proceed from the ſteams of ſuch Subterraneal Bodies as are not yet diſtinctly known to us; and poſſibly have their <hi>Effluvia</hi> variouſly combin'd, either beneath or <hi>above</hi> the ſurface of the Earth. I ſay <hi>above;</hi> becauſe I have ſeveral times, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heat, combin'd ſeparately invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible fumes of differing kinds, into manifeſtly viſible ones in the free and open Air.</p>
                     <p>And that the Subterraneal <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> may produce effects, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore probably be of natures, very uncommon, irregular, and if I may ſo ſpeak, extravagant, may appear in thoſe prodigious Croſſes that were ſeen in our time, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Year 1660. in the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> after an eruption of the fiery Mountain <hi>Veſuvius:</hi> of which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104480:125"/>
the Learned <hi>Kircherus</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an account in a particular <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribe.</hi> For theſe Croſſes were ſeen on Linen Garments, as Shirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleeves, Womens Aprons, that had lain open to the Air, and upon the expos'd parts of Sheets; which is the leſs to be admired, becauſe as <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> fairly gueſſes, the mineral va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours were by the texture that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Linen [which conſiſts of threads croſſing one another for the moſt part at or near right Angles] eaſily determin'd to run along in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtreight lines, croſſing each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſequently to frame Spots reſembling ſome one, and ſome another kind of Croſſes. Theſe were extremely <hi>numerous</hi> in ſeveral Parts of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Jeſuit that ſent the Relation to <hi>Kircher</hi> ſays that he himſelf found thirty in one Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, that fifteen were found upon the Smock ſleeve of a Woman, and that he reckoned eight in a Boy's Band: alſo their <hi>colour</hi> and <hi>magnitude</hi>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:104480:126"/>
were very unequal, and their <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> diſcrepant, as may appear in many Pictures of them drawn by the Relatour: they would not waſh out with ſimple water, but requir'd Soap; their <hi>duration</hi> was alſo une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, ſome laſting ten or fifteen days, and others longer before they diſappear'd. And theſe Croſſes were found not onely upon Linen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments expos'd to the Air, but upon ſome of thoſe (belonging to Altars) that were kept lock'd up in Cheſts (to which poſſibly they might have acceſs by the Key-holes, or ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeded chinck.) To which ſtrange <hi>Phaenomena</hi> if I had the leiſure to add ſome others that I have met with in <hi>Agricola,</hi> and other appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Authours, whoſe Relations my memory doth not now ſerve me particularly to cite; I preſume it would appear yet more probable that Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia</hi> may now and then be of a very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomalous nature, and produce ſtrange effects, and among them
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104480:126"/>
variety of Peſtiferous ones in the Air.</p>
                     <p>But, to add this upon the bye: though I fear Phyſicians will not be able to diſcover <hi>all</hi> the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Bodies whoſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> produce or contribute to the Plague: yet I do not think it impoſſible that by diligent obſervations and trials, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious Men may diſcover <hi>divers</hi> of them; and perhaps Antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                     <p>And though the buſineſs of this Paper be to treat of the Cauſes, not the Remedies of the Plague; yet I love Mankind too well, to ſuppreſs on this occaſion an Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that, by God's bleſſing, may in ſome caſes, ſave the lives of many. In the late great Plague that ſwept away ſo many thouſands at <hi>London,</hi> there ſtaid in the City an Ingenious Phyſician, that was bred by the Learned <hi>Diemerbroeck,</hi> (whoſe Book <hi>De Peſte,</hi> I prefer to any I have yet read of that Diſeaſe.) This Doctour (whoſe name I am
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104480:127"/>
ſorry I have forgotten) hearing that I was deſirous to receive an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Plague from ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Eye-witneſs, and having ſoon after ſome occaſion to paſs near the Place in the Countrey where I then reſided, was pleas'd to give me a viſit, and a rational account of the main things I deſired to know; and when I inquired about his method of Cure, after he had told me that he had twice had the Plague himſelf, whereof he ſhewed me ſome effects; he added, that after many and various trials, he perceiv'd that abundance of his Patients died, after the Bubos, (Carbuncles) or Peſtilential Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours appear'd; becauſe upon a little refrigeration of the Body by the Air, and oftentimes by the very fear that diſheartened the Patient, the Tumours would ſuddenly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and the Peſtilential Matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiling upon the Vital Parts, would quickly diſpatch the fatal work. Wherefore he bethought himſelf of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104480:127"/>
a method, by means of which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd me, he had not loſt one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of very many he treated; if he could but, as he uſually did, by good <hi>Alexipharmical,</hi> and Cordial Remedies, enable and excite Nature to expell the peccant Matter into a Tumour; for then he preſently clapp'd on an appropriated draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plaſter, which would never ſuffer the Tumour to ſubſide; but break it, or make it fit for opening, and thereby give Nature a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient vent, at which to diſcharge the matter that oppreſs'd her. This Plaſter 'twill eaſily be thought I was deſirous to know; and he told me 'twas a Chymical one, and that 'twas no other than the <hi>Magnes Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenicalis</hi> of <hi>Angelus ſala,</hi> whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, becauſe the Book where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 'tis found, is in few hands, I have here annext. If this prove as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull in other Plagues, as it did to thoſe that us'd it in that of <hi>London;</hi> there will be juſt cauſe to admire and praiſe the benignity of Divine
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104480:128"/>
Providence, which in a poiſonous Mineral, that probably does often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times concur to produce the Plague, has laid up a remedy for it.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>By the ſame motive <hi>(Philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py)</hi> I am induc'd to add on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that having had ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to oblige an ancient and very experienc'd Phyſician, to whoſe care was committed a great Peſthouſe, where the Contagion was ſo ſtrong, that he loſt three Phyſicians that were to be Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to him, and three Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons of four that were to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to him; I diſir'd to learn of him, if he counted it not too great a ſecret, what Antidote he us'd to preſerve himſelf from ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and fatal an Infection. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104480:129"/>
he readily granted, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all told me, that his method would not ſeem to me worth mentioning, if I were one that valu'd Medicines by their Pompouſneſs, not their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility. For, beſides ardent Prayers to God, and a very regular Diet, his conſtant Antidote was onely, to take every Morning faſting a little Sea-ſalt diſſolv'd in a few ſpoonfulls of fair Water; which he made choice of, both becauſe it kept his Body ſoluble without purging or weakning it, and for other Reaſons which I muſt not now ſtay to ſet down. I know this Medicine may appear a deſpicable one; but yet in my Opinion it ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd, after ſuch Experience as I have related has recommended it. For I think it deſirable, that notice be taken of all Remedies, that have been found by good Trials, not bare Conjectures or uncertain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, available againſt the Plague. For, ſince Peſtilences, as we have lately noted, are exceeding various
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104480:129"/>
in their kinds, 'tis very poſſible, and not unlikely, that their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated Remedies may be ſo too. And therefore I would not eaſily lay aſide every Medicine, that this or that Learned Phyſician may ſpeak ſlightly of, or even may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he has found it unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full againſt the Plague; ſince the ſame Medicine may be available in a Peſtilence of another kind, in which perhaps the Remedies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Phyſician we ſpeak of, will be found inefficacious.</p>
                     <p>This Conſideration forbids me to paſs by what happen'd to me in the great <hi>London</hi> Plague above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; namely, that a very Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phyſician having once recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to me an Herb little noted in <hi>England,</hi> as a moſt effectual and experienced Antidote againſt the Plague, I caus'd it to be cultivated in a Garden (as I ſtill do every year;) and when the Peſtilence ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged moſt, having ſome of it by me, made up with a little Sugar in the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104480:130"/>
form of a fine green Conſerve, I ſent it to two infected Perſons, who, by the Divine Benediction on it, both of them recover'd. But having made but thoſe two Trials, I dare not ground much upon them onely; though I uſually keep the Plant growing in a Garden, partly becauſe both the Taſte and Colour; one or other of which in moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes is offenſive, are in this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; and partly becauſe ſome little Experience has invited me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Commendations that I have found given of it, againſt the Bitings of venomous Creatures: whereof I remember a notable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is recorded by <hi>Petrus Spehrerius</hi> of a<note place="margin">In Obſervat. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bil. apud <hi>Schen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kium,</hi> l. 7. Obſerv. Med. Tit. de venenis ex animalibus.</note> 
                        <hi>Roman,</hi> who having with his Staff pierc'd or cruſh'd a Viper, that he took to be dead, had ſo ſtrong a Venom tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted along the Staff, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Night he had a very great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation in both his Lips, to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104480:130"/>
which ſuperven'd an exceeding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Fever and ſtrange Tortures; from all which <hi>Serianus Pacyonius,</hi> a noted Phyſician that was call'd to him, free'd him as it were by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, by the Juice of <hi>Goats-rue,</hi> or as others call it <hi>Galega,</hi> that grew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly in that Place. It may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſguſt be taken ſomewhat plentifully, (and ſo it ought to be) in its entire ſubſtance as a Salad; or elſe one may give its Conſerve, its Syrup, or, which is better, its Juice newly expreſs'd.</p>
                     <p>(3.) It likewiſe agrees with our <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> that ſometimes the Plague ceaſes, or at leaſt very nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abates of its Infectiouſneſs and Malignity, in far leſs time than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wonted courſe of that ravenous Diſeaſe, Phyſicians did, or rationally could expect. For ſometimes it may happen, that, though the Temperature or Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateneſs of the Air continues the ſame, the matter that afforded the Peſtiferous Exhalations may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104480:131"/>
ſpent under ground, or ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by combination with other ſubterraneal Bodies, or by ſome of thoſe many Accidents that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, altogether unknown to us, in thoſe deep and dark Receſſes. And if once the Fountain of theſe noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> be ſtopt, ſo that thoſe that are in the Air ceaſe to be recruited, the Wind and other cauſes may in a ſhort time diſſipate them, or at leaſt dilute them with innocent Air, ſo far, as to keep the Diſeaſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd from being any thing near ſo miſchievous as before. And here I conſider, that it may ſeveral times happen, that, though the Minerals that emit the hurtfull Expirations, remain where they were under ground, and be not conſiderably waſted, yet their fatal Effects may not be laſting, becauſe the <hi>Effluvia</hi> were generated by the conflict of two or more of them, which vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently agitated one another, and ſent up fumes, which ceas'd to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, at leaſt in great plenty, when
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104480:131"/>
the Conflict and Agitation ceas'd. As, I have try'd that by putting good Spirit of Salt upon Filings of Steel or Iron in a conveniently ſhap'd Glaſs, there will be made a great conflict between them, and without the help of external Heat, there will be ſent up into the Air ſtore of viſible Fumes of a very Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Odour, and eaſily inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, which copious elevation of Fumes will leſſen or ceaſe, as does the tumultuous agitation that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them. And ſo likewiſe, if you pour <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> upon a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient proportion of Salt of Tartar, there will be at firſt a great ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produc'd, and, whilſt that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, ſtore of red and noiſome Fumes will be elevated, but will not long outlaſt the commotion of the mixture, whoſe active parts will in no long time combine into a kind of nitrous Salt, wherein the noxious parts of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> are as it were pinion'd, and hinder'd from evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating or aſcending, though really
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104480:132"/>
they retain much of their priſtine nature, as I elſewhere ſhew.</p>
                     <p>It may alſo happen, that ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that commotion of ſubterraneal Matter, which ſent forth peſtiferous Exhalations, a more intenſe degree of ſubterraneal Heat, or perhaps the ſame latent Fire, extending it ſelf farther and farther, may force up Fumes of another ſort, that being of a contrary nature, may be, if I may ſo ſpeak, antidotal againſt the former; and by precipitating them, or combining with them, may diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them from acting ſo miſchievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as otherwiſe they would. To countenance which I ſhall tell you, that I have ſometimes purpoſely made Diſtillations, in which one part of the Matter being, after the operation ended, put to the other, there will enſue a ſudden and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt conflict between them, and ſometimes an intenſe degree of Heat. And that mineral Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though otherwiſe not whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, may diſable peſtiferous <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:104480:132"/>
may be gather'd from what I lately noted about a Countrey, which abounding with veins of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar, was, probably by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations, preſerved from the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps appear ſomewhat the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, if we reflect on what I lately mention'd of the ſudden check, that is almoſt every Summer given to the Plague, which at that time is wont to reign at <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi> For ſince 'tis generally obſerv'd and complain'd of, that <hi>Morbifick</hi> Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doe their work much more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually than <hi>Sanative</hi> ones. It ſeems very probable that Exhalations aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from under-ground into the Atmoſphere, may be capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing peſtilential Fevers, and the Plague it ſelf, ſince thoſe Corpuſcles that impregnate the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Air upon the ſwelling of the Nile, are able to put a ſpeedy ſtop, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the contagiouſneſs, but to the malignity of the Plague, even when 'tis aſſiſted by the Summer
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104480:133"/>
Heat, which at <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> is wont to be exceſſive.</p>
                     <p>But having inſiſted perhaps too long on this <hi>Egyptian</hi> Peſtilence, I ſhall onely add, by way of Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Conjecture that invited me to mention it, that the acceſſion even of Expirations that are not themſelves wholſome, may ſometimes ſerve to correct the Air, and put a ſudden check to an Epidemical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. For Corpuſcles of differing kinds may by their Coalitions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire new Qualities, and each ſort of them loſe ſome of thoſe they had before: as, ſuppoſe there wander'd in the Air a great many <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which by their determinate ſhape and bulk were apt to corrode or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate the Lungs, or the Membranes of the Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as thoſe of Nitre are to corrode Silver; it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that another ſort of Reeks, though in their own nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome, may, by aſſociating themſelves with the firſt ſort, and compoſing with them Curpuſcles of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104480:133"/>
new qualities, aboliſh or much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the noxious ones they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in reference to this or that part of the Humane Body. Though the Spirits of Salt-peter will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrode Silver, yet if you add to them (as for ſome purpoſes I am wont to do) about half as much or leſs of the ſpirituous Particles of common Salt, (which yet are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive enough, and will fret aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the parts of Iron, Copper, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) there will emerge a Body that will not at all corrode pure Silver.</p>

And therefore I declared, that by <hi>new Diſeaſes</hi> I meant onely ſuch, whoſe Symptoms were ſo uncommon, that Phyſicians themſelves judged them to deſerve that appellation; Such, for inſtance, as the <hi>Sudor Anglicus</hi> or Sweating Sickneſs; that Diſeaſe which the learned <hi>Wierus</hi> and others call in Dutch <hi>Die Varen;</hi> an unheard-of Diſeaſe deſcrib'd by <hi>Ronſeius,</hi> that in the Year 1581 invaded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd many in the Dukedom of <hi>Lunenburg;</hi> to which many Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans add the Rickets, and others ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the <hi>Lues Venerea.</hi> Having clear'd the Terms, I next conſider'd whether there were really any <hi>new Diſeaſes</hi> properly ſo call'd, and gave ſome reaſons to ſuſpect that ſome Diſeaſes, which among Phyſicians themſelves have paſs'd for <hi>New,</hi> were extant before <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> though not in the Countrey wherein even the learned judg'd them to be new. And I intimated, that to examine this Suſpicion throughly, 'tis not ſafe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104480:135"/>
to acquieſce in the Books of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians onely; but 'tis fit to conſult the Writings of Geographers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ancient</hi> (among whom I particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly recommended <hi>Strabo</hi>) or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,</hi> together with the Relations of Hiſtorians, Navigators and other Travellers. And here I inquired, without determining any thing, whether the <hi>Lues Venerea</hi> be, as moſt Phyſicians are wont to ſuppoſe a Diſeaſe wholly new, or onely new to our European World, and brought hither from ſome African or other remote Region, where it may be probably ſuſpected to have long been Endemical.</p>
                     <p>But taking it for granted, with the generality of Phyſicians, that ſome new Diſeaſes are to be admitted; I advanced to conſider ſome of the Cauſes, to which they may be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; And to give ſome reaſons, why I do'nt acquieſce in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though very general, that derive them onely or chiefly from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying influences of the Heavenly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104480:135"/>
Bodies. For the moſt powerfull of thoſe, namely the Sun and Moon, act in too general and indeterminate a way, to afford a ſufficient account of this affair. And as for the other Lights, the fixt Stars, beſides their being univerſal and indefinite agents, their ſcarce meaſurable remoteneſs makes it juſtly queſtionable, whether they have any ſenſible Operation upon any part of our Bodies, ſave our Eyes. And, <hi>though</hi> I deny not that great intemperateneſs of the Air, as to the four firſt Qualities, as Heat, Cold, Drineſs and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, are wont (not over juſtly) to be call'd, may diſpoſe mens Bodies to ſeveral great Diſtempers, and may alſo be concurrent cauſes of thoſe we are ſpeaking of: <hi>yet</hi> neither can I acquieſce in theſe, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how much more frequently they happen, than new Diſeaſes do; and that their action, though various, is too general and indeterminate to perſwade me, that they can be the adequate cauſes of effects ſo rare and

                     <p>But now; the Subterranean Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of our Globe, beſides that it is always near us, abounds with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of noxious Minerals, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conceals great quantities of differing ſorts of them, that are yet unknown to us.

                     <p>I am not ignorant that the whole Doctrine propounded in the four Propoſitions about the Inſalubrity of the Air, is not at all comfortable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Patients or Phyſicians: But important Theories deſerv'd to be inquir'd into, and, if true, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd though we could wiſh they were untrue.

him from too obſtinately perſiſting in the uſe of receiv'd Medicins, though unſucceſsfull, upon a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that the Diſeaſe can have no other cauſes, than thoſe wont to be aſſign'd it by Claſſick Authours: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, I ſay; I do not deſpair, but that either the ſagacity or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of this inquiſitive age, or at leaſt of Poſterity, may by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God be happy enough to find proper Remedies, even for thoſe Diſeaſes that proceed from Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean <hi>Effluvia,</hi> when once by proper Signs they ſhall be diſtinctly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd; (Of which power of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated Remedies) I have known ſome Inſtances, as to the very bad Symptoms produc'd by Antimonial and ſome other Mineral Fumes.</p>

But it is time to conclude with the recital of the promiſed Experiments. Which I would immediately do, but that I hold it fit to premiſe, by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to them, that I hope the Things hitherto diſcours'd will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear much the more probable, if we ſhall prove by Experiments, that which ſeems much leſs likely than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing we have above deliver'd; namely, that Metals completely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and malleable may be elevated into the Air, and that perhaps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great violence of Fire, in the form of Exhalations and Vapours; the ſingly inviſible Corpuſcles ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their Metalline nature. This at leaſt, as to ſome Metals, I have endeavour'd to prove in another Tract, [entitl'd <hi>a Paradox about the Fuel of Flames.</hi>] But becauſe that

proſecute the Experiment at home, I put into the hands of an induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Phyſician, that was earneſt with me to impart to him the Proceſs, and let Him purſue it for me. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my direction expos'd this <hi>Metalline Roſin</hi> (if I may ſo call it) groſsly beaten to the free Air, where it did, according to Expectation, in a ſhort time change Colour, and turn to a kind of <hi>Verdegreece:</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolv'd in good Spirit of Salt gave a Solution of a very lovely green Colour.

But that which I deſire to have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obſerv'd in this Experiment is, that though this Liquor be thus apt to emit Smoak, not onely plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, but as one would think with Violence, yet I found by Trial, that even when I put it into a Veſſel not ſtrait mouth'd, if I did but lay a piece of a ſingle leaf of Paper flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon the Orifice of the Glaſs, ſo as to cover it all, the viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Fumes would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſe; and the Liquor would lie
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104480:141"/>
like common Water, as long as the Paper lay, though but lightly upon the Glaſs; though upon the Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of that, the Liquor would ſend up plentifull Fumes as before, which ſeems to argue, that ſome Metalline Subſtances may, by the contact of the <hi>Air,</hi> have their Copious aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Atmoſphere very much help'd and promoted, as if the <hi>Air</hi> had Saline or other ſort of Particles in it, that are in reference to ſome Mineral Bodies of a very volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing nature. The way by which I have divers times elevated the Fixedſt of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Metals, <hi>Gold</hi> it ſelf, I have deliver'd in another Paper, and ſhall not here repeat it.

But when the motion of the Air towards the Flame had carry'd theſe Fumes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104480:142"/>

and lengthen'd them in a ſtrange and frightfull manner; and whilſt they were thus ſlender, they were taller than He or any man of ordinary ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But that which appear'd to Him the moſt wonderfull and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, was, that they manifeſtly ſeem'd to be very much affected with the Muſick they heard; inſomuch that ſome Parts of the Tune would make them move to and fro with a ſurpriſing agility, and ſome other Parts of it would caſt them into a Poſture, wherein they ſeem'd to be half aſleep, and as it were to melt away with pleaſure.</p>

               <p>IT may add probability to ſome things deliver'd in this Chapter and in divers other Paſſages of this Treatiſe, if I here recount a ſtrange <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> that came into my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory whilſt I was running over thoſe Parts of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> in ſhort, was this. Having met with divers pieces of tranſparent Glaſs, which I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think to be of a Texture or Temper very differing from ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Glaſs, I thought fit to try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome of them were not far more ſpringy and brittle than their thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would make one expect. And accordingly, though I found ſeveral wherein the Experiment would not ſucceed, eſpecially if their figure were not convenient, yet with ſome others, I had very good ſucceſs, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104480:149"/>
particularly with ſome that were ſhap'd almoſt like the ſharper End of the neck of a Retort. For though theſe pieces of Glaſs were much thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker than ſuch necks are wont to be, being perhaps 6 or 7 times as thick as common drinking Glaſſes, yet I more than once made the Tryal ſucceed ſo well, that, by obliquely ſcratching them, or tickling them if I may ſo ſpeak, on the inſide with the head or point of a Pin, they would forceably burſt into many pieces in my hand. In which ſurprizing <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> the matter of the Glaſs ſeem'd to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomething to this odd Effect, of ſo languid a motion, but much leſs than the Texture, or Tenſion, it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the peculiar way of order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the Fire and the Air.</p>

               <head>Obſervation II.</head>
               <p>TO ſhew that the Suſpicion I mention my ſelf, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of this Chapter, to have had, that the breaking of the Stones there ſpoken of might poſſibly be produc'd or promoted by ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, remaining after the ſtrokes employ'd to force the Stones out of their Beds, was not altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here obſerve, that it need not ſeem incredible, that faint ſtrokes and attritions may leave more laſting and operative Motions among the Inſenſible Parts, even of compact and ſolid Bodies, than one would readily imagine. For I have ſeveral times found, ſometimes by Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deſignedly made, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by undeſigned Accidents, that, having caus'd ſomewhat thin Veſſels of Glaſs, eſpecially Urinals, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104480:150"/>
made clean with Sand mixt with Water, to looſen or grate off the foulneſs that adher'd to the ſides of the Veſſel; though the Veſſels, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been thus made clean, did not appear to have receiv'd the leaſt injury, and would continue very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire perhaps for ſeveral hours, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time they would of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves break with noiſe, and thereby become unſerviceable for the future. But though this happen'd to many Urinals, yet, becauſe to more others it did not, it ſeem'd probable that the diſſilition depended chiefly upon the peculiar texture of the Glaſs in this or that Veſſel, whether acquir'd by a mixture of the Ingredients, that was not uniform enough or made in a due proportion; or elſe by the too haſty refrigeration of the Veſſel, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if it chanc'd, as is not very unuſual, to be cool'd more haſtily in one part than another.</p>

               <p>BEcauſe there are divers Gems; particularly thoſe Tranſparent ones that are Red or Blew, that are much harder than Iron or ſteel, it may much ſtrengthen the Proof of our 8th Obſervation, if I here relate that a Jeweller to a great Princeſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd me, that when he poliſh'd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrs, Rubies, and ſome ſorts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hard Gems, upon his Mill, they would ſeem when attrition had made them very hot, to be all on Fire, like ſo many little Coals: And that each of them had the light it afforded ting'd with a Colour proper to the Stone; ſo that the Ruby gave a Red Light, the Saphyr a Blew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I remember that inquiring of a skilfull Cutter of Diamonds and Poliſher of Gems, whoſe Cuſtomer I had been, about ſome Conjectures I had concerning things belonging to his Profeſſion, he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104480:151"/>
anſwer'd me that ſometimes, when he poliſh'd certain Stones, eſpecially Rubies, that were pretty large and perhaps not thick, he could plainly perceive that the Stone gap'd at and near the Edge, as if it were begun to be crack'd; which ſign admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to make haſte to ſlacken the Motion of the Mill, leſt the Stone ſhould abſolutely burſt; which if it did not he could not perceive any Flaw in it when it was throughly cold, but, which was ſtrange, it appear'd as entire as ever. He added, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what he had ſaid of the intenſe Heat that Gems would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times acquire by Attrition, whilſt they were in poliſhing, that having lately given by this means too great a degree of Heat, to an Oriental Topaz (which ſort of that Gem is very hard,) it crack'd upon the Mill, in ſo much that one part of it quite ſeparated from the reſt, and ſpoil'd the Stone in the capacity of a Gem; as a Proof where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had laid it aſide for me, and would needs make me accept it, as

               <p>TO confirm what has been ſaid in the 8th Obſervation, to ſhew that ſlow and inſenſible Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Motions of the Parts of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that ſeem quieſcent, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry operative, chance afforded me a notable Inſtance, which was this. I had, to preſerve a Liquor from which I expected a curious Experiment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd it in a ſtrong Vial, to whoſe neck a thick Glaſs Stople was but too exquiſitely adapted. This Veſſel I ſet upon the Edge of a Window, in a high and ſecure place, that it might not be mov'd. There it continu'd many Months, or, if I miſremember not, above a Year. And the Liquor was of ſuch a nature, that if any Body had, though but for a few Moments,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104480:152"/>
taken out the Stople, I could eaſily diſcover it. But after all this while, one day that I was ſitting in my Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, at a good diſtance from the place in which the Vial ſtood, I heard a loud and brisk noiſe, almoſt like the report of a Piſtol, and then perceiv'd that ſomething came rolling to my Feet: I haſtily took it up, and, found it to be the thicker and larger part of the Stople of my Vial, which of it ſelf had flown off, leaving the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part ſo cloſely and ſtrongly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted to the Neck, which ſerv'd it for a kind of Socket, that I could by no means pull it out thence. At this Accident I was not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, conſidering the thickneſs of the Solid Glaſs, and that it had ſtood ſo long unmov'd, and that the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and heavier part of the Stople broke off from the other with ſuch violence, and was carry'd from it by inviſible motors to ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Which ſeem'd the more ſtrange, becauſe there was no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nor treading in the Room, that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104480:153"/>
could put the parts of the Glaſs into Motion, there being no Body preſent but my ſelf, who was ſitting quietly and ſtudying.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104480:153"/>
more, about Ten Days or a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after, he was much ſurpriz'd to find, to his great loſs, that this Diamond had of it ſelf crack'd in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, and ſo became of little or no value, but as 'twas a Rarity: and indeed I could not without won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſee ſo fair and hard a Stone ſo oddly ſpoil'd with Clefts, that ſeem'd to penetrate ſo very deep, that 'twas gueſs'd 'twould not be very difficult to pull the parts of the Stone aſunder. And on this occaſion he told me, that he had admir'd this Accident at firſt, much more than he did afterwards.

                  <hi>Borel. de vi percuſſionis prop. CXI.</hi> has theſe obſervable words. I was at <hi>Tauromenium</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> when the Mountain of <hi>Aetna</hi> broke out near <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> a Town diſtant about thirty miles from <hi>Tauromenium;</hi> whilſt the Gap did ſend out now and then with a great noiſe fire and flame all the Houſes of <hi>Tauromenium</hi> were ſenſibly ſhaken: and it was obſervable that ſuch Houſes as look'd directly towards the Gap, were moſt of all agitated. Thoſe that look'd otherwiſe ſhaking more ſlowly, upon which matter of fact he argues thus: had this trembling been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the ſhaking of the Ground of <hi>Tauromenium,</hi> all the Houſes had been equally ſhak'd, ſince this inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of motion could not be aſcrib'd to their different ſituation. Hence then
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104480:158"/>
we muſt needs conclude that this agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was produc'd by the impreſſion of the Air upon the Walls of the Houſes, which demonſtrates to us the great efficacy of a ſound, though at thirty miles diſtance.</p>
