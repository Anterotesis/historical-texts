            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And now, as the <hi>Moon</hi> receiving light from the Sun doth not ſwallow it up, and bury it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecteth it, and as it were, reporteth and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it abroad unto the world: So the Lord having ſhewed mercies unto the Church, requireth that they be not buried in oblivion, but that the glory and praiſe of them be acknowledged unto him. Great Luminaries have certain <hi>Beams</hi> as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118804:4"/>
pipes and channels, through which their light is derived and diffuſed upon others. <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> is the <hi>Beam</hi> of an illightned ſoul, whereby it maketh report of thoſe mercies, which from the Father of light hath been ſhed abroad upon it. Every thing naturally returns to its <hi>original. All Rivers run into the Sea, unto the place from whence they come, thither they return to go,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 7. A <hi>ſtraight line</hi> drawn into length, the further it goes is ſtill the weaker; but in a <hi>circle,</hi> returning to its firſt point and original, it recovers ſtrength; ſo the Creature, the <hi>further</hi> it goes from God, is ſtill the <hi>weaker,</hi> till it return back unto him again. And the beſt way of <hi>returning</hi> unto him is by <hi>praiſing</hi> of him; for praiſes are the language of Heaven, where it is that men are pefectly taken home to God.</p>
            <p>Yet, as we ſaid, nothing is hereby <hi>added</hi> unto him, but onely his <hi>own glory</hi> acknowledged and adored by the Church, as when the Sun ſhines on a <hi>Diamond,</hi> the luſtre thereof is not encreaſed but reported. And as we eſteem thoſe ſtones moſt precious, which do moſt exquiſitely admit and reflect the ſplendor of that light which ſhines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; ſo they are the Lords beſts <hi>Jewels</hi> (as he calleth them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.) which can moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſet forth the glory of his name as he who can with greateſt eloquence commend the vertues of an excellent perſon, is the beſt <hi>Orator,</hi> though his Oration doth not put excellency into the perſon, but onely repreſent and ſet it forth unto others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:118804:5"/>Not therefore for any advantage or acceſſion unto himſelf (who cannot be a gainer by his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) but onely for our benefit and comfort, is the Lord pleaſed to require <hi>praiſes</hi> of his people, as the window admitteth the light of the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not for the benefit of the Sun, but of the houſe into which it ſhineth.</p>
            <p>And as God requires this duty at all times of his people, ſo moſt then, when he doth greateſt things for them; and this was the condition of the Church at this time, which Interpreters refer to the State thereof after its return out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and therefore in the Syriack and Greek verſions, we finde the names of the Prophets <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zacharie</hi> prefixed, as leading to the times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the mercies here mentioned did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>The whole Pſalm is an invitation unto <hi>praiſing of God.</hi> Arguments thereunto are drawn</p>
            <p>Firſt, From <hi>Gods general goodneſs</hi> to the world, verſ. 4, 8, 9, 16, 17, 8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From his <hi>ſpecial Mercy</hi> to his Church. 1. In <hi>reſtoring</hi> it out of a ſad and broken condition, ver. 2, 3. 2. In <hi>confirming</hi> it in an hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>py and proſperous eſtate, both <hi>temporal,</hi> in regard of ſtrength, peace, and plenty, verſ. 12, 13, 14. and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> in regard of his Word, Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made known unto them, ver. 19, 20. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, Theſe mercies are all commended by the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner</hi> of beſtowing them, <hi>powerfully</hi> and <hi>ſwiftly.</hi> He doth it by a word of <hi>command,</hi> and by a word of <hi>ſpeed, He ſendeth forth his commandment up
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118804:5"/>
on Earth, his word runneth very ſwiftly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former part of this <hi>happy eſtate</hi> together with the <hi>manner</hi> of beſtowing it, is in theſe words, from which we muſt by no means exclude the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the latter. And what can be wanting to a Nation which is <hi>ſtrengthned</hi> with walls, <hi>bleſſed</hi> with multitudes, hath <hi>peace</hi> in the border, <hi>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in the field, and which is all in all, <hi>God</hi> in the Sanctuary, God the bar of the <hi>gate,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Children,</hi> the Crown of the <hi>peace,</hi> the ſtaff of the <hi>plenty,</hi> a <hi>gate</hi> reſtored, a <hi>City</hi> bleſſed, a <hi>border</hi> quieted, a <hi>field</hi> crowned, a <hi>ſanctuary</hi> beautified with the oracles of God, what can be wanting to ſuch a people, but a mouth filled, an heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a ſpirit exalted in the praiſes of the Lord? <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O Jeruſalem, praiſe thy God, O Sion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the words we have three General Parts.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>Duty</hi> required, and that with an ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>praiſe, praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>ſubject</hi> of whom required, <hi>Jeruſalem, Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Arguments</hi> enforcing it, drawn from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, 1. Of Gods <hi>Relation</hi> unto them, as <hi>The Lord,</hi> that had <hi>authority</hi> over them, as <hi>Thy God,</hi> that was in covenant with them. 2. Of the <hi>Benefits</hi> wrought for them, wherein is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 1. The <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of them, ver. 13, 14. 2. The <hi>manner</hi> how performed, by a powerful and a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy efficacy, v. 15.</p>
            <p>

In the laſt Pſalm, containing but ſix verſes, we are called upon thirteen times to <hi>praiſe the Lord,</hi> Jewels are made of divers precious ſtones couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together: <hi>praiſe</hi> is a <hi>Jewel,</hi> a comely, a beautifying thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 1. and we finde one of theſe Jewels are made up of no fewer then ſix and twenty ingeminations, <hi>Pſal. 136. praiſe</hi> him for his <hi>greatneſs,</hi> he is <hi>the Lord;</hi> and again, <hi>praiſe</hi> him for his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> he is <hi>thy God.</hi> If a man ſhew me a precious and ſtately thing, I ſhall be thankful out of <hi>curioſity,</hi> as for a <hi>favor;</hi> but if he ſhew it, and then give it, I ſhall be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times thankful, as for a rare <hi>bounty.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118804:12"/>
the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of his <hi>Grace</hi> mine to ſanctifie me, the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of his <hi>Glory</hi> mine to ſave me; who ſhould be thankfull, if not they who want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? And who can be ſaid to want any thing who have God for their God? The Lord, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> is my ſhepheard, <hi>I ſhall not want,</hi> Pſal. 23. 1.</p>
            <p>Of this excellent Doctrine I ſhall make theſe two Uſes, and then ſpeak a little to the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We ſhould learn from hence to bewail our long and great unthankfulneſs under as many and wonderful mercies, as ſcarce any Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven is able to parallel. Unthinkfulneſs is not ſetting ſo high a price as we ought upon a good Land, quiet Habitations, fair Eſtates, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Borders flouriſhing Fields, abundance of Men, Cattel, Wealth, Trade, Strength, and all other good things. Unthankfulneſs for that which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>the riches of the world,</hi> and the <hi>ſalvation of the Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 11. 11, 12. for the Oracles of God, the Ark of his preſence, the glorious light of his Goſpel, and powerful means of grace and ſalvation, in abundance of which I know not whether any Countries on the earth can outvy and ſurpaſs this of ours. Unthankfulneſs (which is worſe) in abuſing mercies, <hi>waxing fat</hi> by them, and then <hi>kicking</hi> againſt the Author of them, <hi>filling</hi> our ſelves in our paſtures, and then forgetting God, making them rather the

fuel of our <hi>lusts</hi> againſt him, then the arguments of our <hi>love</hi> unto him; turning peace into ſecurity, and plenty into exceſs, and grace into laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and pardoning mercy into preſumption of ſinning, multitudes making little other uſe of the Goſpel then that which the Goſpel doth abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to <hi>continue in ſin that grace may abound;</hi> to drink poiſon the more freely, becauſe they have an Antidote by them. Nay, which is yet more prodigious, not uſing nor improving mercies when we were in danger to <hi>loſe</hi> them, when war and deſolation ſhould have taught us to value them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to weep, and bleed, and languiſh, and have <hi>grey hairs</hi> upon us, to be <hi>ſet on fire rou d</hi>

The <hi>not uſing</hi> a mercy, is to be unthankful for it; how much more ſad account muſt men give
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118804:13"/>
of <hi>abuſed mercies?</hi> of <hi>requiting</hi> the goodneſs of the Lord with <hi>forſaking</hi> of him, the culture and Husbandry, the rain and dew which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſtowed upon them with <hi>thorns and briars? Deut. 32. 6. Luk. 13. 7 Heb.</hi> 6. 7. As the greater heat of the Sun doth more ſpeedily ripen fruit, ſo do great mercies haſten the maturity of ſin, and make them as the <hi>rod of an Almond tree,</hi> which bloſſometh before other trees, <hi>Jer.</hi> i. 11. or as a <hi>Basket of ſummer fruit,</hi> which is quickly ripe, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 1.

            <p>Secondly, We ſhould be exhorted unto the careful practice of this excellent Duty. I ſhall not go out of the Text for Motives hereunto.</p>
            <p>1. He hath <hi>ſtrengthned the Bars of our Gates,</hi> we are not by the power or machinations of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies devoured or diſſolved, we have yet the face of a potent Nation, notwithſtanding the devices of any to diſſipate our Laws, or to reduce us to confuſion.</p>
            <p>2. He hath <hi>bleſſed our Children within us,</hi> though the ſword have devoured thouſands, and might juſtly have ſwallowed the blood of many more, ſhould the Lord have dealt with us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our provocations, yet our ſtreets, our fields, our Cities, our Churches are ſtill full, <hi>old men with their ſtaves, little children playing</hi> in the ſtreets, with as much ſecurity as before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:118804:13"/>3. He hath given <hi>peace in our Borders.</hi> When <hi>Ephraim</hi> was againſt <hi>Manaſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Manaſſe</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> no man ſpared his brother, when the Land did eat the fleſh of its own arms, when the ſtrength of battel was poured out in every corner, as if the Lord would have conſumed us all at once, then was he pleaſed to try us once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the keeping of ſo rich a Jewel as <hi>peace.</hi> And when thereafter he raiſed up againſt us new Enemies and troubles by Sea, whereby trade was obſtructed, treaſure exhauſted, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion in danger to be weakned, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy hoſtilities like to have continued amongſt neighbour Nations, which had been before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate and in amity, this evill likewiſe the Lord put a ſtop unto, and made the Sea, which <hi>wrought and was tempeſtuous,</hi> quiet and calm again, and thus hath confirmed <hi>peace in our borders,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the hopes which the enemies of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion had entertained upon thoſe unhappy differences.</p>
            <p>4. He hath <hi>fed us with the fat and marrow of the wheat,</hi> crowned the year with his goodneſs, the fields and the paſtures ſing; he hath ſent a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rain, and refreſhed the earth, the fields and the clouds, and the Sun have been confederate and at an agreement, to empty the bleſſings, wherewith God hath filled them, into our boſoms, according to thoſe gracious promiſes, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 21. 22. Zach.</hi> 8 12.</p>
            <p>5. He ſuffereth us yet to call <hi>him our God,</hi> he is ſtill in the midſt of us, we have yet the cuſtody of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118804:14"/>
his oracles and liberty of his worſhip; he hath not yet given us a <hi>bill of Divorce,</hi> nor caſt us out of his ſight, as our ſins have deſerved. What great reaſon have we to ingeminate <hi>praiſes,</hi> when the Lord is pleaſed to multiply mercies? Who would ever <hi>miſtruſt</hi> ſuch a <hi>God</hi> who can ſo powerfully and ſo ſuddenly help? Who would ever <hi>provoke</hi> ſuch a <hi>God</hi> who can as eaſily and as ſpeedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy? Who would truſt in <hi>bars</hi> and <hi>gates,</hi> in Caſtles and Armies, in Ships and Navies, and leave him out who is the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of them all? Who would not truſt in him who is a <hi>God near,</hi> and a <hi>God a far off,</hi> a <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Gate,</hi> in the <hi>City,</hi> in the <hi>field,</hi> in the <hi>border,</hi> on the <hi>land,</hi> on the <hi>ſea,</hi> whoſe way is in the <hi>ſauctuary,</hi> and his path in the <hi>great waters? Who would not fear thee, O King of Nations, and glorifie thy name? for unto thee it doth appertain, who alone art glorious in holineſs, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in praiſes, doing wonders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude all with a few words unto you, the <hi>Officers</hi> and Repreſentatives of this <hi>great City,</hi> into whoſe hearts the Lord hath put ſo wo thy and pious a reſolution as to appoint this day, in the which to recount his mercies, and to ſpeak good of his name. And albeit your ſelves who are beſt acquainted with the ſtate of the <hi>City,</hi> and Gods dealings therewith, can more abundantly preſent to your own thoughts, variety of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of <hi>divine goodneſs</hi> then I who am but a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can, yet give me leave to be your Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer in theſe few.</p>
            <p>1. Be pleaſed to look back on thoſe bloody
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118804:14"/>
               <hi>Marian</hi> days, when the ſtreets of this City were defiled with the blood of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> when the bleſſed members of Chriſt were drawn from Cole houſes and Priſons to Stakes and flames, and conſider the indefatigable and crafty endeavors, which have been from time to time by that party uſed (and no doubt they are as unwearied now as ever, though haply they are under new ſhapes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes) to reduce us back again. And conſider the purity of Evangelical <hi>Doctrine</hi> and Worſhip, and the great liberty you now enjoy therein (The Lord pardon, pitty, and rebuke thoſe, who either through <hi>ignorance</hi> o <hi>prophaneſs,</hi> do pray the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons with ſuch a benefit, and abuſe it, to the rending and cauſing of breaches in the Church of Chriſt.)</p>
            <p>2. Look on the ſore <hi>plagues</hi> which have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reigned in this place, emptying the City of all that could fly, and ſending Armies of thoſe that remained weekly to the grave. The City is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably now much more populous, many thouſands of houſes being ſince that time newly erected, and few either of the old or new without Inhabitants; yet for theſe many years this raging diſeaſe hath been baniſhed from this place, when probably it might have been a double Judgment unto you, and you have that bleſſing which the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Jeruſalem, Zach.</hi> 8. 5. made good unto you, <hi>The ſtreets of the City full of Boys and Girls playing in thoſe ſtreets,</hi> where, in the days of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, graſs grew for emptineſs and deſolation.</p>
            <p>3. Look on the late bloody <hi>VVars,</hi> when the Lord poured out on the Nation the <hi>ſtrength of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118804:15"/>
battel,</hi> and ſet it on <hi>fire round about, Ephraim Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naſſe,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſe Ephraim,</hi> when the people were as <hi>the fuel if the fire;</hi> you here heard not the prancing of the <hi>horſes,</hi> nor the rarling of the <hi>wheels,</hi> you ſaw not the glittering of the <hi>ſwords,</hi> nor the diſplaying of the <hi>Banners,</hi> you were not witneſſes of the confuſions which other places ſaw and felt. Your houſes were not ſhaken with the roaring of the <hi>Canon,</hi> nor your wives made <hi>Widows,</hi> or your children <hi>Orphans</hi> by the edge of the <hi>ſword:</hi> Your City was then like the top of the hill at <hi>Rephidim</hi> where <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> held up the hands of <hi>Moſes;</hi> no hands lifted up here to <hi>fight</hi> but onely to <hi>pray;</hi> no ſiege here, but that about the Throne of Grace, <hi>ut ad Deum quaſi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu</hi>

               <hi>factâ, precationibus ambiamus orantes;</hi> no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or wreſtling here but that of <hi>Jacob</hi> with the Angel. This City was as it were the <hi>Chappel,</hi> the <hi>Oratory</hi> of the Nation.</p>
            <p>4. Look back on the late heavy blows by <hi>fire</hi> in this City; that ſad and ſudden blaſt by Gunpowder on Tower hill, whereby divers perſons periſhed; thoſe dangerous fires afterwards in other places, unto which the Lord could have given a commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on to have ſpread and diffuſed it ſelf into an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conflagration; the merciful rebuke which was upon the <hi>fire</hi> then, and the ſafety you have ſince enjoyed from ſuch dangers. And truly when I conſider how many Trades there are in this City which deal in <hi>combuſtible</hi> matters, Powder, Flax, Hemp, Pitch, Tar, Turpentine, Hops, Tallow, Paper, Oyl, and many other like, the caſualties
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118804:15"/>
and careleſneſs which may be in many amongſt ſo great a multitude, by knocking of Links, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing of Candles, by falling down or ſparkling of fire, by blowing out of Tobacco, and many other miſcarriages not eaſily ennumerable, it is an evident demonſtration of Gods watching over ſuch a City, and being himſelf <hi>a wall of fire</hi> about it, and giving his Miniſters, who are a <hi>flame of fire,</hi> a ſpecial charge over it, that other <hi>fires</hi> do not break out in it.</p>
            <p>5. Conſider the goodneſs of God to this City, in giving it zealous and faithful <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who make it their buſineſs to be vigilant over the good of this place, who lay next their hearts the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity thereof, to encourage vertue, to puniſh and ſuppreſs wickedneſs, to preſerve peace, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prophaneſs, to look to the health and good order of the place.</p>
            <p>6. Conſider the goodneſs of God unto you in a learned and a faithful <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> what endeavors ſome have uſed to cry them down, and to leave this Nation as ſheep without ſhepheards; the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and abundant light of the Goſpel which ſhineth on this place, this City being <hi>filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the Sea.</hi> If any City in the world may at this day be called as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> once was, a <hi>City of Truth,</hi> a <hi>holy Mountain,</hi> in regard I mean of the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> preached therein, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this may. Inſomuch that Forraigners, <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, (Germans, Batavians,</hi> others learn our lan guage, and come over to this City, that they may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118804:16"/>
hear your Preachers, and read your Engliſh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
            <p>In one word, look unto the <hi>concurrence</hi> with all Countries at home, all foreign Nations abroad do joyn in, to ſend <hi>variety</hi> of bleſſings and comforts unto this City. As the beams of the ſun are united in a Burning-glaſs, ſo variety of bleſſings meets from a wide circumference in ſuch a center as this. The <hi>Sea</hi> ſends you in Fiſh, and the <hi>Air</hi> Foul, the <hi>Fields</hi> Corn, and the <hi>Paſtures</hi> Cattel. Some Countries <hi>adorn</hi> you with Silks and Jewels; ſome <hi>warm</hi> you with Furs and Cottens; ſome <hi>heal</hi> you with Drugs and Balſoms; others <hi>comfort</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh you with Wines and Spices; ſome ſend in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to <hi>build</hi> your houſes, others ſend you in furniture for your <hi>ſhips;</hi> read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. and that will ſhew you the benefits of a <hi>Celebre Empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when you have viewed theſe mercies, look on the many and prodigious <hi>ſins</hi> whereby the Lord is provoked in this place to withdraw theſe mercies from it. Sins made much the more atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by the <hi>mercies</hi> and <hi>light</hi> againſt which they are committed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>Amos.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>Now then, as the Lord hath put into your hearts to conſecrate this day unto his <hi>praiſe,</hi> and to ſtir up one another <hi>to ſpeak good of his name,</hi> be pleaſed to ſet your ſelves ſeriouſly about it. Conſider it is not the work of the lips alone (though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt much in <hi>uttering</hi> the loving kindneſs, and in <hi>ſinging</hi> aloud of the goodneſs of the Lord.) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what <hi>David</hi> that great Artiſt in Divine
