         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>NFORCED
by affection (that
leades the mindes
of men to a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of causes)
I stood studying
howe to requit a
good turne recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that no one
thing is more mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
in nature than an vnthankefull minde, I saw
my self in debt, &amp; bound either one way or other to
pay that Iowe, but not in such degree as I receiued,
but in such sort as my abilitie serueth, &amp; as a man
might say to make a cunning exchange, in steed of
due payment, to offer glasse for gold &amp; bare words
<pb facs="tcp:10414:3"/>
for friendly deedes. In good truth (my honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Frend) if my creditours will so stande conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I am readier to depart from wordes, and
discharge debt therewith, than to promise trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and offer that I haue not. For if free har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
people (fortunate in the worlde) through
bountie of minde (towarde my sutes or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
bestowe manye speaches to doo mee good,
where grace is to bee gotten: I can but yeeld one
ordinarie thanke, for a thousande benefites, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they ransacke my storehouse of vaine inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
and finde some pleasant papers, bepain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with verses, or pollished Pamphlets (beblotted
with barraine matter) where both verse &amp; prose,
shall make but a bad restitution for the goodnesse I
haue stollen by fortune or borrowed by frendshippe.
Yet waying how little Fortune hath done for mee,
and howe fewe creditors I haue, that haue either
lent me anie porcion of preferment (or procured me
but a peece of anie certaine liuing) I thinke my self
somwhat able with the little talent God hath giuen
me, to repay all the debtes that euer I could bring
to perfect remembrance, sauing one a most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Personage, that I dedicated my booke of Choice
vnto, who got me two great Seales (besides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:10414:3"/>
courtesies manie) to shifte withall a season.
And furthermore, your selfe 6. yeres past bestowed
good speaches to the Q. Maiestie in my behalfe, by
the which I got some comfortable recreation, to
quicken my spirites &amp; keepe me in breath. And yet
loe a matter to be mused at, I haue sixteene seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
bookes printed presently to bee bought (albeit
they are but trifles) dedicated in sundrie seasons
to seuerall men off good and great credite, but to be
plaine not one among them all, from the first day of
my labour and studies, to this present yeere and
hower, hath anie waye preferred my sutes, amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
my state, or giuen mee anie countenaunce, I
hope I am not much indebted to those, nor fallen
so farre in their dangers, but may easely get out,
though I yeelde them no more, but a customable
good will. So finding my Muses franke and free
from their seruitude, I addresse this woorke of
vnfeyned friendshippe to your good considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which worke showes the value and woorth
of frendes (whose loue is necessarie about all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states)
the flatterie and finenesse of foes, and
the dayly dissimulation of a cunning worlde. And
if the world meruaile why I treat of that which is
so commonly knowen, and often put in practise,
<pb facs="tcp:10414:4"/>
I answere not those wondring wits, but shoot what
bolts I thinke conuenient, at the bad behauiour of
transformed people, that beares but the shapes of
tame men, &amp; showes the maners of wilde monsters:
and if the worlde say (as I knowe it is talkatiue)
I show a kinde of adulation to fawne for fauour on
those that are happie. I answere, that is a point of
wisdome, which my betters haue taught me, and I
haue read in a great booke of latine (printed 400.
yeres agoe) that one of your owne Ancestors cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Sir VVater Ralegh, had more fawners &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
than you haue: for he was L. chiefe Iustice
of England, and so farre in credit with his Prince,
(his learning was such) that he made lawes &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts,
the which the Prince confirmed &amp; allowed. I
take an example from the fish that followes the
streame, the fowles that comes to the couert from
the windes, and the brute beastes that auoydes a
sturdie storme, vnder the sauegard of a strong and
flourishing tree. Their craftie forecast though they
want reason, may succor the simplenes of any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
creature, &amp; the defence and prouision they
make to escape open danger, may set to schoole a
great companie of ignorant schollers. But I leaue to
speake of their examples (because they are brute)
<pb facs="tcp:10414:4"/>
and follow the grauest sort of sage &amp; wise persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that will not blush nor thinke scorne, to learne a
lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their <unclear>forefathers</unclear>, that got al their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
by following the flood, where we fish for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thus honorable friend, as my affection (&amp;
other good causes moues) bad me go forward with
this my deuice &amp; Present vnto you: so beginning
the same in health, and falling sodainly sicke, I fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
God would haue cut me short from my purposed
enterprise: but his goodnes called me vp, from the
bed of sorrow, (where despaire had almost dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the life) and set me afoote to go and ende my
first determination, and brought me in hope you wil
accept my good will: which may encourage me to a
further labour and studie, that may purchase more
greater fauor &amp; thanks. So resting yours in al that
my small power may stretch vnto, I take leaue, and
wish you what goodnes you can imagine or desire.</p>

            <l>Brings foorth fayre fruite, though spring be past and gon,</l>

            <l>His leaues are fresh, and greene as is the grasse,</l>
            <l>His sugred seedes, good cheape and nothing deere,</l>
            <l>His goodly barke, shines bright like gold or brasse:</l>
            <l>And yet this tree, in breast must needes be shrinde,</l>
            <l>And liues no where, but in a noble minde.</l>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing rockt too long in the careles

the hinderer of health, good happe

causes (my honorable friend) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
my wittes, and bad the
sensible Spirites arise from the forgetfull couch
of drowsie rest, and offer the bodie to some profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
exercises, that therby the head hand and pen
might either purchace commendation, or publish
to good people a matter that should merite some

and barely seene in the artes liberall, &amp; farre
vnfit to touch or treate of Diuinitie, I stoode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
<pb facs="tcp:10414:6"/>
and knewe not what thankfull thing I
should first goe about and take in hand to a good
end and purpose. And so a while bethinking mee
(minding to draw no stronger bow thau I could
well shoot in) &amp; looking into mine owne strength,
I sawe me most ablest and apt to be at commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of Prince, Countrie and Friends. In the
honoring and seruice of whom I should studie to
bring foorth some acceptable worke, not striuing
to shewe any rare inuention (that passeth a meane
mans capacitie) but to vtter and reuiue matter of
some moment knowne and talked of long agoe,

layne dead (for any great fruite it hath shewed) in
the memorie of man. The thing that I meane
that hath layne so long in the graue of forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is faithfull friendship, which <hi>Tully</hi> hath tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and a number of good authors haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of, but fewe in these daies haue obserued, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
and followed.</p>
            <p>And now to proceed forward with this freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
(and shewe the degrees thereof orderly) mee
thinkes that the first braunch thereof is the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionat

to their countrie. For the which <hi>Musius Scaeuola, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratius

shall reade that some although they were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from their countrie, yet they bore in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
and breastes, to the hower of their death, the
loue of their countrie, parents, friends and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
In which euerlasting loue of theirs remayned

such manly and honorable motions of the minde,
that many noble seruices (of voluntarie goodwill
were brought forth by them to the benefite of their
countrie, and recouerie of their first credite, estate
and dignitie. Thus by a naturall disposition
planted in the soule &amp; sensible store-house of stayed
iudgement, great exploytes were brought to
passe, and sondrie wonders of this world hath ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely
bene taken in hand. And surely all these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
examples (with the hazarde of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
liues) brauely put in proofe and executed,
serues to no other ende (as their meaning was)
but to teach those that came after with the like
greatnesse of minde, to followe the forerunners of
all worthy renowne and worldly reputation. So
by this, thousands may see, man is not made for
himself, created to be king of earthly delights, and
placed amidst the pleasures of the worlde, to doe
what he pleaseth, but chiefly to looke and with
good aduisement to search, how and in what sort
he may be duetiful and beneficiall to his countrie.
Now peraduenture in this perillous age (where
many are puft vp with presumption) and sedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
season of proude practises and headstrong
people, some serpentine sect, that caries venome in
their mindes, and mortal stings in their tongues,
will holde a bad opinion and say: that the earth is
made for the children of men (as the Sea is for
the fish) and that is mans natural countrie where
he findeth foode, liuing, and credite in. But this
canckred kinde of rebellious conceite, is such a
gnawing worme in the conscience of man, (and so
<pb facs="tcp:10414:7"/>
farre differs from all humaine lawes) that he that
but thinkes one thought of this nature, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnnaturall to his countrie, but likewise vnbles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and vnhappie in all the soyles and countries
he happeneth to dwell in. For he that honoreth
not in hart the soyle and seate of his natiuitie, and
despiseth the place where he tooke life, sustenance,
nurriture and education, besides good fortune
and preferments (the onely blessednesse here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
of) he doth degenerate, and what birth and
blood soeuer he be of, we may call him a bace borne
groome, or a kindly bastard begotten out of time,
liuing out of order, and of worse beleefe than an
Infidell. The birdes of the ayre, the fish in the
flood, and the beastes on the earth loueth to haunt
and behold the place of their procreation: and the
greatest Conquerors that euer were (call them
Kings or what you please) though they went ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so farre to obtaine victories, yet they brought
all the glorie home to their countrie, and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
onely there where they were first fostered,
founde fauour and fortune, and had from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
bene trayned and brought vp: yea and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their life (both Kings, Prophets and other
great men) desired to haue their bones buried in
their countrie. And some of excellent iudgement
held opinion, that the loue of their countrie did
farre surpasse the loue of their parents, in defence
of which they offred liues, lands and goods, and
cared not what daunger they should thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into, so that thereby they might doe their
countrie any honour or seruice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10414:7"/>
O then what a blemish and blot is this in the
faces and browes of them that in a proude pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
(perswaded by pestilent wittes) aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth
their country, and would hazard on a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish
opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (if it were in their power) to sel Prince,
people and patrimonie, for a colde and bare wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
full of hollownes of hart in a strange King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
where cracked credite is lothsome and long
mistrusted, and seeldome or neuer comes to a good
and honorable ende, I can but wish their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
no worse nor better, but such as <hi>
                  <unclear>Tarpeia</unclear>
               </hi>
fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Sabines</hi> for selling vnto them
the Capitoll of <hi>Rome:</hi> a most notorious example
reade it who pleaseth. So if in those daies (a great
while agoe) millions of men helde the loue and
friendship of their countrie so deere and precious,
as in deede it ought to bee esteemed: now in our
ripened yeeres when wittes are mellowed and
seasoned with the sweete sauour of long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
the folly and foule facts that by ouer great
boldnes makes many runne mad, should be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
warning, and teach all kinde of people, to
keepe the right and playne path of naturall affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards their countrie and friends.</p>
            <p>Now, all these thinges there rehearsed before,
are written in way of friendship to the wild wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
of this worlde, who vndoubtedly wants
but grace and good councell. And the rest that
followes hereafter in this little peece of prose, is
written to your selfe (my honorable friend) whose
friendship I haue felt, and sondrie moe haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
Let the deede shewe it selfe: not writing this
<pb facs="tcp:10414:8"/>
to teach you (with presuming wordes) any other
course than your former iudgement and present
consideration thinkes best to holde, but onely to
keepe the blaze of good will continually burning,
by feeding the flame with plying and putting in
more oyle to the lampe. For I acknowledge that
you knowe, that as the sinowes is needfull for
the body, the marrow for the bones, and the blood
for the life: so friendship is most fittest to knit the
ioyntes and mindes of men together, and bindes
them about with such brazen bandes, that no
barres of yron may breake, nor policie of people
may put asunder.</p>
            <p>He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath trauayled (as I haue done) through
the torrest of affliction, where many wilde beastes
are wandering in the woods (some roring and
running after their pray) shall see how narrowly
he hath escaped from the gaping and deuouring
monsters, and finde that if friendshippe and good
fortune had not holpen him, he had bene vtterly
destroyed. From the highest to the lowest (reckon
what degrees can bee named) in good sooth they
are all left alone bare-footed and desolate, where
friendship hath forsaken them. But where or into
what laborinth, O Lorde, haue I now brought
my selfe: for now I am forced to goe forward, and
may not steppe backe, but seeke an open way to
walke in, orderly to set downe and shewe the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of friendship, the flatterie of the world, and
the sinenesse of our age: the circumstance whereof
craues an other maner of discourse and volume
than this little treatise can vtter. What then, as
<pb facs="tcp:10414:8"/>
by small sparkes (or kindled coales) great fire is
made, and of a trifeling tale true matter may bee
gathered: so out of weake wordes strong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may bee sifted, and through a number of
spiced speeches, a simple sentence may shewe some
sauour, and yeeld such tast to the quicknesse of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
that the hearers wittes and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall willingly stand contented with all that
shall be spoken. And friendship is so much desired,
spoken of, and necessarie for all kinde of people,
that onely the bare and naked name thereof, is
sweete and most acceptable, though the writer
thereon be but meanly learned, and of small suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience
to set out at the full, the fulnesse of so florish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a vertue.</p>
            <p>Then forward to the purpose: I say and proue
that the same is true friendship that proceedes
from vertue, and hath so noble a nature (by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
motion of goodnesse) that neither vice can
corrupt, nor any kinde of vanitie vanquish: For
where it taketh roote, it buds so beautifully that
it bringeth foorth an euerlasting fruite, whose
taste is more sweete and precious, than can bee
easely imagined.</p>
            <p>And now in a season, when finenes and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
so aboundeth, and striues by cunning practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to supplie the place of friendshippe (and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growe
euery braunch that springs from loyall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie)
this true friendshippe is most sweetest of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
and most highest of reputation, and burnes
with a quenchlesse flame, like a blazing Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon,
or sparkling Torche (that can abide all
<pb facs="tcp:10414:9"/>
windes) which is set vp on the toppe of a high
Mountaine. For fine or grosse flatterie is but a
bare foyle to set forth a bad Iewell: and the craftie
curious cunning of these artificiall fellowes (that
feedes all mens humours) makes through their
manifolde trumperies, a free passage to perfect
faithfulnesse and friendly good will. There is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly
crept and finely conuayed, into the common
societie of men, a hundred sondrie sortes &amp; shewes
of amitie, which in deede are but iuggling castes
(or ledger demayne) to purchase fauour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the lookers on. If all that speake faire, bowe
downe knee, make trim curtchie, kisse fingers and
handes (yea offer seruice and friendshippe) were
harty and louing friends, the world would bee so
full of friendship, that there were no place left for
adulation and dubble dealing. And surely if a
man durst discipher the deepenesse of dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wee should finde our ordinarie manner of
friendship so faint-harted and lame, that it neither
could goe out of the doore with any man, nor yet
dwell safely with many in the house. It seemeth
and may bee well aduouched, that friendship of it
selfe is so secrete a mysterie (shrined in an honest
hart) that few can describe it, and tel from whence
comes the priuie and inwarde affection, that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
breedes in breast, and is conuayed to the
hart, with such a content and gladnesse, that the
whole powers of man leapes in the bowelles of
the bodie for ioye at that instant. For example,
some that neuer giues cause (with probable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
to bee embraced and made account of as a
<pb facs="tcp:10414:9"/>
friend, is by a naturall inclination, receiued into
fauour, placed in delight, and planted perpetually
(so long as life lasteth) in the warme bosome of
our frendly affections and fauourable conceites.</p>
            <p>Then further note, a wonder of nature, for we
see a merueilous motion among men: for some,
and that a great number, hauing neither harmed
vs, nor ministred any way occasion of dislike, yet
no sooner in our companie, but we finde their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
offensiue, their presence vnpleasant, their
wordes sharpe, (spoken well and to the best mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
yea their workes and whatsoeuer they will
doe, are taken amisse and construed to the worst.
But chiefly to be noted, we litle desire the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
peraduenture of a friendly companion.
Thus so to hate without cause, and loue earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without desart, is a matter disputable, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
plainly, that friendship is (without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
the onely true loue knot, that knits in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction,
thousands together: and yet the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and maner of the working is so great, that the
ripest wittes may waxe rotten, before they yeeld
reason, and shewe how the mixture is made: that
two seuerall bodies shall meete in one minde, and
bee as it were maried and ioyned in one maner of
disposition, with so small a shewe of vertue, and so
little cause, that may constrayne both parties to be
bound and fast locked in a league of loue. Then
what may bee thought on those that currie fauor,
followe for good turnes, turnes about like a we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-cocke,
faunes where fortune fauors, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors
no where, but for commoditie, countenance,
<pb facs="tcp:10414:10"/>
credite, and to compasse that they seeke. If friends
bee chosen by election and priuie liking, these open
palterers may goe whistle: for neither they know
the boundes of a good minde, nor the blessednesse
that belongs to friendship. What then should we
say of mens behauiours in generall? For without
reuerence vttered by courtesie, suing and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for benefite, fauning and speaking fayre (for
entertayning of time) creeping and crouching to
keepe that wee haue, and winne that wee wish, all
ciuill order would bee forgotten, rudenesse would
make reuell, and men should sodainly misse the
marke they shoote at. But graunting now, these
ceremonious fashions and maners, yet the vsers
thereof, are no more like friends, than a Maske
and Mommerie (with vizars on their faces) is
like a company of graue Senators, that gouerns
a mightie Monarchie. And more then mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
it is, that such paynted shadowes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
preferred to bee as pillers of friendshippe,
when friendship, without proppes stands against
all weathers and windes, and is of a more cleere
complexion, than to bee patched vp with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds,
or matched with corrupted maners, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
to vertue, and friend to nothing but vice. For
friendshippe is a certaine felicitie of the minde, a
sweete ensence that burnes before God, a preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of mans renowne and life, a willing bondage
that brings freedome for euer, a stedfast staffe that
all good people doe stay on, the mother and nurse
of mutuall loue, the conqueror of hate, the pacifier
of quarels, the glorie of Kings, and the suretie of
<pb facs="tcp:10414:10"/>
subiects. And friendship is so princely and noble
of condition, it may not bee ioyned with anie but
such as are as honorable as it selfe. You shall see
among friendes of equall calling (that are like of
affection) such a sweete and common consent of
fraternall loue and liking, that euery thing is
wrested to the best construction, and no one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may be ministred amisse, the mindes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of men, runs so mirrily together, as it were
a sorte of pretie chickens, hopping hastely after the
cheereful chucking, of a brooding hen. And where
such amitie is (enterlarded with honest pastime)
there all hollownes of hart is banished, all playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is embraced, and all good things doe prosper:
as a man might say, friendship is a ring-leader to
all happinesse, and the guide that shewes men the
high way to all worldly exercises.</p>
            <p>But now some may aske me, how men should
make choyce of their friends, and knowe by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
apparance, the inwarde disposition of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
so many looke smoothly, so many flatter, and
so many hath clapped on such audacious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
that the wisest may be beguiled when he
least lookes for <unclear>defaite</unclear>? It may bee aunswered,
that choyce ought to be made of proofe, and not of
fayre semblance, but of constant perfection: for
such as casteth colours on cunning deuises, and
alwaies to cloke collusion, crcepes finely in fauor
with simpering and smiling, to leade readie wits
after their subtill intentions, by their needles bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fruitlesse fauning, often chaunge of vizage, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manerly
boldnes, and daily attendance, where no
<pb facs="tcp:10414:11"/>
desart commaunds them, the fayned friends of
this world may be found, and in the state of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
all true friendship is tryed. And me thinkes
they take no great paynes, that accompanie men
in their prosperitie, and they merite no great
thankes, that desire to taste (at all times) other
mens good fortunes: so that by thrusting and
pressing after those, we hope to plucke somewhat
from, debates of it selfe it is no certaine signe of
friendship, that springs from a simple and playne
affection.</p>
            <p>Now, many will holde question, and say that
Fortune must be followed, sought for, waited on,
flattered because she is a deceiuer, and finely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned:
For that with rude and rusticall behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
both fortune and friends, will fling vs farre
behinde, that would march before our fellowes.
But I pray you, is not the long proofe of craftie
practises, the extraordinary dissimulation of fine
people, a testimonie that they are no true dealers,
that worke with worldly wickednesse and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
to bee accepted as friends. Then who should
presently be called a faithfull follower? thus some
man may demaunde. Such I say as in mens
meanest calling and credite, hath begun to fauour
them, and in their better estate, doe honestly in all
causes of reason, equitie and iustice of iudgement,
discharge their dueties, and leaue flatterie (that
openeth the doore of dubblenesse) and fall flatly to
the true order of playne dealing: such I say that
neither for fauor, feare or fortune, but dare speake
as they thinke (due reuerence obserued) and doe
<pb facs="tcp:10414:11"/>
rather cut off the festered flesh than feede and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
a corrupted cancker. Such whose loue and
fidelitie lookes narrowly on all the bounds and
limits of friendshippe, and are so ielous ouer the
friends they honour, that they cannot suffer any
thing to sound out of frame, that may impeach,
hinder, or appale the good name and credite of
them they follow: such whose studie, diligence and
waking regarde, stands as a watch to giue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and aduertise their friends of all inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
daungers, sclaunders, and eminent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
and hazardes: such are the members most
meete to be about a frend, most worthie welcome,
most to bee liked, loued and trusted: and such are
the blessed birds of the bosome, that ne sings nor
sayes, nor makes signe of other thing than they
present. And the rest that loyter about crooked
measures, sounding and searching by deceites
(like Fishers that closely hides their hookes) to
see who they may catch, take holde of, and feele for
their aduantage. They are the slee smellers out
of fortunate flowers, that growes in happy mens
gardens, the prowlers after profite and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
purchased by audacious practises, the busie
bodies that neuer stands still, but turnes like a
toppe to betray the trustie: the tossed white froth
of the Sea (that makes a fayre shewe without
substance) which vanisheth away at the touch of
euery mans finger: and they are the swelling
bubbles of the troubled water that are blowne
with each litle blast ouer many a land, and makes
neither signe from whence they are come, nor to
<pb facs="tcp:10414:12"/>
what good ende and purpose they serue. So sir,
seeing the swarmes of fayned friends, the heapes
of hollowe harts, the abuse of infected mindes,
the musted faces couered with counterfaite good
maners, and the effect of true friendshippe vtterly
mistaken, in many poynts &amp; places of this world.
I trouble you no further with the reading of these
lines, hoping in your fauour and friendshippe, as
your affection shall mooue, and my merites with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

a further present vnto you, of a few verses (hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
