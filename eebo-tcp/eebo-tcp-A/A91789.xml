         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

them with words, yet they are wanting to him.</q>

            <bibl>Dan. 4. 27.</bibl>
            <q>Let my counſell be acceptable unto thee, and
breake off thy ſins by righteouſneſs, and thine iniquities
by ſhewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening of
thy tranquility.</q>

that they ſhould keep it for themſelves, but that they ſhould ſupply

            <p>Reaſons why we ſhould impart and give to ſupply the wants of others, are,
becauſe</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is Gods command that we do ſo:</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord, deale thy
bread to the hungry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 7. Leave for the poor, that the poor may eate, <hi>Lev.
19. 10. &amp;</hi> 23. 22. If thine enemie hunger, feed him, give him bread to eate; if

thou ſhalt relieve him, and alſo a ſtranger, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 35. Thou ſhalt love thy
neighbour as thy ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 9.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Chriſt did ſo:</hi> Ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, though hee
was rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might
be made rich, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 9. ſee</hi> Iſa. 25. 4. <hi>He ſaith,</hi> learn of me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29.
He that followeth not after me, is not worthy of me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 38. Chriſt had

had compaſſion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 33, 34.</p>

2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>I brought alms to my nation,</hi> Act. 24. 17. <hi>Dorcas was full of good works, &amp;
almes deeds which ſhe did,</hi> Act. 19. 36. 39. <hi>She ſtretcheth out her hand to the

wretched, covetous extortioner; but when he was converted,
immediatly he became liberall; <hi>Half my goods I give to the poor, &amp;c.</hi> Luk.
19. 7, 8, 9. So they <hi>ſold their poſſeſſions and goods, and parted them to all men,
as every man had need,</hi> Acts 2. 44. 45. &amp; 4. 32, 33, 34, 35. 37. Exo. 16. 18. 15. 2 Cor.
18. 14, 15. <hi>The righteous giveth, and ſpareth not,</hi> Pro. 21. 26. <hi>Beyond their
power they were willing,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you which
was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 2. 15. <hi>God grant you to be like minded one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
according to Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 15. 5. Beliveers have <hi>the minde of
Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16. Phil. 2. 19, 20. <hi>They are merciful,</hi> Mat. 5. 7. Col. 3. 12.
So much as we are like Chriſt, we love, are pittiful, and have bowels
of mercy; ſo much as we believe, we love; love is full of labour, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and ſpareth for no coſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 24. How are we like Chriſt &amp;
his people, if we have not the ſame ſpirit, mind, &amp; heart they have? If

            <p>4. What we have is Gods, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 17. what we have to ſpare, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
need the ſame, God hath bidden us to give it them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 25. 21. If
he hath ordered it for them, it is their due, it is injuſtice and theft to
detain it. <hi>With-hold not the goods from them to whom it is due, though there
be power in thine hand to do it,</hi> Pro. 3. 27.</p>

to be without <hi>naturall affection,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 3.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Give and ye ſhall ſin leſs.</hi> Break off thy iniquities by ſhewing mercy to
the poor, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27. By mercy and truth iniquity is purged, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16. 6.</p>

2 <hi>Cor. 8. 9. 24. Philem.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>9. Not to give, or to give ſparingly is a cauſe of poverty. <hi>He beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
poor that dealeth with a ſlack hand,</hi> Pro. 10. 4. So to <hi>with-hold more then
is meet tendeth to poverty,</hi> Pro. 11. 24.</p>
            <p>10. To give is the way to have more. <hi>There is that ſcattereth, and yet
encreaſeth,</hi> Pro. 11. 24. <hi>Give, and it ſhall be given you,</hi> Lu. 6. 38.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>What you give is not loſt, but lent, God hath promiſed to pay
it again.</hi> He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth to the Lord, and that which he
hath given, will he pay him again, <hi>Pro.</hi> 19. 17. Caſt thy bread upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

but not God, becauſe they do not know him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. <hi>To ſhew mercy to the</hi> poor may be a lengthening of thy tranquility,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27. The mercifull man doth good to his owne ſoule, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. 17.</p>

to ſupply others neceſſities, yea and to part with ſome part of
that which is neceſſary for us, to ſupply others in their extreamities;
thoſe that wil not do ſo, wil not ſel their poſſeſſions (much leſs dye for
their brethren) to feed the hungry belly, and cloath the naked body

            <p>Surely many would give much, and enough to ſupply the wants of
others; but until things be put into ſome good way &amp; order; if ſome
who have great eſtates ſhould ſell them, and give all away, it would

               <hi>There are Statutes as good as can be deſired for the poor if executed, the Statue</hi> 43.
Eliz. 2. <hi>Provide</hi> to raiſe weekely, or otherwiſe of every inhabitant ſuch ſumms of money as they
ſhall thinke fit for a ſtocke to ſet the poor on worke (and to compell them to worke) <hi>and</hi> towards
the neceſſary reliefe of poor not able to worke to diſtreſſe and ſale of goods, or impriſon without baile
or mainprize till he have paid the ſame. <hi>Yet for theſe many years the poor are neglected,
and ſuffered to beg contrary to the ſtatutes: Yea, they ſuffer great miſery, and run to
ruine, and yet both Magiſtrate, Miniſter, and people are ſilent, and content to have
it ſo, this is a ſore evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thear the Town of <hi>Maidſtone</hi> and the City of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and a few other places, the
poore are ſet to worke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and provided for without begging. Oh that <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. would
doe ſo alſo, <hi>That there be no complaining in our ſtreets,</hi> Pſal. 144. 14. But in ſtead of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the poor, there be that rob the poor. One Juſtice of Peace gave in his account of
the poors money 500. pound ſhort, this can be p<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oved. If men fearing God and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
covetouſneſſe, were appointed to receive that which would be voluntary given to
effect this good worke; there would be ſtock enough to ſet the poor on work, and to
ſupply all wants The people of this Nation have been ſo bountifull, that a Law was
made to reſtrain them, fearing that all the whole L<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d would be given to the poor, the
Papiſt may riſe up againſt many of this generation. It is a ſad thing that they ſhould be
more forward upon a bad principle, then a Chriſtian upon a good one. I hope it will
<pb facs="tcp:166597:8"/>
not be long till thoſe in Authority will conſider the cauſe of the poor and help it. It is
poſſible we may ſee ſome as willing to help o<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hers as to help themſelves, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
others to do ſo: the poor daily increaſe and multiply; in time, if you prevent it
not, they will be able and willing to order you and your eſtates as they think fit. Take
care, and provide work and things neceſſary for the poor. Surely there is no worke in
the world that men will give more freely unto then this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worthy</hi> Oliver Cormwel <hi>deſerves great honour and imitation, he gives
more mony to the poor then any I have heard of in our days,</hi> thouſands a year.
I would the Rich would follow his ſteps; it is expected the Lord will
uſe him with ſome others who have the ſame ſpirit, and mercifull
heart to do great things for the good of this Nation, eſpecially to eaſe
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he oppreſſed, and to help them that cannot help themſelves, and that
all honeſt and wel-minded people ſhall bleſſe God for them, and for
what they have done; the benefit and good thereof will more &amp; more
appear to the glory of God, and the welfare of this Nation. <hi>He hath
put down the mighty from their ſeate, and exalted them of low degree,</hi> Lu. 1.
52. <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubject to the higher Powers, there is no power but of
God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. Thoſe againſt whom none are able to prevail, are
the greateſt and higeſt power.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have the greateſt power, are the fitteſt, and moſt able to
protect and govern: honour &amp; obedience is due to them that protect.</p>
            <p>God hath by this Army protected, ſaved our eſtates and lives. Such
Rulers are to be deſired, who feare God, and have power and good
principles. In reaſon we may expect a continued ſafety from them
who have been a meanes to procure the liberty we enjoy, rather then
from others, who under the title of Authority would undo us. Did
not the late Parliament order treble damages for not paying of tithes,
and erect a tribunall to puniſh all that did preach without ordination
of the ſaid Hierarchy and their Prieſts, which themſelves have declared
to be Antichriſtian. There doth not appear more love to God, to
his people, and to this Nation, then in the Officers of the Army.</p>
            <p>They deſerve the greateſt honour and truſt among men that have
ſuffered, been wounded, and ſhed their blood for this Nation, have
freely offered for Gods ſake, and for our ſakes their lives and eſtates
to ſave ours. I pray you give us leave to owne and ſpeak well of them
who have ſaved our eſtates and live<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>God doth not put the power into the hands of any, ſo much for
their ſakes as for others; the honour, ſafety, welfare, peace, comfort,
happineſſe, and glory of this poore Nation they ought to ſeek and
prefer before their own. I truſt the Lord hath put it into the hearts
of thoſe who have the power over us, to ſay, we will doe this, and ſee
this done; we will not ſeeke our own things, but every one anothers
welfare, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 24. and each one to ſay as <hi>Gideon, I will not rule
over you, the Lord ſhall rule over you,</hi> Judg 8. 23.</p>
            <p>Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as his worke ſhall be, <hi>Rev.  22. 21.</hi>
