            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Discourse</hi> (Christian <hi>Reader)</hi> is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son tho' of real Value, who yet hath so very Low an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of himself, as to think my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation may give some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to this his Performance. They are indeed very Accidental Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:34071:3"/>
that make this difference, very often, between some and others, in the Eye of the World. Otherwise, that might well be said, which was in that great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; <hi>I have need to—come to thee, and comest thou to me?</hi> It is evident to those who know him, that the many years, heretofore, wherein he drew <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademick</hi> Breath, and liv'd an Ornament to the <hi>Society,</hi> whereof he was long a Member, were not trifled away. There he past his time as a <hi>Recluse;</hi> more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>his Study,</hi> than the <hi>Theater.</hi> He closely pursu'd his design; more to acquire solid, useful <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> than <hi>Fame.</hi> And since, in his long Rural Recess, his design hath been the same; and his way of Living hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle differ'd, in a Chosen Obscurity; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented rather to Shine to <hi>Himself,</hi> than the World.</p>
            <p>Yet the Urgency of Conscience, and a desire to do good to the Soules of Men, hath wrung from him this short <hi>TREATISE.</hi> An Off-spring that hath

            <p>CHrist hath taught us (who is our Mediator) how far to extend our Prayers, not onely to our Fiends, but to our Enemies and Persecutors. And
<pb facs="tcp:34071:5"/>
will Christ (who also is ordain'd Judge of the World) take it well at the Great Day, That Parents make not continual Prayers, Morning and Evening for, and with their Children, and the rest of their Families? Are not Children the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded pieces of your selves? Will not that same <gap reason="foreign">

You are not onely Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Natural, but Christian, and have Promised in the Presence of God and his Church, that your Children should be Vertuously brought up to lead a Godly and Christian Life. O remember your Promise made at their Baptism, and do not Unchristen them by your Breach of Covenant! O Pray, That God would make you instrumental for their Spiritual well-being, as he hath for their Natural being. Beware of Poysoning the Soules of your Children, whose Bodies you have nurst at your breasts, and fed at your Tables. How can such Parents answer it at the great day of Appearance, who, by wicked Examples, teach their Children to Curse and Swear,
<pb facs="tcp:34071:5"/>
Lye, Cheat, Break the Sabbath, and to make no reckoning of Religion? Be not deceived, for if you be not Christians in your own Houses (whatever profession you make in the House of God) your Christianity is unsound. Assure your selves, that if Christianity were possest of your Hearts, it would be Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in your Houses. Is not Sin the Plague of the Heart? Is it not of an active, infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prevailing nature? Is not Sin allways with us, and diffuseth it self into all places where we live? Doubtless Sin follows Men whithersoever they goe, to Church, Market, and home again. What would you have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be? What is Christianity? Must Religion be a Stranger, or some soft Guest, who comes but seldom to see you, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, after a while, becomes fastidious? What would you make of true Piety, What would you have Christianity to be? A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised Inferiour, to stand or fall, to come or goe at your pleasure, taken in, cast out, used a little, and then laid aside? It cannot be such a <hi>Thing.</hi> But true Religion and Christianity is <hi>That Thing,</hi> which breaths Heavenly, Regenerating, Renewing, Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Influences: It is, That same Ancient,
<pb facs="tcp:34071:6"/>
Sacred, Awsom <hi>Thing,</hi> which pierceth the Soul, the Heart, Conscience, and by the Power of God, changeth the whole Man-Lastly, (O all you Heads of Families) be not deceived, if you and your Housholds be Religious, and Christians Indeed, that Religion will Bear the Image of Holiness and Righteonsness, making not onely your Houses, but your Soules and Bodies, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the Holy Ghost to dwell in. If what is here written in this <hi>Short Tract</hi> [By <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Motive]</hi> prevail with any One Family in a Parish, or any one Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Family (so Precious is the Soules Salvation) to become <hi>Practisers</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> in their Houses, I shall rejoyce that I have not Run in vain, nor Laboured in vain, through Jesus Christ or Saviour, to whom be Glory for ever.

            <p>It is a most Dangerous Design, to think of Multiplying Vice and Impiety by gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Societies, as if the Lesser Sins of Single Life, Married into Company, might take Liberty to swel into a Flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 25.

               </note> for the Material place, where the People Assemble to Worship God, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the Juridical Power of Church-Officers, and sometimes for the Church-Revenues. But here it is taken for, The Visible Church of Christ, Militant upon the Earth, as it Comprehends Believers of All Places and Times from first to last; And as it is made up of Particular Churches or Societies of Believers; And these made up of Believing Families. A Christian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily should be the <hi>Epitome</hi> and <hi>Nursery</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> But (alas) it is far otherwise at this day. A Minister may go into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Families in the Parish and Chappel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not a Word of Scripture Read, nor a Prayer made in the Family all the Week long, as if Religion were An <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> not A <hi>Friend</hi> to their <hi>House;</hi> or, That <hi>Religion</hi> were a <hi>Duty Onely</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi> and not on the Week day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:34071:9"/>
The Church of God, at the first, was <hi>Domestical,</hi> not <hi>National,</hi> till the Holy Line grew <hi>Strong</hi> and <hi>Populous</hi> from Good <hi>Families;</hi> As from <hi>Adam, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Shem</hi> (who lived till <hi>Isaac</hi> was 50 years old) <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, by Promise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so it came to pass in After-times, that as <hi>Posterity</hi> in <hi>Families Degenerated,</hi> so the <hi>Church Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,</hi> as in <hi>Cain, Ham, Ishmael, Esau.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Cause of the Churches Decay in our days.</note> Thus it is in our Days, <hi>Ungodly Families</hi> are the <hi>Decay</hi> of God's <hi>Church;</hi> they make <hi>Thin</hi> Congregations, they bring a <hi>VVast</hi> upon the <hi>Solemn Assemblies.</hi> What an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious</hi> Thing is it to Loiter away the Lord's Day?

What a piece of Wickedness is it, to go forth all the Week to Serve the World, and Refuse to go forth on the Lord's Day to Serve him? Who would think that Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Profanation were so shameless in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies called Christian? Why should a <hi>poor excuse</hi> hinder Men and Women from the Church, which must not from the Market? How many <hi>Halts</hi> do some <hi>Make,</hi> when they should <hi>Goe</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify the Lord's-Day in their Conscionable Attendance upon God's Ordinances? What an <hi>Unseemly</hi> Thing is it to <hi>Skulk</hi> at <hi>Home,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:34071:10"/>
or at a <hi>Neighbours House,</hi> to <hi>Chatt</hi> and <hi>Talk</hi> away, to <hi>Feast</hi> away, <hi>Sleep</hi> away, <hi>Surfeit</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>Bibb</hi> and <hi>Fiddle, Smoak</hi> and <hi>Pipe,</hi> for <hi>Carnal Pleasure;</hi> to <hi>Visit</hi> away, and, <hi>for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi> to <hi>Travel</hi> away the <hi>Lord's-</hi>Day, when they should be <hi>waiting</hi> at the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> O what pitty is it, that obscure Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling-houses should pick and pilfer any one Member of a Congregation from the House of God? These profane Families do break Covenant which they made in Baptism, whereby they were Solemnly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church of God, Engaging to Renounce the Works of the Devil, the World and the Flesh and to continue in the Communion of Saints, to love, fear, and worship that God, who made them for that end, and into whose Name they were Baptized, Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.

All Ungodly Families do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the guilt of that Foul Sin of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by their Sabbath-breaking. For if they be for Real Membership with the Church of Christ, why do they not hold fast their Christian Profession in Publick?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34071:10"/>
Why do they not Keep their Baptismal Covenant, to holy and constant Fellowship with Christ and his Church in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies? Why do they not set up Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Christianity in their Houses, that they might partake of Heavenly Promises and Blessings of the Spirit of Christ, by Prayers and Praises, Reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and Catechizing? All which Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties stand Obliging them, as they be the genuine and proper fruits and Evidences of that Mystical Union and Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which is between Christ and all sound Christians and Church-Members. For, He is not a good Church-man, that is not a good Christian at Home. <hi>He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly, neither is that Circumcision, which is outward in the Flesh: But he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and Circumcision is that of the Heart, in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not in the Letter, whose Praise is not of Men, but of God,</hi> Rom. 2. two last Verses.</p>
            <p>What profit will there be at the Day of Judgment, of Names of Christians, and live like Insidels and Heathens? What? Shall God's Grace abound to us in this Age of his Church, by breaking down the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Wall of Partition between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> to make his Church Catholick:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34071:11"/>
And shall we set up a Partition-Wall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God's House and our own, and not permit Religion to dwell there? O let not any Professor confine Religion within Church-walls, seeing, That the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Faithful is made up of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Families, and seeing, That a Right Belief in the Church-Assembly, will bring forth the Fruits of Holiness in thy Family. And all Parents and Masters of Families now under the Gospel, ought to be more Useful for the Spiritual concerns, of all under their Care, then those Parents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; And that because of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er discoveries, and more plentiful Effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Grace. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your Sons and your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters shall Prophecy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see Visions, also upon the servants and the handmaids, I will pour out my spirit,</hi> Joel 2. 28, 29.

it might be consider'd, that God will reckon with all Governours of Families, both for not Using and Abusing their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of Authority.

No Heathen <hi>Gods,</hi> nor Evil <hi>Spirits,</hi> nor the <hi>Devil</hi> himself (whom they Invocate as Chief) can send Curses upon any one, without Commission from the Allmighty.</p>

            <p>When <hi>Cain</hi> was banisht from God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, it was not onely, an Exile to him, but an Execration upon him, as one Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of his Gracious Protection and Mercy for ever.

If it were possible to be Wicked alone, without Infecting others, it would not be so Infamous, as to make others to Sin, as do all Wicked Families.

What Comfort in that healthy Body, which is made a sink of Sin, and slave to every noisom Lust? Certainly this Corporal Health and Strength is worse then brutish, for the Beast Feeds, Works, Resleth, Playeth for the benefit of Man; but a Wicked Healthy Man, is not onely an Enemy, but a Curse to himself, and to all that partake with him in his Sin.

            <p>How this may consist with the Justice of God, Is thus Resolved, (1.) <note n="†" place="margin">A great Question Answer'd in many Particulars</note> The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments which God bringeth upon the Children for the Fathers sins, are onely Temporal and Outward Punishments. <note n="*" place="margin">

they are smitten with Infectious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, as <hi>Gehazies</hi> Posterity; some come to untimely ends, as <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Absalon,</hi> and the little Children of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram.</hi> Posterity may fare better or worse, for the Vertues, or Vices of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, <hi>i. e..</hi> Outwardly and Temporally, but Spiritually and Eternally they do not: For as never yet any Man went to Heaven for his Fathers Goodness, so not to Hell for his Fathers Wickedness. (2.) Children most times tread in their Fathers Steps, and continue in their Sins, and so draw upon themselves their Punishments. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that most times sins pass along from the Father to the Son, and so down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by a kind of Lineal Descent from Parents to Children, whole Families being tainted with the special Vices of their Stock; either by Nature, Example, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation. <note n="*" place="margin">Aetas pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor avis tulit nos nequiores; mox datu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niem viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osiorem.</note> Therefore Parents ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Constitution-Sins in themselves, which follow the predominant humours of their Bodies and Souls, and of shewing bad Examples for want of good Education. If we should observe some Families for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Generations Descending, we may see Whole Generations of Ryotous, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Swearers, Sabbath-breakers, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Persecutors, Oppressors, Unclean and Filthy Persons, Superstitious and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34071:23"/>
Families, and such like. And thus the Curse of God descends upon Posterity. (3.) It is to be noted (for our better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, how justly God punisheth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for sins of Wicked Parents and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours) that between Head and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Governours and Governed (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Kingdoms, or Churches, or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies) there is such an Union, that whereas we look upon them severally, they are but One, as One Body, Magistrates are Civil Fathers, Ministers are Ecclesiastical, and Parents of Families (over and besides) are Natural Fathers. Now, where there is Union, there is Communion, suited to the Relative State of Things and Persons, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Rewards and Punishments. The whole Person of Man is Punish'd for one part, Tongue or Hand; for, as they Act for the Whole, so they make it obnoxious. And so it is with Magistrates and Rulers, in respect of those under Government. For, as in the Body Natural, there is a Locomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty, guided and commanded by Superior Principles of Sense and Reason, to go forth and bring home those things which are suitable to it: So in every Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, there are Inferiour Instruments guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Superiour Powers, which, by doing their part in an Evil Work, whether in their own Persons, or in their Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34071:24"/>
become guilty, and so lyable to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. (4.) Observe, That <hi>Achan</hi>'s sin was publickly and solemnly prohibited, and the Punishment threatened fully known to all of his Family, in which, if there were Infants, or Children short of years of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, yet they cannot be said to suffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly, because of that natural contagion of sin drawn from the Loines of their Parents, and because of some actual sins committed. (5.) In Answer, This Punishment, which involved the Posterity of <hi>Achan,</hi> ought not to be lookt upon so properly the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Children, as the Punishment of Parents, because the suffering of Children, (being so near and dear to them) rendered this Dispensation more notable and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary to all <hi>Israel,</hi> and smart and afflictive to <hi>Achan,</hi> which was the intent of it. (6.) God sometimes turns that into a Fatherly Chastisement, which was a Punishment in the Predecessor. Innocent Posterity some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times suffers for Guilty Ancestors, but such Visitations may have kindness in them. (7.) We must beware of questioning God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial <note n="*" place="margin">Judicia Doi occulta sunt nulla injusta.</note> Proceedings, or examining them by our own Measures, of Mans Reason, Laws, or Tribunals.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34071:24"/>
of God to punish Posterity for Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors sins, with Temporal Punishments; let all Parents take heed of shewing Evil Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to their Children, of Swearing, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, Sabbath-breaking, Cheating, Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oppressing, Coveting, least they, by following their steps (as they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) suffer Eternal Judgments. O let all Parents beware, of Breaking their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal-Covenant, and causing their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to break it, thereby undoing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Children to all Eternity, unless Mercy prevent them.</p>

Whereas Riches are the Servants of Good Men, they are the Masters of Wicked Men. The good Man maketh his Riches subordinate to the Glory of God; but the Wicked Man is in servitude, to the Lusts of the Elesh, the lust of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life. Wicked Men (in the sight of God) have not a Sanctified right to these Temporal Things, while they are out of Christ. And altho' they have an Indulgence, from the common Bounty of Divine Providence, to use Temporals and become Rich, yet they want a comfortable Title to them. And
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34071:26"/>
what comfort in the Having, or in Using of these Temporals, without the Grace and Blessing of God? Is it not a Sigh of God's Wrath and Curse upon Mens Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Families, when they suffer the World to Lord it over their Consciences, Time, Education, Office, Reason, Souls and Bodies and all. When the World hath Mens Knees, Prayers, Oaths, Strength, Wit, Parts, Memory, when the Love of the World hath seised on God's Worship, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, Ordinances, and Ministry, Is there not a Curse upon such abused Riches?

            <p n="1">1. That those Persons sin more, who Pray not at all in their Houses, then such as make Prayer. It is better to do that which is Materially Good, then that which is both Materially and Formally Evil. It is better to have a Form of Worship and Religion, then Atheistical Prophaneness. It is better to have Leaves of Profession, then nothing but the Cursed Fruits of a Corrupt Tree. It is more Eligible <hi>(ex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura rei)</hi> to exercise Common Gifts and Operations of the Spirit, and some Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Conscience, than to be Barren of All Gifts, and Dead to all outward Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, Isa. 43. 23. Amos 5. 25. <hi>Thou hast not brought me the small Cattel of thy burnt-offerings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Have ye offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me sacrifiee and offerings,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:34071:29"/>
2. That God is pleased to Reward, with Temporal Blessings, such as Pray, and Humble themselves for their sins, though they be not true Believers, and sincere therein.</p>
            <p>God is pleased to Encourage all sort of sinners to observe and set up Outward Duties of Religion, and they shall fare the Better. It is not without Reward to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form some Formalities of Worship, though done in Hypocrisy, 1 Kings 21. 29. <hi>Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me,</hi> &amp;c. Here is a Great Temporal Mercy given to <hi>Ahab</hi> during his Life <hi>[I will not bring the evil in his days.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider, That none be hardened in their Omission of the Externals of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I say, let them know, That sin is in the Person, before it Infect the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; In the Subject, before it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Action. Therefore let the blame be laid where it ought, not upon Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the Duties thereof, but upon the Professor and his bad Life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Seeing the condition of Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and Wicked Men, is so contagious, that it pollutes all their Outward Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions, let them make hast to get
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34071:29"/>
out, by the use of all means of God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order to their Conversion: As by Prayer, Hearing the Word, Reading the Word, Reading Good Books, and, by Good Company, as before-mentioned. For although the Prayers of the Wicked and Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate be unpleasing to God, yea, an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, yet it is their Duty to Pray, that they may be turned from their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ways, that so their Persons and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, may find acceptance through Christ.</p>
            <p>O let all sorts of Prayer-less Families Pray, that they may Pray in Faith, and that they may become sincere, and down-right Christians. If you have any Bowels of Compassion for your own Souls, and the Souls of your Children, get out of the Cursed Condition of Wicked Men. Who would lead a Wicked Life, if he were sensible of his Misery, and the Curse of God upon the House of the Wicked?</p>

            <p>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. In respect of themselves. Sin consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it self, as it is a Privation of Holiness and Righteousness, is finite not Infinite, because that Holiness and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was at the first Created, was Finite suitable to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And Punishment considered in it self <hi>[Intensive]</hi> is Finite; But if Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be considered <hi>[Extensive]</hi> it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; that is to say, Punishment for its <hi>Entity</hi> (or its <hi>Being)</hi> is Finite: And for its Duration in that <hi>Being,</hi> It is Infinite; Or, thus in short, Sin is of Infinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in Hell, and Its Punishment is Answerable. Were the life of sinful <note place="margin">Aequm est ut ille, qui nunquam desinit esse Maelum nunquam desinat esse Miser.</note> Men prolonged for ever upon Earth, they would sin for ever; The guilt and filth of sin descends into Hell with the Impenitent, and the Damned are ever Living and ever Sining, therefore it is Just, that their Punishment run Paralel with their sining.</p>

2. In respect of Duration, sin and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be considered, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect they both are Infinite, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, emnity and contrariety of sin to God's purity and goodness remaineth for ever, and the punishment is inflicted for ever. Gods word hath placed Rewards and Punishments one against another, <hi>Mat. 25. Last, And these shall go into everlasting Punishment, but the Righteous into Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The wages of Sin is Death, but the Gift of God is Eternal Life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> As <hi>Rewards</hi> are Eternal, so <hi>Punishments</hi> are Eternal, As Life is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, so Death is Eternal. By the Rule of Contraries these Illustrate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sin and Punishment are considered in respect of the Object, or against whom sin is committed, <hi>i. e.</hi> against the Majesty of Heaven and Earth, the supreme Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, of Infinite Justice and Holiness. Sin in this respect may be said to be Infinite, being the Transgression of the Law of an Infinite Majesty. For more full Answer to this Question.</p>

1. Observe, That although Mans Time of sinning be but short compared to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of suffering, yet this doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the Nature of sin, being <hi>[Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal]</hi> to it, for the sin of Apostate Angels, presently after the Commission, was in it self, <hi>(abstractively</hi> taken, for that Malicious defection and deformity from the chief Good) as hateful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God, as it was afterwards and farther on. In like manner, the sin of our first Parents, deserved Eternal Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment, the very first Day, as well as in future time. The Reason hereof is this, We ought in this matter enquire into the Moral Evil, Internal principles, and roots of sin, the formality of it, emnity, privation, separation, and aversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Mans chief end, the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God himself, the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and Fountain of Happiness.</p>

It is most certain, that the Church cannot flourish, unless the parts and members of it, perform Holy Duties and Offices in their Capacities, both in Church and Family. The want of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in Families, is the Decay of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The difference between a Christian Family and a Church, is that of Parts and Whole, if the parts be wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34071:39"/>
the Constitution of the whole is Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Depraved (more or less) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of the parts.</p>
            <p>Is it likely, That Heads of Families should be truly Devout in the Church, and Exercise no Religion at home? How shall we Judge of the Churches encrease, if not from Parochial Religion in Families? Wickedness of.

Is it likely that Preachers should do any good, when Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents by open Profaneness, pull down what they set up? As if they were resolved to live as they do, let the Minister say what he will. Is it likely that the Ministry should prosper in a Congregation, when most Families will do nothing towards it themselves, by keeping Holy the Lords Day, and serving and worshipping him in the Week Day? Would Masters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies take hold with the Minister, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would enter into Families through Gods Blessing. But O what little is done to help forward the salvation of Souls by Good Parents! They ought to prepare and break up the fallow ground of their Families, they ought to Root out the Weeds of Vice, and pluck up corrupt Principles out of this little spot of ground, that it may be fit to receive the Seed of the word with profit, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 3, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 12.</p>

If thou saist, thou art of the Body: I demand then, what is thy Office in the Body?
