            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is like the <hi>Puritan</hi> of old: A word which
hath as many and as bad ſignifications, as
ſpeakers have diverſity of deſigns or intents.
In one mans mouth a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is an <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi>
Proteſtant of the ſobereſt ſort, who is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

many years, who offered the ſaid <hi>Epiſcopal
Form,</hi> which A. Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> proved to be the
true Government of the ancient Churches.
And ſo we have made <hi>Epiſcopal Presbyterians,

In anothers mouth a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is one

is preſcribed in the Word of God,

Among all theſe, when you ſpeak with a
Railing Ruffian, he muſt tell you which he
means himſelf: But when we meet with a
Divine that underſtandeth the common uſe of
the Word, we muſt take him to uſe it in the

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. 1. They take a Miniſtry to be ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary to the propagating of the Goſpel &amp;
the ſaving of Souls, <hi>Rom. 10. 14, 15. Act. 20. 17,
18,</hi> &amp;c. 2. They ſuppoſe that this Miniſtry doth
not ſave men, as Wizards think that Charms
do heal men, by their <hi>Preſence, Titles, Names,</hi>
or <hi>Habits;</hi> By <hi>ſtanding</hi> in the Reading-place,
or Pulpit, or being called the Parſon of the
Pariſh, or ſaying his ſet words over them
when they are dead: But by ſuch <hi>publick</hi> and
<hi>perſonal, frequent, plain, ſerious Inſtructions,</hi> as
are ſuited to their <hi>ignorance ſecurity, preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hardheartedneſs,</hi> and <hi>love to ſin;</hi> and
ſuch as in other caſes would be thought fit to
change mens minds and lives. 3. They ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that when a well, commended Speech
hath been ſaid to ignorant impenitent people,
one day in a week, without any perſonal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
conference to ſet it home, and make
it more intelligible, the moſt make but little
more of it, than if it had been ſaid to them in
an unknown Tongue, or at leaſt remain ſtill ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and impenitent. Yea, if Forms of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſms
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59462:6"/>
themſelves be taught them, it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
with them year after year to ſay the
Forms, and never underſtand the matter ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.
4. They ſuppoſe that a greater number
of the conformable Prieſts, than they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to mention, do Preach ſo ignorantly and
dully in the Pulpits, and do ſo little of this
perſonal or private work beſides, as that there
is great need of a far greater number of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
than all the preſent <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> be.
5. They find that ſome places, of many years
paſt, have had no Miniſters at all. 6. They
are not able to confute the people in too many
places, who tell them that their publick Prieſts
are ſo defective in their neceſſary qualifications
for their Office, as that they hold it unlawful
to own ſuch for true Miniſters, and to
encourage them by their preſence, or commit
the care of their Souls to ſuch. 7. They think
that ſome other places have godly, able Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
Miniſters, whom the Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
love and honor. 8. They think that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
bounds of Churches, are of humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Conſtitution, and not of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
or unchangeable. 9. They think
that a Pariſh, <hi>quatenus</hi> a Pariſh, is not a <hi>Church;</hi>
nor a Pariſhioner, <hi>as ſuch</hi> a Church-member;
for <hi>Infidels, Papiſts, Hereticks, Schiſmaticks</hi> and
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> may be Pariſhioners. 10. They
think that the Magiſtrate hath the power of
the <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Tythes,</hi> and <hi>publick Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59462:6"/>
and <hi>Liberty,</hi> but that he hath not the
<hi>power</hi> of <hi>Ordination</hi> or <hi>Degradation;</hi> but a man
may be a true Miniſter without his conſent,
and ſo I think all Chriſtians hold. 11. They
think that ſome of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> were
true Paſtors of their ſeveral Flocks, before
they were ſilenced and caſt out. 12. They
think that the ejecting them from the <hi>Temples</hi>
and <hi>Tythes</hi> did not degrade them, nor make
them no true Paſtors to their Flocks. 13. They
think that the Magiſtrates putting another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Miniſter in poſſeſſion of the Temple and
Tythes, did not diſſolve the foreſaid relation
of the former. 14. They think yet that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
requireth Miniſter and People to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to ſuch a Diſſolution of their Relations,
where they cannot hold it without greater
hurt than benefit: Yea, and to conſent that
the impoſed Miniſter be their Paſtor, when he
is fit himſelf, and the Worſhip performed by
him fit for them to joyn in. 15. But where
both are fit, they know no reaſon but they may
take both the <hi>Ejected</hi> and the <hi>Impoſed</hi> Perſon
conjunctly for their Paſtors, each being to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
to the ſame Church, according to their
various Liberties &amp; Capacities. 16. They greatly
difference between <hi>London</hi> &amp; ſuch like populous
Cities, &amp; Country Pariſhes, becauſe the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Churches, the greatneſs of Pariſhes,
and the paucity of Miniſters in <hi>London</hi> is ſuch,
that the tenth perſon in ſeveral Pariſhes cannot
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59462:7"/>
come to Church if they would. 17. In ſuch
places therefore they purpoſe to hold their
Meetings at the time of the Pariſh meeting,
becauſe it will be no hindrance to it. 18. So
they do alſo in thoſe Pariſhes where the Pariſh
Prieſt is unfit to be owned in that Relation.
19. Where there is a faithful Paſtor in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Church whom yet half the people cannot
hear, they will not draw the people from
him, nor diſparage him to hinder the ſucceſs
of his labors, but rather perſwade them to
honor him, hear him, and obey his Doctrine;
and to judge of the Tolerated Miniſter but as
of his fellow ſervant, of the ſame Religion,
helping in the ſame Work, where all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are too little. 20. Where the Pariſh
Miniſter is faithful, and the Pariſh ſmall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and neer enough to Aſſemble in one
place, and the people ſatisfied with the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,</hi>
I ſuppoſe the ſobereſt of the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi>
(for they are not all of a mind) will
gather no Church out of that Pariſh,
but will joyn with that Pariſh Church and
Miniſter (ſuppoſing them united by conſent)
and will uſe their own Miniſterial Aſſiſtance,
at ſuch other times, and place, and manner, as
ſhall beſt tend to keep up Love and Concord,
and to further and not hinder the ſucceſſes of
the publick Miniſter. 21. I hope no man
worthy the name of a Miniſter, will dream
that <hi>England</hi> ſhould have no more Teachers,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59462:7"/>
than there are (or are like to be) <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts:</hi>
Or will think it his duty to hinder the
Labors of any ſober Proteſtant Miniſters: Nay,
I hope they will all underſtand, that it was
never more their Duty nor their Intereſt to
cheriſh all brotherly Love and Concord with
ſuch; and woe be to that man who ever he
be, whether a <hi>Selfiſh envious Conformist,</hi> or a
<hi>Schiſmatical factious Nonconformiſt,</hi> that after
all ſuch ſins and ſad experience of the fruits,
ſhall yet hinder the <hi>Concord</hi> of <hi>Proteſtant Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
I had almoſt ſaid, or that doth not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
and diligently promote it. 22. He that
had rather ten thouſand perſons ſtay'd idlely
at home, or went to Sports or Drinking, in
<hi>Stepney</hi> pariſh, or <hi>Giles</hi> Cripplegate, or <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi>
or <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields, or <hi>Giles</hi> in the
Fields, or <hi>Clement Danes,</hi> &amp;c. than a <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt</hi>
ſhould preach to them, I will not
ſoul my paper by calling him as he deſerveth,
though he pretend that gathering a Church
out of a Church, is a thing that he oppoſeth.</p>
               <p>23. In all theſe Caſes following, the <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi>
will hold diſtinct Church-Aſſemblies
from the Pariſh Churches. 1. Where the
Pariſh Church is not capable of them, as was
laſt inſtanced, by reaſon of the number.
2. When the Pariſh Prieſt is one to whom
wiſe men may not commit the care of their
Souls, and one whoſe Miniſtry is not to be
owned, (I would there were none ſuch.)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59462:8"/>
3. When the Ejected Miniſter <hi>in foro conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae
&amp; Eccleſiae verè ſic dictae,</hi> retaineth ſtill
his Ancient Relation to his Flock, and part of
them Schiſmatically ſeparate from him, and
joyn with an intruder publickly, that never
had a lawful Call, and the other half ſeparate
not from their ancient Paſtor. Its poſſible the
obtruder, though he have the Temple, may be
the Schiſmatick. Ask Dr. <hi>Wild,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
whether they thought not ſo 14. years
ago. 4. It may be ſome that are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyant
than my ſelf with good peoples weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and humours, when there is none of
the foreſaid Reaſons, may rather chooſe to be
Paſtors to honeſt <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptists,</hi>
than by deſerting them to leave them to do worſe.
And what great matter of injury or provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould this ſeem to any peaceable man?
Envy is too odious a thing for any Servant of
Chriſt to own. Is it in the power of <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi>
to bring all their judgments to yours.
And till they can, muſt they be quite caſt off.
Who knoweth not how many Ages the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
were tolerated by the wiſeſt and godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Emperors and Biſhops; yea, what black
characters are given by pious Hiſtorians, of
<hi>Ithacius,</hi> and his fellow Biſhops, who firſt in
<hi>France</hi> did ſet the Sword awork even againſt
<hi>Hereſies,</hi> and of <hi>Cyril</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who firſt
as a Biſhop uſed it himſelf. 5. But that's not all:
What if any number of perſons as good as you,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59462:8"/>
ſhall think that the <hi>Liturgie</hi> is guilty of all
the <hi>Diſorders</hi> and <hi>Defects</hi> which once were
charged on it, and of ſome Doctrinal Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſince: And what if they think that the
Pariſh Churches are void of Chriſts true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
and are under an Alien, one which
they judge unlawful. What if they ſay that
yet your Churches may be true Churches, and
all this may be ſubmitted to, when we can have
and do no better; but he that can ſerve God
in a manner more agreeable to his Word, is
bound to do it; and not to offer God the
worſt, when the King alloweth us to do our
beſt. And if withall they ſay, that you refuſe
them and they refuſe not you: You will not
give them the Lords Supper, unleſs they take
it kneeling (which I think they may do, but
they think otherwiſe) you will not Baptize
their Children without the tranſient Image
of the Croſs as a dedicating ſign, &amp;c. If in this
caſe they chooſe a diſtinct Church-Aſſembly
and Paſtor, and Mode of Worſhip; what harm
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s this to you or any one, and why ſhould it
break Love and Peace? 24. But in this laſt
Caſe I ſuppoſe the moſt of the Nonconformiſts
that live in Country Pariſhes which have good
Miniſters of their own, will not call themſelves
a diſtinct Church (totally) but will hold
their meetings as <hi>Chappel-Meetings</hi> are held;
Preaching the Word and Communicating in
the Sacraments in the beſt way they can among
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59462:9"/>
themſelves; but ſo as not to unchurch the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Church as none, or to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from their Communion; but will keep
all loving correſpondence with them, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
ſometimes Communicate with them,
to ſhew their principles by their practice. For
the benefit of Chriſtian <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> may
make it beſt for certain ſeaſons to joyn even
in defective Modes of Worſhip, as Chriſt did in
the <hi>Synagogues</hi> &amp; Temple in his time. Though
the leaſt defective muſt be choſen when no ſuch
accidental reaſons ſway the other way. And
perhaps ſome <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> own Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be as defective as the <hi>Liturgie.</hi>
25. Where the people are ſatisfied with the
Pariſh-Church Communion, I ſuppoſe the
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> will only help to inſtruct them
at ſeaſonable times, and not meddle with
the Sacramental Adminiſtrations. 26. The
ſame practice may be done on various Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
and many <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> may gather
Churches in the forenamed Caſes, without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Separatiſts,</hi> or forſaking any of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
principles. Their differences will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in theſe reſpects. 1. They will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
any of your Pariſh Churches <hi>Null,</hi>
which have lawful Miniſters. 2. They will
not ſay that your Worſhip is ſuch as no man
may lawfully Communicate in. 3. They
ſtill hold that Pariſh-bounds are very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
(though not abſolutely neceſſary) to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59462:9"/>
Church-bounds: not taking every Pariſhione
to be of the Church, but none (ordinarily) but
Pariſhioners to be of the Church. 4. They
are driven from the Pariſh-Miniſtry againſt
their wills, and had far rather hold their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ſtations. 5. They will thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to them when ever they have leave; And
earneſtly pray that theſe ſeemings and ſhews of
ſeparation may ceaſe, the occaſion of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken away. 6. They prefer their own
manner of worſhipping God, as better than the
Liturgy in their opinion, and therefore to be
choſen when they may chooſe; but they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it not the only acceptable Worſhip, but
are preſent with you in ſpirit, deſiring a part in
the prayers of all true Chriſtians in the world.
7. They ſet not up the Church-Government
of the People over the Paſtors, or themſelves, nor
any of the reſt of the Separatiſts proper princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Church-Government. 8. Laſtly, they
deſire nothing more than as Neighbour-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in love and concord to carry on with you
the ſame work of Chriſt. And in all theſe
they differ from Separatiſts, though they gather
Churches.</p>
               <p>26. The grand Difficulty to the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
in their preſent condition, lieth but in
this one caſe, <hi>Whether in competent Pariſhes,
which have able and godly Conformable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
the obligation to hold Union and Communion
with the Pariſh Church, or the obligation to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59462:10"/>
a more regular way of Church-Diſcipline
and Worſhip than the Pariſh Churches do or will
do, ſhould be judged the more prevalent;</hi> And
conſequently whether they ſhould gather
Churches out of Churches in this caſe. For in
the other forementioned caſes the anſwer is more
eaſie. I ſhall give my own opinion as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
1. It is lawful and a duty to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſuch a Pariſh-Church, when we can have
and do no better. 2. We cannot have or do
better, when it cannot be without a greater
hurt to the Publick Intereſt of the Goſpel, the
Church, and the Souls of other men, than the
benefit to us and others is like to countervail.
That cannot be done lawfully which cannot be
done without doing more hurt than good, and
deſtroying the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> We muſt do that which God bids us,
and leave it to him what ſhall be the ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> True. But you muſt <hi>prove</hi> then that
God bids you do it; for we will not take your
word. A<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>matives bind not to all times: No
duty is at all times a duty; Nay, out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it is a ſin. He that ſaith, <hi>Pray continually,</hi>
would not have you pray when you ſhould
preach or hear, or be quenching a Fire in the
Town: He that commanded <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> ſet ſome
to learn the meaning of theſe words <hi>[I will have
mercy, and not ſacrifice.]</hi> There is few of you
but would forbear a Sermon or Prayer to ſave
your own or others Lives: And you receive the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59462:10"/>
Sacrament but once a moneth (at moſt) which
the <hi>Primitive</hi> Churches uſed every Lords
Day. 3. The ſame practice than in one
place (where it will do more good than hurt)
is a duty, which in another place (where it
will do more hurt than good) is a ſin. 4. The
Caſe is now of ſo great moment that no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
ſhould raſhly determine it for himſelf, nor
upon the deſires of ſome of the people only, but
ſhould conſult with wiſe and ſober men that
are impartial. 5. The <hi>benefits</hi> to be expected
and compared, are theſe, 1. The pleaſing of
God (when we know it is his will) and the
profit of mens Souls, by the moſt regular
manner of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Worſhip.</hi> 2. The
ſetting up an imitable example of right <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
and <hi>Worſhip</hi> to other Churches (but then
woe to them that ſet up a worſe.) 3. The
ſatisfying the Conſciences of ſome honeſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking
people, who think (erroneouſly)
that a Conforming Miniſter may not be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
with, or at leaſt not in the uſe of
the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> or in a Pariſh Church, or that
the Sacrament may not be received kneeling.
6. The evils to be feared, and compared with
the benefits, are theſe. 1. The exaſperating
of the minds of perſons for number or quality
conſiderable, and ſo alienating them from their
brethren, and hindring their good. 2. And
thereby weakening the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> intereſt, in
a time which requireth our greateſt Concord.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59462:11"/>
3. And the ſetting of parties againſt parties, and
Churches againſt Churches, and turning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
into contentions and mutual oppoſitions.
4. And the countenancing of unlawful ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which will all ſhelter themſelves under
ſuch examples; and the dividers will not
ſee the different principles on which we go,
while our practice ſeemeth to be the ſame.
5. And ſo it may be injurious to future Ages,
by ſeeming to give them preſidents for unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſeparations. 6. And it is not the leaſt
evil conſequent, that we ſhall cheriſh not only
the Error of thoſe that think worſe of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Worſhip
&amp; Aſſemblies than there is cauſe;
but we ſhall alſo accidentally nouriſh their
pride, who will think themſelves a holier peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
becauſe they Erroniouſly over-cenſure the
perſons and practices of others. 7. The prime
great obligation for the cure of all this, doth
Ile upon ſome of the conforming ſide; It were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
for them, not to ſilence Chriſts Miniſters that
are as wiſe and good as themſelves. It were eaſie
for them, not to puniſh a godly perſon ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
as an Excommunication comes to, for the
weakneſs of ſcrupling a Sacrament-geſture;
and not to puniſh their Children with being
unchriſtened, or themſelves with Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
who think the dedicating Image of the
Croſs unlawful, or think it their own duty to
enter their own Children into the Covenant
of God, rather than Godfathers that have no
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59462:11"/>
propriety in them, and they are ſure never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to take them for their own, or uſe them
as they covenant to do. 8. If on ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
true godly Chriſtians are caſt out of
their Pariſh-Churches, whether they err or
not, all Miniſters are neither obliged, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to deſert them, and ſo to add cruelty
and affliction to the afflicted. 9. They
that think they anſwer all by ſaying that theſe
peoples ſcruples are but Errours, do but
1. Shew their ſelf-eſteem, who can call that
Errour which they have ſaid ſo little to prove
to be ſo (in ſome of their inſtances.) 2. And
he talketh neither like a <hi>Paſtor</hi> nor a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
nor a <hi>Man,</hi> that thinketh all that err ſhould
be caſt out of the Church. 10. To diſcern
whether in this caſe a diſtinct Church is to be
gathered or not, is a work of meer Chriſtian
prudence and muſt be determined by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the good and evil conſequences together,
and diſcerning truly which preponderateth.
And he that through Imprudence miſjudgeth
either way, doth ſinne. 11. Therefore
it is folly, and ſin for Miniſters (Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
or Nonconformable) to expect that in
this, all ſhould go the ſame way, and to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thoſe that differ from their Opinion,
when they may be under different circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
12. They that live in <hi>London,</hi> where
it hath ever been uſual to go to Neighbour Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Churches
from their own, and where
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59462:12"/>
cuſtome, and abundance of accidents make
the inconveniencies leſs, have not ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their different Church-meetings, as
thoſe in Countrey Towns and Pariſhes have,
13. Thoſe that live where the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi>
are the main body of the people, and the reſt
are ſuch for number and quality, whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
is of leſs publick conſequence, have
the leſs againſt their diſtinct Church-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
14. Thoſe who live where the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts</hi>
are few, and the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> for
number and quality moſt conſiderable, and
are like to be greatly exaſperated by diſtinct
Churches, muſt deny their own perſonal
conveniencies, rather than hinder a greater
good, and may not do that which others may
do. 15. When the publick good forbids it, the
tolerated Miniſters muſt not gather diſtinct
Church-Aſſemblies, but joyn with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Churches, and help the people by their
inſtructions at other times. 16. When the
publick good forbids it not, the tolerated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
muſt hold diſtinct Aſſemblies, for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> as near
as they can to the will of God. But ſo as to
further, and not diſgrace nor hinder, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Pariſh-Miniſters; living with them in
Unity, Love, and Peace: and whether <hi>de nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>
their Aſſemblies ſhall be called <hi>diſtinct
Churches,</hi> is a caſe of no great moment,
though I think that it is fitteſt to take them for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59462:12"/>
                  <hi>diſtinct Churches, ſecundum quid,</hi> and not <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter,</hi>
as many Chappels be: Seeing though
in the Aſſemblies they diſtinctly worſhip
God, &amp;c. yet they hold perſonal Communion
in a godly converſation with the reſt of the
Chriſtians in the Pariſh, and ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alſo aſſemble with them. And ſo much
for my own opinion in this caſe.</p>
               <p>27. If Chriſtians would but give over the
cenſoriouſneſs, contentions, and abuſe of
others, which different Aſſemblies in the ſame
Town are uſually employed in, I ſee not
what great hurt it would do any, for <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
Separatiſts, &amp;c.</hi> that cannot joyn
with the Pariſh-Churches, to have leave to
meet among themſelves, and worſhip God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in peace.</p>
               <p>28. As the weakneſs of the people incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
them to cauſeleſs ſeparations and disjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo the doleful Pride and Selfiſhneſs of the
carnal part of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> hath in moſt Ages
made them too impatient with the peoples
weakneſs; and make ſuch a noiſe and ſtir in
the World, if a few do but withdraw from
their Communion, as if all that diſowned
them, diſowned Chriſt. And all, becauſe Pride
would make every man a God to the World,
on whom all muſt depend, whom all muſt
honour and obey, and no man muſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict;
and all that depart from them, are
ſuppoſed to accuſe and undervalue them. And
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59462:13"/>
thus as of our own ſelves, ſome men ariſe to
draw Diſciples after them, ſo others ſet the
Churches in a flame, for fear of loſing any
of their Diſciples or eſteem; and between
both, how ſadly and for how many Ages,
have the people of Chriſt been torn in pieces.
What harm doth it me or any other (if my
Pride will let me be quiet) if men that differ
from me in ſome Points of Judgment, do quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Worſhip God, by themſelves. But it is ſo
rare for Separated Aſſemblies, not to make it
their Religion and work, to make others odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and factiouſly to draw Diſciples and aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates
to themſelves, that they muſt alſo thank
themſelves, that others are ſo impatient with
them; ſo certain it is that all ſides are too
blame.</p>
               <p>29. The right Dioceſan holdeth that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
is eſſential to a Church, and conſequently
that we have no more Churches than <hi>Dioceſſes,</hi>
and that Pariſh-Churches are properly no
Churches, but Chappels, or <hi>Parts</hi> of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan-Church:
And if ſo, 1. Then he that
ſeparateth from a Pariſh-Church, ſeparateth
from no Church (though we think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.)
2. And as he that went to any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
in the Dioceſs, kept ſtill in his own
Church, ſo a tolerated Church may be as good,
a Church, as ſuch a Pariſh, and it ſhould not
be made a hainous matter for any to go to it,
by them that allow men to go from Pariſh to
Pariſh.</p>

And that it is no leſs than, 1. Horrid
Sacriledge; 2. Perfidious Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
3. Diſobedience to God; 4. Cruelty

&amp;c.</hi> As if the Miniſters of Chriſt did
know no difference between <hi>noiſe</hi> and <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
Yea, we are told <hi>of Schiſm from the Church of

in my purſe, to make me underſtand what
the <hi>Church of England</hi> is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59462:20"/>
1. I know that the King is the Civil-Head
or Governour of it. But it is a <hi>Conſtitutive
Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Head that muſt denominate it,
as an eſſential part.</p>
               <p>2. I take it for granted he ſpeaks of <hi>a Church</hi>
organized in a proper political ſenſe, as conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
of a <hi>Pars regens,</hi> and a <hi>Pars ſubdita;</hi>
and not as an ungoverned Community.</p>
               <p>3. I take it for granted that we have two
Archbiſhops, and they tell me, that one is not
under the Government of the other. And if
that be true, we may have a Church of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and a Church of <hi>York,</hi> but no one Church
of <hi>England</hi> as denominated from one of them
as Head.</p>
               <p>4. I take it for granted that the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not the Conſtitutive-Head, 1. Becauſe
it is ſo ſeldom in being, that then we ſhould
ſeldom have a Church of <hi>England:</hi> For the
Eſſence ceaſeth with the eſſential part. 2. And
the Canon thundreth againſt them that deny
the Convocation to be the Repreſentative-Church
of <hi>England.</hi> If it mean of the whole
Church, Paſtors and People, then the People
rule, and make Canons by them (as the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts
hold:) And it is the Head of the Church
only that we enquire after. If they mean the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> then the Repreſentative-Church or
Head muſt be ſomewhat diſtinct from the
Real repreſented. If it be the whole Clergy
that is the Real Repreſented-Church or Head,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59462:20"/>
then we are Popular, or Presbyterian; for the
Presbyters are the major part by far. And
what Rulers are they that never rule the
Church as one, by themſelves, but only by
Repreſentatives. I confeſs eaſily that many
Churches united under one King, and living
in one Kingdom, and having thereby ſpecial
opportunity for Synods, and Correſpondence
and Concord, may be called <hi>one Church,</hi> by
a denomination, 1. accidental, 2. and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
not uſed in Scripture; And we will not
be ſo quarrelſome as to avoid that language
where men will needs uſe it: But it is the
<hi>Thing,</hi> and not the <hi>Name,</hi> that we enquire
of: <hi>What is that One Eſſential Conſtitutive-Head
which maketh the Churches of</hi> England
<hi>to be all one Church, in a proper political ſenſe,</hi>
that is, <hi>as a Governed-Society?</hi> None queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Civil-Head;</hi> none queſtion the need of
<hi>Communion and Agreement</hi> among all theſe
Churches. But the Queſtion is only of the
<hi>one Eccleſiaſtick Conſtitutive Head.</hi> And if
you will have the Queſtion to be <hi>de nomine,</hi>
pardon us for holding that <hi>forma denominat.</hi>
But if you will <hi>denominate</hi> many Churches
<hi>[One]</hi> from <hi>One Accident,</hi> inſtead of <hi>One In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Form</hi> or <hi>Eſſence;</hi> and if you will uſe
terms in Divine Matters, which God never ſo
uſed in his Word, we contend not againſt you,
but only deſire to underſtand you, when you
charge us <hi>with Schiſm from the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59462:21"/>
We have obſerved what hath been the
effect of ſuch another enterprize in the Roman
Empire: It was thought meet by Princes that
where the Empire was One, the Church
ſhould be in ſome ſort <hi>One</hi> alſo, which was
under them. Whereupon <hi>Rome</hi> had the chief
Patriarchate. But in time, 1. this <hi>Humane</hi>-Unity
(name and thing) is pretended to be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;</hi>
2. And this <hi>One Imperial Church</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one Emperour) is taken to be <hi>One Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church;</hi> as if the <hi>Indians, Perſians,</hi>
and all other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (even the <hi>Abaſſian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire)
had been part of it, and the <hi>Orbis Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi>
had been <hi>Orbis Univerſalis.</hi> 3. And
then no man is a Chriſtian that is not baptized
into this Papal Church, and made a Subject
of the Pope. Tell us what you mean by our
<hi>Schiſm from the Church of England?</hi> We di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
not our ſelves from the King or Kingdom,
or from the particular Churches as concordant
in any neceſſary thing. If it be only that we
agree not with the Major Vote in all <hi>Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Oaths, Diſcipline</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> No
more did the Biſhops in the Roman Empire,
who had various Liturgies; nor <hi>Gildas</hi> with
the <hi>Britains,</hi> nor <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Martin</hi> with
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops; nor the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal
party in <hi>Scotland</hi> heretofore with the
Presbyterians, when they were the major part.
Is every difference in things unneceſſary from
the major part, <hi>a Schiſm from them?</hi> The
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59462:21"/>
Biſhops thought not ſo in <hi>England</hi> fifteen
years ago: We do not go ſo far with you, as
<hi>Gildas</hi> with his Britiſh Clergy, who pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him <hi>non eximium Chriſtianum,</hi> no <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Chriſtian,</hi> that called them <hi>Prieſts</hi> or
<hi>Ministers,</hi> and not rather <hi>Proditores, Traitors,</hi>
as he himſelf did. Nor do we make ſuch a
Schiſm as <hi>Martin</hi> ſeemed to do, who renounced
Communion with the Biſhops and their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
(all his life) who had proſecuted the
<hi>Priſcilianiſts</hi> with the Secular Sword. Yet
neither of theſe holy men are called <hi>Separatiſts</hi>
or <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But perhaps it is our <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to the
<hi>Church</hi> that is our <hi>Schiſm</hi> from it. 1. But
every one that maketh himſelf an Eccleſiaſtical
Governour over other Paſtors and Churches,
is not therefore their rightful Lord. The King
we know, and his Officers we know, but we
know not all that call themſelves our Lords
or Maſters. Not but that obedience is the
eaſieſt courſe of life, to a quiet humble mind:
But fidelity to our King commandeth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning
of <hi>Uſurpers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. We confeſs that we do not actually
obey the Civil unqueſtionable Power in every
particle about Gods Worſhip which hath
been commanded us; I need not tell you
why. No more did the Chriſtians for three
hundred years after Chriſt; nor the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Biſhops in the dayes of <hi>Constantius,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59462:22"/>
Valens, &amp;c.</hi> nor the Proteſtants now in
<hi>France,</hi> nor the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> now in <hi>Sweden,
Denmark Saxonie;</hi> nor the <hi>Lutherans</hi> under
<hi>Calviniſt</hi> Governours, &amp;c. We compare not
our Rulers to any of theſe, in any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
but only as <hi>Rulers;</hi> but if you your
ſelves are reſolved to <hi>ſay and ſubſcribe,</hi> and
<hi>ſwear,</hi> and <hi>do</hi> whatever lawful Rulers bid you,
its poſſible that before you dye, you may
ſhew that indeed you are not of our minds.</p>
               <p>3. But who ever took every act of <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
in a Circumſtance, in a <hi>Family</hi> or
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> to be a <hi>Schiſm</hi> from that <hi>Family</hi> or
<hi>Kingdom?</hi> Do you rule by ſuch a Law of <hi>Works</hi>
or <hi>Innocency,</hi> which cuts off men for every diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and <hi>cenſureth him that</hi> obeyeth not
perfectly in all things?</p>
               <p>4. And methinks this ſhould not be your
meaning, becauſe by Nonconformity, we more
diſobeyed our Rulers before their <hi>Toleration,</hi>
than <hi>ſince;</hi> and yet it is our preaching <hi>after</hi>
that you call our Schiſm from the Church.
You ſee what trouble you put men to, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
you, becauſe you ſpeak unintelligib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and confuſedly.</p>
               <p>If you tell me that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> owned
a <hi>National Church</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. So do I, as before deſcribed, that is, as
denominated, 1 From an <hi>accident,</hi> and not
from an <hi>Individuating Form,</hi> and therefore
<hi>equivocally</hi> and <hi>improperly,</hi> 2 And <hi>humanely,</hi>
and ſo <hi>unneceſſarily,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59462:22"/>
2. And if <hi>Scots</hi> or any <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do it
otherwiſe, that's nothing to me, who am no
more bound to their Opinion than yours. And
ſure the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not called <hi>One</hi>
in the <hi>Presbyterian ſence,</hi> as an Ariſtrocracie,
or as <hi>Headed</hi> by the <hi>whole Clergie</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct.</p>

               <p>2. As they held it lawful to hold Lay-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Pariſh-Churches that have true
Miniſters, ſo do we.</p>
               <p>3. They never ſaid, it was unlawful to hold

no more will we. What Law tyeth us
to be ſuch <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> as to renounce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

Communion with none but his own party, but

ſeaſonably with all true Chriſtian

the <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> and <hi>Separatist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Do you not hold it lawful for a Miniſter
to remove from one Pariſh to another; and
for any man for his ſouls edification, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
his dwelling into another Pariſh where
is a better Miniſter? And what if forty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
do ſo? who calleth any of this Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

Had this been Separation and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> or not? If

is it <hi>Schiſm</hi> to joyn with <hi>ſuch men in other

to dreſs them, and feed them, and that all
other perſons help is needleſs. Get them to
faſt all till you ſeed them your ſelves, and
make them believe they need no other meat.
We that have conferred with all the people of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59462:32"/>
our Pariſhes when we were permitted, found
that multitudes were almoſt as ignorant as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:</hi>
And yet our excellent ſucceſſours, that
do no ſuch thing (as to any <hi>two of them</hi> that
ever I knew or heard of) but ſee their faces in
the Church, can prove all our Teaching <hi>needleſs</hi>
to theſe poor ignorant ſouls: Is this humility,
and Miniſterial fidelity? Its <hi>ſin</hi> in us to preach,
and <hi>duty</hi> to the <hi>Conformiſts:</hi> I am glad they
take it yet for a duty to <hi>any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But is it not as eaſie for us to ſay, That
you have <hi>needleſly,</hi> and <hi>ſinfully,</hi> and <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly</hi>
taken our places, (I mean as to the
Church-Relation, &amp; not as to the Temples and
Tythes,) and drawn <hi>ſome</hi> of the people to
<hi>ſeparation</hi> from thoſe that were <hi>before true
Churches?</hi> We ſay not ſo; but put not your
ſelves on the hard task of diſproving it, if you
are wiſe.</p>
               <p>4. But our neceſſity <hi>Sir,</hi> hath viſible Cauſes.</p>
               <p>1. God and our own conſent at our Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
made our <hi>neceſſity</hi> of exerciſing our
Miniſtry; We are not aſhamed of the Goſpel
of Chriſt, nor that it was our <hi>choice:</hi> But God
hath laid <hi>this neceſſity on us, and wo be unto us
if we preach not the Goſpel, as we have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Biſhops to ſome of us, and <hi>ſenior</hi>
Paſtors to others, by Miniſterial <hi>Inveſtiture im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
this</hi> neceſſity on us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59462:32"/>
3. The great neceſſity of multitudes of fouls
(which nothing but <hi>groſs ignorance de facto,
Infidelity,</hi> or <hi>Impudency</hi> can deny) concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to cauſe this neceſſity.</p>
               <p>4. The Law impoſeth a neceſſity on us,
not to preach among you in the Temples: If
then God ſay, <hi>Preach,</hi> and the Law ſay,
<hi>Preach not in the Temples,</hi> we may conclude
we <hi>muſt preach out of the Temples;</hi> if we have
but as much wit as King <hi>James</hi>'s Hounds had,
that at a double way, if they find the Hare
hath not gone one way, will take it for
granted he is gone the other. Here is then but
two makers of our <hi>neceſſity,</hi> the <hi>Impoſer</hi> and the

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59462:34"/>
Name the men that offered us a comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the men that refuſed it? If you tell
us that <hi>you,</hi> or ſuch another offered it to one
of your neighbours, you may poſſibly make
your words ridiculouſly true: But if you
mean that either the King or Parliament of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it, tell us when, and and who were the
refuſers. If you mean any Parliament Speeches,
it is not fit for us to talk about them. But
you will not I ſuppoſe preſume to ſay that the
Parliament ever offered either Toleration or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
comprehenſion (that is, to take in
<hi>Nonconformiſts;)</hi> much leſs both.</p>
               <p>There was a Rumor of one <hi>Mans Speech,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> as if it had ſounded like a
refuſal of ſome abatement, but if you will
talk with him as I have done, he will ſoon
ſhew you the falſhood of that Rumor.</p>
               <p>If you could have proved that any <hi>ſecret
perſon</hi> ever refuſed ſuch an offer, can you
thence ſay to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> that <hi>they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you mean an offer that by a great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

it your ſelf.</p>
               <p>1. That it was not refuſed, but very
thankfully accepted.</p>
               <p>2. That for the <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>other men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

1. That it was their deſire that all <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Diſſenters</hi> might be tolerated.</p>
               <p>2. That it was His Majeſties work and not
theirs.</p>
               <p>3. That therefore thoſe that were to be <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,</hi>
were accordingly to be ſpoken to of
the Terms, for we were capable of treating of
the Caſe and Terms of none but our ſelves.
And after this the endeavour for our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
went on to our content, till the
Parliament ſate, and preſently ſhut the door
againſt it.</p>
               <p>I know of no other offer but this, which
thoſe few that dealt in it well know was far
from being refuſed; ſo that a greater ſlander
could ſcarce have been laid on men that have
ſtil ſo greatly deſired A COMPREHENSION
OF ALL SOBER PROTESTANTS IN
THE PUBLICK MINISTRY, and A TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LERATION

becauſe we would not provoke you
more than needs.</p>
               <p>2. As far as I can promiſe, we will judge
of you no worſe than we have done, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
any Communion with you which we have
uſed, and can uſe without neglecting our own
work. As I conſtantly joyn in my Pariſh-Church
in Liturgy and Sacraments, ſo I hope
to do while I live (if I live under as honeſt
a Miniſter,) at due times. But what if I had
leave without Conformity to preach in the
next Pariſh-Church? I cannot then be in
yours at the ſame time. He that preacheth
not, may hear you conſtantly: But he that
may preach himſelf, muſt not ceaſe his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
to be ſtill one of your Flock. We long
ago publiſhed our Judgments, that <hi>It is a ſin
not to joyn with a leſs-worthy Miniſter, and a
leſs-orderly Mode of Worſhip, when we can have
no better; And that it is a ſin to tye our ſelves
ordinarily to ſuch when we may have better law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi>
that is <hi>(conſideratis conſiderandis) upon
terms whereon it will not do more hurt than good.</hi>
You ſee then on what terms we may vary our
practices, without the crimes recited by you.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59462:41"/>
If now when we are preaching our ſelves, you
will ſay that we are <hi>departing from you,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we cannot be in two places at once), and
then come on with all theſe Calumnies, we take
but this to be your meaning;</p>
               <p>1. To tell us that you think we ſo value
the honour of our Names and Reputations with
you, as that you can make us falſe to our
Callings, rather than be cenſured by you.</p>
               <p>2. That you have alwayes a Quiver full
of ſuch Arrows provided, and reſolve, that if
we will not give over our Miniſtry, and be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by you, you will make as many as you
can believe, that we never had <hi>ſenſe of Duty,
love of Peace</hi> or <hi>Unity,</hi> or <hi>any good end,</hi> but <hi>meer
ſlaviſh fear.</hi> So men, it's like, would ſay of
Chriſt, when ſometimes he preached openly,
and ſometimes departed from mens fury into
the Wilderneſs or obſcure places; Or of <hi>Paul</hi>
that was let down by the Wall in a basket,
and when he departed from the Jews Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
which he had before frequented; or
thoſe that fled from one City to another. It is
a duty to preach when I <hi>can,</hi> and no duty
when I <hi>cannot:</hi> And if others make the <hi>[can]</hi>
and the <hi>[cannot,]</hi> is it <hi>I</hi> or <hi>they</hi> that change
my practice? But if you teach men ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
cauſleſs Cenſures and Reproaches, you
may have <hi>many</hi> Diſciples, but not very <hi>good
ones.</hi> And ſome will thus paraphraſe your

words, <hi>[If the King will not let us perſecute
them for preaching, we are reſolved we will
ſlander them, and make men believe (on how
hard terms ſoever they ſerve Christ) that they
do it all but as cowardly ſelf-ſeeking Knaves.]</hi>

it all ſignifieth but what you have

            <p>BRethren, you hear by this Author that
the Conformiſts are greatly afraid of
<hi>Popery,</hi> and that the danger by ſome will he
ſaid to be from you: but who ever taketh you
for the Papiſts friends, the Papiſts themſelves
will never ſo eſteem you. You ſee that ſome
Comformiſts are deſirous of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>concord</hi>
with you, for the common end, the Churches
ſtrength againſt all adverſaries. God forbid
that you ſhould not be as forward to love
and peace as they. I have theſe following
counſels to give you before I go out of the
World, expecting to have you ere long in a
condition, which will require more <hi>wiſdom,
holineſs,</hi> and <hi>fortitude,</hi> than I fear the moſt are
yet poſſeſſed of.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Reſolve by the grace of God, againſt all
temptations,</hi> and <hi>through all difficulties, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to ply your Miniſterial work</hi> You ſee how
much Satan is againſt it, and how he tryeth
every way to hinder it: ſometimes by force
and fears, ſometimes by <hi>flatteries,</hi> ſometimes
as that old Prophet ſeduced the other, by
coming as in Chriſts name, as an Angel of
Light, and by Miniſters of Righteouſneſs.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59462:44"/>
He maketh not light of your Miniſtry, elſe he
would not do ſo much againſt it; O do not
you make light of it. Our Ordination,
Vow and Covenant is Holy! If <hi>Ananias</hi> and
<hi>Sapphira</hi> dyed for alienating conſecrated <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
by a lye, what ſhall we expect, if we alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
conſecrated perſons by a lye: Souls are
precious, ſin is ſtrong, Satan is ſubtile, the
World is deceitful, the fleſh is unreaſonable,
deceivers have great advantage, time is ſhort;
O therefore work while it is day, for the
night cometh when none can work; Our own
floath and ſin is the moſt dangerous ſilence.
How many ſouls feed or famiſh, live or die, as
we do our duty, or neglect it? Can you ſpare
your fleſh or labour, when you think what
impenitent ſouls muſt feel for ever; and what
the Sanctified ſhall enjoy? Would you not
ſhine your ſelves as Stars in the Firmament?
Would you not be found by Chriſt <hi>ſo doing?</hi>
Would you not convert Sinners from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of their way, when it is the ſaving of a
ſoul from death, and covering a multitude of
ſins? What ever Word of God deceivers may
abuſe to ſtop your mouths, be ſure that <hi>holy
Covenants</hi> muſt be kept; that <hi>Sacrilege</hi> is a
ſin; that <hi>nature</hi> it ſelf tells you, no man hath
power to nullifie your Obligation to <hi>Charity
it ſelf</hi> in the work of mens Salvation; that
the love of God dwelleth not in you, if you
ſee your Brother have need, and ſhut up the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59462:44"/>
bowels of your compaſſion from him: Men
may regulate your charity for good, but not
deſtroy it. If the poor were famiſhing about
you, no Law can diſoblige you from reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. Be ſure that <hi>neceſſity is laid</hi> on all
the Miniſters of Chriſt (though not by the
ſame <hi>way</hi> as it was laid on the Apoſtles;) and
woe be unto them if they preach not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
Fear none of thoſe things that you ſhall

Crown: You ſhall judge the world that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you: It will be joyful to hear, <hi>Theſe are
they that came out of great Tribulation,</hi> &amp;c.
Even Dr. <hi>Th. Jackſon</hi> notably concludeth,
that the reaſon why Martyrdom among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
now, is rarer than among Unbelievers
heretofore, and that more ſuffer not, as <hi>John
Baptiſt</hi> did of <hi>Herod,</hi> is not becauſe Great
ones among Chriſtians are not ready to do as
<hi>Herod</hi> did, but becauſe Miniſters more omit
their duty; The deareſt duty is the moſt gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>2. I beſeech you, <hi>Study harder that you may
now ſo preach,</hi> as that <hi>you may convince men
practically,</hi> that <hi>you are really uſeful &amp; needful
to the World, and that your ſilence is a real loſs.</hi>
They that now take your labours to be <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
are tempted to it by the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of too
many. They can ſcarce find in their hearts to
ſay ſo of any Eminent judicious Men; If
when you have ſo long made the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59462:45"/>
that <hi>ſilencing</hi> you is a moſt <hi>heynous ſin,</hi>
you ſhal now preach ſo <hi>rawly,</hi> ſo <hi>incongruouſly</hi>
ſo <hi>injudiciouſly, &amp; unskilfully,</hi> or <hi>coldly,</hi> as to
confute your ſelves, &amp; harden thoſe that were
for your ſilence, how great will your ſhame
be? If you will be thought more uſeful than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
think you, preach <hi>better</hi> now than others
do. I really fear, leſt <hi>meer Non-conformity</hi>
have brought ſome into reputation as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious,</hi>
who by <hi>weak preaching</hi> will loſe the
reputation of being <hi>judicious,</hi> more than their
ſilence loſt it. What now will you <hi>do better</hi>
and <hi>more</hi> than others to prove that the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cannot ſpare you? I expect not great
<hi>Judgement</hi> &amp; <hi>Learning</hi> in all the <hi>younger</hi> ſort,
nor thoſe that in theſe times have bin kept
from ſtudy, by labouring to get their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
Bread: but verily the <hi>injudiciouſneſs</hi> of
too many among you, is for a lamentation.
But the grand calamity is, that <hi>the moſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
are uſually the moſt confident and ſelf-conceited;
and none ſo commonly give way to
their ignorant zeal, to cenſure; back bite, and
reproach others, as thoſe that know not what they
talk of.</hi> I impute not this to you as Non-Conformiſts,
but as ſons of <hi>Adam:</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath convinced me, that PRIDE
OF UNDERSTANDING, when
men have little to be proud of, or <hi>confidence</hi>
of all mens own apprehenſions, is the vice of
Men, Women and Children, when they are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59462:45"/>
paſt eighteen years of age, which ſeemeth to
be moſt deſperately uncurable. Few ſorts
ſo ſilly, but are always in the right, and others
erroneous in compariſon of them: as Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams
pitty the ignorance of their Keepers;
So that I fear not the prevalency of <hi>ſcepticiſm</hi>
in the world (though I fear <hi>infidelity:) Self-conceitedneſs,</hi>
I warrant you will keep it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Such ancient as <hi>Ephrem Syrus, Macarius,
Martin,</hi> &amp;c. who were of little Learning but
holy and humble, and preſumed not above
their knowledge, were honoured in the
Churches: but when the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Holy
Monks would ſhew their humble pride and
ignorance, by tumults and zealous madneſs,
to ſeek the blood of the Biſhops, that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not that God had Hands and Feet like
Men, and to deſtroy thoſe as ungodly that
were not as fooliſh as themſelves, what could
have bin more ſcandalous againſt the honour
of Godlineſs and Chriſtianity?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Over value not your own Preaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
under value not other mans, becauſe they are
Conformiſts.</hi> The <hi>number</hi> and <hi>neceſſities</hi> of the
<hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>ungodly</hi> indeed do make your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
neceſſary, were you leſs fit than many
of the Conformiſts: but that proveth you
not <hi>more able,</hi> or your preaching better than
theirs. Partiality may make ſome of your
own mind, think all well that you ſay, and
all weak that others ſay: but the reſt of men
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59462:46"/>
will the more deſpiſe you. Be not wiſe in
your own conceit; Look not every man at
his own gifts and worth, but at the gifts and
worth of others: In honor prefer one another:
Pride is the firſt born of the Devil: and <hi>pride</hi>
of <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> is more common
and pernicious, than pride of <hi>Comelyneſs,
Wealth,</hi> or <hi>Greatneſs.</hi> Mark that Preacher
Conformable or Non-conformable, who <hi>ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
hardeſt</hi> for his <hi>own honour,</hi> and would
raiſe it by <hi>diſhonouring others,</hi> and is moſt <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient</hi>
of all that <hi>clowdeth</hi> him, and is onely
for thoſe that ſet <hi>him up;</hi> and look out no
further for a mark of <hi>badneſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> but take that
man for one of the <hi>worſt,</hi> how well ſoever he
<hi>preach</hi> or <hi>pray.</hi> Except Chriſts Apoſtles had
bin converted to the <hi>teachable humble</hi> ſtate of
little Children, they could not have entered
into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 3.
You wear not the Livery of Chriſt, if you
are not humble, and apter to think meanly of
your own gifts and doings, proportionably,
than of other mens. How unſavoury is it to
hear a Non-conformiſt come from a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sermon of a Conformiſt, ſaying (to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the peoples benefit,) <hi>This is poor dry ſtuff,</hi>
and carping at every incongruous word; as
much as to ſay, <hi>I can do much better:</hi> Through
Gods Mercy, <hi>ſome</hi> Conformiſts preach bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than many of you can do.</p>
            <p>

4. <hi>Yet difference between Conformable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi>
and <hi>own not the Miniſtry of any that
are utterly incompetent</hi> and <hi>intolerable;</hi> Hear
them not ordinarily: for though I ſay not
that all their Miniſtrations are nullities, yet
I ſay that you ſhould not encourage an <hi>intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
undertaker,</hi> to deſtroy himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
By <hi>into crable</hi> men, I mean,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such as are <hi>ignorant</hi> of, <hi>or erroneous</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the eſſentials of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such as are utterly <hi>unable</hi> to <hi>teach</hi>
them <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such as malignantly Preach down
the practice of a holy life. Or in a word,
thoſe whoſe Miniſtry is ſuch, as really tendeth
to do more hurt than good; from ſuch turn
away. Yea, <hi>where</hi> the <hi>Conformable Miniſter
may be tolerable, in caſe no better could be had,
yet if indeed his teaching be ſo trifling,</hi> and <hi>ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
as <hi>is like to do but little good, let compaſſion
move you, to take more liberty your ſelves to
teach the people there, than under worthyer
Men.</hi> Too many ſuch young raw triflers,
I confeſs I have heard my ſelf: and I would
not have <hi>order</hi> or <hi>humility</hi> pretended, to turn
<hi>Preaching</hi> into a <hi>Ceremony,</hi> leſt all Religion
be next taken but for a Ceremony. It is a
ſerious work, and muſt be ſeriouſly done.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>If you live where</hi> the <hi>Conformable Pariſh
Miniſter is faithful (truly endeavouring the
ſalvation of his Flock)</hi> I <hi>charge you in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59462:47"/>
name of Chriſt Do not onely,</hi> if <hi>poſſible, as much
as in you lyeth, live in love, familiarity and
peace with him, but alſo do all that you can to
maintain his honour,</hi> and <hi>promote his work.</hi> Be
not Strangers to him: Diſtance breedeth
uncharitable thoughts. If you hear or ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that you diſlike, go privately and
lovingly, and tell him of it: If any behind
his back diſhonour him, rebuke them. If he
look for ſome ſuperiority over you, and ſome
obſervance from you, deny it not: It is a
duty to ſubmit to one another. You can tell
a <hi>Prelate,</hi> that he that will be the greateſt,
muſt be the Servant of all: Practice as you
preach. He that ſcorns to ſtoope is proud,
as well as he that would have Men ſtoope to
him. Live with him as a <hi>Brother</hi> and as a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
in meekneſs, humility, and gentleneſs
of behaviour: And do not like our young
paſſionate Perſons, trample upon him, as if his
Conformity had put him, as a ſinner, below
you as more Holy than he, and under the
Magiſtery of your Reproofe. You and I
think that he hath ſinned: But he thinks
that it is we that ſin: And he that is without
ſin, let him caſt the firſt ſtone. I charge
you <hi>Love him,</hi> as your ſelves, and behind his
back ſay nothing, and do nothing, but what
is fit to teſtifie ſuch love. Let all men thus
know that you are Chriſts Diſciples; For all
your Nonconformity, you are no <hi>better
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59462:47"/>
than he,</hi> if you be not more <hi>Charitable</hi> than
he. If you ſet your ſelves in a dividing way,
ſecretly to rejoice at his Diſparagement, and
to draw as many from him as you can; you
are but <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> of the Church of God:
Call your ſelves what you will, I will call you
<hi>Deſtroyers</hi> if you are <hi>Dividers.</hi> Yea much that
elſe would be your <hi>Duty,</hi> muſt be omitted to
avoid Diviſion. The <hi>work of God,</hi> the <hi>good
of Souls,</hi> the Defence of the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
agai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> require your moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
ſtrength. And you are be rayers of all
theſe, if you are <hi>Dividers.</hi> Suppoſe your ſelves
as Chappel Curats under the Pariſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and ſo in concord perform your work.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Therefore go as oft as you can to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi>
and <hi>hold Communion perſonally with
him, and lead the people with you.</hi> Do not ſay,
Now we have opportunity to <hi>do better,</hi> it is
<hi>unlawful to joyn with them that do worſe:</hi> For
thoug it be not lawful for you to neglect
your own Duty and opportunity, it is lawful
for you by <hi>Deed</hi> as well as <hi>Word,</hi> to ſhew
your <hi>Chriſtian Concord</hi> and <hi>Communion:</hi> and
ſo to <hi>do,</hi> may make it at that time much better
which elſe in regard of the manner would be
worſe. Otherwiſe if one Preacher, pray and
preach <hi>better</hi> than all the reſt, all the people
ſhould be bound to forſake their Miniſters &amp;
go to him as one that doth <hi>better.</hi> But <hi>bonum
eſt ex cauſis integris: Diſjunction</hi> and <hi>ill effects,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59462:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your <hi>better mode</hi> of Worſhip <hi>worſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>Therefore in Pariſhes where all may well
hear the Pariſh Miniſter, I would not have you,
without neceſſity, preach at the ſame hour as he
doth, but at ſome middle time;</hi> that you may
not ſeem to vie with him for Auditors, nor to
draw the people from him; But let them go
with you to hear him, and after come and
hear you (or before;) But in <hi>London</hi> and
great Pariſhes where <hi>all cannot come</hi> to the
Pariſh Church, as alſo in Pariſhes where the
Miniſter is <hi>not to be owned,</hi> I perſwade you to
no ſuch obſervation: It is ſo inconvenient to
the people there, to be caſt upon unmeet
hours, that I perſwade you not to do it.</p>
            <p>8. Where the Pariſh Miniſter is to be heard
by you and your hearers, I think it beſt to preach
ther but once a day, and at ſome neighbour place
that hath moſt need, the other part. <hi>My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the people cannot hear and
digeſt four Sermons a day, nor three well:
and thoſe that hear you twice, will not go
to the Pariſh Church; and ſo you will but
draw them away, from that which might
profit them as well as yours. And it is <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well</hi> that more affecteth people, then
Preaching <hi>long</hi> or <hi>often.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe, alas, you will hardly
live, where ſome Neighbour Pariſh hath not
ſo bad a Miniſter, as that the people have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59462:48"/>
more need of help; and the reſt of your
pains may be beſtowed on Week-day Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
as the people have leiſure.</p>
            <p>9. Therefore I greatly deſire, that in ſuch
places you would beſtow the greater half of
your labour in private, in skilful exhorting
people from houſe to houſe? If you did not
ſo before you were ſilenced, repent betime;
If you did, you have found the benefit of it.
This is it, which few Conformiſts do, and in
this you may beſt live as their true Aſſiſtants.
Publick hearing without perſonal conference,
ſeldom bringeth men to underſtand well
what you ſay. Brethren, let me ask you, as
before God: Why hath no more of this bin
done while you were ſilenced? Is it not too
much Hypocriſie, to cry out againſt them
that forbid us Preaching, which is one half
of our duty, and in the mean time wilfully to
neglect that part which none forbad us? I
ſpeak not of them that were driven from all
Cities and Corporations where their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
enabled them, and forced to live
where they had no ſuch opportunity; nor of
them that through poverty had not time.
But moſt men might have done more this
way than was done; This way the Papiſts
have done their work. And it is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
that moſt that come to your <hi>Chappel
Meetings,</hi> are ſuch as you take for the leaſt
needy, as being already turned unto God
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59462:49"/>
But from houſe to houſe you may ſpeak with
the more ignorant: for ſome of them its like
will hear you. And ſincerity inclineth men
to that way of duty that hath leaſt oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Preach Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> the
<hi>common Catechiſm principles,</hi> (which are of
greateſt need and uſe, and require the greateſt
skill in Preachers,) <hi>and do not on pretence of
going higher, trouble the peoples heads with
unneceſſary things,</hi> nor turn them after vain
janglings: much leſs againſt Conformity, or
any thing that reflecteth upon the Pariſh
Miniſters. You may quickly kindle in your
Religious Hearers, a factious opinionative
kind of zeal, that ſhall make them fire-brands
in the Church, and no whi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> tend to ſave
their ſouls. And you may deceive your ſelves
by exerciſing ſuch an opinionative zeal, while
you think you are doing the work of Chriſt.
O how happy had the Churches bin, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of all the Schoolmens &amp; old contenders
curioſities of the Trinity, and all the blind
diſputes of Predeſtination and Free-will, and
all the buſle about Epiſcopacie, Presbytery,
Independency, Anabaptiſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the
Churches had heard the Baptiſmal Covenant
it ſelf, with the Creed, Lords Prayer, and
D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alogue well opened, and mens hearts
had bin more fired with the love of God in
Chriſt, rather than their heads heated with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59462:49"/>
ſuch controverſies, as the poor people cannot
manage, but only by unskilful Teachers, are
tempted by them to be diſturbers of the
Church.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>If there be any among your people, that by
ſuch a ſinful unpeaceable zeal, will be cenſuring
&amp; deriding Conformiſts, Independents, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi>
or any <hi>honeſt tolerable diſſenters,</hi> and <hi>will
be reproaching them behind their backs, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
them <hi>odious to the Hearers, rebuke them
ſharply,</hi> and cheriſh not their ſin; And if
they hear not, rebuke them before all, and if
they amend not, caſt them out of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
and as you love your ſelves, the
Church and others, let not the proudeſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerious
people be your Maſters: Take heed
of that baſe complying humour, that maketh

and irregular ways.</p>

too many well meaning honeſt people. Woe
to the ſelfiſh Teachers, that for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
intereſt, dare not contradict them, but
cheriſh them into their dividing errours;
when their eyes are opened, and they ſee their
miſtakes, they will be tempted to ſhew their
own diſlike of them, by running as far on the
extreame of formality; In a word, help to ſave
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59462:52"/>
Religious people from being <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi>
while they cry out againſt ſuperſtition; and
make them know that a Religion which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in our own <hi>modes</hi> and <hi>ways</hi> of worſhip,
and in decrying other mens, may ſtand with
all unmortified ſin; and that the <hi>fleſh</hi> is no
more denyed by <hi>ſitting,</hi> than by <hi>kneeling,</hi> and
that to ſay I am Godly becauſe my geſtures,
and orders are more Scriptural than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,
is a pittiful way for an Hypocrite
to cheat his ſoul: and make them know that
few things have hardened men againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and made Non-Conformiſts a ſcorn
inſtead of being helpers of mens ſouls, ſo
much as to ſee that many place their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in ſuperſtitions of their own, <hi>Touch not,
taſt not, handle not;</hi> and make it piety to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
that as ſin, which is no ſin: and then
men judge of all the reſt by this.</p>
            <p>13. And I will preſume to tell you my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
as of a matter, not abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but at this time, of ſuch <hi>convenience,</hi> as if
I were to keep a Church Meeting, I would
reſolve upon it, as my duty: and that is, that
<hi>your own practice now ſhew a ſound</hi> and <hi>healing
judgement about</hi> that <hi>Church troubling Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie</hi>
of <hi>Praying freely,</hi> or by <hi>Forms; even</hi>
that <hi>now you would ſeaſonably do both.</hi> The
contention about this hath bin childiſh, and
yet a fire not yet quenched in the Church:
while one belyeth God, as if he had forbidden
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59462:52"/>
all FREE Prayer in the Church; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
belye him as if he had forbidden all
Forms or <hi>Book</hi>-prayer: when God hath left
both free, to be done as edification moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.
His underſtanding is low that
thinketh either of them ſimply unlawful;
and he knoweth little in ſuch matters, that
knoweth not, <hi>that both ways have many</hi> and
<hi>great conveniences,</hi> and <hi>both have many</hi> and
<hi>great accidental inconveniences,</hi> (which having
enumerated elſe where I muſt not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat.)
And they that are all for the one only,
or the other only, ſhall have all the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
with the benefits: but he that will
<hi>ſeaſonably uſe both,</hi> ſhall have the benefits of
<hi>both,</hi> and the leaſt part of the inconveniences
of either; Therefore in the Churches of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
free prayers</hi> were allowed in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
after the Liturgy.</p>
            <p>And pardon me for ſaying, that when this
petty controverſie hath ſo much diſtracted us,
thoſe Miniſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that uſe but one way onely,
ſeem ſcandalouſly to the people to be onely
for that way, and ſo do harden them in their
errour, and keep the fire burning in the
Church. He that prayeth only by Book or
Form, perſwadeth the poor people that <hi>free
prayer</hi> is <hi>Fanatical, uncertain</hi> and unlawful:
and they that <hi>never</hi> pray <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> perſwade
the poor people, that all Forms or Book-prayers
are unlawful; if a whole party agree
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59462:53"/>
in forbearing all Forms at ſuch a time as this,
when ſo many take them for unlawful. And
ſo they corrupt mens very Religion, and
teach them to make <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>ſins</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
which God never made, and thereby
ſet them in a way of Hypocriſie, Self-delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and endleſs quarreling with others.</p>
            <p>I preſcribe to no man; and toleration ſo
far taketh off publick Impoſitions, as that
none can now ſay, <hi>This Form is impoſed on me,</hi>
and <hi>therefore unlawful.</hi> But (though I will
not bind my ſelf) I here tell the world, <hi>That
if my ſtrength</hi> and <hi>toleration,</hi> and <hi>a call ſhould
ever more give me opportunity for the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of mine Office, I would ſometimes pray free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without Forms,</hi> and <hi>ſometimes uſe ſome part
of the common Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>ſometimes uſe the
Reformed Liturgy, which in 1660. was agreed
on by the Commiſſioned Non-Conformiſts,</hi>
(though being done in extream haſt, it ſhould
be reviewed and perfected:) <hi>I would ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
pronounce the Creed, (as the Faith which
the Church Aſſembleth in</hi> the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of,)
and <hi>ordinarily recite the Lords Prayer and
Decalogue, and read two Chapters and the
Pſalms:</hi> And they that would not joyn in
this way of Worſhip, ſhould freely go chooſe
them a Teacher more agreeable to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
for I would not ſerve the humours of
any in their dividing errours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59462:53"/>
And Brethren, endure me to tell you,</p>
            <p>1. That pleaſing the ignorant profeſſors
humours, is a ſin that ſheweth us too hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and carnal, and hath always ſad effects
at laſt.</p>
            <p>2. And that I confeſs to you I think <hi>your
day is ſhort;</hi> and that it is now of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
what the <hi>future effects of your courſe
will be to poſterity,</hi> or thoſe to come, than how
it will take with your preſent followers. And
when the Hiſtory of this Age is written, do
that now which you would have there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.
My chief meaning is, <hi>This will be a
controverſie when we are dead and gone: Do that
now, which being recorded may beſt tend to the
right deciſion of it then. Leave to Poſterity
now you have liberty, that example</hi> (as well as
words) <hi>which thou would have them follow.</hi>
Tempt not future Contenders to plead that
all Forms are unlawful by your examples.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, <hi>We ſhall thus looſe our people, and
the Separatiſts, who will cheriſh all ſuch humours,
will have them all:</hi> I anſwer, We have too
long tryed the pleaſing way already, and ſee
that we cure not, but cheriſh their diſeaſe.
Take Gods way, and let us deny our ſelves,
as well with the humourous people as we have
done with the Conformiſts, and then leave
the iſſue to God. And if they will follow
Separatiſts, it is fitter that they be miſlead by
ſuch erroneous perſons, than by you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:59462:54"/>
14. And on this occaſion let me ſay a
word to this kind of Religious people: Is it
not a ſhame to you that your worthieſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
ſhould be fain to go beſides their own
judgement in Gods Worſhip to humour <hi>you?</hi>
And that they muſt tell the world, We would
mix <hi>Free-prayer</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> in publick, but
the people then will be gone to the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts.
I ſay not that they go againſt their
<hi>Conſciences;</hi> For their conſciences have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
them to omit what elſe would have bin
fitteſt, leſt croſſing your humour, it ſhould
drive you away to your own ſubverſion:
But how came you to be ſo much <hi>holyer</hi> and
<hi>wiſer</hi> than the Holyeſt and wiſeſt of your
Teachers? Mark, is it not more of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Apprentices that are of this mind,
than of the old experienced Chriſtians. Is
it not a high degree of Pride for perſons of
your <hi>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> to conclude
that allmoſt all Chriſts Churches in the
World for theſe <hi>thirteen hundred years at leaſt
to this day,</hi> have offered ſuch worſhip unto
God, as that you are obliged to avoid it,
and all their Communion in it; And that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the Catholick Church on earth,
this day, is below your Communion for
uſing Forms? And that even <hi>Calvin</hi> and the
Presbyterians, <hi>Cartwright, Hilderſham,</hi> and
the old Non-conformiſts, were unworthy of
your Communion: Would you have run away
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59462:54"/>
from <hi>Dod</hi> or <hi>Perkins,</hi> or from <hi>Cyprian</hi> or
<hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and ſaid, They are <hi>formal Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi>
not to be joyned with? Doth God uſe
by Miracle to make ſelf-conceited Women
and young Men, ſo much wiſer than the moſt
ancient ſtudious experienced Divines. It is
beſt then to turn Preachers before we grow
old, and to avoid <hi>ſtudy</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> leſt it
make us more ignorant than we were.</p>
            <p>Brethren and Friends, I profeſs for your
ſincerity many of you are our joy, and it is
not a little that we have done and ſuffered for
your ſakes; But I muſt tell you (for Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
will t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll if you) that for your <hi>ignorance,
injudiciouſneſs, pride, ſelf-conceitedneſs,</hi> you
are our <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>ſhame.</hi> We are hit in the
teeth with ſuch <hi>ſelf-wiſe ignorant giddy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable</hi>
followers, And we have nothing to
ſay, but to bluſh, and ſay that you <hi>mean
well,</hi> and that it <hi>is not long of us.</hi> Can Gods
Spirit which ordaineth <hi>Elders</hi> to be Paſtors
in his Church, be the Guide of your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
when with ſuch ſhameleſs pride you
ſet up your errours againſt the knowledge of
your Guides? If <hi>you</hi> are <hi>wiſeſt</hi> be <hi>you</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,</hi>
(which ſome are prone enough to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate.)
It ſhameth us, it grieveth us, to
ſee and hear from <hi>England,</hi> and from <hi>New-England</hi>
this common cry. <hi>We are endangered
by Diviſions, principally becauſe the ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59462:55"/>
part of the Religious people, will not be
ruled by their Paſtors, but muſt have their way,
and will needs</hi> be <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Church and
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, I tell you with truth and grief, I am
confident (next to mens own ſin, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
them to a judicial deluſion,) <hi>nothing hath
done more to ſet up Popery,</hi> and the <hi>Prelacy you
diſlike, than the ſcandalous inſtances of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs
and Church tearing humours:</hi> And
that you have made more Papiſts, than ever
you or we are like to recover. Nothing is
any whit conſiderable that a Papiſt hath to
ſay, till he cometh to your caſe and ſaith, <hi>Doth
not experience tell you, that without Papal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and force, theſe people will never be ruled or
united?</hi> It is <hi>you</hi> that tempt them to uſe fire
and Fagot, that will not be <hi>Ruled</hi> nor kept
in concord, by the wiſeſt, and holyeſt and
moſt ſelf-denying Miniſters on Earth. Even
<hi>Ainſworth</hi> the Learnedeſt and Godlyeſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
of the Separatiſts, though he went with
them beyond Sea, and was of their opinion,
and carded wooll to maintain himſelf while
he was their Teacher, yet could not keep that
one ſeparated Church in peace. And muſt
you, even you that ſhould be our comfort,
become our ſhame, and break our hearts, and
make men Papiſts by your temptation. Woe
to the World, becauſe of offences, and woe
to ſome by whom they come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:59462:55"/>
I thank God, I ſpeak not my own caſe; I
think thoſe many Religious people that I
have had the overſight of, are as ready to be
ruled by me, and as undivided, as any that
ever I have known? But alas, in too many
places it is otherwiſe: Should the Miniſters in
<hi>London,</hi> that have ſuffered ſo long, but uſe
any part of the Liturgy and Scripture Forms,
though without any motive, but the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God, &amp; the Churches good, what mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and cenſuring would there be againſt
them? And woe to thoſe few Teachers that
make up their deſigns by cheriſhing theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.
One would think that their warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had bin fair. But—<hi>ſi nati ſint ad bis
perdendam Angliam</hi>—The Lord have
mercy on us!</p>
            <p>15. Seeing <hi>places</hi> and <hi>numbers</hi> and other
Church-circumſtances are matters left to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<hi>prudence,</hi> be <hi>ſure that you prudentially
diſcern the diveſity of duties, according to the
diverſity of places and occaſions.</hi> Theſe things
I here include.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That you be not of thoſe Church-tearers
opinion, who muſt have all go juſt one
way, in all thoſe undetermined variable
things; And will cenſure all, and take them
for dividers, that do not as they do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Edification</hi> or the <hi>Publick
good</hi> is the <hi>end, rule</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> of theſe <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential</hi>
actions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59462:56"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That in looking to this rule and
end, you muſt not look only to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Congregation or the preſent Age, but
to all the Churches abroad, and to poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That nothing here ſhould be
raſhly done, but by great adviſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That therefore other Brethren, (as
well diſſenting as conſenting Miniſters)
ſhould for ſafety be conſulted with, not to be
your Governours, but for <hi>Counſel</hi> and for
<hi>Concord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To which end correſpondencies
of Miniſters is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>16. In thoſe places where the <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Church,</hi> and that your <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of
the <hi>Sacraments is like to do more harm than
good, it is your duty to forbear it,</hi> and <hi>only to
Teach.</hi> How to diſcern this, Prudence and
Counſel muſt direct you: If there be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Pariſh Miniſter, and the people are all or
almoſt all ſatisfied (or may be ſatisfied by you)
to communicate with him according to the
liturgy, and if your own adminiſtration would
ſtir up ſo much offence and hurt, as that the
benefit cannot countervail it, the caſe is plain.
But if you live in <hi>London,</hi> or where all <hi>the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cannot come to the Pariſh Church,</hi> or the
<hi>Miniſter is intollerable,</hi> and the <hi>good is like</hi>
(on prudent adviſe) to be apparently <hi>greater
then the hurt,</hi> I know not but you may</p>
            <p>1. Know your flock by name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:59462:56"/>
2. And take it either as a Chappel (in ſome
places) or as a diſtinct Neighbour Church (in
other places.)</p>
            <p>3. Duely Adminiſter the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>4. And ſoberly and wiſely uſe Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>Be ſure</hi> that the <hi>Concord of all</hi> the true
<hi>Proteſtant Non-Conformiſts Churches, be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
upon the ſimple ancient Catholick terms,</hi>
and not upon any ſelf-deviſed Additions:
That is, that all that own the Scripture in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and the Baptiſmal Covenant, the
Creed, Lords Prayer, and Decalogue in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
(as the ſummary of Holy Belief, holy
Deſires, and holy <hi>Practice,)</hi> be taken for fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſtians, till it be proved againſt them
that by <hi>Hereſie</hi> or <hi>wickedneſs</hi> they nullifie this
profeſſion. This is the Rule and Teſt of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
concord. Here all agree: And if after
this one Church will uſe Forms of Prayer, and
another will not, one will Baptize Infants,
and another will delay it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
that muſt be born, where Love and
Reaſon cannot heal them, without breach of
Charity, Concord or Communion; yea in
the ſame Church, ſuch different opinions
may be born, further than as thoſe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from the Paſtors mode of worſhip, will
ſeparate themſelves when none rejecteth them.
We have all naturally a Pope born in us, and
when men have never ſo much talkt againſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59462:57"/>
Popery and Prelacy, too many cenſure or run
away from all that are not of their way.</p>
            <p>If any tell you that ſo wide an enterance
will let into the Church Socinians and other
Hereticks, who will mis-expound the words,
Ask them again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Whether Baptiſing men is not a
taking them into the Church? And whether
the Apoſtles and Churches for many hundred
years, required any more of thoſe that were
Baptized? And whether their buſineſs be to
ſhew themſelves wiſer than the Apoſtles, and
the primitive Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether Hereticks will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to all the Scripture, while they miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it; And whether all the Scripture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be not big enough for a Creed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether all Hereſie be not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of ſome of the aforeſaid Articles
of Faith, and he that ſaith, <hi>I believe this Creed
and all that is contrary to it,</hi> renounce not all
Hereſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whether all Laws be faulty
which men can miſinterpret; And whether
the Law muſt be changed and enlarged as oft
as any break it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whether all the Volumns of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils, be not yet too little by that
rule, the ſence of many being ſtill contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If we muſt have new Creeds and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59462:57"/>
Church Articles as oft as Hereticks miſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the old, whether it be not in the power
of the Devil and Hereticks to make our Faith
ridiculouſly alterable every year, till it grow
intolerably voluminous?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> And who is it that muſt be ſtill
the Creed-makers or menders? And where
will they ſtop? And how ſhall we know when
we have all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Is he a wiſe Paſtor, that readeth
how the Churches have ever ſince the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at <hi>Nice</hi> bin diſtracted with new Creeds,
and yet will take no warning? Read how
<hi>Hilary Pict.</hi> inveigheth againſt them. When
they vexed <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelf with ſuſpicions
of Hereſie about the Trinity, (becauſe he
was not for the term <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> as <hi>a perſon)</hi>
his anſwer was, <hi>They ask me of my Belief</hi> (or
<hi>Faith) as if I had bin New-born</hi> (or <hi>Baptized)
without a Belief:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Is it not
a true and ſufficient Creed or profeſſion of
Faith, which we all make at Baptiſm? Why
elſe are we Baptized?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninethly,</hi> Tell them, that Paſtors indeed
muſt <hi>know more</hi> than all the <hi>people:</hi> but not
by having a <hi>new Creed</hi> or <hi>Scripture,</hi> but at
their <hi>Oraination</hi> they are to give an account
of a <hi>fuller underſtanding</hi> the <hi>ſame Creed</hi> than
the people muſt do: And the <hi>Ordainers</hi> muſt
<hi>examine</hi> them where they ſuſpect them of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:59462:58"/>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Laſtly, Tell them that no more
than this is neceſſary, at the <hi>door;</hi> but if any
<hi>after</hi> prove an Heretick, the accuſer muſt
prove it by him; and what is the uſe of
<hi>Church-Diſcipline,</hi> but to reform him or caſt
him out? And <hi>Laws</hi> will not ſerve alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they ſay that a Heretick may do much
miſchief before it can be proved againſt him,
Tell them.</p>
            <p>1. That it muſt not be <hi>Thoughts</hi> but <hi>Words</hi>
that do miſchief in the Church; And <hi>Words</hi>
are proveable.</p>
            <p>2. That ſuch proud tyrannical overdoers,
have bin the Churches undoers? And it is <hi>they</hi>
that have done as much miſchief as moſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks:
And that they that will be ſo much
wiſer and better than God, as to keep out all
Hereſie by their ſelf-conceited ways, are the
men that let in Hereſie and Impiety, and
keep or caſt out faithful Paſtors, and are the
Officers and Agents of the great Divider and
Deſtroyer of the Churches.</p>
            <p>Let me add, Brethren, we that have lived in
an Age, when the Engines of <hi>Church-Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
have ſo ſadly proſpered, and have ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereby, and born our Teſtimony againſt
them, are doubly obliged to <hi>leave this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of ours to Poſterity</hi> to warn them, that
if poſſible they <hi>may eſcape the ſnare;</hi> And
therefore TO PUBLISH THIS OUR
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59462:58"/>
JUDGEMENT, <hi>and</hi> OUR OWN
CONCORD ON THESE PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITIVE
TERMS to all the World,
as againſt the <hi>Romiſh tyrannical-uncertain-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
Church-dividing,</hi> and <hi>ſtill growing
Articles of Faith;</hi> Remembring that the ſame

Problem.</hi> 15. and 16. proveth out

            <p>18. <hi>Manage</hi> your <hi>Miniſterial converſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi>
and <hi>piouſly.</hi> The converſe of Miniſters
is of great uſe, and therefore frequent Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
needful: Uſe them to theſe ends.</p>
            <p>1. To adviſe and prevent the effects of
raſhneſs or imprudencie in Church affairs:
when every weak man hath the uſe of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of all his ſeniors, it is ſafe.</p>
            <p>2. To preſerve Concord, and prevent back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings,
animoſities and ſactions, and diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
ſcandalous ſingularities.</p>
            <p>3. That young Miniſters may be Learners
as well as Teachers, and may grow up under
the Helpes of their Seniors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:59462:59"/>
I think therefore you may beſt thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
your Converſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> Often meet for faſting and prayer, to
lament our former and later ſin, and to
pray for the Church of Chriſt and for all
men; for the King and all in Authority,
that we may live a quiet and peaceable life,
in all Godlineſs and honeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> Set up conſtant regular Diſputations,
(not about trifles, nor with litigious licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs)
But about the grounds of our
Religion, eſpecially the differences between
us and the Socinians, and Papiſts; And this
with School order, under Moderation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</p>
            <p>1. Too many of us are young and unſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed
in theſe matters, and little fit to deal
with the Philiſtins Goliahs, and have great
need to increaſe in holy defenſive skill.</p>
            <p>2. It will by the bounds of order prevent
all contentions and wranglings, and medling
with Rulers or other mens matters, and all
loſs of time by impertinent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III. Counſel</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> about Church
practice muſt take up the reſt of your time.
And theſe three ſeaſonably uſed <hi>Prayer, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi>
and <hi>Counſel</hi> will conduce much to
your growth and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>But ſee that Miniſterial Meetings turn not
<hi>from Counſel</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> to <hi>Formality</hi> and
<hi>Vſurpation</hi> of a <hi>Ruling power</hi> over one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59462:59"/>
and ſo degenerate not into Synodical
Church-tyranny; much leſs uſurpe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
right: For Synods ill managed
have bin the Fevers and Pleuriſies of the
Churches.</p>
            <p>19. <hi>Therefore be</hi> ſure to keep out, both <hi>the</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
<hi>of</hi> Major Votes, <hi>and of the</hi> proud Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial
ſelf-arrogations of any individuals, <hi>that</hi>
think all others muſt ſtoop to them.</p>
            <p>1. When it is once thought that the Major
<hi>Vote</hi> muſt carry it, an <hi>Ithacian</hi> Synod, will
tyrannize; and every weak ſelf-conceited
man, that hath nothing of ſence to ſay againſt
you will charge nine Learned judicious grave
Divines with <hi>Inſolency,</hi> if they will not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by ten that are <hi>unlearned</hi> or <hi>injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
ſelf-eſteemers. <hi>Voteing</hi> is not for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but for <hi>Concord;</hi> And not to be uſed,
(leſt it ſeem an appearance or introduction of
uſurpation,) except in caſes where meer <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>
is your work.</p>
            <p>2. But nothing hath more plagued the
Church than the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Arrogancy</hi> of ſome
of the Paſtors, that think they are wronged
if they may not Rule. Think not that this
Spirit is only in Papiſts or Dioceſans; Pride
is the heart of the old man, and born in all;
And doleful experience telleth how it ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in too many Antiprelatical Miniſters, of
humbling principles, and unhumbled ſouls.
Do we not know that the Pride of <hi>ſome among
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59462:60"/>
our ſelves,</hi> that muſt <hi>be All,</hi> and <hi>do all,</hi> till
they have <hi>undone all,</hi> is the very thing, that
hath ſilenced ſo many Miniſters, and brought
us to the ſtate that we are now in? There
are ſome men that muſt only be heard in all
debates, and ſeldom hear; who are <hi>angry</hi> if
they be gainſaid; who think that nimble
Tongues, or popular Intereſt, or grey hairs,
muſt paſs for uncontrolled reaſon. And they
ſtudy to make parties, and ſet up their own
Dictates, by paſſion or indirect contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
They can ſeldom debate a cauſe, but
their ſpleen ſwelleth againſt thoſe that ſay
not as they ſay, but contradict them, and they
ſecretly back-bite them to blaſt their names!
They note thoſe that follow them, and thoſe
that oppoſe them, and make two parties of
them. And all cometh from the common
ſin of man-kind, <hi>An unhumbled overconfident
underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe men muſt firſt be meekly deſired to
be quiet, and to let you be quiet, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that Non-conformiſts are not for
ſelf-obtruding Prelacy; And that they are
Brethren and not Lords: If that will not do,
try by Prayer to prevail with God, for more
of <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> in his Miniſters. If that
will not do, ſilently bear their importunity
with neglect: If that do not, Meet without
them:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:59462:60"/>
3. And yet there is as great a miſchief as
any of theſe to be avoided alſo: Which is the
<hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs</hi> and Pride of the younger
and the more injudicious Sort of Miniſters,
hindering them from following the Counſels
of wiſer experienced men. For though we
muſt have no arrogant Lordly Uſurpers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, yet all that know any thing muſt
confeſs, that in all profeſſions <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imious</hi>
men are few: It is but to few Divines
that God giveth clear and accurate judgments;
And undoubtedly there is a three-fold Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
and ſubmiſſion of divine obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
            <p>1. Of Subjects to men in Office over them.</p>
            <p>2. Of the younger to the Elder.</p>
            <p>3. Of them that have leſs knowledge, to
them that have more. For <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Seniori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
are but formalities, did they not ſuppoſe an
eximious <hi>fitneſs</hi> by Superior <hi>knowledge.</hi> If
therefore God endow here and there one
man with extraordinary judgement, it is
the wiſdom and happineſs of the times to
know him, and to kindle their Torches at
his fire: So did one <hi>Luther,</hi> one <hi>Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,</hi>
one <hi>Calvin,</hi> one <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> one <hi>Jewel,
Whitakers, Reignolds, Davenant,</hi> &amp;c. profit
many. You may go a hundred miles amongſt
the leſs judicious ſort, and miſs of that light
which one <hi>Ameſius</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne <hi>Camero,</hi> one <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
one <hi>le Blanch</hi> &amp;c. could ſhew the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59462:61"/>
world. And it is the Plague of corrupted
nature that <hi>Ignorance</hi> keepeth men from <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
it ſelf, and not one of a multitude (even
of Religious men) who are <hi>injudicious</hi> will
believe that they are injudicious; but every
man is ſo much the more confident that he is
in the right and others erre, by how much the
more he erreth himſelf: ſo that few ignorant
Miniſters are teachable, but think that they
are too wiſe to learn, becauſe by office they
undertake to teach: But through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
my own converſe hath bin with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſort of Miniſters, which was the occaſion
of our unity and peace. And <hi>London</hi> and the
Countrey have many ſuch, who I hope will
be able to reſiſt the dividing attempts of the
<hi>ſelf ignorant</hi> and ſelf-conceited.</p>
            <p>20. Laſtly, <hi>Spend this little time as in the
way to ſpeedy ſufferings</hi> and <hi>death:</hi> Your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Winters day is ſhort. Work hard:
Live wiſely: Suppoſe your tryal were the
next year: Behave your ſelves as men that
ſtand in proſpect of the Grave: It is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that God will paſs over twenty years wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
diviſions, wantonneſs, proud contention,
ſelf-diſtraction, ſcandals, and great ſins ſo
little repented of, that men cannot endure
to hear them named, with ſo ſhort or ſmall
a ſuffering as we have undergone. And the
ſame Spirit yet blinding the guilty, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome of the ſeparating party in Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59462:61"/>
and working ſtill by unlawful means
to their unlawful ends, is the fearful Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,
that more of the old effects are to be
produced by the old uncured cauſe. O be
not partakers in the guilt and blindneſs leſt
you partake of the deſtruction, and <hi>dementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be the ſure prognoſtick</hi> of <hi>perdition.</hi> But
O Lord ſpare thy people, and bleſs thine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and let not the weakneſs or will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of the Paſtors or people, deliver it up
as a prey to the Deſtroyer. And though our
folly and ſcandal have made us a ſcorn, let
it not turn to the extirpation of true Religion,
and to the further advantage of <hi>Church-ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Malignity</hi> in the world.
And if we the fooliſh ſinful Paſtors, have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
our honour and ſtation in thy Church,
let not the <hi>Tyrannical Fooliſh</hi> and <hi>Wicked,</hi> but
thoſe that ſhall be <hi>wiſer, holyer</hi> and more
faithfully and ſucceſfully <hi>diligent</hi> ſucceed us.</p>

preſumed to counſel the Non-Conformiſts
as my equals, I will preſume no
higher with you, than to lay my ſelf at your
Feet, and humbly a ſecond time to become
your Petitioner for the ſouls of men, for the
Goſpel, the Church, and the intereſt of Chriſt.
It is your Office to be Petitioners to mankind
for Chriſt, and to beſeech them in his ſtead
to be reconciled to God. And a man might
hope that one that ſhould become a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner

to foreſee what they were bringing to paſs,
and are not, by any ſober man, to be accuſed
of doing either <hi>they knew not what,</hi> or <hi>what they

               <p>
                  <hi>I. O be not too angry with thoſe that cenſure
you as ſinners.</hi> I deteſt raſh cenſoriouſneſs:
But you know men that differ in this world,
about <hi>Speculatives,</hi> may differ about matters
of <hi>Practice too:</hi> The Jeſuiſts, Fryars and Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſts
do ſo, in not a <hi>few</hi> or <hi>little</hi> things.
And in ſuch a difference, one party muſt needs
conſure the practiſers of the contrary, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
If you and I differed about Uſury,
<hi>Stage playes, Gaming,</hi> &amp;c. one party muſt
needs think that the other ſide do live in ſin.
And who liveth and ſinneth not? Either the
cenſure is <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe:</hi> If <hi>true,</hi> ſhould you
not be as thankful as to one that would ſave

               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:59462:63"/>
1. You are <hi>fallible;</hi> and the notice of a
<hi>poſſible pernicious</hi> danger, ſhould be received
with ſelf-ſuſpicion and thanks.</p>
               <p>2. And you ſhould love them the better for
their averſneſs to ſin, though they ſhould mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
the matter of it. A proud heart ſaith
ſwellingly, <hi>Am I to be accounted herein a ſinner?</hi>
A humble perſon will ſay: <hi>Alas, I am too likely
to miſtake and ſin: but if I do not, I will love, even
a miſtaken enemy of ſin.</hi> And to deal faithfully
with you, <hi>Had thoſe honeſt Conformiſts</hi> of my
acquaintance, but come firſt to the ableſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
and impartially heard and weighed all
that they had to ſay, and not ſecretly ſlipt
into Conformity, as if they had bin afraid
of hearing all, I ſhould have bin the more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with their Cenſurers. But God
hateth ſin, and ſo muſt all that truely love
him. And they are our beſt friends that do
moſt to preſerve us from it. And they are
our greateſt enemies, that would flatter us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. To Preach againſt <hi>ſin,</hi> is your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
Office: And if any man thinks that
you make a ſolemn Covenant to ſin, that you
may have leave to preach againſt ſin; Yea,
that you deliberately commit a great one, that
you may have leave to preach againſt a leſs in
other men, this man deſerveth to be heard
though he miſtake. At Death and Judgment,
nothing in the world but <hi>ſin</hi> will be your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
Unjuſt cenſures will be none. If we
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59462:64"/>
ſay nothing to you yet its eaſie to gather by
the coſtly terms on which we avoid it, that
we take conformity for a ſin.</p>
               <p>And if any of the people carry it cenſoriouſly
or contemptuouſly towards you (which we
abhor) remember that you take them for <hi>weak</hi>
and <hi>pieviſh</hi> perſons: And honour or contempt
is valuable according to the quality of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourer
or contemner: You take your follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to be the <hi>wiſer</hi> as they are the <hi>more:</hi> And
<hi>we</hi> bear <hi>their cenſures of us,</hi> and much more:
And cannot you bear the cenſures of a <hi>few</hi>
that you judge weaker? You will proclaim
the Non-Conformiſts to be the ſtronger
Chriſtians, if they can bear poverty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints,
with the cenſure of the moſt, when
you cannot bear the cenſure of the feweſt,
with liberty and Miniſterial maintenance and
honour.</p>

Pride, leſt it fill you with envy againſt your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that ſerve the ſame Lord, when you think
they any way diminiſh your reputation and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
I would have others keep up your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to the utmoſt; which in the name
of God, I charge upon them; Yea, and in
honour to prefer you: But if you think they
do not, remember that you are the Servants
of a <hi>Crucified Chriſt, who made himſelf of no
reputation, but took upon him the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59462:64"/>
and yet this way got a name above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
name. As ſure as you live, contending
for honour, is one of the readieſt ways to
looſe it, and giving it to <hi>others,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
it your ſelves, is one of the ſureſt
ways to get it, It is its motto, <hi>Quod ſequitur
fugio; quod fugit ipſe ſequor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Self-eſteem, and Pride is odious in all: but in
a Miniſter of Chriſt more odious, than in any
man: but never ſo odious as when it riſeth
to ſuch malignity, as to <hi>envy</hi> or <hi>hinder</hi> the
work of God, becauſe another more eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
doth it. It is a ſin that I am readyer to
tremble to think of, than further to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
               <p>And remember what work it hath made in
the Churches of Chriſt already. Read but
what <hi>Euſebius, Socrates, Sozomen, Evagrius,
Nicephorus,</hi> &amp;c. ſay of the fewds of the old
Biſhops: Read but the Acts of the Councils
at <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1, &amp; 2. of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> at <hi>Ariminum,</hi>
at <hi>Sirmium,</hi> at <hi>Nice, 2d. &amp;c.</hi> and if hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and ſhame do not overwhelm you, to
think what Chriſtian Biſhops did, and that
ſo early in the face of the Heathens, you are
not men. Read but how <hi>Nazianzene</hi> was
uſed at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by a Synod of Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Biſhops, when he had overcome the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:</hi>
Read the Controverſies between <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi>

his manner of dealing againſt the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniſts,</hi>
and of his double Letters and Preſent
which he ſent by <hi>Ifidore</hi> a Prieſt, to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and <hi>Maximus,</hi> to be given to him that

againſt <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and his ejection by
a Councel of Biſhops: Read the proceedings

Read but the deſtruction of the many

great ſuſpicions that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cauſed it.
Look but on the face of the Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Churches to this day, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and cauſe of their diviſions: And ſee what
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have done oft times againſt the
<hi>Calviniſts</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
(as in <hi>Gaſp. Peucers</hi> ſufferings for one:)
And ſee what the <hi>Roman</hi> Papacy and Clergy
have done in the world by Lordly Pride and
ſelfiſhneſs: And laſtly, See what hath bin
done by it in this Land; and at laſt learn
by experience, and judge of Church-mens
Pride by the effects.</p>
               <p>Brethren, what harm will it do to you, if
a Non-Conformiſt preach by you? if many
follow him? If ſome prefer him before you?
Do not others prefer you before him? What
if his followers think Conformity to be ſin?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59462:65"/>
Do not you and yours think ſo of our Non-Conformity?
It is not your ſelves that you
preach for, but the peoples Souls: And why
may not Chriſts Goſpel profit them from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
as well as from you? Nature teacheth
men to reliſh their own food, and partly to
feel what doth them good? <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.
Strom.</hi> 1. giveth it as the reaſon why the
Church <hi>(then,</hi> not <hi>now)</hi> left it to every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant
at the Sacrament, to <hi>Take their own
part, Becauſe</hi> man having free will, ſhall be
the chooſer, or refuſer of his own good. If
they chooſe a worſe Teacher than you, it is
not <hi>you</hi> but <hi>they</hi> that are the looſers: If they
chooſe a <hi>better,</hi> you have your end, if you
are Chriſtians; If you preach <hi>not ſo well</hi> as
another, you are not fit to be Miniſters of
Chriſt, if you be not glad that another doth
better, and is a bleſſing to the Flock. If
you preach <hi>better,</hi> its two to one but good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
will have an inſuparable attraction: Or
if miſtake make them more capable of good
from another than from you, ſhould you not
deſire that they might have it? Will you ſay,
It is their partial humour? I have heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Miniſters ſay ſo, that had reaſon to have
ſaid, It is my <hi>unskilfulneſs</hi> or <hi>dulneſs:</hi> But
ſuppoſe it be ſo; A Phyſician will let his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
take his Medicine from one mans hand,
if he refuſe it from another. The Father will
not let the Infant famiſh if he will take no
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59462:66"/>
meat from him, but from the Mother. If
the people had no faults or weakneſſes, what
need were there of <hi>you</hi> or other Miniſters.</p>
               <p>I am as apt to ſpeak ſharply againſt the
humours and weakneſs of Religious people, as
moſt that are not <hi>envious</hi> and <hi>malignant.</hi> But
I muſt give them this Teſtimony, that though
many of them cannot well judge of <hi>judiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
in their Teachers, yet moſt of them love
a <hi>ſerious Preacher</hi> and a <hi>Godly Liver;</hi> And
few of them diſtaſt either <hi>Prelates</hi> or <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
if they <hi>preach ſeriouſly,</hi> and <hi>live Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
But when in all the Countreys they ſee
ſuch <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Livers</hi> choſen out for <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing,</hi>
all the world cannot keep them from
diſliking ſuch Biſhops as ſhall do thus. I am
moſt confident for thoſe of my old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that if they had ſeen Biſhops (after
their long diſacquaintance with them) to
have Preached and Prayed in a ſound and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Holy manner, and ſet themſelves to
promote the labours of Godly Preachers, and
to encourage piety in the people and repreſs
iniquity, they would generally have loved
and honoured them, without reſpect to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
or Independency: It is Godlineſs
that Godly people care for. But ſince I and
abundance about us were ejected, and ſince
many of themſelves have bin laid in Goals, it
is no more in my power to make them love
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59462:66"/>
ſuch Biſhops, than to make them love the
Goal it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Yea further, Brethren, what if the Non-Conformable
Miniſter do give the Sacrament
to ſome, as you do to others? What if they
think their way beſt, as you think yours?
What if they call themſelves a Church and
exerciſe Diſcipline, (which without need I
would not have them do,) What harm will
this do to you or others? If it do them <hi>harm,</hi>
let them thank themſelves: But to you it can
do none, unleſs the unchriſtian ſin of <hi>pride
and envy</hi> cauſe it: or unleſs by <hi>reproaches</hi> and
<hi>contentiouſneſs</hi> they hinder the ſucceſs of your
labours; which is another thing. I confeſs
I have ever bin jealous of ſuch <hi>Arbitrary
Churches,</hi> where there is room for all in one
Church, leſt they ſhould turn <hi>Anti-Churches</hi>
and Theatres of emulation and contention;
(which I charge all conſcionable perſons to
abhor:) But all this may be avoided at
cheaper rates, than ſilencing ſo many labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Miniſters, or excommunicating all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that are Non-conformiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Joyn lovingly with your Brethren, as
Servants of one Lord, to promote one work.</hi>
Look not ſtrange at them, if they deſire your
friendſhip; Yea, if any of them prove cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and pieviſh, if you are the more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
condeſcending, and forward to love and
unity, and to further the peoples good, I ſhall
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59462:67"/>
take you for better men than them; And ſo
will all that judge by the fruits of the Spirit.
Try this way inſtead of wrath, and I dare
undertake that it ſhall more maintain your
honour, with your peace of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Brethren, our great account is near: The
Judge is at the door: It will be then comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to give a true account of Miniſterial fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
and hear, Well done good and faithful
ſervant; rather than to hear, We have beaten
our fellow Servants, or unfaithfully kept the
Key of knowledge. The ſouls of your charge
are <hi>many</hi> and <hi>precious:</hi> It is a hard and great
work to cure one: to make one Ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
underſtand, one proud perſon humble,
one infidel to believe, one worldling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Heavenly, or one ſenſualiſt to be a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
Saint: What help then do you need;
what labour is requiſite, to bring a Pariſh of
many hundred or thouſand perſons to this
change! As our weakneſs muſt make us all
cry out, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things,</hi> ſo
when <hi>one man</hi> hath <hi>ten mens</hi> work to do, he
may well ſay, He is inſufficient: In the firſt
three Centuries, when one Congregation
had a Biſhop with a Colledge or Company
of fellow Presbyters, they were not too many,
though one onely could preach at once. I
ſpeak not uncertainties: We have tryed the
Paſtoral work; and know by experience that
a Pariſh of a thouſand (much more of many
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59462:67"/>
thouſand) families, hath work enough for
many the moſt able and diligent Miniſters
in the Land: Yea, a Pariſh of an hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
needeth more help than any one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
is able to afford them: Try them all
by perſonal conference houſe by houſe as we
have done, and judge. Would you then have
the people taught, reformed and ſaved, or
not? If yea, Would you not have neceſſary
help to do it? I cannot believe that man to
know truely what it is to be a Miniſter or a
Chriſtian, that perceiveth not a neceſſity of
help if he can have it: And if you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
all now living, thoſe that are born
next will have need of as much labour as their
Parents: For <hi>ignorance, ſenſuality</hi> and <hi>pride</hi>
will be born with them.</p>
               <p>Thank God therefore that you may have
help, and take it, whether you meet in <hi>one</hi> or
<hi>two</hi> Aſſemblies: Help your tolerated Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in their work, as thoſe that more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the good of the peoples ſouls than they.
Conſult together for the removing of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
and for the ſtrengthening of each
other. And if any factious, or froward Non-conformiſt
ſhould happen to be your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
go to him, and by love and familiarity
ſeek to win and cure him; and you will win
the hearts of all good people. And if he be
really turbulent, and do more harm in the
place than good, I am perſwaded the reſt of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59462:68"/>
the Non-conformiſts will rebuke him, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
him. I add,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. If any difference between you cannot be
compoſed, inſtead of troubling the people about
it, quietly refer it to ſome indifferent Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
Is there not a wiſe man among you?
Muſt <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Lots</hi> Servants, ſeparate
them for a Well? Muſt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
part for different cenſures of another mans
omiſſion? Shall Chriſtians, Proteſtants, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
the Teachers of Love, and Concord
and Patience, be ſo <hi>weak,</hi> ſo <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> ſo <hi>bad,</hi>
ſuch contradicters of their daily Doctrine,
as not to be able to carry on Chriſts work in
peace; nor to make an amicable compoſure
of their differences? If you are Chriſtians
indeed, the difference is not who ſhall have
the moſt <hi>followers, applauſe</hi> or <hi>honour,</hi> but who
ſerveth God and ſaveth ſouls, in the right
and true effectual way? And may not prayer
and conſultation reconcile ſuch a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie?
For my own part I am conſcious of
<hi>pride and ſelfiſhneſs;</hi> Yet I can confidently
ſay, that when I had a Paſtoral charge, where
I needed many Aſſiſtants, if I had known
where that man lived whom the people would
have loved, honoured and profited by, more
than my ſelf, I would have rid night and day
to get him to be the man: And when I have
heard my Neighbour Miniſters that were
younger men (I can ſcarce forbear naming
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59462:68"/>
them) preach much more affectionately and
profitably than my ſelf, I have ſate under
them with tears of joy. But alas, What hath
ten years ſilence of ſuch men, deprived the
ſouls of the poor people of! I never <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

abaſe my ſelf by going naked, or by taking
on me to be an Awfe, or by filthineſs, or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
behaviour; As if Heaven and a Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
were moſt like: (See <hi>Foulis</hi> his Hiſtory
of Popery.) But I have thought it my duty to
caſt away deliberately and knowingly much
of my Reputation, even with Religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by the diſcharge of ſuch duty as I
knew would do it; Believing that Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is one thing to be reſolutely denyed for
Chriſt, and that he that ſaveth his honour
ſhall loſe it, and he that loſeth it for Chriſt
ſhall have everlaſting honour.</p>
               <p>Brethren, there is no great matters to be
done in the Church of Chriſt in the midſt of
ſo many corruptions and temptations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>confirmed Reſolution:</hi> Reſolve t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the ſervants of Chriſt, and to ſeek mens
Salvation, and to take no thought for your
carnal intereſt and honour; And then the
God whom you ſerve will take care of it.
Think not that other mens ſelfiſhneſs or fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs
is an excuſe to yours: Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

for ſinning more (and that by <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,

ſin, proteſting</hi> againſt Repentance) in
the day when Judgements called us all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
our Repentance for our former ſins. But
yet we ſuſpect our own underſtandings: We
know what different apprehenſions of things
good men may have: We know that we are
great ſinners our ſelves: We take not all this
to warrant our cenſorious ſeparations from
you. But we beſeech you be not too angry
with us, for differencing between good and
evil, between him that ſweareth, and him
that feareth an Oath. As long as we do it
to the coſt and ſuffering of our own fleſh,
which diſputeth in us more cunningly and
ſtrongly for Conformity, then all the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,</hi>
the <hi>Fullwoods,</hi> the <hi>Stilemans, &amp;c.</hi> in
<hi>England.</hi> We have naturally no more love
to poverty, to ſcorn, to a priſon, than you
have: And why may not thoſe that do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe almoſt ſay, that its like we ſtudy
to know the truth, as hard as any of you all?
And the love of beggery, ſcorn and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59462:69"/>
is not likely much to byas us. And
if you think that our honour with our party
doth it, you muſt needs think that we (who
ſo ſharply reprove them,) do think very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of that poor deſpiſed party, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their opinions, not onely before your
<hi>Magnates &amp; Plures,</hi> but alſo before our
Livelihoods, Liberties and Lives. Woe to
the Hypocrite that hath no better a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward!</p>
               <p>And why ſhould we do it? Were we not
as capable of the more <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>General</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
as you, if we could have taken your
way?</p>
               <p>As <hi>we</hi> are none of your Judges then, Be
you none of ours, but let us with <hi>Reſolved
unity</hi> (though not <hi>uniformity)</hi> ſerve that one
God whom we are all devoted to. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that to <hi>Preach Love</hi> is your Miniſterial

work. Reſolve as much to maintain <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

as the Martyrs did to maintain the <hi>Chriſtian
Faith.</hi> Remember <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper:</hi> You

We purpoſe not to Unminiſter you ſo much

                  <hi>Gildas</hi> did his <hi>Brittains,</hi> nor to ſeparate
from you ſo much as <hi>Martin</hi> did to the death,
from all the Neighbour Synods and Biſhops,
for a far leſſer cauſe than the ſilencing of
eighteen hundred Miniſters. We take not
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59462:70"/>
you whom I now write to, to be conſenting
to this work. (Though your <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>non-reſiſtance,</hi>
hath bred ſuch thoughts of you in
people, as we would fain have you cure by
the contrary means.) We are for peace:
Be not you againſt it: But we cannot buy it,
by deſerting the Miniſtry, to which we were
conſecrated and devoted, nor by neglecting
ſo many thouſand miſerable ſouls. Bring
things in <hi>England</hi> once to that paſs, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
our labour may be unneceſſary, in the
judgement of thoſe that are not <hi>Infidels, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi>
or <hi>Malignant enemies</hi> of a holy life,
and we will preſently gratifie all that deſire
our ſilence, or our baniſhment, and will not
trouble men with needleſs work.</p>
               <p>Thus, Brethren, you ſee, I have preſumed
no higher than to Petition you; And that
not to your coſt or detriment; nor for our
preferment, wealth or eaſe: We aske you not
for food or rayment; We crave from you
none of your Dignities, nor Eſtates: Though
when I find this Author diſſwading us from
our Miniſtry, becauſe the people are <hi>poor,</hi> I
think that reaſon might almoſt as aptly have
ſerved to perſwade us to live no longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the world is too poor to keep us; We
do but eat if we preach, and ſo we muſt if we
do not: And I think it had ſavoured of no
exceſs of Charity and Miniſterial ingenuity,
if he had rather ſaid, <hi>Brethren, you muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59462:70"/>
your undertaken Miniſtry, and we and the
peoples ſouls have need of all your help; And
the maintenance is given for the work, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you that work with us, ſhall have part of
the Church maintenance with us, at leaſt a fifth
part, as was allowed to the ejected by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
becauſe the people cannot maintain you,
and it is hard to ſerve God without anxiety, while
your families are in want.</hi> This had better
beſeemed our Brethren; but we crave and
expect no ſuch thing from you; but only pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
to ſuffer us to live and labour by you,
and let God provide for us as he pleaſe.</p>
               <p>And if we had expected that heretofore you
had Petitioned our Rulers, for the liberty
of our Miniſtry, it had bin no unreaſonable
expectation. All knew that our own Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had no hope: Miniſters ſhould of all
men have bin moſt ſenſible of the Churches
breaches, loſs and danger, and moſt compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
of the peoples ſouls: If you had but
humbly acquainted our Rulers, That all our
labours conjoyned are too little; that you
needed our help, and the ignorant our teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
That your own judgement was, that our
Miniſtry was more neceſſary than our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Conformity,</p>
               <p>1. You know not but you might have bin
heard: For no doubt our Rulers thought
they did that which the Reverend Church-men
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59462:71"/>
did adviſe or think beſt: I hope you do not
think that our civil Rulers would have done
all that they have done againſt us, if it had
bin againſt the Biſhops and conformable Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
judgment and adviſe: Civil Governours
are never ſo cruel in matters of Religion, as
the Ruling and exaſperated Clergy are, as the
Hiſtories of all ages teſtifie.</p>
               <p>2. Or at leaſt you might have had the
greater peace of Conſcience, in all the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
that have followed, and ſaid, <hi>It is not
long of us.</hi>
And you would have acquitted your ſelves in
the judgement of all your hearers, and they
would have bin the leſs prejudiced againſt
your Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Had you Petitioned and prevailed but for
theſe two things, you had healed all our
breaches,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the door of enterance might not
have bin barred by any other ſubſcriptions,
profeſſions or Oaths, than what were uſed in
the Churches of Chriſt, till the exaltation of
the Papacy (for 600 years,) beſides the Oaths
of Allegeance and ſupremacy, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in the 39. Articles, according to the

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That thoſe (ſo ſubſcribing) who
dare not uſe the Liturgy and Ceremonies,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59462:71"/>
might have leave to <hi>preach</hi> in the Churches
which uſe them, under Laws which ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
them from all unpeaceable oppoſition
to what they dare not uſe, or to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church. And having mentioned
this, What if I added yet this clauſe to my
preſent Petition to you?</p>
               <p>V. That you will yet Petition for us, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the Church of Chriſt, that upon the
foreſaid terms we may be, if poſſible, taken in to
the eſtabliſhed Miniſtry, If not, yet tolerated as
Lecturers under you in ſuch Churches, where
the Miniſters deſire us, not taking any of their
maintenance from them, but truſting God for our
daily bread.</p>
               <p>By this means you ſhall have no need to
fear our injuring of your wealth or reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Nor the ſtrengthening of the Papiſts by
the weakening of Proteſtants through our-own
diviſions; (Onely let not the people who
ſcruple Conformity, be therefore denyed
Church-Communion and Sacraments.)</p>
               <p>And now as God will judge, ſo let the
world judge, &amp; let poſterity judge whether we
are unworthy in compariſon of the preſent
Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> to be permitted to
preach Chriſts Goſpel on theſe ſelf-denying
and ſelf-abaſing terms; And whether they
that cry out of the danger of Popery. Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Profaneneſs and Hereſies, and yet had
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59462:72"/>
rather let them in all, than give us leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
that Miniſtry to which we were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,
in poverty and ſubjection; and while
they cry out of Diviſions, will not lay by
the <hi>Dividing-engines;</hi> ſhould rather accuſe us
or themſelves, if the evils overwhelm us, which
they ſeem to fear?</p>
               <p>It is not <hi>pleaſure, profit or worldly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
that we contend for: We would do
no man hurt or wrong: If our lovers of
Church-power do think us intolerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we obey them not as fully as they deſire,
we profeſs before God and Man, that it is not
becauſe we would not be ſubject and obedient
to any, as far as will ſtand with our obedience
to God, but only becauſe we <hi>dare not,</hi> we <hi>will
not</hi> do that which we believe that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth
us: And if we erre, it is not for want of
ſtudying, perhaps as hard and impartially as
they, to know the truth: And to him that
thinketh he doth evil it is ſin. It is ſin, and no
ſmall or tolerable ſin, which our conſciences
fear, in our forbearing ſubſcriptions and
Conformity: If they alſo take it to <hi>be a ſin</hi>

ſin,</hi> than to ſuffer the inundation of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
Popery and the reſt which they ſay is
ready to break in upon us, And if they think
our not Subſcribing, Swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be in

any other of our perſonal ſufferings, unleſs the
ſouls of many thouſands, and the Proteſtant
Religion, and our Poſterity alſo ſuffer for it,
the Judgments of God muſt be endured. But
remember not Lord our offences, nor the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
of our Fore-fathers, neither take thou
vengeance of our ſins: Spare us good Lord;
Spare thy people whom thou haſt redeemed
with thy moſt precious blood, and be not
angry with us for ever. And haſten O Lord
Jeſus thy more Righteous Judgement.</p>
