            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Arke of the new Couenant (more is the pity it should

the duty of euery priuate Christian to further the
cause of the Gospell in what hee may, much more of
them whom the Common-wealth calleth forth for
publike imployments; I blesse God that I haue no
need to presse this charge vpon your particular, or

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all solemne Assemblies, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
meetings vpon ciuill affayres,
the first act, vsually, is to open
and reade the Commission which
may warrant the businesse to bee
vndertaken. This course I haue
thought good to obserue and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
in making entrance vpon this
holy and religious Exercise: First,
to open vnto you the Commission, which may warrant
and beare out the duty wee are now to goe about; and
that, not onely in the substance, but also in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>In this Exercise there are but two things subiect to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23793:6"/>
question: the Exercise it selfe, and the season for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it.</p>
            <p>The Exercise it selfe, The <hi>Preaching of the Word.</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
minded men, who sauour not the things of God,
will happly conceiue of it, at the least, as not so necessary:
The season for the performance of this Exercise (being on
the weeke day,) others perhaps will censure it as not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.
To both these the Spirit of God, in the words
I haue now read, giueth vs an expresse warrant; and that
not by way of allowance onely, but by way of iniunction;
as of things that not onely may bee done, but must bee
done. To the Exercise it selfe, [<hi>Preach the Word,</hi>] not
onely a toleration, but a peremptory command. To the
circumstance of time, the season for the performance of
it, [<hi>Be instant in season, out of season:</hi>] No season vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
for this so necessary a duty: Euen that which may
seeme to carnall reason, to flesh and blood to bee out of
season, is yet seasonable. Though it may seeme vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to the hearers, yet it is seasonable in the speaker.
This is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> charge to <hi>Timothy</hi> in particular, and
in him to all the Ministers of the Gospell, [<hi>Preach the
Word, be instant in season, out of season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Apostolicall charge,<note place="margin">Diuis.</note> there are two things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselues to our consideration, <hi>The duty inioyned;</hi>
and, <hi>The manner of discharging it:</hi> The <hi>Duty</hi> that is inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is, Preaching of the Word, <hi>Preach the Word:</hi> The
<hi>Manner</hi> how this duty must be discharged, is, With ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse
and diligence, with vndaunted resolution,
with indefatigable industry; <hi>Bee instant in season, out of
season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the Duty it selfe: <hi>Preach the Word.</hi> This
is a Duty imposed by God vpon all the Ministers of the
Gospell:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They must Preach the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the charge,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> we see, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
vpon his sonne <hi>Timothy,</hi> and he doth it with as much
seriousnesse and earnestnesse as possibly can be conceiued:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23793:6"/>
               <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall
iudge the quicke and the dead at his appearing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 1.</note> 
               <hi>and his kingdome,
Preach the Word.</hi> Did you euer heare a charge set on with
more pressing arguments, with more compulsiue and
commanding perswasions? I, but in imposing this charge
vpon <hi>Timothy,</hi> doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deale, as our Sauiour
saith of the Scribes and Pharises,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 4.</note> who <hi>binde heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
vpon other mens shoulders, but they themselues
will not moue them with one of their fingers?</hi> Nothing
lesse: What he imposeth vpon <hi>Timothy,</hi> he conceiueth
and acknowledgeth to be as deepely charged vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
<hi>Necessity is laid vpon me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 161<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>yea, Wee is vnto mee of I
Preach not the Gospell.</hi> So deeply did this great Doctor of
the Gentiles account himselfe to stand charged with this
Duty. There was a Necessity lay vpon him for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it; that Necessity backt with a Woe if hee
should neglect it. The like Necessity, the like Woe lyeth
vpon all the Ministers of the Gospell in their seuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and stations: They must Preach the Word: Woe is
vnto them if they doe it not: I must not dwell vpon
confirmation. This was the first and the last charge
which our blessed Sauiour gaue to his Apostles, when he
was to send them forth into the world after hee had told
them whither they should goe; the first charge he giueth
them, is,<note place="margin">Mar. 10. 7.</note> 
               <hi>As ye goe, Preach,</hi> When hee himselfe was to
leaue the world, and to take his last farewell of them,
the last charge he giueth them,<note place="margin">Mark. 16. 15.</note> is, <hi>Goe ye into all the world,
and preach the Gospell to euery creature.</hi> Preaching of the
Gospell was the Alpha,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 17.</note> and the Omega in their Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Ministration; and it is one of the maine businesses
which the Ministers of the Gospell must attend vnto;
They must <hi>Preach the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By way of explication, and illustration, I will here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
vnto you two things: What is meant by <hi>Preaching;</hi>
what by the <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first: To Preach in a generall and large accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Word,<note place="margin">What Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is.</note> is to declare, or any wayes make
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23793:7"/>
knowne the will of God vnto man: In this sense euery
declaration of the will of God, be it by any of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
Chastisements, Iudgements, Creatures, may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
be called Preaching: <hi>The heauens declare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and the Firmament sheweth his handy work.</hi> Neuer a
Creature in heauen and earth but readeth a Lecture, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
to the eye of the beholder, the mercie, wisedome,
power and goodnesse of God: And so in this generall
sense, Reading may also be called Preaching. But more
specially and properly, in the ordinary phrase of the
Scripture, Preaching importeth a Ministeriall action,
wherein the will of God is made knowne to the Church,
after a speciall manner, by the Ministers of the Gospell. To
speake distinctly. The Ministers of the Word, being A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
betwixt God and his people,<note place="margin">Wherein the office of the Ministers of the Word consists.</note> their office consisteth
in two things: 1. In dealing with God for the people.
2. In dealing with the people for and from God. First,
they are to deale with God, for and on the behalfe of the
people; to be, as it were, their <hi>Mouthes vnto God,</hi> in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp their suits, and supplications, and thanksgiuings
vnto God, in expressing their desires vnto God, to pray
for them: <hi>God forbid that I should sinne against the Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceasing
to pray for you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 23.</note> saith <hi>Samuel</hi> vnto the people. And
secondly, as they are to be the peoples mouth to God, in
praying for them, so they are to bee <hi>Gods Mouth</hi> to the
people, in instructing them, in declaring his will to them.
<hi>If thou take away the precious from the vile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 15. 19.</note> 
               <hi>thou shalt be, as it
were, my mouth,</hi> saith the Lord to the Prophet <hi>Ieremy.</hi> The
Prophets of God, the Ministers of the Word, are Gods
mouth, whereby he speakes, and makes knowne his will
to his people. The will of God is made knowne to the
Church, by the Ministers of the Gospell, two wayes:
<hi>By Visible signes,</hi> by <hi>Audible voyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Visible signes:</hi> The Sacraments, which, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the Church by hands of the Ministers, are as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
words to make knowne and ascertaine to euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer,
the eternall gracious purpose, the euerlasting good
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23793:7"/>
will of God towards him in his Sonne.</p>
            <p>But secondly, and principally, by <hi>Audible voyce:</hi> By Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
voyce the will of God is declared to the Church by
the Ministers of the Word in two Ministeriall actions;
In Reading; in Preaching: In Reading the Text, the
letter of the Scriptures; in Preaching, interpreting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding,
applying them to the edification of the
Church: Both these Ministeriall actions you haue ioyned
together in the practice of <hi>Ezra</hi> and the Leuites in <hi>Nehe.

               <note place="margin">Neh. 8. 8.</note> 
               <hi>in the Law of God distinctly, and
gaue the sense, and caused the people to vnderstand the reading.</hi>
That which we haue here to deale withall, is the last of
these Ministeriall actions, Preaching, properly so called,

            <p>3 How wee are to speake and deliuer the will of God
to the people, namely, as Heralds should doe: How is
that? Why, 1. <hi>Boldly: 2. Faithfully: 3. Plainely. Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
as hauing authority, as representing the person of the
Prince that sends them: <hi>Faithfully,</hi> neither adding to, nor
detracting from what they haue receiued in instruction
from their Masters: <hi>Plainly,</hi> that all they to whom they
are sent, may heare and vnderstand their message: Thus
should the Ministers of the Word behaue themselues in
the dispensation of the Gospel, in preaching of the Word:
Deliuer it,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Boldly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Boldly.</note> as standing in the place, representing the
person of God himselfe: not fearing the faces of them
to whom they are sent: <hi>Behold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 3. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>I haue made thy face strong
against their faces, and thy fore-head strong against their fore-heads,
As an Adamant, harder than Flint, haue I made thy
fore-head,</hi> saith the Lord to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Such an
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23793:9"/>
vandaunted boldnesse, such an inuincible resolution should
there be in the Ministers of the Word, in deliuering the
will of God to the people; in instructing, exhorting,
conuincing, reprouing; they must doe it with boldnesse.
They that preach Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 29.</note> must so preach him, as Christ
himselfe preached, when hee was vpon the earth, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
authority: It is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> charge, in expresse words,
to <hi>Titus: These things speake and exhort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>and rebuke with all
authority:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: that is, with a Ministeriall
authority. In this, Christs preaching, and our preaching
of Christ, differ; He preached, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as hauing
authority in himselfe, from himselfe: Wee must preach
with <hi>authority</hi> too, but not as hauing authority in our
selues, but with a deriued, a Ministeriall authority, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from him whose Ambassadours we are, whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we represent: Preach with authority: Boldly.</p>
            <p>2. Faithfully:<note place="margin">Faithfully.</note> Deliuer the will of God, his whole
will, nothing but his will, neither adding to it, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
from it: Thus did the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preach
and deliuer the will of God to the Churches: What hee
deliuered to others,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23.</note> he first receiued himselfe; <hi>I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of the Lord that which also I deliuered vnto you.</hi> And
as he receiued what he deliuered, so hee deliuered what
he receiued; he kept nothing backe: <hi>I haue not shunned
to declare vnto you all the Counsell of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 20. 17.</note> They are his owne
words to the Elders of Ephesus at Miletum. Thus must
we deliuer the Counsell of God, his reuealed Will (for
that is meant by <hi>Counsell</hi> in that place, not his secret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and Purposes, but his reuealed Will, specially his
Counsell and Purpose touching the way and meanes of
saluation, by Christ, and Christ alone) we must deliuer it
faithfully; not adding to it, nor baulking any thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be knowne. Exemplary to vs is that resolution
of the Prophet <hi>Michaia,</hi> when hee was sent for to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
before King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ahab: At the Lord liueth</hi> (saith he)
<hi>whatsoeuer the Lord saith vnto me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 22. 14.</note> 
               <hi>that will I speake.</hi> Deliuer
the will of God faithfully.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:23793:9"/>
And thirdly, deliuer it plainely: Heralds speake di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
with an audible voyce,<note place="margin">Plainly.</note> in a knowne language, to
the vnderstanding of those to whom they are sent: <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 18. 26, 27.</note>
when he was sent as an Herald to the people of the
Iewes, he would not speake to them in the Aramites lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
as <hi>Eliakim</hi> would haue had him, but in the Iewes
language, that the people might vnderstand his arrand.
Thus must Gods Heralds, the Ministers of the Word, in
deliuering his Embassage, in preaching of the Word,
they must speake plainely, distinctly, in a knowne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
to the capacity of the hearers: Thus did <hi>Ezra</hi> and
the Leuites,<note place="margin">Neh. 8. 8.</note> in that forenamed place; <hi>They read in the
booke, in the Law of the Lord distinctly, and gaue the sense, and
caused the people to vnderstand.</hi> And it is noted of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
at the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> as an exemplary president to
the Ministers of the Gospell for euer: That <hi>Euery man
heard them speake in his own language:</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Act. 2. v. 6.</note> they spake to
euery man in his own language; not that the hearers heard
that in diuers languages which they spake but in one, as
some haue (not without some colour in the words) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectured;
for then (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Caluin</hi> vpon the place well
obserues) the miracle had beene in the hearers,<note place="margin">Calu. in loc. v.</note> not in
the speakers, whereas the <hi>clouen tongues</hi> rested vpon the
Apostles, not vpon the people. <hi>Their tongues</hi> were <hi>clouen,</hi>
they spake to the people in their owne languages, that
they might vnderstand as well as heare: For a Herald to
deliuer a message of importance in a strange language,
which none vnderstand but himselfe, he had as good bee
silent. They that take vpon them the preaching of Christ,
must speake in the language of Christ, and the language
of the people; they must speake <hi>plainely.</hi> This it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to Preach, <hi>viz.</hi> To deliuer the will of God, as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds
doe the commands of their Masters: to speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>all:</hi> to speake in the <hi>name of God,</hi> with <hi>boldnesse, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
plainenesse.</hi> You now see the first question resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and cleared: What is meant by <hi>Preaching:</hi> But what
must we Preach? <hi>The voyce saith to vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 40. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Cry; but what shall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23793:10"/>
wee cry?</hi> That is the second thing to be vnfolded: The
text telleth vs, <hi>The Word:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>We must Preach the
Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (<hi>the Word</hi>)<note place="margin">The Word ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two waies.</note> it admits of many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
significations in the Scriptures: In this place it may
be taken two wayes:<note place="margin">1. For Christ himselfe.</note> First, for <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, who is
sometimes in the phrase of the Scripture called (<hi>the Word,</hi>)
<hi>In the beginning was the Word:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Are in text.</note> That is, the eternall sonne
of God, the vncreated,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 1.</note> essentiall <hi>Word</hi> of the Father.
Christ is called <hi>The Word</hi> (to omit other more witty than
solid coniectures) principally for two reasons: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is the summe and substance of that Word, that
first and great Word, that Word of words, the Word of
promise made by God himselfe to his Church at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
and afterwards, in effect, from time to time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
and ratified vnto the Patriarchs:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>The seed of the
woman shall breake the Serpents head:</hi> The substance of this
promise is Christ himselfe, the seed of the Virgin, in
him this promise is verified and made good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called the <hi>Word:</hi> Secondly, he is (<hi>the Word,</hi>) because
by him the will and purpose of God is made knowne to
the Church, as our mindes are expressed to other men
by our words;<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>No man hath seene God at any time, but the
onely begotten sonne of the Father, he hath declared him: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
him:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith the Originall; the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
to conduct, and direct, and leade a man, as it were,
by the hand to the finding out of something that was hid
before. The will of God was a thing that was locked vp
in the breast of his secret counsell, a thing hidden from
our eies, as the purpose of a mans heart is from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of another. Now Christ hath led vs to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of this will by declaring of it, as a mans words
lead another to the knowledge of the intents and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of his heart, and therefore called <hi>The Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. The Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> by the <hi>Word,</hi> here wee may vnderstand the
reuealed will of God made knowne in his Word in the
Scriptures: specially his will concerning his sonne, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23793:10"/>
the saluation of his people by him: <hi>The Word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell:</hi>
The Gospell is called (<hi>the Word</hi>) the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
the whole Bible, euery part and parcell of it is the word
of God; but the Gospell is the pith, the marrow, the
quintessence, the summe and substance of this word, and
therefore called, by way of eminency,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 7.</note> 
               <hi>The Word of the
Gospell: That the Gentiles might heare the Word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell:</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: the word by way of eminency: This is
the Word which the Spirit of God is pleased to honour
with so many honourable additions and compellations in
the Scriptures; sometimes calling it <hi>the Word of life, the
Word of eternall life: Master,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6 68.</note> 
               <hi>thou hast the words of eternall
life,</hi> saith <hi>Peter</hi> to our Sauiour. The Law is a <hi>Word of
death,</hi> a killing letter: the Gospell is a Word of life, a
quickening Word, giuing life, leading vnto life: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
againe,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 13.</note> the word of Truth: <hi>In whom yee also belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
after that ye heard of the Word of Truth.</hi> Euery word of
God is a true word, the Gospell is the word of Truth:
Sometimes the word of the Kingdome:<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Whensoeuer a man
heareth the Word of the Kingdome.</hi> The Word of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
because by this Word, as by his Scepter, Christ
ruleth like a King in the hearts of his people: and by
this Word he maketh them Kings, bringing them by it,
to the Kingdome of grace here, and of glory hereafter:
Sometimes againe,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 26.</note> the Word of saluation: <hi>To you is the
Word of this saluation sent,</hi> saith <hi>Paul</hi> to the men of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och.
The Word of saluation, because it is the power of
God to saluation. There is a singular excellency and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
in this word of the Gospell, and therefore here in
the text, called <hi>The Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to which of these two interpretations we should
incline, it matters not; there is no materiall difference
betwixt them; Whether Christ, or the Gospell of Christ,
all commeth to one: Christ is the subiect of the Gospell,
and the Gospell is the doctrine of Christ;<note place="margin">The subiect of Preaching, is Christ and the Gospell.</note> the sense is still
one and the same: That which <hi>Timothy</hi> and the Ministers
of the Gospell must preach, is nothing but the Word,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23793:11"/>
Christ, the Gospell of Christ: They must preach Christ:
Him did <hi>Philip</hi> preach vnto the Samaritans; <hi>He preached
Christ vnto them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 8. 5.</note> Him did <hi>Paul</hi> preach immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his conuersion;<note place="margin">Acts 9. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Straightway he preached Christ in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues:</hi>
To this subiect did he euer confine his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching:
<hi>We preach Christ crucified:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23.</note> Hee preached Christ,
nothing but Christ:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>I determined not to know any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you saue Iesus Christ.</hi> Thus must wee preach Christ,
and the <hi>Gospell of Christ:</hi> They are the expresse words of
our Commission,<note place="margin">Mark 1<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Goe Preach the Gospell:</hi> Here is then
the subiect of our Preaching, nothing but Christ, the
Gospell of Christ. True indeed, we must preach <hi>Moses,</hi>
we must preach the Law; but how? Wee must Preach
<hi>Moses</hi> as a harbinger to Christ; wee must Preach the
Law, but in reference to the Gospell, that we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
with <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Prepare the way of the Lord, and
make his paths straight:</hi> that we may by this meanes leuell
and smooth the way for Christ, that the offer of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by him may finde the better entertainment: That
which we must principally eye and looke at in our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
is, this Word, Christ, and the Gospell of
Christ.</p>
            <p>To preach Christ and the Gospell of Christ, is a great
worke: if you would know what it is, it consisteth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
in foure Ministeriall actions: I will but name
them:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In reuealing of Christ;</hi>
               <note place="margin">To preach Christ, and the Gospel of Christ, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in foure parts.</note> in laying open the truth of
doctrine concerning Christ; his owne person; his two
natures, Godhead and Manhood; his three offices, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Priestly, Propheticall; with the seuerall workes of
either; the seuerall passages of his incarnation, birth, life,
death, resurrection,<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 27.</note> ascension, intercession, comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
at the last day.<note place="margin">Act. 2. 22. to 37</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. In <hi>reuealing the will of God concerning Christ: viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19. 20</note>
that it is his will to saue sinners by him, and him alone;
that he hath set him forth as a meanes of reconciliation;
that he hath giuen him as an all-sufficient sacrifice for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23793:11"/>
sinnes of the world: so making a generall offer and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Christ to all that will receiue him as a Sauiour, and
a Lord.</p>
            <p>3. In reuealing <hi>the way to come vnto Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and to God by
him: viz. By faith,</hi> and faith alone, which is the onely
hand and instrument ordayned of God to apprehend and
take hold of Christ, to apply the merit of his actiue and
passiue obedience vnto eternall life.</p>
            <p>4. And lastly,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. c. ver. 23.</note> in giuing and applying Christ particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to euery poore penitent sinner that is heauy laden
vnder the burthen of sinne: Commanding him in the
name of God to beleeue in Christ,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 31.</note> to receiue him as a
Sauiour, to take hold of him, and to rest vpon him: assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him withall, in the name of God, that Christ dyed
for him in particular, and that the merit of his death and
passion belongeth to him, and shall be imputed vnto him;
so by this particular application, forming Christ in the
soule,<note place="margin">Cal. 4. 19.</note> from whence will follow a through change, and
conuersion both in heart and life. This it is to <hi>Preach
Christ, and the Gospell of Christ.</hi> And this is the duty which
S. <hi>Paul</hi> here imposeth vpon <hi>Timothy,</hi> and which all the
Ministers of the Gospell should principally be imployed
about.</p>
            <p>I might here now giue you some reasons of the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this duty of preaching the Word after this manner:
To omit all other:</p>
            <p>The reason of reasons is,<note place="margin">Reas.</note> because it is <hi>the ordinance of
God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> his <hi>power vnto saluation:</hi> that is, his powerfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
which he hath in his wisedome appointed and
set apart for the working of the saluation of his people;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 18.</note>
for the begetting, beginning of grace, increasing of grace,
perfecting of grace in the hearts of his chosen, and so
consequently to bring them through grace to glory.</p>
            <p>The time preuents mee, giue mee leaue now to passe
from the duty it selfe, to the manner of performance: I
shall make the application of both together. The <hi>manner</hi>
how this important duty should bee discharged, is set
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23793:12"/>
downe, first, <hi>generally,</hi> then illustrated and explayned
more <hi>particularly:</hi> generally, [<hi>Be instant</hi>] particularly, [<hi>In
season, out of season.</hi>] I will be briefe in all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be instant,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

imports two things; <hi>Earnestnesse,</hi> and <hi>Diligence.</hi> Thus
must the Ministers of the Gospell be instant in preaching
of the Word;<note place="margin">Ministers must be instant two wayes:</note> they must stand to, and stand ouer the
worke 1. with earnestnesse: 2. with diligence.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First,<note place="margin">Earnest, and that</note> they must be <hi>instant and earnest</hi> about this worke

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. They must bee <hi>earnest with themselues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">With them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</note> and that in
stirring and exciting vp themselues to the worke, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselues forward vpon this seruice: great need
of earnestnesse this way.</p>
            <p>There are many auocations which will be ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
and turne vs aside,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> to call vs away, to plucke vs back
from the worke: profits, pleasures, preferments, ease,
quietnesse and the like: Flesh and bloud will alwayes be
whispering in our eares, as <hi>Peter</hi> in his Masters, <hi>Master,
fauour thy selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Besides these auocations, wee must make account to
meet with many discouragements, many dangers, much
hardship, Beares and Lyons in the way, stormes and
tempests enow to make vs not onely to looke backe, but
euen to leaue the plough of God in the open field.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Besides these discouragements, much resistance, much
opposition: Euery <hi>Paul</hi> must make account to meet with
an <hi>Elimas;</hi> euery <hi>Moses</hi> with a <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in one kinde or other, wee must make account to
finde Satan standing at our right hands, when we are to
goe about this worke, as hee stood at the right hand of
<hi>Iehoshuah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>to resist him,</hi> when he was <hi>to stand before the
Lord</hi> to execute his office. Great need of earnestnesse to
put our selues forward in a seruice where we shall meet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23793:12"/>
with so many auocations, so many discouragements, so
much opposition: All our earnestnesse will bee little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make vs beare vp head against this tide. Strange
it is how farre these haue preuailed many times against
the faithfull messengers of God, to the disheartning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to the silencing of them: It was the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
owne case: such was the entertainment that he met
withall, in the discharge of his office, that hee had euen
resolued with himselfe <hi>not to make mention of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 20. 9.</note> 
               <hi>not to
speake any more in his name.</hi> It made him almost to silence
himselfe from Preaching any more: and had not the
Word beene in his <hi>heart, as a burning fire shut vp in his
bones</hi> (as he there speakes) <hi>hee had beene for euer silent:</hi>
Such defamations, such minting and coyning of slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
reports,<note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> such catching at his words, such <hi>watching
for his haltings,</hi> such lying in wayt to intrap him, (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
telleth vs in the next verse) that he had euen resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to turne his backe vpon his office. If any of the
Messengers of God meet with better measure in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their duties, it is more than God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them, or they can promise to themselues. Great
need therefore to stand vp to the worke, that wee may
ouerlooke and ouerleape all these blockes that lye in the
way: Great need to be <hi>earnest,</hi> euen to offer a kinde of
holy violence to our selues to stirre vp our selues to the
worke. Euen as the Cocke, the true Embleme of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Word, first awakens himselfe by the clapping
of his wings, that hee may awaken others by his crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
so must wee offer a kinde of holy violence to our
selues to awaken and stirre vp our selues to the worke of
our Ministry, that being stirred vp our selues first, wee
may</p>
            <p>2. Awaken and stirre vp <hi>others:</hi> Ministers must bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
instant and earnest with others as well as with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,<note place="margin">Others.</note>
offer violence to others, in Preaching the Word,
as well as to themselues. The Kingdome of heauen should
suffer <hi>violence</hi> as well in the speaker, as in the hearer: in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23793:13"/>
the mouth of the one, as in the heart of the other: It is
the charge which the Master of the Feast giueth vnto

wayes to fetch in guests to the Supper;<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Compell them to
come in.</hi> Thus should wee Preach the Gospell, inuite
men to the participation of Christ with commanding
arguments, with compulsiue perswasions, so as to take
no deniall. So should we deale with the soules of men,
as the Angels did with the bodies of <hi>Lot</hi> and his family,
plucke them as fire-brands out of the flames, and that
with a holy violence.<note place="margin">Iude 23.</note> It is the charge which the Lord
giueth to the Prophet <hi>Esay, Esa. 55. Cry aloud, spare not:</hi>
Great reason the Ministers of the Word should Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,<note place="margin">Esa. 55. 1.</note>
they often speake vnto dead men, such as are <hi>dead
in trespasses and sinnes:</hi> Doe we see men sleeping and snor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
securely in their natural states and conditions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

to speake: Doe wee see men walking on securely in the

            </p>
            <p>1. It may be taken for the <hi>ordinary set time</hi> appoynted
and set apart for this exercise:<note place="margin">For the set time, the Lords day.</note> The ordinary time set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
by God himselfe for this duty, is the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi>
the <hi>Lords day:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 31. 13.</note> And then to Preach the Word, is to Preach
it <hi>in season.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 12.</note> The Sabbath was, and the Lords day is a <hi>signe
of sanctification</hi> vnto the people of God; neuer are the
meanes of sanctification so properly in season as then.
This season did our Sauiour and his Apostles vsually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue.<note place="margin">Mark. 6. 2.</note>
Before his resurrection they went into the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
and taught vpon the Sabbath dayes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 4. 16, &amp;c.</note> After his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 14.</note>

               <hi>as at the day of Pentecost,</hi> and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times. And this season the Ministers of the Gospell
are to obserue after a speciall manner. In this there is a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23793:14"/>
difference betwixt the word of God and that Mannah
which came downe from heauen in the wildernesse; that
fell vpon euery day of the weeke except the Sabbath, this
spirituall Mannah neuer falleth so seasonably as
then.</p>

Word may be most acceptable,<note place="margin">Other special oportunities.</note> most profitable vnto the
hearers. There are certaine <hi>seasons</hi> when the Word is
likely to finde better acceptance and entertainment, to
take place rather than at other times: as, <hi>viz.</hi> when men
are humbled vnder the hand of God, when the heart is
broken vnder some great affliction or other, whether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or feared, that is a season when the Word is like to
finde easier passage, and to make a deeper impression: So
againe, when the heart is warmed and melted with the
fresh apprehension of some new mercy, that is a <hi>season</hi>
when the Word is likely to finde a wide and effectuall
doore opened to it to let it into the soule: So againe, there
are certaine <hi>seasons</hi> when some particular doctrin is more
seasonable, than others; As to minister comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
to an afflicted deiected soule: when the heart
is pricked, wounded, when the spirit is broken vnder the
apprehension of sinne and Gods wrath due to it, then to
preach, comfort is like the powring in balsome into a
bleeding wound, or like a showre of raine falling vpon
the new mowne grasse, it is a <hi>word in season.</hi> Now Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

of the speaker:<note place="margin">So the Word seemeth to be three wayes.</note> 2. In respect of the hearer: 3. In respect
of both.</p>
            <p>First, in respect of the <hi>Speaker,</hi> the Minister himselfe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the Preaching of the Word seemeth to bee <hi>out of season,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In respect of the Minister.</note>
when his ease, his pleasures, his profits, his worldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
some vnnecessary auocations or other, draw
him another way. When there is no constraint, no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Preaching, the Law of the Land requires it not,
neither is there any benefit, but perhaps danger likely to
accrew to himselfe by Preaching (as in times of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution)
then it may seeme to him to bee <hi>out of
season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In respect of the <hi>Hearers,</hi> when their Farmes, their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Oxen, their particular calling, domesticall imployments,<note place="margin">Hearer.</note>
perhaps sports, pastimes, recreations draw them another
way: When they cannot repayre to the hearing of the
Word without some paines, without some hardship in
respect of the season, the weather, (<note n="*" place="margin">A snowy morning.</note> as it falleth out this
morning,) or otherwise, then the Preaching and hearing
of the Word, seemeth to them to be <hi>out of season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, to both <hi>Speaker</hi> and <hi>Hearers</hi> it may seeme <hi>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of season.</hi> When it is preached not onely at the set ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
times,<note place="margin">To both.</note> vpon the Sabbath, the Lords day, but also at
other times, vpon other occasions, vpon the weeke day;
then flesh and blood will be ready to think it as a showre
of raine in the midst of Haruest, <hi>out of season.</hi> Now at
these times, which to carnall reason may seeme vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
must the Ministers of the Gospell stand vp to the

and aduantages of Preaching publikely, of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting

<hi>out of season,</hi> being in the weeke day, when men should
attend vpon their particular callings, and other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
If it doe, yet we dare not neglect it: the Spirit
of God here giueth vs a warrant for it, nay, layeth a
charge vpon vs to embrace the occasion, to take hold and
make vse of this aduantage which God and authority
haue put into our hands: here is our Commission, <hi>Preach
the Word, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue dwelt long vpon the doctrinall part of the Text,
perhaps you may thinke too long. All this time you may
say, what is this to vs? To make you amends in that
which remaines, giue me leaue to turne my speech now
wholly vnto you. The doctrine hath beene ours (I wish
we may make it ours by practise) the application shall be
yours.</p>
            <p>You see what charge it is which the Spirit of God here
imposeth vpon vs: <hi>Preach the VVord, bee instant in season,
out of season:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The peoples duty in fiue parts.</note> Doe but turne the tables, the Charge is
yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Heare the VVord, be instant in season, and out of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi>
This charge hath many parts; to set it on the better,
I will breake it in pieces.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Vse 1. <hi>Heare.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Heare the VVord:</hi> Preaching and Hearing are
Relatiues: If there lye a necessity vpon vs to Preach, by
the same rule there lyeth a necessity vpon you to Heare:
Hee that ordained vs to Preach the Gospell, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
ordained you to <hi>heare</hi> the Gospell: And therefore let
me exhort you, in the name and feare of God, to attend
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23793:15"/>
vpon this ordinance of God: I call it his <hi>ordinance:</hi> and
so it is as well in the hearer, as in the speaker: <hi>Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Hearing, by
the word of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 10. 17.</note> that is, by his ordinance, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Beza</hi> most naturally interprets the
word.<note place="margin">Bezannot, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cum.</note> Attend vpon it therefore, and that because it is
his ordinance. There is a great deale of force and strength
in this argument, to perswade men to attend vpon the
hearing of the Word preached, because it is Gods owne
ordinance. A man may alwayes expect to finde God
when he seeketh him in his owne way. Then may a man
comfortably assure himselfe of a blessing, when hee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it in the ordinance of God, in that way which God
himselfe hath chalked out, and appointed for that end
and purpose. It is the ordinance of God that maketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thing to bee vsefull vnto vs, that maketh euery
comfort to bee comfortable, that maketh euery meanes
of our good to be helpefull and seruiceable to vs: Why
doth bread nourish vs more than the grasse of the field?
It is Gods <hi>ordinance,</hi> There is a <hi>word</hi> of command that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
along with the one,<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 4.</note> and not with the other, which
hath ordained, appointed, and set it apart for that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
vse, and hath giuen it a speciall efficacy for that end
and purpose. Now such a <hi>word</hi> there is in this ordinance
of God, the Preaching and the hearing of the Word: God
hath, in his counsell and purpose, set it apart, as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ordinary meanes for the beginning, increasing, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the worke of grace in the hearts of his chosen, and
so to be his <hi>power vnto saluation;</hi> and hath giuen it a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
efficacie for this end and purpose. Surely, if men did
but seriously consider, and certainely beleeue this, they
would wait and depend vpon it with more confidence,
with more assurance of successe.</p>
            <p>What is the maine reason why men make so little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it, and reape so little benefit by it.</p>
            <p>Amongst others, this I take to be the principall, they
doe not esteeme it, nor attend vpon it as Gods ordinance,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23793:16"/>
but as mans ordinance. If they come to the hearing of
the Word, they looke vpon it with a squint eye, they
come to it out of some base, by, sinister respect, and not
in obedience to God, to wait vpon him in the vse of his
ordinance: And this it is that hinders the fruit, the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of it,<note place="margin">Esa 53. 1.</note> that they doe not finde the <hi>arme of the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
to them in this ordinance.</hi> This day you haue heard it,
that <hi>Preaching,</hi> and so by necessary consequence, <hi>Hearing,</hi>
is the ordinance of God himselfe; and therefore bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to submit and to subiect your selues vnto it, to
come to it, to wait, attend, depend vpon it as his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>And secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> bee not offended with the simplicity of
this ordinance of God:<note place="margin">The Word; without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at the simplicity of it.</note> You see that our Preaching is
confined to one subiect, from which it may not swarue or
stray; <hi>viz. The VVord:</hi> Christ, and the Gospell of Christ;
we must <hi>know</hi> nothing else amongst you: Doe not you
desire to know or heare any thing else from vs: This is
the property of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> new borne Babe, one borne
againe of water and the spirit,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>to desire the sincere milke of
the Word:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Milke that is pure as it commeth
from the breast, without the mixture of any thing else
with it. If wee feed you with this sincere milke be not
you nauseated with it, take heed of loathing of it:
A sincere heart will desire after sincere milke: So much
longing after mixture in the Preaching of the Word, as a
man shall finde in his heart, so much insincerity is in it.
If we preach the bare Word to you, if we present Christ
vnto you, and naked Christ, without the cloathing of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
wisedome, the <hi>wisedome of words,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it; bee not you offended at it. Wee must Preach
Christ as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preached him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Christ crucified:</hi> Now
he was crucified naked; euen so must we preach him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you. This is the excellency of preaching, not to set
forth Christ vnder a veyle, as it was in the time of the
Law, but to lay him naked, that euery one may see him
with open face: So to present Christ vnto the eares and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23793:16"/>
hearts of the hearers,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe presented
him vnto his <hi>Galathians,</hi> to <hi>draw him out to the life,</hi> to <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
him before them:</hi> so to present him, as he was presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the eyes of the Iewes, when they saw him hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vpon the Crosse. Be not offended therefore with the
simplicity of Christ, and the doctrine of Christ, we must
Preach nothing but this Word.</p>

(or zealously affected) alwayes in a good thing:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Earnest. Gal. 4. 18</note> Sure I am,
you cannot be earnest, or zealous in a better cause than
this; It is Gods cause, it is the Churches cause, nay, it is
your owne cause, a cause that concerneth you neerely,
your soules cause, your welfare, your happinesse, your
life and liuelihood, your saluation depends vpon it: If e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
you will be earnest in any cause, be zealous in this.
<hi>Be earnest,</hi> 1. With your selues; 2. With others.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>With your selues,</hi> and that both to stirre vp your selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>to the duty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">With them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them. seues,</note> and <hi>in the duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, bee earnest to stirre vp your selues <hi>to</hi> the duty:
great need of earnestnesse in exciting and stirring vp your
selues this way.</p>
            <p>For 1. there is a naturall auersnesse in euery man, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
sets him off from the duty:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>To the duty.</hi> Reas. Why,</note> Flesh and blood finde no
taste, no relish in this ordinance of God, the Word pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preached: This is one of those <hi>things of God,</hi> of which
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>That the naturall man receiueth not,
discerneth not, vnderstandeth not:</hi> Great need therefore
to vse all holy meanes to quicken and to excite spirituall
appetite.</p>
            <p>And 2. Besides this naturall auersnesse, you shall finde
many pull-backes, many auocations, many lets and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
to draw you aside, to hinder you. Those in the
Gospell (which I named before) are too common; Farms,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23793:17"/>
Oxen, domesticall affayres, ciuill imployments. The
worlds businesse will steale away the time from Gods bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse:
Our bodies will seeke to starue our soules; our
particular callings will ingrosse all the time, that there
shall be little left for the generall.</p>
            <p>3. Besides these auocations, you must make account to
meet with many discouragements: It may be taunts and
reproaches from prophane and wicked men; it may bee
an ouerly countenance from friends and alliance: some
dust or other Satan will bee ready to stirre vp to blinde
your eyes withall, that you should not see to finde the
way to the house of God, to attend vpon this his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Great need of earnestnesse to excite and stirre vp
your selues, that you may ouerlook all these seeming lets,
impediments, discouragements.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, be earnest to stirre vp your selues <hi>in</hi> the duty:<note place="margin">In the duty.</note>
as there is a naturall auersnesse in vs to the duty, to keepe

to awaken our selues, that we may heare, and heare with

the nurse to giue downe the milk more freely, more

of this sucking of this sincere milk that hath made so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

and discouraged so many forward and hopefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
in the Church, if not to the stopping of their
mouthes, yet at the least to the damping of their spirits,
to the quelling of the life and power of their Ministery.
And 2. when they <hi>profit by</hi> the Word, grow and thriue
in grace by it. No such incouragement to an Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as when he seeth his tillage to prosper, no such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
vnto a nurse, as when shee seeth her childe
battle and thriue; it maketh them thinke no paines too
much: Whereas on the contrary, a barren soile, and a
starueling nursery kill the hearts of both. No incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vnto the Ministers of the Gospell like vnto this,
when they finde the worke to thriue and prosper in their
hands; when they see that the seed which they sow is not
cast away, when they see that their labor which <hi>is not vain
in the Lord,</hi> is not in <hi>vaine</hi> neither in the hearts and liues of
the hearers. This will make vs <hi>stand vp to the worke, watch</hi>
when we should sleepe; <hi>labour</hi> when we could be content
to be at ease and quiet; thinke no paines too much. Thus
stirre vp the Ministers of the Word, be instant and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

We shall haue need of a stocke, a store of grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs goe from flower to flower, (I speake the more

the right hand by an vnwarrantable running from Sermon

euery occasion which the Lord offereth in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Ministry of his Word, for the gathering of honey,
the gathering of grace to carry home to the hiue, to lay vp
in the heart, to make vp a stocke, a store against the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
against hard times, euill dayes, the dayes of triall, sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
death: We shall then finde all to be little enough, and
therefore whilest our Summer of health, and liberty, and
peace lasteth, vp and be doing; euery day be increasing of
the store; get something from euery Sermon, from this
which you haue this day heard; if you carry away nothing
else, yet carry away this resolution, that by the grace of
God inabling you, you will endeuour to make better vse of
all the publike means of grace which God shal hereafter in

this or in any other place afford vnto you. One flowre will
not load a Bee, neither will one Sermon, though neuer so
excellent, load the head and heart of a Christian to make
him rich in grace: And therefore be Instant, as Earnest, so
Diligent.</p>

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 2.</note>
to make your prouision for the weeke ensuing. Then
may you expect a speciall blessing from God in attending
vpon this holy exercise, because as the exercise it selfe is
Gods owne ordinance, so the day also is set apart by the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> like ordinance, for that exercise: 2. <hi>Be instant in season; viz.</hi>
At those <hi>speciall times and seasons</hi> when the Lord is pleased
to fit and to dispose you vnto the duty, after a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
There are certaine seasons, certaine <hi>gales of grace</hi> (as
we may call them) which the experience of euery Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
can informe vs of, when the Lord is pleased to breath
more kindly, more sweetly, more effectually vpon the heart
and soule, to the quickening and inlarging of it, than at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times: Sometimes when it is kindely humbled and
broken vnder some affliction, either outward or inward;
sometimes when it is warmed, and suppled, and melted
with the fresh apprehension of some new mercy, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a clearer glimpse of the light of Gods countenance,
a more full and rauishing apprehension of the vnspeakeable
loue and fauour of God in Iesus Christ: Sometimes againe,
it is after a secret and vnexpressable manner moued, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
and moulded to a more chearefull, a more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
performance of all dutie. Now these are <hi>seasons</hi> which
should be very pretious in the eyes of Christians, which
they should not let slip without a speciall improuement:
take hold of them, make vse of them, as for other duties, so
for this: When the wind blowes, whilst the Spirit of God
breatheth vpon the soule with a fresher gale in sweet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
inclinations, affections, resolutions, hoyse vp the
sayle, make vse of that aduantage, in hearing and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23793:20"/>
of the Word; to heare it with more frequency, with
more power, with more life, with more intention of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
<hi>Thus in season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. And lastly, <hi>Be instant out of season:</hi> And that</p>
            <p>1. At other times,<note place="margin">Vse 5.</note> beside the set, the ordinary time, set
apart by God himselfe;<note place="margin">Out of season three waies.</note> vpon the <hi>weeke day,</hi> as well as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sabbath day, when God shall offer a fit occasion.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
The word in it selfe is not, cannot bee out of season at any
time. The Word is the bread of life, shadowed out (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other mysteries) by the Shew-bread vnder the
Law, which signified not onely Christ himselfe, but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spirituall repast which the Church hath with, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and the meanes of their repast. Now bread, we
know, is neuer out of season: All other meats, almost,
haue their times and seasons when they are in season, out
of season, but bread is alwayes in season. The like we may
say of this ordinance of God, the Word preached, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
out of season: Some other ordinances of God there
are, as holy and religious fasting and feasting, humiliation
and thanksgiuing, they haue their times when they are in
season and out of season. But this exercise of Preaching of
the Word, it is alwayes in season, on the Sabbath day, on
the weeke day; as the Shew-bread stood vpon the Table in
the presence of God, vpon the weeke day as well as vpon
the Sabbath: No time vnseasonable to appeare before the
Lord in this ordinance of his.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Out of season;</hi> when it may seeme to flesh and blood <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to be something vnseasonable, and that in respect of other
occasions which may draw vs aside from it: If those occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
be not important, if they be such as may either bee
neglected altogether without any great preiudice to our
selues or others, or such as may be dispatched sooner, or
deferred longer; in this case let the lesser giue place to the
greater. If it be with some small detriment to thy selfe in
outward respects,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 24.</note> yet remember what <hi>Dauid</hi> saith to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunah;</hi>
he will not offer a sacrifice vnto God <hi>of that which
cost him nothing:</hi> Borrow a little from thy body, thy estate,
thy worldly imployments, to bestow it vpon thy soule:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23793:21"/>
Make bold a little with other occasions, to purchase some
time for God and his worship and seruice.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. And lastly, <hi>Be instant out of season,</hi> euen then when
thou findest thy selfe vnfit &amp; indisposed vnto the duty: yet
euen then when thou findest a present indisposition hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about thee, attend vpon this ordinance of God: It is a
<hi>Word of life,</hi> a quickening Word, as well to put life into the
soule, and to stirre it vp when it is dead, as to preserue and
increase it: It is an Anabaptisticall frenzie that Christians
should neuer attend vpon this or any other duty, but when
the spirit moueth them: Wee often see ships riding a long
time in a road stead, when they might bee in the hauen;
wherefore is it? that they may bee in the winds way (as
we say) to take the first oportunity that shall bee offered:
Euen thus should Christians anchor, as it were, in the
house of God, euen then when they seeme to be becalmed,
that they cannot stirre and moue themselues about holy
duties as they were wont to doe, yet euen then ride it out,
wait vpon God in the vse of this ordinance: though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for the present, bemoane and bewayle thy vnfitnesse,
looke vp vnto God for life, and seeke it from him in thy
attendance vpon this ordinance. This is Gods owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
(as for vs to Preach) so for you to <hi>Heare the Word, to
be instant in season, out of season.</hi>
