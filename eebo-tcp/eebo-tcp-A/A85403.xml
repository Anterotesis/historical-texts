         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

very ſparingly, then diſcourſeth, the particulars of his worth: Upon my entrance hereinto, I declared my ſelf under a ſolemn reſolution (not much ſhort of a vow) not to offend the weakeſt of the living, by commending, no not the ſtrongeſt of the dead, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially not in the Pulpit, not at ſuch a time, when their higheſt concernments are in hand, and they moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credly engaged to attend them with all their might and ſtrength. Only the principal ſubject of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>Mercy,</hi> was indeed not the leaſt of his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. His example herein will bleſs you, if you follow it, but will riſe up in judgement againſt you, if you turn your backs upon it. His other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well moral as intellectual, were very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, both for kind, and degree. He was Religious, not of cuſtome, or of courſe, but of conſcience, nobly diſdaining to proſtitute his judgement to any circumforaneous, or vulgar opinion in matters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining unto God, ſimply upon the credit, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, of other mens Faith; and withal ſtudiouſly ſcrupulous and tender of receiving any Notion or Tenent whatſoever, into his Belief, until he had cauſed it to paſs through the fire of a diſtrict examination and enquiry, and found that it would not burn. Whilſt the health and ſtrength of his body was able to bear the weight of exerciſes of Devotion, he maintained a conſtant and cloſe trade of communion with God: and in the time of his laſt weakneſs, a few weeks before his change, amongſt other ſavoury Diſcourſe, he bemoaned himſelf, that ſince the prevailing of his diſtemper upon him, he was deprived of his heart-breaking opportunities with God. His heart was up very high in deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge of the Truth, and this in the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb facs="tcp:114809:3"/>
Queſtions controverted between men of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt judgements in theſe days. Books of Divinity that were any thing judiciouſly or accurately written, his delight was, at his ſpare hours.</p>

            <p>He put no difference between perſons, either for their concurrence with him, or diſſent from him, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of opinion, or form of worſhip. But that which commended any perſon unto him, was his own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his integrity, and goodneſs of heart towards God. Some to whom his heart ſtood very cloſe in affection, whilſt they were yet ſound in the Faith touching Infant-Baptiſm, found no change in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects towards them, after their judgements had warp'd the contrary way, no not after they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed all Chriſtian communion with him in a Church way. His ſignal Integrity, Juſtneſs, and Clearneſs in dealings, as well in the adminiſtration of the Truſt committed unto him, as in his private occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are freely teſtified by all that had to do with him in either kind, with a <hi>nemine contradicen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,</hi> (as far as I have heard.) The Greatneſs (which ſome call Goodneſs) of his Eſtate, made no breach at all upon the goodneſs of his diſpoſition in his converſation: He obſerved no diſtance, made between himſelf, and the meaneſt of his Brethren, by his abundance; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons even of loweſt degree, by the mediation of his affableneſs and humility, found acceſs unto him upon all their occaſions; and few, if any, came from him diſcontented. His carriage was compoſed and grave, yet without affectation: His Diſcourſe, ſeaſonable
<pb facs="tcp:114809:4"/>
and ſavoury, without offence. His native temper ſeemed to incline him to much reſervedneſs: but by judgement and conſcience he reduced that which was leſs deſireable, or leſs uſeful, in this inclination. His Habit and Garb every ways comly, ſutable rather to his profeſſion, then eſtate. Whatever ſavoured of oſtentation or vanity, he left to be taken up by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of looſer and lighter ſpirits. The full cup, which God gave unto him, he carried with an even and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hand, without ſpilling: yet freely gave to every man that was a thirſt, and came in his way, to drink.</p>
            <p>His intellectual endowments were given him by the largeſt meaſure, which God in theſe days is wont to mete unto men. What <hi>Ethan,</hi> or <hi>Heman, Chalcol,</hi> or <hi>Darda,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 King. 4. 31.</note> were in their generation, the like, or not much unlike, was he in his. His underſtanding was large, and very comprehenſive: His apprehenſion quick and piercing: his judgement ſolid and mature, his memory, faſt and faithful; his elocution, or ſpeech, diſtinct and clear, elegant, and fluent enough, yet not luxuriant or pedantick. He was more then of ordinary abilities to argue the moſt thorny and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe points in Divinity; ready of Diſcerning, where the quick of any controverſie, or matter in debate lay: very expert he was in the word of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, able to draw waters of life out of ſuch Wells of ſalvation, from whence many men of good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and parts of Learning, had not wherewith to draw, becauſe of the depth of them. He had a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular dexterity to make the rough things of buſineſs, ſmooth, to turn the inſides of matters, outward, to untie knots, and diſ-intangle intricacies, in all manner of affairs that were brought to him. I ſcarce know
<pb facs="tcp:114809:4"/>
any man amongſt thoſe he hath left behind him, of like felicity with him of giving counſel and advice, in caſes of difficulty, and doubtful conſideration.</p>
            <p>In ſum, as well for parts of Nature, as of Grace, he was an highly accompliſht man, adorned and ſet forth by God, for a pattern, as for others, ſo for you (more neerly related to him) more eſpecially. I truſt his life though he be dead, ſhall ſpeak unto you, whilſt yours continues, and help to form and faſhion you into the ſame image of Chriſtian worth and deſireableneſs with him. The beſt way to make your ſelves as little loſers as may be by his death, is to live by the pattern of his life, and to preſerve the memory of all that was exemplary in him, not ſo much for ſtory, or diſcourſe, as for a ſpur to a conſcientious imitation. Your day is coming, as his is lately paſt: yet a little while, and you will all overtake him in the duſt. If in the mean time your hearts through the Grace of God, will ſerve you ſo to live, as that you may be counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſtand at the ſame hand of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with him in the great day, you and he ſhall never part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany more.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>GOod Reader,</hi> I was bound with a threefold cord of ingagement to publiſh the Sermon in thy hand. Firſt, the memory of my dear friend deceaſed, at whoſe Funerals it was preached, pleaded the law of friendſhip, and by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hereof demanded, either this, or ſomewhat more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentous (if any ſuch thing had been within my reach) at my hand. Secondly the ſolicitations of ſome of his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and friends in the name of many more for the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, were too conſiderable to be neglected, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by me, yea or by a perſon of greater breadth in the world then I. Laſtly, the miſunderſtanding (as I hear) of ſome things by ſome perſons, preſent at the delivery, requires a more ſteady repreſentation of what was ſpoken, to make their crooked things ſtreight.</p>
            <p>The vulgar vote and report of the outward eſtate of my worthy friend (now in an incapacity himſelf to rectifie mens apprehenſions in any thing relating to him) hath been ſomewhat injurious unto the preciouſneſſe of his memory, and this even amongſt thoſe, who know ground enough wherefore to honour him, and onely ſuppoſe a ground wherefore they ſhould honour him leſſe. The common eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and diſcourſe of his eſtate, ſurmounting a third part, and not a little more, the reality and truth of it can ſeth the proportion of his bequeſts to appear leſſe and ſo leſſe honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and lovely in the eyes of ſome, the the truth of all things known and conſidered, reaſon repreſenteth them. A twelfth, or there abouts ſequeſtred by will out of an eſtate, where there is a wife; and ſeveral children to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is no proportion of disparagement either to the wiſdom,
<pb facs="tcp:114809:5"/>
or piety, or bounty of any man; eſpecially, where a life full of works of mercy hath gone before. When thoſe that are <hi>rich in this world,</hi> are charged by God to be <hi>rich in good works,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17, 18.</note> the charge (questionleſſe) reſpecteth rather the time of the lives, then of the deaths, of ſuch men. And when as God himſelf hath contented himſelf with preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in general, as that rich men <hi>do good, be ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate, be rich in good works,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note> for men to undertake to preſcribe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, is a kind of pretending to be wiſe above that which is written. However, I wiſh, rather then expect, that they who complain that <hi>Grantham</hi> ſteeple ſtands awry, would ſet up a ſtreighter by it, and fear that when themſelves ſhall come to the triall, they will juſtifie the truth of the <hi>Greek</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <gap reason="foreign">

matter, or ſubſtance of it; for as for the term or word it ſelf, I purpoſely declined it to prevent miſtakes in thoſe that might be weak, not having then either time or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to open or handle the difference between the two juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.

            <p>I have added, altered, or inſerted very little, in ſo much of the Sermon inſuing, as I had time to deliver, when it was preached.

            <p>When I mention this, or any other holy diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of like nature with it, I ſtill inſert theſe, or the

like words, <hi>with the fruits thereof,</hi> partly becauſe it is the familiar dialect of the Scripture, under words properly ſignifying ſome inward affection, or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, to comprehend, together with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the actings or effects proper to it, as the word, <hi>Faith,</hi> frequently importeth, together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grace, or principle of Faith in the heart, the proper fruits of it alſo, which we commonly call, good works, or an holy converſation (Inſtances of this kind of Scripture-language, beſides that menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, there are without number, but we haſten) partly alſo, becauſe that which is here aſcribed to this heavenly diſpoſition of <hi>mercy,</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>it rejoyceth againſt judgement</hi> (of which preſently) enforceth us ſo to interpret and underſtand it [<hi>viz.</hi> as ſignifying with the inward affection of <hi>mercy,</hi> the outward fruits or works of <hi>mercy</hi>] according to that true and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary rule in Logick, <hi>Subject a talia ſunt, qualia à prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatis ſuis eſſe permittuntur; i.</hi> Subjects in propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt be ſo underſtood, as their predicates, or that which is ſaid of them in the ſaid propoſition, will permit and bear. Now we ſhall (God aſſiſting, and the time not preventing) in the proceſs of our Diſcourſe, ſhew, that it is not meerly and barely the inward affection of mercy, that is able to raiſe this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effect of <hi>rejoycing againſt judgement,</hi> but the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſeconded, aided, and ſtrengthned by her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy actings, and practical exertions of her ſelf; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what our Apoſtle teacheth us in the very next verſe (with ſeveral verſes following) concerning Faith: <hi>Can Faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſave a man?</hi> meaning, that it is contrary to all principles, as well of Reaſon as Religion, to imagine that an empty and bare Faith, not attended with ſuch works, which are comly or

meet for Faith to bear, at leaſt having time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to bring forth in this kind, ſhould ever advance or lift up the creature to ſuch an eſtate of bleſſedneſs and glory, as ſalvation importeth. For to this purpoſe he explaineth himſelf, verſ. 17. <hi>Even ſo Faith, if it hath not works, is dead <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of it ſelf [is dead, i.</hi> uſeleſs and unprofitable, as dead things are, to thoſe who have it, eſpecially in reſpect of ſuch great and high productions, or attainments, as <hi>Salvation</hi>] In ſuch a ſenſe as this, <hi>mercy</hi> alſo, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>without works,</hi> may be ſaid to <hi>be dead,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no ways able to yeild ſuch rich and pleaſant fruit, as <hi>rejoycing againſt judgement.</hi> So then, <hi>mercy rejoyceth againſt judgement,</hi> i. <hi>Mercy,</hi> with her children, the tree of mercy well laden with fruit growing on it, thus <hi>rejoyceth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only this is further to be conſidered, that when the Apoſtle attributes by way of honour and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, unto mercy, this <hi>rejoycing againſt judgement,</hi> he is not to be underſtood to ſpeak of <hi>mercy</hi> ſimply, or of <hi>mercy</hi> in any faint or inferior degree, though ſeconded with works proportionable, or of ſuch a kind of <hi>mercy,</hi> which is over-ſhadowed and (as it were) ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended, or over-awed by covetouſneſs, nor of a pinching, or penurious kind of <hi>mercy,</hi> which is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in worldly, covetous, yea and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men (as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in our Saviours days, were wont to give almes as it were of courſe, and yet were covetous, and ravening wolves, and ſome men will give a little to ſtop the mouths of their conſciences, hoping hereby to keep poſſeſſion of all the reſt with the more peace) but of <hi>mercy</hi> in ſome degree of her exaltation, of <hi>mercy,</hi> which hath her great enemies, covetouſneſs, and hard-heartedneſs, penuriouſneſs,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114809:11"/>
and narrow-heartedneſs, &amp;c. under her feet. It is the frequent manner of the Scripture to uſe words of a general ſignification, and which ordinarily ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ſpecies or kinds of things (indefinitely) in an emphatical ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for that which excelleth, and is eminently conſiderable in its kind. In the laſt verſe of the fourth chapter of this Epiſtle, it is ſaid; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is</hi> [or, there is] <hi>ſin [i</hi> ſin of a great demerit, or of high provocation in the ſight of God] For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is <hi>ſin</hi> to men [ſimply, or in ſome degree] not to do good, whether they know to do it, or no; as is evident from our Saviours deciſion of the caſe, Luk. 12. 48. So when God diſcourſeth with <hi>Job</hi> about that kind of creature, which we call, the <hi>Horſe</hi> (Job 39. 19.) <hi>Haſt thou given the HORSE ſtrength? Haſt thou clothed his neck with thunder? The glory of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils is terrible, &amp;c.</hi> (with much more of like import) by the word, <hi>Horſe,</hi> here, he doth not mean any kind of <hi>Horſe,</hi> or every thing that may properly or truly enough in ordinary language be termed, an <hi>Horſe:</hi> the greateſt part of <hi>Horſes</hi> have neither part nor fellowſhip in this deſcription: but he ſpeaks of an <hi>Horſe</hi> that is high of mettle, ſtrong of limbs, full of courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In like manner, when the Apoſtle commends love, or charity. 1 Cor. 13. by that great variety of the ſignal effects of it here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that it <hi>behaveth not it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,</hi> &amp;c. he doth not by <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> mean, this Grace in any inferiour, weak, or low degree, but in her ſtrength, and ſome conſiderable advance in the ſoul. Other inſtances of this kind the Sc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ſpeaking thus gloriouſly of <hi>mercy,</hi> as that it <hi>rejoyceth againſt judgement,</hi> we muſt conceive him to ſpeak of it, nor ſimply, or abſolutely, as it is ſuch a Grace, or holy affection, in reſpect of the kind of it, but (as hath been already ſaid) as it is ſuch in degree alſo, and in ſome conſiderable elevation in the ſoul. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, rejoycingly gloryeth over, or againſt, <hi>judgement.</hi> It is ſomwhat a like expreſſion (for ſenſe, and import) with that <hi>Job 5. 22. At deſtruction and famine thou ſhalt laugh,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt be confident, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in take great contentment, that theſe ſhall not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or hurt thee, as they are like to do the generality of men. Or like that, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 8. (ſpoken in the name of the Church of the Jews to her enemy) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not againſt me, O mine enemy; i.</hi> Pleaſe not thy ſelf, take no ſuch contentment in my preſent afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and low condition, as if I were never like to be again in a capacity of quelling thy pride, or avenging my ſelf on thee; as it follows, <hi>when I fall, I ſhall ariſe;</hi> meaning, that ſhe ſhould get up again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſtrength to make her part good with her. So when it is ſaid, <hi>mercy rejoyceth againſt judgement,</hi> the meaning is, that <hi>mercy</hi> [ſo underſtood as was lately opened] qualifieth, ſtrengthneth, enableth the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in whom it is found, to be confidently ſecure, that he ſhall receive no prejudice or hurt by the judgement of God, by that judgement, which God ſhall paſs upon the world in the great day, and under which the greateſt part of the world will fall, and never riſe more. There is ſcarce any thing more uſual in the Scripture, then to aſcribe that to the quality or form, which properly belongeth to the ſubject qualified
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114809:12"/>
with it, or (which is much the ſame) to put the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract for the concrete. As in thoſe paſſages lately mentioned, <hi>Charity beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,</hi> &amp;c. the meaning clearly is, that <hi>charitable</hi> perſons, or men and women richly endued with <hi>charity,</hi> do all theſe things by vertue of that excellent endowment; Thus Rom. 11. 7. <hi>The Election hath obtained it [i.</hi> all thoſe, whether men or women, who believe, and hereupon, by vertue of the eternal Decree of God in that behalf, are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from others, and made an <hi>Elect</hi> or choice ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of perſons unto him, <hi>have obtained it,</hi> meaning righteouſneſs or juſtification.] Thus alſo ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand (and haply not amiſs) that, Rom. 10. 6. <hi>But the righteouſneſs which is of Faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe: Say not in thy heart, who ſhall aſcend,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The righteouſneſs which is of Faith, i.</hi> Perſons juſtified by <hi>Faith,</hi> by means of this their <hi>Faith,</hi> are wont to encourage and ſpeak unto men, thus: <hi>Say not in thy heart, who &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, the true and entire ſenſe and import of the words before us, riſeth thus: Merciful men, men whoſe hearts and hands are much exerciſed in doing of good, in ſhewing <hi>mercy,</hi> by means of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or conſciouſneſs of this God-like diſpoſition in themſelves, and the regular actings of it, are, or lightly cannot but be, full of a joyful and bleſſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that they ſhall ſtand in the great judgement of the world, and find favour and acceptance in the eyes of the Judge, when all unmerciful, covetous, and hard-hearted wretches ſhall fall under it, and be ground to powder by it. If there be any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requiſite for the due underſtanding of the words, notice may be given of it upon occaſion, in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:114809:12"/>The only point of Doctrine that we ſhall commend unto your <hi>Christian</hi> attention from the words (as they have been opened) is this:</p>
            <p>A rich and bleſſed aſſurance of ſalvation is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> and proper reſult, or fruit, of much <hi>mercy.</hi> Or if you pleaſe, the Doctrine may be conceived in this, or the like, tenour of words (agreeing, in ſubſtance, with the former) A perſon rich in works of <hi>mercy,</hi> is, or readily may be, joyfully ſecure, and this upon good ground, from periſhing, or that he ſhall not periſh, in the condemnation of the world.</p>
            <p>Firſt, (to prevent miſtakes, if it may b<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> we ſhall a little further explain the Doctrine unto you, in ſome particulars. 2. We ſhall conſult the Scriptures for our better eſtabliſhment in the Truth of it. 3. We ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate the truth of it, from its proper grounds and principles. 4. And laſtly, (the time permitting) we ſhall, as God ſhall enable, joyn the ſpirit of the Doctrine, and your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſomwhat cloſer together, in a way of Uſe and Application.</p>
            <p>For the firſt; there are 3. particulars, wherein the Doctrine requires ſome explication.</p>
            <p>1. It is not to be underſtood, as if it entituled rich men only to that glorious ſecurity from condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which it ſpeaks, or as if they alone were in a condition to perform works of mercy, and men that are poor and low in the world, excluded from all part and fellowſhip in that happy buſineſs. For certainly, even the pooreſt of men and women are capable of <hi>ſhewing mercy,</hi> as well as the rich, though not in all the ſame reſpects. They may <hi>ſhew mercy,</hi> and this not only one to another, but even unto rich men themſelves, as <hi>viz.</hi> by commiſerating and pittying
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114809:13"/>
them in reſpect of their ſlippery and moſt dangerous ſtanding by means of their riches (of which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gives notice in the Goſpel<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 19. 23, 24. Mark 10. 23, 24.</note>) and ſo by praying unto God for them, that he will keep their foot from being taken in the ſnare of this worlds abundance; and again, by ſuffering them to enjoy their wealth, not only without any impeachment or impairing of it by them, but without their having an evil eye upon it, without envying or repining, that they ride upon horſes, when as themſelves go on foot; and yet further by not ſuffering, as far as lyeth in them, any perſon whatſoever unrighteouſly to touch any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is theirs; by <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſtifying their good will towards them, in endeavouring to ſtop all hard ſayings, and ſiniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports concerning them, as of covetouſneſs, pride, hardneſs, &amp;c. So alſo by a ready, free, diligent and faithful ſerving them in all ſuch occaſions, wherein at any time they ſhall ſtand in need of their help, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. For rich men are not priviledged by their riches againſt all kind of miſeries, nor againſt all wants, indigencies, or neceſſities: Yea they have their dependencies upon the poorer ſort of men, as well as theſe have theirs upon them; and theſe (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) if things were duely eſtimated, as many, and as Great: <hi>The King himſelf</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) is ſerved by the field</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Eccl. 5. 9.</note>; [or as the Hebrew hath it, is ſervant to the field] <hi>viz.</hi> the care and labor of the poor Husbandman intervening: and in ſuch a ſenſe as this, in which he is, or may be ſaid, to be a ſervant to the field, he may be alſo ſaid to be a ſervant to the Husbandman. The Philoſopher likewiſe in his Fable of the Lyon and the Mouſe, very emphatically taught the grand ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity which the Greateſt of men may ſometimes have of the help of the meaneſt, where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he fancieth, the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114809:13"/>
Lyon being taken, intangled, and held faſt, in the toile or net of the Hunter; that the Mouſe upon the Lyons roaring, came and with her little teeth gnawed the Net inſunder, until way was made for the Lyons eſcape. So then the pooreſt ſort of men, that are but able to give a Cup of cold water, or to ſpeak a good word of a man, or to conceive a prayer for him, or to forgive injuries, or to miniſter with the hand to any mans outward occaoſins, when deſired, or the like, may be mreciful to what degree they pleaſe in their way, and conſequently are as capable of that high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, a glorious ſecuritie from condemnation, as rich men themſelves. This in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>2. When the Doctrine affirmeth, that a merciful frame of heart is a proper means to ſecure it, againſt condemnation, and the fear of it, the meaning is not (nor is it implyed) that all perſons who are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably and <hi>Chriſtianly</hi> mercifull, do actually, or at all times injoy themſelves in this bleſſed ſecuritie. Some may not ſo throughly underſtand, either the nature of <hi>Mercy,</hi> or the nature of God ſo ſympathizing with it, or may forget at preſent to compare the one with the other, or neglect to conſider how God hath poured out himſelf in promiſes of grace and <hi>mercy</hi> unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this Heavenly character. Therefore all the Doctrine intends (as to this point) is, That perſons ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally merciful, or full of goodne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, are by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this gracious diſpoſition worthily acted, either are in the actual poſſeſſion of that Heavenly ſecurity we ſpeak of, or at leaſt in a rich and regular capacity to be argued, either by themſelves, or others, into it, or, that they are not far from it. This is another particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to be taken into conſideration for a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:114809:14"/>3. (And laſtly) when it attributeth unto <hi>mercy</hi> (in the ſence declared) a joyful exemption from fear of judgment or condemnation, it doth not ſpeak of a looſe, prodigal, or vain glorious diſpoſition, which (haply) in ſome perſon may affect the name of, <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> becauſe it effectually inclines them, as <hi>Mercy</hi> is wont to incline her children, to part with their money, or other good things, freely enough unto others, amongſt whom ſome that are indigent and ſtand in need, may ſometimes (it is like) be found. Such a principle or diſpoſition as this; deſerveth not the name of <hi>Mercy,</hi> becauſe a man or woman may be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it without any compaſſionate ſenſe at all of the miſeries or neceſſities of thoſe, who are relieved by them. Nor doth the Doctrine, by <hi>Mercy,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any affection of that name, wherewith ſome, both men and women, are (as it were) prevented, not knowing how, or by what means, they became thus <hi>merciful,</hi> or compaſſionate, as our Saviour ſpeaketh of ſome that are <hi>Eunuches from their Mothers womb,</hi> (as of others, who make themſelves ſuch for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.) For though this kind of <hi>mercy</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and proceedeth from God, as the Author of Nature, yet it is not able to create that Heaven of ſecurity in the heart and ſoul of a man, unto which the Doctrine intituleth that <hi>mercy,</hi> of which it ſpeaks.<note place="margin">What mercy it is, of which the Text and Doctrine ſpeaks.</note> This <hi>Mercy</hi> then importeth an affection raiſed in the ſoul of a man or woman by Goſpel conſideration (the holy Ghoſt over-ſhaddowing or aſſiſting thoſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, or that exerciſe of the mind and conſcience, by which it is raiſed) whereby they are effectually inclined and provoked to miniſter unto the neceſſities of thoſe that ſtand in need, when they have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, according to the means which God hath touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouchſafed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114809:14"/>
unto them for their relief. This (with what brevity we could) for the explication of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>For the truth of it, ſo underſtood, as hath been declared, although that one text of Scripture, upon which it hath been built, be of ſufficient evidence and authority to ſecure it unto your judgments and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, yet let us give you meaſure heaped up, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon ſome others for the ſtrengthening and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of this ſecurity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſhall not be afraid</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> ſpeaking of the<note place="margin">Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of the Doctrine.</note> man that is <hi>gracious, and full of compaſſion and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> Pſal. 112. 4.) ſuch a man (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall not be afraid of evil tidings</hi> (he means, any, or all ſuch <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> which import evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> which are of a ſadding, or terrifying nature unto the generality of men) <hi>His heart is fixed trusting in the Lord. His heart is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: he ſhall not be afraid, till he ſee his deſire upon his enemies:</hi> The tidings of the day of judgment, when far the greateſt part of the world ſhall be ſent quick to Hell, never to return thence to the days of eternity, are tidings of the greateſt evil to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men and women, that can be, yet he that is <hi>Gracious [i. e.</hi> apt to do good without any carnal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or inducement thereunto] <hi>and full of compaſſion,</hi> ſhall not be aſtonyed, or ſtruck with fear at theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, though ſo formidably evil (as hath been ſaid) as appears by that which followeth: <hi>His heart is fixed, his heart is eſtabliſhed, truſting in the Lord;</hi> meaning, that his <hi>truſting</hi> in God, is that which <hi>fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſheth his heart,</hi> ſo that it is not, it cannot be ſhaken, or toſſed up and down within him with thoſe ſtorms and tempeſts and whirlwinds of fear, which are the rending, and tearing, and tormenting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114809:15"/>
of other mens. A feather, though it be a very weak and light thing, and hath nothing in it ſelf to balaſt it, or wherewith to reſiſt the leaſt puff or whiff of wind, yet if it be cloſe and faſt knit or bound to a great Rock, it pertakes of the ſtability and firmneſs of this Rock, and can no more be ſhaken, or removed, then the Rock it ſelf. In like manner, a man made of fleſh and blood, a creature very contemptible in his own ſtrength, apt to be ſhaken and ſhattered in pieces with ſad expectations and fears of what it may ſuffer from time to time, yet being cloſe united unto God, and cleaving faſt to him in truſt and dependance becomes intereſſed in the ſecurity and unmoveable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God himſelf. This happy poſture or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul, the Apoſtle calleth a being <hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 6. 10.</note>; meaning, that good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and true beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ought to be as ſecure, as dreadleſs and fearleſs of evil, notwithſtanding their own weakneſs, as if they were themſelves inveſted with the glorious omnipotencie, or <hi>power of the might</hi> of God, and had the ſame means for their preſervation and ſafety in their own hands, which now are in his. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> further diſplaying the ſecurity or fearleſs poſture of his <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>compaſſionate</hi> man) <hi>until he ſee his deſire upon his enemies,</hi> i. e. until he ſhall ſee all thoſe, whether perſons or things, from whence he may be conceived to be in danger of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, ſo broken, ſcattered, and confounded, that he ſhall fully know himſelf to be out of all danger offuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from them; meaning, that he ſhould never be <hi>afraid:</hi> For he that is without fear until he ſee his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies utterly deſtroyed, certainly will not be afraid afterwards. Now the great and moſt formidable
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114809:15"/>
enemies of the <hi>Gracious</hi> and <hi>Compaſſionate</hi> man, as he is a man, are Death, and Hell [or the Grave] with their ſad and diſmal retinue, both <hi>a parte <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Therefore the man now before us, <hi>Gracious, and full of Compaſſion ſhall not be afraid, [i.</hi> ſhall enjoy himſelf in a bleſſed tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and ſecurity of mind] <hi>until he ſhall ſee his deſire on them [i.</hi> until he ſhall ſee both Death and Hell, with all their train, caſt into the Lake of fire, Rev. 20. 14.] after which he ſhall apparantly be out of all danger of being hurt by them.

               </gap>n this qualification, <hi>full of Compaſſion,</hi> in characterizing ſuch a perſon, whoſe heart ſhould be fixed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by truſting in the Lord, and conſequently, who ſhould not <hi>be afraid,</hi> &amp;c. and why a Perſon of this character ſhould <hi>trust in the Lord,</hi> and ſo be <hi>eſtabliſhed,</hi> rather then any other man, ſhall be ſhewed unto you when we come to open the Ground and Reaſon of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>In the mean time give me your patience to add a brief paſſage or two out of the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> for your further ſatisfaction in the truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith this Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, <hi>c. 3. 14.) that we have paſsed from Death to Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love the Brethren.</hi> That he ſpeaks here in a more particular manner of <hi>love</hi> to the poor <hi>Brethren,</hi> which uttereth it ſelf after the manner of goodneſs, mercy, and compaſſion, appears from the ſequel of the context, and more eſpecially from verſ. 17. <hi>But who ſo hath this worlds goods, and ſeeth his Brother have need, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> Now then the Apoſtle (as ye heard) ſpeaking thus; <hi>We know that we have paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:114809:16"/>
his meaning is, that all they who <hi>love the Brethren</hi> (in the ſenſe ſpecified) <hi>i.</hi> expreſs themſelves in a way of kindneſs and mercy to ſuch of the <hi>Brethren</hi> who are poor, and ſtand in need of their help, <hi>know</hi> hereby, <hi>i.</hi> may readily or eaſily <hi>know</hi> hereby, have a pregnant ground on which to be built up in this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed confidence or aſſurance, that they have <hi>paſſed from Death to Life,</hi> that the bitterneſs of the wrath, and vengeance which is to come, is already paſſed as to them, and that condemnation ſhall not be their portion.</p>
            <p>The 17, and 18. verſes of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, are confederate in Notion and Import, with the now-opened paſſage, and give teſtimony to the ſame Truth. In the former, <hi>Herein</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) is our love</hi> [or, love with us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, this is a ſigne, an argument, that our <hi>love</hi> hath attained ſome meaſure, or degree, of <hi>perfection,</hi> and hath acted its part well, when it hath raiſed us to a <hi>boldneſs,</hi> or fearleſneſs of ſpirit, <hi>in the day [i.</hi> againſt the day] of <hi>the judgement</hi> of the world. Or thus, the conſideration of this great priviledge, or fruit of our <hi>love,</hi> when it ſhall be grown to any ſtrength or perfection, is a worthy motive unto us to perfect it, or to haſten us to the perfecting of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that by it <hi>we ſhall</hi> have <hi>boldneſs</hi> [or, liberty of face, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>in the day of judgement.</hi> Now they, who at preſent know they ſhall have <hi>boldneſs in the day of judgement,</hi> muſt needs have, even at preſent, a large firſt fruits of that Harveſt. It follows: <hi>becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world.</hi> This clauſe ſeems to contain a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or ground of the former aſſertion, and to import
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114809:16"/>
that our being found <hi>in this world</hi> by means of our love perfected, like unto God, or unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who fils the world with the fruits of his love, goodneſs and mercy, is a pregnant reaſon, why we ſhould even at preſent, promiſe unto our ſelves boldneſs in the day of judgement, in as much as there is not the leaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for any jealouſie or fear, that God ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe in the day of judgment, who have been like unto himſelf in works of love, goodneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie (works wherein himſelf moſt delighteth) and this in a place, where it is a matter of greateſt difficulty and disadvantage for men to reſemble him in theſe, <hi>viz. this</hi> preſent <hi>world,</hi> where there are ſo few examples leading, or incouragements inducing, unto ſuch things; yea and very many things greatly diſcouraging from them.</p>
            <p>The Tenor of the latter of the two verſes pointed at, is, <hi>There is no fear in love.</hi> He ſpeaks of love made <hi>perfect</hi> (as appears both from the former verſe, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from the clauſe immediately following:) <hi>In this love</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>there is no fear,</hi> i. e. with this <hi>love,</hi> or where this <hi>love</hi> is, <hi>there is no fear [viz.</hi> of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rejection by God:] The reaſon follows, by way of <hi>Antitheſis; but perfect love,</hi> i. e. becauſe love when grown to any good degree of perfection, <hi>caſteth out</hi> [ſuch] <hi>fear</hi> out of the ſame heart with it. And the reaſon (ſaith he) why <hi>love</hi> carrieth this oppoſition in it unto fear (as <hi>viz.</hi> to eject and caſt it out of the ſoul) is <hi>becauſe fear hath puniſhment,</hi> or torment, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the nature of love, goodneſs and mercy, is ſo rich, ſweet and God-like, that it will endure nothing that is afflicting, or tormenting, neither in others as far as it is able to relieve them; but eſpecially not, in its own ſubject, in the ſame perſon, where it ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideth.

yea goodneſs it ſelf, and ſo acknowledged by all men, ſhould abandon his chitdren, who are are really and truly, though ſpiritually, deſcended from him, and who avouch their Heavenly parentage in the ſight of the world, by doing the works of their great Father, that he (I ſay) ſhould abandon ſuch children as theſe unto perdition, unto the vengeance of eternal fire.<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon of the Doctrine is: when a mans heart is enlarged in mercy, kindneſs and love to thoſe that ſtand in need, ſo that doing of good unto ſuch, is a thing connatural and pleaſing to him, comporting with his <hi>Genius</hi> and diſpoſition, he is in an advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious poſture hereby to take impreſſions of a belief, that like gracious and merciful diſpoſitions are to be found in others alſo; according to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; <hi>charity</hi> or love,—<hi>beleeveth all things, hopeth all things</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 7</note> [<hi>i. e.</hi> effectually inclineth, or diſpoſeth the perſons qualified with it, to beleeve and hope the beſt concerning others, upon any competent and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds for either, and where reaſons are not pregnant or convincing of the contrary] Eſpecially a man by means of ſuch a frame and temper of his own heart and ſpirit, as that we ſpeak of, is richly prepared to entertain the report of the kindneſs and mercy, of the goodneſs and love of God, in the Goſpel. For he that is conſcious to himſelf, that he himſelf is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and mercifully inclined, can freely pardon thoſe that have injured or offended him, can freely miniſter unto the neceſſities of thoſe that ſtand in need, muſt of neceſſity beleeve that God is above him in all theſe excellencies, more gracious, more merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which we know is the tenor and ſubſtance of the Goſpel) or elſe make himſelf, if not ſuperior, yet equal unto God, in thoſe things, which are his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114809:18"/>
glory in the eyes of his creature. Now this the conſcience of every man and woman naturally trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and abhors to do. Therefore he that is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted and open handed, in mercy, kindneſs and goodneſs unto men, hath ſpace and roomth (as it were) within him to receive and give entertainment unto that great Salvation, which the Goſpel brings and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers unto the world, together with all the Heavenly retinue of the grace, love, goodneſs, mercy and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, which accompany it: all which being received into the ſoul by Faith, joyn hand in hand to ſecure him againſt condemnation. Whereas men and women of narrow and ſcant hearts, wherein there is ſtowage and roomth onely for themſelves and their own worldly concernments, lie under a moſt ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, next to an incapacity, to embrace the glad tidings of the Goſpel, in their due compaſs and extent, without which they will hardly reach to the effectual allaying and quelling of their fears of wrath and condemnation for their ſins. It is a piece of the Prayer which <hi>Paul</hi> made for the <hi>Epheſians, that being rooted and grounded in love [i. e.</hi> being upon pregnant, weighty, and mature conſiderations and grounds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved againſt all diſſwaſives and temptations to the contrary, to perſevere in <hi>love,</hi> and in the exerciſe of it, they might by the opportunity and help of ſuch a frame of heart, <hi>be able to comprehend with all Saints, [i. e.</hi> to conceive and underſtand, with a commenſurable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of apprehenſion and faith, as near as may be, wherein I pray that all the Saints may be partakers likewiſe with you] <hi>what is the breadth and length, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">a <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. 18.</note> 
               <hi>depth, and height, and to know the love of Chriſt, that paſſeth knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. To <hi>know the love of Chriſt</hi> in all the dimenſions of it here named, to know it (I mean)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114809:19"/>
as men may, and ought to know it (though otherwiſe in the full compaſs of it, it is above the knowledge and belief of men) but I ſay to know it, as men may know it, is ſufficient to reſcue their hearts and conſciences out of the hand of all fear of judgement or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for ſin. Now then the Apoſtle in the paſſage yet before us, clearly ſuppoſeth. 1. That perſons <hi>rooted and grounded in love</hi> (in the ſenſe declared) are in a rich and immediate capacity of attaining this knowledge; And 2. That no perſon without this qualification or advantage, is in any likelyhood, yea or poſſibility, to attain it. Where love to God and men with the reſt of the gracious retinue which ſtill bear it company, as mercy, goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have not opened, widened, and enlarged the heart to a very great extent and compaſs, the <hi>breadth and length, depth and height</hi> of the love of <hi>Christ</hi> to men, cannot by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their vaſt dimenſions, enter, or receive enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment there. This is a ſecond Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is a principle found in the generality<note place="margin">Reaſon 3</note> of men, to conceive and think that God is like unto themſelves in inward principles and diſpoſitions, whatſoever theſe be. The truth is, that by creation they did in theſe reſemble him, and were like unto him, and this was their glory, being (I conceive) that Image of God, in which they are ſaid to have been created. Again, true it is, that by Regeneration this reſemblance is regained: and this for the meaſure or degree of it, proportionable to the greater or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perfection of the work it ſelf of Regeneration. Now though wicked men by voluntary ſinning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in ſin upon ſuch terms, grievouſly obliterate, deface, and waſt this Image or ſimilitude of God in themſelves, and make themſelves more like unto
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114809:19"/>
               <hi>Satan,</hi> then God; yet partly out of the pride, partly out of the ignorance of their hearts, partly out of a deſire to enjoy themſelves in the pleaſures and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of ſin without fear of being judged by God for it in the end, they are willing to hearken unto <hi>Satan,</hi> when he ſuggeſteth unto them, and tempteth them to beleeve that God ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth in the ſame principles, Genius and diſpoſition with them, according to that of <hi>David, Thou thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> (ſpeaking in the perſon of God to a wicked man) <hi>that I am altogether ſuch an one as thy ſelf,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that I am not offended with thee, will not puniſh thee, for thy wickedneſs: <hi>but</hi> thou art dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deceived in this: for (as it follows) <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thee, and ſet them</hi> [thy ſins] <hi>in order before thine eyes</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſa. 50. 21</note>; meaning, that he would judge and puniſh him ſeverely for them, and this with ſuch a kind of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhould be as glaſs unto him, wherein he ſhould (as it were) ſee his ſins one after another as he had committed them, in their native and proper ſhapes of deformity. Now as wicked men are apt to think, though very fooliſhly and falſly, that God is of their mind and like unto them, ſo are holy and good men apt to think alſo, and this according to their duty, and the truth; onely acknowledging their own infirmities and imperfections, and conſequently, their due diſtance from God. Good men cannot but think that God is good, that he is holy, that he is gracious, merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and conſequently that he is like unto them, or (which is the ſame as to the point in hand) they unto him. And the more explicit and expreſs theſe divine impreſſions or qualities are found in them, the richer and fuller their knowledge and aſſureance muſt needs be that God is like unto them, and they unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:114809:20"/>As when men are eminently gracious, eminently good eminently merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is ſcarce any place left for queſtioning or doubting, whether we be like unto God, and ſo he to us, or no. Now then when a man ſhall be rich, and reign in this confidence, that he is like unto God in righteouſneſs, goodneſs, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how, or upon what account can he be afraid that God ſhould condemn or deſtroy him? Though fear in many caſes be a very irrational, ſenſleſs, and unruly paſſion, yet to be afraid, leſt God ſhould ſend the Divine Nature, that is, his own, into Hell, is a kind of fear ſo broadly irrational and extravagant, that it is not incident to one of many thouſands. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſympathize and communion in nature, diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and action, when apprehended and beleeved, is ſecurity in abundance to the inferiour, from receiving any prejudice or harm by the power of him that is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior. Upon this ground it was, that the wicked perſon, concerning whom we lately heard from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> that he <hi>thought</hi> God to <hi>be ſuch an one altogether as himſelf,</hi> was confidently ſecure that God would not hurt, judg, or puniſh him; which conceit of his, as a natural conſequent of the ſaid thought, <hi>David</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimates by making God to ſay in oppoſition to it, (as we likewiſe heard) <hi>but I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thine eys</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 50. 21.</note>; meaning, that he would puniſh, or deſtroy him; which implies, that this wretched man promiſed unto himſelf peace and freedom from puniſhment, from the hand of God. The Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> likewiſe builds upon the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, in reaſoning (as we lately alſo heard) thus: <hi>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the day of judgement: becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 17</note>. But of theſe words formerly. This for a third Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:114809:20"/>Fourthly, This impreſſion is ſtrong and clear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> every mans heart, conſcience, and ſoul, that God loveth mercy, as he doth all kind of righteouſneſs and goodneſs otherwiſe. We ſhall not need (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to ſtrengthen the hand of this impreſſion from the Scriptures; which plentifully aſſert the love which God beareth unto all righteouſneſs, of which mercy is (and ſo the Scripture maketh it) a principal part, or member. Yea and nature it ſelf teacheth every man this further, that the more any creature excelleth in any of thoſe worthy diſpoſitions which he loveth, he loveth this creature proportionably the more. <hi>The righteous Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) loveth righteouſneſs,</hi> and then ſubjoyneth; <hi>his countenance doth behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> or, thoſe that are righteous <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 11. 7.</note>, meaning, that he looketh after them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beareth reſpects of grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. So then that being a known property of <hi>love,</hi> which the Apoſtle mentioneth amongſt many others, <hi>viz. to think no evil,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 7.</note> [i. e. to reſtrain its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from intending hurt in one kind or other, to any perſon, unto whom it is born] they who know that God loveth mercy, and merciful men (as all men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally do) and withal know, that themſelves are merciful, which all they that are eminently merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, cannot lightly but do, have no ground at all to fear that God intendeth evil towards, them, leaſt of all that greateſt of evils, condemnation, or the vengeance of eternal fire. This for a fourth Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Hell is (as it were) the great draught, or<note place="margin">Reaſon 5.</note> jakes of the world, into which there is nothing to be thrown, or caſt, but that which is filthy, noyſom and unclean, and which would be offenſive unto God, and render the ſtate and condition of holy and good men, the Sons and Daughters of God, leſs deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114809:21"/>
and delightſome unto them, if it were not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them, and caſt in there. Jewels or things, of value, pleaſure and delight, are not wont to be thrown upon dunghils, or into noyſome Vaults, the uſe whereof only is to receive and keep that a-part, and at a diſtance from men, which being neerer hand, and in view, would annoy them, and render their lives uncomfortable. Leaſt of all are men wont to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſuch things into any of theſe diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable receptacles, which are moſt neceſſary for the comfort and well being of many. Now the Sons and Daughters of Mercy, are both Gods Jewels, and mens: they render God himſelf full of beauty, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and deſirableneſs unto the world. <hi>Let your light</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note>. As the <hi>Jewes</hi> directed him that was born blind, after they had been inform'd that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had opened his eyes, though upon a wrong and wicked pretence: <hi>Give God the praiſe, we know that this man is a ſinner</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 9. 24.</note>; So we knowing that men generally being left unto themſelves, and led by the ſpirit of the fleſh, and of the world, are <hi>ſinners,</hi> are covetous, unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, heard-hearted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when we ſee the pleaſant and lovely works of mercy and goodneſs putting forth themſelves plentifully in them, we cannot, quitting our ſelves like men, but acknowledge God to be the Author and Father of theſe works in them, and conſequently to be moſt gracious, lovely, and deſireable himſelf. The holy Ghoſt takes notice that <hi>the multitude wondred when they ſaw the dumb to ſpeak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to ſee: and</hi> that upon this, <hi>they glorified the God of Iſrael</hi>;<note place="margin">c <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 30.</note> as knowing and conſidering, that it muſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114809:21"/>
needs be he, who by his grace and power, had made this happy change in the ſad conditions of theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men. But when men ſhall ſee of the ſtones of the Earth children raiſed up unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes turned into Rivers, and dry and barren grounds into water-ſprings; I mean, when they ſhall ſee men and women, who ſometimes were, or atleaſt were in danger of being, as empty Vines bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth fruit onely to themſelves; great ſelf-lovers, ſelf ſeekers, hard of bowels, eaten up with the zeal of this preſent world, regardleſs of the ſorrows, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, neceſſities, extremities of others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when men (I ſay) ſhall ſee ſuch perſons as theſe to be transformed and renewed in the frame of their hearts, and ſpirit of their minds, as that now they are full of mercy, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted, of earning bowels, fruitful in good works, travailing in birth with the peace, comfort, joy of their generation, and of all round about them, theſe being matters of far greater dignation from God, then the other, and not reſolveable into any other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or cauſe, but himſelf, cannot in reaſon, but turn to a richer account in glory unto him from men, then thoſe things, for which we heard that the <hi>multitude glorified the God of Iſrael.</hi> Thus then we ſee how mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful men are Gods <hi>Iewels,</hi> commending and ſetting him forth with beauty and pleaſantneſs of glory unto the world. In this reſpect there can be no ground of fear that he ſhould caſt them amongſt the retryment and filth of the world, into the great ſink, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſewer of Hell.</p>
            <p>Again, the perſons we ſpeak of, the generation of the merciful, are ſo far from being any offence upon the holy Mountain of the Lord, or (indeed) upon any mountain of the world, that they are deſireable
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114809:22"/>
and pleaſant in the eyes of all fleſh, they are the <hi>deliciae generis humani,</hi> the delight and darlings of mankind. The Common-Wealth of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God rejoiceth greatly over them, and cannot flouriſh, or well ſtand without them. So that there is not the leaſt cauſe of the leaſt jealouſie or fear unto any of theſe, that their caſting into Hel would be any gratification or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation unto the Saints, but rather as a ſword paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through their ſoul, or a grievous diſmembring of their body. Thus ſecurity from the wrath which is to come, compaſſeth the generation of the merciful on every ſide.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, To the Friends of God, and thoſe who<note place="margin">Reaſon 6.</note> ſtand cloſe to him in thoſe exigencies or caſes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity (as they may be called) unto which he hath voluntarily, and according to the preſcript of his own wiſdom, expoſed himſelf in the world, there is no occaſion of fear to be condemned by him, but all grounds of the greateſt ſecurity in this kind that can be deſired.

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:114809:22"/>Now that perſons mercifully diſpoſed, and ſuch who (in <hi>Davids</hi> Language) <hi>conſider the poor and needy,</hi> are the friends of God, and ſtand by his Intereſt, the Intereſt of his glory, in the world, the Scripture it ſelf witneſſeth and acknowledgeth, in ſaying, <hi>He that hath mercy upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord, and that which he hath given, will he pay him again</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 19. 17</note>. How, or in what reſpect, doth he that <hi>giveth</hi> unto the <hi>poor, lend</hi> unto God? The reaſon of the aſſertion is (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) this: God every where claims to himſelf the great honour of being the Sovereign Adminiſtrator of humane affairs, and Governour of the world: and he is generally by men, acknowledged ſo to be. Now as he is the Supream Ruler and Governor of the world, the care of the poor and needy, being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the world, and if they be godly and vertuous, very conſiderable and worthy members hereof, lieth upon his hand, as well as, if not much more then, the care of other perſons. Yea himſelf very frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth himſelf by word and promiſe, to take ſpecial care of the poor and helpleſs, and that he will be mindful of them, and provide for them. In both reſpects when the poor are neglected, and expoſed to extremities, the honour and equitableneſs of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world, together with the truth of his word and promiſe, are in danger of being called into queſtion, at leaſt by his enemies, and thoſe that are leſs acquainted with his methods and ways. So that they who charge themſelves and their conſciences with looking after the poor, and ſhall miniſter unto their wants and neceſſities, as they are able, and have opportunity to do, herein juſtifie and vindicate the Government of the world in the hand of God, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the truth of his Declarations made in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half

of the poor, from, and againſt all imputations and aſperſions that are, or might be; caſt upon them, upon the account of a deficiencie in this kind, and in caſe the poor ſhould be wholly unregarded. Yea, whereas the great God hath (as it were) pawned unto the world, thoſe ineſtimable Jewels, the honour of his righteouſneſs, and of his truth, that the poor of the Earth, ſhal not be forſaken or left deſolate, but remembred in his providential diſpenſations in the world, they who ſhal ſhew them kindneſs, and be as nurſing Fathers unto them, what do they elſe but <hi>lend unto the Lord,</hi> for the redeeming of his pawns, and to prevent the rejoycing of his Enemy, the world, over the forfeiture of them? Whereas they who ſhut up the bowels of their compaſſion againſt the indigent and needy, and ſuffer them to faint and ſink under the burthen of their poverty, whilſt they have in their hand the good things of this world wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, do what in them lyeth, expoſe the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and truth, and faithfulneſs of God in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world, unto reproach and ſhame. Hence it is, that the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John,</hi> imputeth the heard-heartedneſs of men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poor, not ſo much to a defect or want of love in them towards the poor themſelves, as towards God, who is more concerned (as he is capale of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in one kind or other) in the relief and non-relief then themſelves. <hi>But whoſoever hath this worlds good, and Brother have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion ſeeth his from him, how dwelleth THE LOVE OF GOD in him</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 17</note>? By the way it may be ſome comfort and relief of ſpirit unto the poor, when they are neglected by men, that they are herein but fellow-ſufferers with God himſelf. This for a ſixth Reaſon.</p>

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:114809:23"/>Seventhly (and Laſtly) Amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and thoſe that are trained up in the knowledge of the Scriptures, there is this reaſon beyond all the reſt, why men and women ſignally gracious and merciful, cannot lightly be troubled with any ſervile fears of judgement or condemnation, <hi>viz.</hi> that God hath poured out himſelf ſo abundantly above meaſure in his word, in high approbations of this Grace and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it, and eſpecially in promiſes of all ſorts, great and precious in every kind made unto it, as if he judged, both the world that now is, with all that is deſireable in it, and the world alſo that is to come with all the glory and great things thereof, conſideration or reward little enough for thoſe that ſhall honour him, and his Goſpel, like themſelves, with the exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not need to inſtance in particulars. The Firmament of Heaven is not fuller of Stars then the Scripture is of Divine promiſes and engagements unto thoſe that ſhall caſt their bread upon the waters, and ſhew themſelves the natural ſons and daughters of <hi>mercy: Give</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>and it ſhall be given unto you, good meaſure preſſed down, and ſhaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and running over, ſhall they</hi> [not men] <hi>give into your boſom</hi>

            <p>Proceed we now to the Uſe and Application of it. Here we ſhall find it ſerviceable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto us upon three ſeveral accounts. 1. It will yeild us matter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. 2. Of Reproof. 3. (And Laſtly) of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for Inſtruction; If men full of goodneſs and mercy cannot (lightly) but enjoy themſelves in an Heavenly ſecurity from the wrath of God, which hangs over the head of the world, learn we from hence, that then there is a courſe to be taken, by which men and women may be built up in a ſtable, ſteady, and well grounded aſſurance of ſalvation: there is a ſtone to be turned, and this not very heavy neither, under which the ineſtimable jewel of an Heavenly ſecurity lyeth hid, and may be found, a ſecurity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I mean, that a man ſhall be able to ſtand before that great Judge in that his day, and not fall, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world. By the coldneſs, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie, and dead-heartedneſs of the generality of men and women, in looking after ſuch a ſtate and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this, a man would think that it were like the world, which ſome men fancie to be in the Moon, yet find few or none that will trouble themſelves to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114809:24"/>
look after it, partly becauſe, they know not whether there be ſuch a world, or no, partly becauſe in caſe there be, they know not how to come at it, or how to intereſs themſelves in any the good things of it. In like manner the far greater part of men look upon a wel grounded aſſurance of ſalvation. 1. As a thing of a queſtionable and uncertain being. 2. As a thing out of their reach, in caſe the being of it ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: and what in one of theſe reſpects, and what in the other, all thoughts of ſeeking after it are as far from them, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, and the Heavens from the Earth. But the Doctrine deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the Scriptures hath aſſured us, both that there is a <hi>rejoycing againſt judgement,</hi> and, that <hi>mercy</hi> in her Exaltation will inveſt men in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From the tenor and import of the ſame<note place="margin">Inſtruct. 2.</note> Doctrine, take we further knowledge what the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, and how it cometh to paſs that the generality of Profeſſors amongſt us, fall ſo frequently into the company of <hi>Jim</hi> and <hi>Ojim,</hi> converſe ſo much with dark and doleful thoughts and fearful apprehenſions of death, and of the judgement to come: why their comforts in God and in <hi>Chriſt</hi> are ſo weak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and faint, that they do them little ſervice in an evil day, are not able to balance an ordinary tryal. Alas, in all this they bear the burthen and ſhame of their own folly, of their great unfaithfulneſs unto God and men, and their own ſouls. They are ſtrait-hearted, and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed: this is the root of all the bitterneſs. As Horſes, and ſome other creatures, never thrive, never are in good plight or likeing, whilſt they are hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, which is a diſeaſe incident to them: ſo when men or women are heart-bound (a ſpiritual diſeaſe, or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114809:25"/>
diſtemper very incident to Profeſſors, and eſpecially to thoſe that are rich amongſt them) this keeps them from thriving ſpiritually; this is a diſeaſe under which their ſouls cannot proſper. Their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will not ſuffer them to feaſt their conſciences: they ſell their peace to purchaſe the ignoble office of being Jaylors, or Priſon-keepers, to a little Silver. They give by the peny, inſteed of giving by the pound, to make any earnings, any conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of their Chriſtian Profeſſion. They who in all their abundance can find nothing, or nothing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, to caſt into the Treaſury of Gods glory, are not like to find any thing conſiderable caſt by God out of the unſearchable riches of his grace and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, into the treaſury of their peace. When the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with his Bowe and Arrows ſmote but thrice upon the ground, then ceaſing, the Story ſaith, that the <hi>man of God was wroth with him, and ſaid, Thou ſhouldest have ſmitten five or ſix times: thou hadst then ſmitten Syria till thou hadst conſumed it, whereas now thou ſhalt ſmite Syria but thrice</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Kings 13. 19.</note>. In like manner, many Profeſſors deprive themſelves of that perfect victory and conqueſt over their fears and doubtings, which is ſo deſirable, and withal might be obtained, by giving portions only to one, or two, when as the Scriptures, and God ſpeaking here, requireth them to <hi>give porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto ſeven, and alſo unto eight</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Eccl. 11. 2.</note>. It is <hi>the liberal ſoul that ſhall be made fat</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, Obſerve we yet further from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<note place="margin">Inſtruct. 3.</note> (by way of Inſtruction) a worthy conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or mean<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be carried round, or round about. Now the reaſon of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultory humour and practiſe is commonly pretended to be a diſ-ſatisafction in conſcience, about the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs or lawfulneſs of that way, or truth of thoſe Doctrines, or Opinions, which are deſerted by men, together with a conviction of goodneſs and truth in that new way, and Doctrine, unto which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. Whereas the true reaſon (for the moſt part at leaſt) of ſuch removals, is the negligent, un-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and unworthy deportment of men and women, under thoſe Forms and Tenents, which they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſed, or a non-improvement of thoſe opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and means for their Edification, Comfort, and Peace, which theſe Forms and Tenents afforded unto them. Many Profeſſors in this caſe, do like thoſe, who not thriving in their callings through idleneſs, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or ill-husbandry in one kind or other, charge all the blame upon their callings, as if theſe were ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditioned, and devoured their followers; pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that had they been trained up unto, or followed, other callings, they might have thriven, and lived of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114809:26"/>
themſelves as well as others. I do not ſpeak this as if a Chriſtian profeſſion might not both with more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation in the ſight of God, and with more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the edification and comfort of Chriſtians themſelves, be managed in one way, then in another; or conſequently, as if there might not be in many caſes a v<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> worthy and commendable ground (yea poſſibly more then one) for men and women, to paſs from under one form unto another, and ſo to die in their judgement to one Opinion or Tenent, that they may live unto another. But that which the preſent branch of Inſtruction holdeth forth unto you, is, That the true reaſon why Profeſſors vary and ſhift their Forms, and Tenents, ſo frequently, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably, both unto the Goſpel and themſelves, as they do, is, their barren and unfruitful converſings under them. For by reaſon hereof they gather little comfort or peace from, or under, them (no Form, or Opinion whatſoever, how regular or true ſoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able, without a conſcientious and due improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, to enrich or bleſs any mans ſoul) and not finding their ſouls to proſper under them, they grow into a diſcontent at them, and bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſome other, which they conceit and hope, (though alaſs! very groundleſly) will upon the ſame terms, and without any more care, better befriend them in their ſpiritual eſtates, and commend them more highly unto God. Whereas the Truth is, that as on the one hand, there is ſcarce any Form, ſo much beſide the Rule, nor any Doctrine or Tenent ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn and Truthleſs, but that the evil and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of them, as to the ſound peace of Conſcience in the main, may be repriſed by a worthy and fruitfull converſation; ſo on the other hand, there is no Form
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114809:26"/>
or Opinion, ſo conform to the Scriptures, or rich in Truth, but that an empty and fruitleſs converſation under them, will in time render them unto men as veſſels wherein there is no pleaſure, yea, and make them the diſdain and contempt of the ſoul. <hi>Mercy,</hi> under any form of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſcipline or Worſhip, under any Tenents in Religion, will <hi>rejo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce against Judgement:</hi> and where the Conſcience enjoys it ſelf upon theſe terms, is bleſt with ſuch a priviledge as this, there will be no diſpoſition towards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a change, but only upon grounds and motives very weighty and pregnant indeed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Take we yet further knowledge from<note place="margin">Inſtruct. 4.</note> the Doctrine (by way of Inſtruction) how and by what means, all, or the greateſt part of, the ataxies, diſorders, and male-deportments of men in the world, might be prevented, and ſo the condition of humane affairs reduced unto terms of a thouſand times more comfort and peace to the inhabitants of the earth, then now it ſtandeth at, or is like for the future, to be reduced unto in any other way; unleſs it be by an high hand of heaven, and by turning this preſent world into that which is to come. <hi>Mercy</hi> exalted by the generality of men, would bring this great, this ſo unſpeakably deſirable a thing to paſs, and this by filling their hearts and conſciences with joy and peace. For the root of all the bitterneſs that is taſted in the lives and converſations of men by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great unworthineſs and wickedneſs, that ruleth in them, is, the want of ſuch company in their heart and ſoul, which would highly ſatisfie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them. Now there is no ſuch company to take, pleaſe, and fill the hearts and ſouls of men, as the native fruits, the genuine and clear reſults of ſuch
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114809:27"/>
               <hi>Mercy,</hi> as the Doctrine commendeth. Which (as the Doctrine likewiſe importeth) are peace of Conſcience towards God, and well-grounded exultations in the ſoul, againſt judgement, and fears of condemnation. What is it that occaſioneth, or ſecretly tempteth men to break out into any way of ſin or wickedneſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? <gap reason="illegible" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>an it be any thing elſe, but only want of ſatisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deſired contentment at home? <hi>The ſoul that is full</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) loatheth [or as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal hath it, treadeth under foot, <hi>i.</hi> neglecteth, or deſpiſeth] <hi>an honey-combe</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pro. 27. 7.</note>. And <hi>Job</hi> demandeth: <hi>Doth the wilde Aſs bray when he hath graſs? or loweth the Ox over his fodder</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Job 6. 5.</note>? When the heart of a man is full of the peace of God, and reigns in an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecurity, the honey-combe of ſin, whether iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſweetneſs of pleaſure, or of profit, or of the greatneſs of this world, becomes but a ſuperfluity and lothſome impertinency to the ſoul. Nor would men complain of God unto the Divel, as being hard and ſtrait handed towards them (as all they, who ſeek to eaſe, or better their condition by ſinning, do) if he did anſwer the joy of their hearts: which moſt aſſuredly he would do, were they merciful as he is merciful, or delighted in mercy, as he delighteth. <hi>Saul</hi> did not enquire after a <hi>familiar ſpirit,</hi> until God refuſed to anſwer him, either <hi>by Dreams, or by Urim, or by Prophets</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 6, 7.</note>; and (queſtionleſs) he would ſtill have anſwered him in one or other of theſe ways, and ſo have kept him from the temptation of being behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Divel, had not <hi>Saul</hi> by his diſobedience and great un worthineſs deſtroyed his own capacity of ſuch a Grace and Favour from him. Nor would God ſuffer the ſoul of any perſon, man or woman, to be ſo barren and empty of ſpiritual proviſion and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114809:27"/>
accommodations, as to need the benevolence of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> or any contribution whatſoever from Sin, were their hearts and their hands jointly exerciſed with mercy, as he hath commanded them. The pleaſures and profits and all the advantages of ſin are onely ſweet to neceſſitous ſouls, drunkenneſs, uncleanneſs, covetouſneſs, oppreſſion, deceit, pride, anger impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, with the reſt of the troublers of the world, and diſturbers of the peace and comforts of men, would all hide their faces in the duſt, and not be once named amongſt men, did <hi>mercy</hi> exerciſe that ſoveraignty and command over the hearts and Conſciences of men, which of right appertain unto her.</p>
            <p>Fifthly (and laſtly for inſtruction) obſerve wee by the light of the Doctrine delivered, the ſtrange and uncouth folly, yea madneſſe, of a generation of men in the world, who notwithſtanding pleaſe themſelves in their way, as if they were the firſt born ſons of wiſdome and ſound underſtanding. The perſons of the Character now mentioned and meant, are the great layers up of treaſure for themſelveson earth, men that have ſilver and gold, heap upon heaps, and deſire to heap up ſtill, that have joined houſe to houſe and field to field, and are intent upon joyning ſtill, forgetting in the mean time to offer the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherewith God (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>is ſo well pleaſed</hi> to diſtribute and communicate unto thoſe that ſtand in need, and <hi>SHUTTING up their Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from</hi> their brethren, who are deſtitute of dayly food, as if they were afraid, that if theſe were at any time left open, their great Eſtates would preſently run out by them, and return unto them no more. Whereas the truth is, that did rich men give a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> vent and breathing that way to their great and unweldy Eſtates
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114809:28"/>
it were the moſt prudential and promiſing way under heaven to keep them from Conſumptions, and to make them long-liv'd even to many generations. <hi>There is a ſore evil</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man) <hi>which I have ſeen under the Sun,</hi> viz. <hi>riches kept for</hi> [or by] <hi>the owners thereof to their hurt.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eccl. 5. 13.</note> Yea moſt certain it is, that there is no great Eſtate or wealth whatſoever, but if it be <hi>kept</hi> too cloſe and too intire, will in the end be found to have been <hi>kept</hi> to the great <hi>hurt,</hi> and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable damage of the <hi>owner.</hi> And whereas it is an excellent and high ſtrein of wiſdome for men, to <hi>make themſelves</hi> ſuch <hi>friends of the Mammon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe,</hi> who, when they <hi>fail</hi> here, <hi>may,</hi> and will, <hi>receive them into everlaſting habitations;</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 17. 9</note> ſo is it on the other hand the exaltation of folly, for men to make (as it were) of the ſame material, ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whoſe diſpleaſure may cauſe them both to <hi>fail</hi> the ſooner here, and wil moſt certainly exclude them out of thoſe <hi>everlaſting habitations</hi> of reſt, and joy, and peace, into which otherwiſe they might, and ſhould, have been received. For men ſhall be ſent to Hell, as well for the want of Charity, and of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as for the want of Juſtice; neither is it much mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial whether a man or woman be ſent thither upon the one account, or the other.
