            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 In reſpect of the known untowardnes of the major part of the people, who being wonderfully wedded to old cuſtomes, are not eaſily wonne to any new courſe, though never ſo much to their own profit, that two or more fit perſons of approved skill and integrity may be made <hi>Publique Stewards</hi> or <hi>Surveyors;</hi> one of the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,</hi> the othet of the <hi>Woods</hi> of this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and impowered to overſee and take care of the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of what is, and by all good improvement to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and provide for what is wanting to the preſent age: and (except ſome ſuch Expedients be uſed) it is more then likely will be wanting to ſucceeding ages.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That according to the uſual cuſtome of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> a Law may be made of letting and hiring Leaſes upon improvement; where the manner is, That the <hi>Farmer</hi> covenanteth on his part, to improve the land to ſuch or ſuch a greater Rent, by an orderly and excellent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> as well as building. The <hi>Landlord</hi> on the other ſide covenanteth on his part, at the expiration
<pb facs="tcp:119037:3"/>
of the ſaid Leaſe, to give ſo many years purchaſe of the Improvement (according to the agreement) which is 3 or 4 years, or ſomtimes more, or to give out of it ſuch a parcell or moity of Ground. As if land formerly going for 6. <abbr>s</abbr> an Acre, be upon improvement worth 10. <abbr>s</abbr> or 13. <abbr>s</abbr> 4. <abbr>d</abbr> an Acre. The <hi>Landlord</hi> is to give 4. or 5. <abbr>s</abbr> upon every Acre, more or leſſe, according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it pleaſe God to bleſſe theſe Motions, and that accordingly the <hi>Nationall Husbandry</hi> of this <hi>Common-wealth</hi> be improved; we may hope through Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſee better dayes, and to be able to beare <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Publique burdens</hi> with more eaſe to our ſelves, and benefit to <hi>Humane Society</hi> then hitherto we could attain unto.

                  <p>The whole Diſcourſe ſhews you, how to <hi>improve barren</hi> &amp; <hi>heathy land,</hi> &amp; how to raiſe more then ordinary profit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by ſuch wayes and means as are not practiſed in <hi>England,</hi> but as commonly in ſome parts of <hi>Brabant</hi> &amp; <hi>Flaunders,</hi> as the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of <hi>Wheat</hi> &amp; <hi>Rie</hi> is here. By that means you may nobly augment your eſtates, and will receive ſo much the more profit &amp; praiſe, by how with more induſtry &amp; diligence you govern your affairs: and wil not only be imitated, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo honoured by your <hi>Neighbours,</hi> when they ſhal ſee your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours proſper ſo far, as to convert <hi>barren</hi> &amp; <hi>heathy ground</hi> left un-husbanded for many ages, into as <hi>commodious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable land,</hi> with <hi>Paſtures</hi> and <hi>Meadows,</hi> as any be in this <hi>Kingdome.</hi> And certainly, that man is worthy of praiſe and honour, who being poſſeſſed of a <hi>large</hi> &amp; <hi>barren Demeaſne,</hi> conſtrains it by his labour and induſtry to produce extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fruits; which redounds not only to his own particular
<pb facs="tcp:119037:4"/>
profit, but alſo to the <hi>Publique benefit. Cato</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is a great ſhame to a man, not to leave his</hi> Inheritance <hi>greater to his</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors <hi>then he received it from his</hi> Predeceſſors, <hi>and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth the</hi> liberality <hi>of God, who by</hi> ſlothfulneſſe <hi>loſeth that which his land may bring forth, as not ſeeming willing to reap the fruits which God hath offered him.</hi> Nay, he threatens the <hi>crime of high treaſon;</hi> to thoſe <hi>that do not augment their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſo much as the</hi> Increaſe <hi>ſurmounts the</hi> Principall.

To ſuch a man you must give good wages, with intent to advance your own gain, and take the more eaſe, by reaſon of his honesty and knowledge.</p>
                  <p>You will finde this <hi>Husbandry</hi> (after you have once had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of it) to be very pleaſing to you, and ſo exceeding profitable,

that it will make you diligent: For no man of any <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Science</hi> (except an <hi>Alchymiſt</hi>) ever prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ſo much gain any other way, as you ſhall ſee demonſtrated in this enſuing <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> The <hi>Uſurer</hi> doubles but his principall, with Intereſt upon Intereſt in <hi>7</hi> years; but by this little <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> you ſhall learn now to doe more then treble your principle in one years compaſs And you ſhall ſee how an <hi>Induſtrious</hi> man in <hi>Brabant</hi> &amp; <hi>Flaunders</hi> would bring 500 acres of <hi>barren</hi> &amp; <hi>heathy land,</hi> that was not worth at the moſt above 5. <abbr>l</abbr> a year, to be worth 700. <abbr>l</abbr> a year in leſſe time then <hi>7</hi> years.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to your deſires, I have ſent you what I have obſerved in <hi>France,</hi> about the ſowing of a ſeed called commonly, <hi>Saint-Foine,</hi> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is as much to ſay as <hi>Holy-Hay,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as I ſuppoſe of the excellency of it. It's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Parkinſon</hi> in his <hi>Herball,</hi> where you may ſee a perfect deſcription of it, <hi>Onobrychis Vulgaris,</hi> or <hi>Cocks head;</hi> becauſe of it's flower, or <hi>Medick Fetchling:</hi> By ſome it is called <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala;</hi> becauſe it cauſeth cattel to give abundance of milke. The plant moſt like unto it, and commonly known; being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>ſowne</hi> in gardens, is that which is called <hi>French Honey-ſuckle,</hi> and is a kind of it, though not the ſame. <hi>France</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſuppoſed, to want the feweſt things of any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> in <hi>Europe;</hi> yet it hath no ſmall want of <hi>Hay,</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Paris;</hi> which hath neceſſitated them to ſowe their dry and barren lands with this ſeed. Their manner of ſowing it, is done moſt commonly thus: When they intend to let their Corn-lands ly, becauſe they be out of heart, and not ſituate in a place convenient for manuring, then they ſowe that land with <hi>Oats,</hi> and theſe ſeeds together about equall parts; the firſt year they onely mowe off their <hi>Oates,</hi> leaving the <hi>Saint Foine</hi> to take root and ſtrength that year; Yet they may if they pleaſe, when the year is ſeaſonable, mowe it the ſame year it is ſowne; but it's not the beſt way to do ſo: the year following they mowe it, and ſo do ſeven years together; the ordinary burthen is about a load, or a load &amp; a halfe in good years, upon an <hi>Arpent,</hi> (which is an 100 ſquare Poles or Rods,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119037:6"/>
every Pole or Rod being 20 foot) which quantity of ground being nigh a 4th. part leſſe than an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acre; within a league of <hi>Paris,</hi> is uſually Rented at 6 or 7 <abbr>s</abbr> After the land hath reſted 7 years; then they uſually break it up, and ſowe it with corn till it be out of heart, and then ſowe it with <hi>Saint Foine</hi> as formerly: for it doth not impoveriſh land, as <hi>Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Plants</hi> do; but after ſeven years, the roots of this plant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and ſweet, as the roots of <hi>Licoriſh,</hi> do rot, being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the Plough, and enrich the land. I have ſeen it ſown in divers places here in <hi>England;</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Cobham-Park</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> about 4 miles from <hi>Graveſend;</hi> where it hath thriven extraordinary well upon dry Chalky banks, where nothing elſe would grow: and indeed ſuch dry barren land is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for it (as moiſt rich land for the great <hi>Trefoile</hi>) or great <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Graſſe</hi> (although it will grow indifferently well on all lands) and when the other graſſes and plants are deſtroyed by the parching heat of the Sun; becauſe their roots are ſmall and ſhallow; this flouriſheth very much, having very great root and deep in the ground, and therefore not eaſily to be <hi>exſiccated;</hi> As we have obſerved <hi>Ononis</hi> or <hi>Reſt-Harrow</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to do, on dry lands; but if you ſowe this on wet land, the water ſoon corrupts the root of it. This plant without queſtion would much improve many of our barren lands, ſo that they might be mowen every year once, at leaſt ſeven years together, and yield excellent fodder for cattel, if ſo be that it be rightly managed; otherwiſe it cometh to nothing, as I have ſeen by experience. I therefore councel thoſe who ſowe this, or the great <hi>Trefoile</hi> or <hi>Clover-Graſſe,</hi> or any other ſort of graſſes, that they obſerve theſe Rules.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That they do make there ground fine, and kill all ſorts of other graſſes and plants; otherwiſe they being native <hi>Engliſh</hi> will by no meanes give way to the <hi>French</hi> ones; eſpecially in this moiſt climate; and therefore they are to be blamed; who with one ploughing ſowe this or other ſeeds; for the graſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently groweth up and choaketh them, and ſo by their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and ill Husbandry, diſcourageth themſelves and others.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Let them not be too ſparing of their ſeeds; for the more they ſowe, the cloſer and thicker they will grow, and preſently
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119037:6"/>
fully ſtock the ground, that nothing elſe can grow. And further the ſeeds which come from beyond the Seas, are oftentimes old and much decayed, and therefore the more ſeed is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Not to expect above 7. years profit by it; for in that time it will decay, and the naturall graſſe will prevaile over it; for every plant hath his period; ſome in one yeare; ſome in 2. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in 3. as the common <hi>Thiſtle;</hi> and therefore after 7. years let them either plough the land up, and ſowe it with that ſame ſeed again, or with other Graine as they do in <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4 Let not <hi>ſheepe</hi> or other cattel bite them the firſt year, that they may be well rooted; for theſe graſſes are farre ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the ordinary graſſes; and cattel will eat them down, leaving the other; and conſequently diſcourage their growth.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 The beſt way, if men will be at the charge, is to make their ground very fine, as they do when they are to ſowe <hi>Barly,</hi> and harow it even; and then to howe theſe ſeeds in alone without any other grain, as the Gardiners do <hi>Peaſe;</hi> yet not at ſo great a diſtance; but let them make the ranges about a foots breadth one from another, and they ſhall ſee their graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes flouriſh, as if they were green <hi>Peaſe;</hi> eſpecially if they draw the howe through them once or twice that ſummer to deſtroy all the weeds and graſſes: And if they do thus, the great <hi>Clover</hi> and other ſeeds may be mowen even twice the firſt year, as I have experimented in divers ſmall plots of ground.</p>
                        <p>There is at <hi>Paris</hi> likewiſe another ſort of fodder, which they call <hi>La Lucern,</hi> which is not inferior, but rather preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this <hi>Saint Foine,</hi> for dry &amp; barren grounds; which hath bin lately brought thither, and is managed as the former; and truly every day produceth ſome new things, not onely in other Countreys, but alſo in our owne. And though I cannot but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much commend theſe plants unto my <hi>Countrymen,</hi> knowing that they may be beneficial to this <hi>Nation;</hi> yet I eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend unto them a famous kind of graſſe growing in <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> 19 miles from <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> at <hi>Maddington,</hi> which may better be called one of the wonders of this land, then the <hi>Hawthorne-tree</hi> at <hi>Glaſſenbury,</hi> which ſuperſtition made ſo famous: for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the ſame kind are found elſwhere. You may find this,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119037:7"/>
graſſe briefly deſcribed in a Book called <hi>Phytologia Britannica,</hi> (which lately came forth, and ſet down even all the plants which have been found naturally growing in <hi>England, Gramen Caninum Supinum Longiſſimum,</hi> which groweth 9 miles from <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> Mr, <hi>Tuckers</hi> at <hi>Madington:</hi> where with they fat <hi>hogs;</hi> and which is 24 foot long, a thing almoſt incredible; yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known to all that ſhire. Now without queſtion, if the ſeed of this graſſe, be ſown in other rich Meadowes, it will yeeld extraordinarily; though perchance not ſo much, as in its proper place. I wonder that thoſe that live thereabouts, have not tryed to fertilize their other Meadowes vvith it: for it is a peculiar <hi>ſpecies</hi> of graſſe; and though ſome ingenious men have found about 90 <hi>ſpecies</hi> of graſſes in this <hi>Iſland:</hi> yet there is none like to this, that can by any meanes be brought to ſuch an height, and ſvveetneſſe. And truly I ſuppoſe, that the through examination of this graſſe, is a thing of very great importance, for the improvement of <hi>Meadows</hi> and <hi>Paſtures;</hi> and it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the great <hi>Trefoile, Saint Foine, La-Lucern,</hi> or any <hi>exotick</hi> plant vvhatſoever. And though I am very unvvilling to exceed the bounds of an Epiſtle; yet I cannot but certifie you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Huſbandry</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi> in other particulars (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) is greatly deficient, which I will do as briefly as may be; and likewiſe, how ingenious men may finde <hi>Remedies</hi> for theſe <hi>deficiencies.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1 That it is a deficiency in <hi>Husbandry,</hi> that it is uſed no more.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That one good digging, becauſe it goeth deeper than the Plough, and buryeth all vveeds, killeth the graſſes; is as good as three Ploughings, and if the Land be mellovv, not much more chargeable.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That it vvould imploy many 1000 of people, that a third part of the ſeed might be ſaved. As I have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that all the vveeds and graſſes, might be more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed thereby, and the ground better accommodated
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119037:8"/>
for other crops; and to conclude, the crop conſiderably grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yet thus much I muſt further ſay, concerning ſetting of Graine, That great <hi>Beans</hi> are even of neceſſity to be ſet, and that ſmall <hi>Beans</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi> and other places, are likewiſe ſet with profit, for the reaſons above mentioned; that to ſet <hi>Peaſe</hi> (unleſſe <hi>Haſtevers) Oates, Barley,</hi> is a thing even ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: that <hi>Wheat</hi> although in divers grounds it may be ſet with profit; yet to <hi>howe it in</hi> (as the <hi>Gardiners</hi> ſpeak) as they do <hi>Peaſe,</hi> though not at the ſame diſtance, but about a foot the ranges one from another, is better then ſetting, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe to ſet Corn is an infinite trouble and charge; and if it be not very exactly done, which children neither can nor wil do, and theſe muſt be the chief ſetters; wil be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prejudicious.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 A moiſt ſeaſon about <hi>Kerning</hi>-time: which moiſture either corrupteth the roots of the Plant, or the nouriſhment of it, or the ſeed in its <hi>Embrio:</hi> or perhaps in ſome meaſure all theſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Low; moiſt, foggy ground, for the reaſons above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

In <hi>Vineyards</hi> it's obſerved, that dung cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth more increaſe in quantity, but leſſe in goodneſſe, ſo that the ill-taſt of the dung may eaſily be diſcerned; becauſe wine hath an high taſte, vvithout queſtion the ſame happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to other Plants, although it be not ſo eaſily diſcerned; for the ferment or ill odour of the dung, cannot be over-maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Plants, as vve ſee alſo in <hi>Animals,</hi> that corrupt diet cauſeth unſavory taſts in the fleſh: ſo <hi>hogs</hi> in <hi>New-found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where they are nouriſhed by <hi>fiſh,</hi> may by their <hi>taſts</hi> be called rather <hi>Sea-porpuſſes</hi> then <hi>Land-ſwine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4 The ſovving of <hi>Smutty</hi> Corne oft produceth <hi>Smuttyneſſe;</hi> the ſon like unto the father; I account <hi>Smutty</hi> Corn an <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> or <hi>ſick</hi> Graine, and ſuppoſe that by a <hi>Microſcope</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection may be diſcerned.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, the ſovving of the ſame ſeed oft on the ſame field, cauſeth <hi>Smuttyneſſe;</hi> becauſe that <hi>nitrous jewce,</hi> vvhich is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the nouriſhment of the Grain, hath been exhaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the precedent years; and therefore it is excellent <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry</hi> every year to change the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Grain, and alſo to buy your Seed-Corn, from places farre diſtant. I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> vvho did ſovve ſome <hi>Wheat</hi> which came from <hi>Spain,</hi> vvhere the Grain is uſually very hard and flinty,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119037:11"/>
and as it vvere tranſparent, and farre vveightier than ours (as it appeareth by a meaſure at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> vvhich holdeth about 3 buſhels, and if our <hi>Wheat</hi> in the <hi>Northern</hi> parts vveigheth 160. the <hi>Southern</hi> Corn weigheth ſometimes 180, 200, 220:) and had a crop beyond expectation.</p>
                        <p>The uſuall <hi>Cures</hi> of <hi>Smuttyneſſe,</hi> beſides thoſe mentioned before, are theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 To lime your ground, which warmeth and dryeth the land.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 To lime your Corne, which is done thus. Firſt, ſlack your lime, add then moiſten your Corne or lime, and ſtir them together, till your Graine be as big as a ſmall <hi>Peaſe.</hi> This liming preſerveth Corn likewiſe from birds and worms, and is found a very good <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt this diſeaſe: others make a ſtrong ly vvith common ſalt, and ſteep their Corn in it all night, and then draw away their ly for further uſe; which ſeldome faileth of its deſired effect. Whether this ſtrong ly doth by its <hi>corroſiveneſſe,</hi> mortifie the weak and imperfect Corne, ſo that it will not grow; Or whether it be a <hi>Remedy,</hi> to cure the imperfections thereof, is worth the enquiry? I ſuppoſe this ly doth <hi>exſiccate</hi> the <hi>ſuperfluous humidity,</hi> which is the cauſe of this corruption. If Corne be brought into the barn very <hi>Smutty,</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> they uſually thraſh it on dry floors planked with boards; by which means, the <hi>Smuttyneſſe</hi> is beaten away, and ſticketh not to the Grain, onely a little blackneſſe appeareth about the eye, but if it be thraſhed on a moiſt floor, the blackneſſe ſticketh to the grain, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeareth dark, and is ſold at a lower rate to the Bakers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mildew</hi> is without queſtion an <hi>unctuous</hi> dew, which deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from above about <hi>Midſommer;</hi> it aboundeth in dry years, as <hi>Smuttyneſſe</hi> in moiſt. I cannot think that there is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily any Malignity in this dew, but it produceth its effect by manifeſt cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> from an <hi>oily viſcuous</hi> quality which ſtoppeth the <hi>pores</hi> of the husk wherein the <hi>Wheat</hi> lieth, and depriveth it from the Ayre, and conſequently from nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the Ayre is the life of all things.

it wil produce the ſame effect.

                        <p n="1">1 The beſt way is to cut dovvn the trees about your ground, and your hedges lovv, that the vvind may <hi>ventilate</hi> your Corn.</p>

                        <p n="4">4 The uſe of a kind of <hi>bearded Wheat,</hi> is an excellent <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy:</hi> for the beard ſhoveth off the <hi>dew,</hi> that it doth not ſo eaſily inſinuate it ſelfe into the <hi>eare,</hi> and likewiſe cauſeth the <hi>eare</hi> to ſhake by the leaſt wind.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119037:12"/>
his Book called <hi>Paradiſus Terreſtris,</hi> where at leaſure you may read it. I will onely point briefly at the <hi>Deficiencies,</hi> which I finde in this part of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> and the beſt wayes to <hi>Remedy</hi> them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 I ſay, that it is a great <hi>Deficiency</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that we have not more <hi>Orchards</hi> planted. It's true, that in <hi>Kent</hi> and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Gloceſterſhire, Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> there are many gallant <hi>Orchards,</hi> but in other <hi>Countrys,</hi> they are very rare and thinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if there were as many more, even in any <hi>Countrey,</hi> they would be very profitable. I know in <hi>Kent,</hi> that ſome advance their ground even from 5 <abbr>s</abbr> 
                           <hi>per</hi> Acre to 5 pound by this means, and if I ſhould relate, what I have heard by divers concerning the profit of a <hi>Cherry-Orchard,</hi> about <hi>Sittenburne</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> you would hardly believe me; yet I have heard it by ſo many, that I believe it to be true: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that an <hi>Orchard</hi> of 30 Acres of <hi>Cherries,</hi> produced in one year above a 1000 pound, but now the trees are almoſt all dead; it was one of the firſt <hi>Orchards</hi> planted in <hi>Kent.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> reporteth, that the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Leiceſter's</hi> Gardiner in <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> time, firſt began to plant <hi>Flemiſh Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> in thoſe parts; which in his time did ſpread into 16 o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and vvere at that time ſold at greater rates then novv; yet I knovv that 10 or 15 pound an Acre hath been given for <hi>Cherries,</hi> more for <hi>Pears,</hi> and <hi>Apples.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 There is a great <hi>Deficiency</hi> in the ordering of <hi>Orchards,</hi> in that they are not vvell pruned, but full of <hi>Moſſe, Miſletoe,</hi> and <hi>Suckers,</hi> and oftentimes the ground is packed too thick of trees; for they ſhould ſtand at leaſt 20 foot aſunder; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvill ill husbands beſtovv dunging, digging, or any other coſt on <hi>Orchards,</hi> vvhich if they did, might pay half their rents in ſome places. One told me for a ſecret, a Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for to make Trees bear much and excellent fruit, vvhich vvas this: Firſt, in an old tree, to <hi>ſplit</hi> his root; then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Compoſt</hi> made of <hi>Pigeons</hi>-dung, <hi>lees</hi> of vvine, or ſtale <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> and a little <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> (to deſtroy the vvormes,) it hath ſome probability of truth: for by experience I knovv that a buſhell of <hi>Pigeons</hi>-dung hath cauſed a tree to grovv and bear,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119037:13"/>
vvhich for divers years before ſtood at a ſtand; but concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>ſplitting the roots,</hi> I know not what to ſay. Some old <hi>Authours</hi> affirm this ought to be done; becauſe that the roots may as well be hide-bound, as other parts of the tree, and not able to attract his nouriſhment, and when the Root is ſplit, it will ſpeedily ſend forth divers ſmall <hi>fibrous</hi> roots; which are the principall <hi>Attractors.</hi> It were good that ſome vvould give us an account exact of this <hi>Experiment,</hi> But ſome wil object againſt <hi>Orchards,</hi> that they ſpoil much ground, and therefore ought to be planted onely in <hi>hedges.</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That <hi>Plumtrees</hi> and <hi>Damſins</hi> may very well be planted in hedges, being ordinarily thorny plants; this is uſed very much in <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> where the <hi>Plums</hi> uſually pay no ſmall part of their Rent; yet I never ſaw in theſe <hi>Southern</hi> parts of <hi>England,</hi> any <hi>Apples</hi> or <hi>Pears</hi> thrive in an <hi>Hedge,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a <hi>Crab</hi> or a <hi>Wilden,</hi> or ſome <hi>Sweeting</hi> of little worth. How they thrive in <hi>Hereford-ſhire</hi> and thoſe places, I knovv not.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> of <hi>Orchards</hi> planted at 20 or 30 foot diſtance, is not worth ſpeaking of: for this is the uſuall courſe in <hi>Kent,</hi> when they plant any ground, they exactly place them in rank and file, and then plough their lands many years, and ſowe them with Corn, till the <hi>Orchard</hi> beginneth to bear fruit; then they lay them down for <hi>paſture,</hi> which <hi>paſture</hi> is not conſiderably <hi>ſoure;</hi> but hath this advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other <hi>Paſtures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1 That it is ſooner grown by 14 dayes in the ſpring than the <hi>Medows,</hi> and therefore very ſerviceable.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 In <hi>Parching Summers</hi> here is <hi>plenty,</hi> when other places have ſcarcity.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 They are great ſhelters for Cattle, eſpecially <hi>ſheep,</hi> who will in thoſe places, in great ſnowes ſcrape up meat, which in other places they cannot do: and if the paſture were <hi>ſoure,</hi> yet the loſſe is not great; for it will be a convenient place for the <hi>Hogs</hi> to run in, who muſt have a place for that purpoſe, where there are no Commons.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="17" facs="tcp:119037:13"/>4 I ſay, that the <hi>Benefits</hi> are ſo many by <hi>Orchards,</hi> that you ought like an ungrateful man to thruſt them up to the hedge: for they afford curious walks for pleaſure, food for Cattle, both in the Spring early, and alſo in the <hi>parching Summer,</hi> and <hi>nipping ſnowy Winter:</hi> They afford fuel for the fire, and alſo ſhades from the heat, phyſick for the ſick, refreſhment for the ſound, plenty of food for man, and that not of the worſt, and drink alſo even of the beſt, and all this without much labour, care or coſt, who therefore can juſtly open his mouth againſt them?</p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, that we do not improve many excellent Fruits, which grow amongſt us very well, and that we have as yet many fruits from beyond Seas, which will grow very well with us. I paſſe by the generall and great Ignorance, that is amongſt us, of the variety of <hi>Apples,</hi> of which there are many ſorts which have ſome good and peculiar uſes; moſt men contenting themſelves with the knowledg of half a ſcore of the beſt, thinking the vertues of all the reſt are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in them: as alſo of the variety of <hi>Pears,</hi> which are incredibly many. A <hi>Friend</hi> of mine near <hi>Graveſend,</hi> hath lately collected about 200 <hi>ſpecies.</hi> I know another in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>) who hath nigh the ſame number. I hear of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Worceſter-ſhire,</hi> not inferiour to theſe. In <hi>Northamton-ſhire.</hi> I know one, who hath likewiſe collected very many. So that I dare boldly ſay, there are no leſſe in this <hi>Iſland</hi> then 500 <hi>ſpecies;</hi> ſome commended for their early ripeneſſe; ſome for excellent taſtes; ſome for beauty; others for greatneſſe; ſome for great bearers; others for good Bakers; ſome for long laſters, others for to make <hi>Perry,</hi> &amp;c. But to our purpoſe: I ſay many rare fruits are neglected; to Inſtance.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 In the <hi>Small-nut</hi> or <hi>Filbird,</hi> which is not much inferiour to the beſt and ſweeteſt <hi>Almonds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 The great <hi>Damſin</hi> or <hi>Pruin-plum,</hi> which groweth well and beareth full in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>Almonds,</hi> which groweth well and beareth good fruit, as I have ſeen divers buſhels on one tree in my Brothers <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="18" facs="tcp:119037:14"/>4 <hi>Walnuts,</hi> which is not a fruit to be deſpiſed.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Mulberries,</hi> but of theſe preſently in another place. I might likewiſe adde <hi>Currants, Raſpeſes,</hi> of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent drinks may be made.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 <hi>Quinces,</hi> of the which I cannot but tel you that a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> at <hi>Prichenel</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who had a tree from beyond Sea, hath the beſt in <hi>England,</hi> and hath made above 30 pound of a ſmall piece of ground planted with them, as I have heard from his own wifes mouth. And therefore it is by reaſon of our ill <hi>Husbandry,</hi> that we have <hi>Quinces</hi> from <hi>Flaunders, Small-nuts</hi> from <hi>Spain, Pruins</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> and alſo <hi>Walnuts</hi> and <hi>Almonds</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Cheſtnuts</hi> (which I had almoſt forgot) from <hi>Portugall.</hi> And now I cannot but digreſſe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to tell you a ſtrange and true ſtory, with my opinion of it. In divers places of <hi>Kent,</hi> as at and about <hi>Graveſend,</hi> in the Countrey and elſewhere, very many of the prime <hi>Timbers</hi> of their old barnes and houſes are of <hi>Cheſtnut-wood,</hi> and yet there is ſcarce a <hi>Cheſtnut-tree</hi> within 20 miles of that place, and the people altogether ignorant of ſuch trees. This ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that in former times thoſe places did abound with ſuch timber; for people were not ſo fooliſh ſurely in former times to runne up and down the world, to procure ſuch huge maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey timbers for barnes and ſuch buildings when as there was plenty of <hi>Oakes</hi> and <hi>Elmes,</hi> at their doors: And further, it ſheweth, that theſe Trees will grow again with us to a great bigneſſe. This putteth into my mind the ſtory of the <hi>moore-logs,</hi> which are found in divers places of the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>moores</hi> many foot deep; which logs are long and black, and appear to be a kinde of <hi>Firre</hi> or <hi>Pine;</hi> and yet in thoſe places, people are altogether ignorant of theſe Trees, the Countrey not producing any of theſe <hi>ſpecies.</hi> The firſt ſtory of <hi>Kent,</hi> which I know to be true, cauſeth me to wonder the leſſe at the latter: for I ſee that a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of wood, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, even totally in a place. And</p>
                        <p n="2">2 I know, that in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> that <hi>Pines,</hi> and <hi>Firres</hi> and <hi>Cedars</hi> do grow wonderfully thick in ſuch <hi>Moors</hi> or <hi>Swamps,</hi> and being light wood, and eaſily wrought,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119037:14"/>
they are continually uſed, while they laſt, for buildings. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſuppoſe theſe <hi>Moors</hi> are <hi>Commons,</hi> to the which the poor have uſed to reſort for firing, &amp; how ſoon great woods will be conſumed by them, every one making what havock he pleaſeth, all men know. As concerning their being ſo deep in the ground, the blackneſſe; I ſuppoſe that when wood was abundant in thoſe places, every one did cut what they pleas'd, and left what was not for their turnes, which being in moiſt places, was ſoon glutted with moiſture, and made ponderous; by which means it ſoon buried it ſelf, as ſhips do, on quickſand, or perhaps the <hi>turf</hi> (which hath a peculiar facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vegetative, for where it is exhauſted, it ſoon groweth again) in time hath grown over them; the people permitting it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that wood, once <hi>ſobb'd</hi> in wet, is of little uſe, as we ſee by <hi>Piles</hi> on the <hi>marſhes</hi>-ſide, ſcarce any man vouchſafing to carry them home. The blackneſſe of this wood proceedeth, as I ſuppoſe, from the ſooty fume, or <hi>evaporation</hi> of the black <hi>turffe,</hi> (which endeavoureth, as all earths do, to reduce all things into its own nature; which though it be not able ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accompliſh; yet it introduced divers diſpoſitions, and qualities, as blackneſſe in the wood. Some ſuppoſe, that theſe <hi>moore-logs</hi> have laine there ever ſince the <hi>flood,</hi> with whom I will not contend; ſeeing that any wood, if it be kept from the Aire continually moiſt or dry, will endure even thouſands of years without putrefaction.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 <hi>Deficiency,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The <hi>6</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning not improving our Fruits.</note> is the <hi>Not-improving</hi> of our <hi>Fruits</hi> for the beſt ends and purpoſes. <hi>Normandy,</hi> which produceth but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wine, maketh abundance of <hi>Cider, Perry,</hi> which they eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate equally to wine, if it be made of good fruit. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Perry</hi> is made of <hi>Choaky Pears,</hi> very juicy, which grow along by the high-way-ſides, which are not to be eaten raw. In <hi>Biſcay</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where wine is ſcarce, they make <hi>Cider</hi> of a certain ſweet <hi>Apple,</hi> which hath a little <hi>bitterneſſe</hi> in it, and is like to our <hi>ſnouting,</hi> and the <hi>Cider</hi> is very good. And truly here in <hi>England,</hi> if we would make <hi>Cider</hi> and <hi>Perry</hi> of the beſt ſorts of Fruits, which is rarely done, (for we think any fruit good enough for that purpoſe) we might make drinks,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119037:15"/>
no wayes inferiour to the <hi>French wines,</hi> which are uſually ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before they come over the ſeas to you, their ſpirits ſoon evaporating. There are two wayes of making <hi>Cider</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> one, by bruiſing and beating them, and then preſently to put them into a veſſel to <hi>ferment</hi> or work (as it is uſually called) of themſelves: The other way is to boil the juice with ſome good <hi>ſpices,</hi> by which the rawneſſe is taken away, and then to ferment it with ſome yeſt, if it work not of it ſelf, this is the beſt way: and I have taſted <hi>Cider</hi> thus made of an excellent delicate taſte. Neither let any complaine of the vvindineſſe; for it is onely vvant of uſe: When I had for 2 or 3 years continually drunk <hi>wine</hi> beyond Sea, the ſtrongeſt beer for 2 or 3 vveeks vvas as vvindy to me, as <hi>Cider</hi> vvill be to any; and aftervvards vvhen I vvent to <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>wine</hi> of that place vvas as troubleſome as <hi>Engliſh beer</hi> for a little time: hovv much vvine might be ſaved, and alſo <hi>malt</hi> if <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> did take theſe good courſes, vvhich other <hi>Nations</hi> do, and conſequently how much advantage vvould this <hi>Iſland</hi> reap thereby? If I were an houſe-keeper in the Country, I would make excellent <hi>Beer, Ale, Cider, Perry, Metheglin, Wine,</hi> of our own <hi>grapes,</hi> and if my Friends vvould not drink theſe, they ſhould drink water, or go away a thirſt: I vvould ſcorn to honour <hi>France</hi> ſo much as men do uſually; and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> ſhould not laugh at us, and ſay that vve can as vvell be vvithout <hi>bread,</hi> as their <hi>wines, Currants, &amp;c.</hi> Thus may many other <hi>excellent drinks</hi> be made out of our <hi>Fruits:</hi> not to ſpeak of thoſe which are made of our <hi>Grain,</hi> as <hi>Barly, Wheat,</hi> &amp;c. yet I muſt tell you, that I knovv an <hi>Ingenious</hi> man, vvho can vvithout malting <hi>Barly,</hi> make a <hi>drink</hi> not inferiour to <hi>wine,</hi> and a greater quantity of <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> out of them, and vvith leſſe coſt, then by the ordinary vvay, by a peculiar <hi>fermentation</hi> of his ovvn; vvhich time vvill diſcover. There is another <hi>Ingenious</hi> man, vvho out of <hi>Damſins</hi> and other fat and ſvveet <hi>plums,</hi> can make a <hi>drink</hi> not inferiour to the beſt <hi>wines,</hi> and abundance of <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi> Many <hi>Ladies</hi> knovv hovv to make <hi>Cherry, Raſpes</hi>-vvines; and Sir <hi>Hugh Plattes</hi> in his <hi>Cloſet</hi> for <hi>Ladies,</hi> diſcloſeth many ſecrets of this kind;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119037:15"/>
as alſo for <hi>Conſerves, Marmalades,</hi> which are things both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull and profitable. I have a kinſman, who can even out of <hi>black-berries,</hi> make a very pleaſant <hi>drinke,</hi> which curioſity he is unwilling to publiſh. <hi>Glauber</hi> an excellent <hi>Chymiſt</hi> hath divers ſecrets of this kind, even to the advancing of <hi>Hawes, Hips, Canker-berries, Slowes,</hi> to excellent <hi>Aqua-vitae's, drinks, vinegers,</hi> which he himſelf firſt invented. In <hi>Ruſſia</hi> in the <hi>ſpring-time,</hi> it's an uſuall cuſtome to pierce the barke of the <hi>Birch-trees,</hi> which at that time will weep much <hi>liquor,</hi>

                        <p n="1">1 To advance <hi>Nurceries</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Apples, Pears, Plums, Cherries,</hi> which <hi>Gentlemen</hi> may do for a ſmal matter, and then plant out theſe trees, when they are grown great enough.

                        <p>And firſt, although I think that the <hi>wine</hi> is the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, which <hi>Hot Countreys</hi> eſpecially enjoy, as <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Countreys</hi> do <hi>Milk, Butter, Cheeſe</hi> in abundance, and the coldeſt and <hi>Barrenneſt Fowl,</hi> and <hi>Fiſh</hi> in an incredible number; God of his goodneſſe diſtributing ſome peculiar bleſſings to every Countrey; Notwithſtanding I dare ſay, it's probable, that <hi>Vineyards</hi> have formerly <hi>flouriſhed</hi> in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and that we are to blame, that ſo little is attempted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119037:16"/>
to revive them again. There are many places in <hi>Kent</hi> called by the names of <hi>Vineyards,</hi> and the grounds of ſuch a Nature, that it ſeemeth probable, they have been ſuch. I hear fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by divers people of credit, that by records it appeareth, that the tithes of <hi>wine</hi> in <hi>Gloceſterſhire</hi> was in divers Pariſhes conſiderably great; but at length <hi>Gaſcony</hi> coming into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from whence cometh the moſt of the <hi>ſtrong French Wine,</hi> call'd <hi>high-Countrey wine,</hi> and cuſtomes being ſmall, <hi>wine</hi> was imported into <hi>England</hi> from thence, better and cheaper then we could make it, and it was thought convenient to diſcourage <hi>Vineyards</hi> here, that the greater trade might be driven with <hi>Gaſcoine,</hi> and many ſhips might finde imployment thereby.</p>
                        <p>Some fond Aſtrologers have conceited, that the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown older, and therefore colder hath cauſed the ſun to deſcend many degrees lower to warm and cherriſh it, and one argument which they bring for this opinion is, that <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Silkworms</hi> are found in thoſe Countreys, wherein former times they were unknown: But if theſe fond men had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the good <hi>Husbandry</hi> in theſe times, with the bleſſing of God on it, they had not run into ſuch fooliſh imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This is true indeed, that the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers, who had <hi>Alſatia</hi> given them to live in, which is one of the beſt and moſt <hi>Southern</hi> places of <hi>Germany,</hi> mutined, becauſe they thought it ſo <hi>cold,</hi> that <hi>Vines</hi> ſhould not grow there, and that therefore they ſhould be deprived of that delectable liquor; whereas we find at this preſent day <hi>Vines</hi> flouriſhing many hundred miles more towards the <hi>North,</hi> both in <hi>France, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> and that they are crept down even to the <hi>latitude</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for the <hi>Rheniſh-wines</hi> grew within a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the <hi>Weſt-Southern</hi> places of this Iſle, and <hi>Paris</hi> is not two degrees <hi>South</hi> of us, yet <hi>Vines</hi> grow threeſcore miles on this ſide <hi>Paris,</hi> as <hi>Beaumont;</hi> yea the <hi>Vines</hi> of theſe places are the moſt delicate; for what <hi>wine</hi> is preferred before the neat <hi>Rheniſh</hi> for Ladies, and at table; and truly in my opinion, though I have travelled twice through <hi>France;</hi> yet no <hi>wine</hi> pleaſed me like <hi>Vin D'ache</hi> and of <hi>Paris</hi> eſpecially about
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119037:17"/>
                           <hi>Rueill,</hi> which is a very fine <hi>brisk wine,</hi> and not <hi>fuming</hi> up to the head, and <hi>Inebriating</hi> as other <hi>wines:</hi> I ſay therefore that it is very probable, that if <hi>Vines</hi> have ſtept out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> from them to theſe places, which are even as farre <hi>North</hi> as <hi>England,</hi> and yet the <hi>wines</hi> there are the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that they are not limited and bounded there. For a 100 miles more or leſſe cauſeth little alteration in heat or cold, and ſome advantages which we have wil ſupply that defect. But not to inſiſt too long on <hi>probabilities,</hi> I ſay, that here in <hi>England</hi> ſome <hi>Ingenious Gentlemen</hi> uſually make <hi>wine</hi> very good, long laſting, without extraordinary labour and coſts. To inſtance in one, who in great <hi>Chart,</hi> in the <hi>Wilde of Kent,</hi> a place very moiſt and cold,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Peter Ricard.</hi>
                           </note> yearly maketh 6 or 8 hogs-heads, which is very much commended by divers who have taſted it, and he hath kept ſome of it two years, as he himſelf told me, and it hath been very good; Others likewiſe in <hi>Kent</hi> do the ſame: and lately in <hi>Surrey a Gentle-woman</hi> told me, that they having many <hi>grapes,</hi> which they could not well tell how to diſpoſe of, ſhe, to play the good <hi>Houſe-wife,</hi> ſtampt them to make <hi>verjuice;</hi> but two moneths after drawing it forth, they found it very fine brisk <hi>wine,</hi> cleer like <hi>Rock-water,</hi> and in many other places ſuch <hi>experiments</hi> have been made. I therefore deſire <hi>Ingenious</hi> men to endeavour the raiſing of ſo neceſſary and pleaſant a commodity; eſpecially when <hi>French Wine</hi> is ſo dear here, and I ſuppoſe is likely to be dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; I queſtion not, but they ſhall finde good profit and pleaſure in ſo doing, and that the <hi>State</hi> will give all encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to them: and if the <hi>French Wine</hi> pay <hi>excize</hi> and <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> and the <hi>Wines</hi> here be <hi>toll-free,</hi> they will be able to affoord them far cheaper, than the <hi>French</hi> can theirs, and ſupply the whole <hi>Iſle,</hi> if they proceed according to theſe <hi>Rules.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1 To chooſe the beſt ſorts of <hi>grapes,</hi> which are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for this <hi>Iſle,</hi> and though there are many ſorts of <hi>grapes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Gardiners,</hi> yet I commend four ſorts eſpecially to them; and I deſire that they be very carefull in this particular: for it is the foundation of the work; if you fail in this, you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119037:17"/>
fail in all; for I know that <hi>Burdeaux-Vines</hi> bear very great <hi>grapes,</hi> make <hi>verjuice</hi> onely at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that the tender <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans-Vine</hi> doth not thrive there.</p>
                        <p>The firſt ſort is the <hi>Parſely Vine</hi> or <hi>Canada-grape;</hi> becauſe it firſt came from thoſe parts, vvhere if grovves naturally; and though the Countrey be intolerably cold; yet even in the vvoods vvithout manuring, it ſo farre ripeneth his fruits, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> make <hi>wine</hi> of it for their maſſe; and <hi>Racineè</hi> (vvhich is the <hi>Juice</hi> of the <hi>grape</hi> nevvly expreſt, and boiled to a <hi>Syrupe,</hi> and is very ſvveet and pleaſant) for their Lent-proviſion, as you may read in their <hi>Relations:</hi> and this <hi>Vine</hi> ſeemeth to be made for theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Countreys, becauſe it hath it's leaves very ſmall and juicy, as if it vvere on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to let in the ſun, and it ripeneth ſooner than other <hi>grapes,</hi> as I have obſerved in <hi>Oxford-Graden,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 Sort of <hi>Vine</hi> is the <hi>Rheniſh-grape;</hi> for it grovveth in a temperate Countrey, not much hotter in ſummer then <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> and the <hi>wine</hi> is excellent as all knovv.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Sort is the <hi>Paris-grape;</hi> vvhich is much like the temper of <hi>England,</hi> onely a little hotter in ſummer: this <hi>grape</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a ſmall bunch cloſe ſet together, very hardy to endure <hi>froſts</hi> and other <hi>inconveniencies,</hi> and is ſoon ripe; ſo that the <hi>vintage</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> is ſooner ended then that of <hi>Orleans</hi> or <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux;</hi> and though it be not ſo delicate to the taſte, as ſome other <hi>grapes;</hi> yet it maketh an excellent brisk <hi>wine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4 Sort is the <hi>ſmall Muskadell;</hi> vvhich is a very fine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <hi>grape,</hi> both to eat and to make <hi>wine.</hi> In <hi>Italy</hi> it uſually grovveth againſt their houſes vvalls, and of this they make a ſmall pleaſant <hi>wine,</hi> a moneth or tvvo before the ordinary <hi>Vintage.</hi> It is a tender plant in reſpect of the other <hi>Vines</hi> in the fields: theſe <hi>Vines</hi> I knovv are the moſt convenient for this Iſle; becauſe they bear ſmall bunches, and <hi>grapes</hi> ſoon ripen, and are hardy to endure froſts and ill vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 To chooſe convenient places. For this end, I counſell them, Firſt, to plant <hi>Vines</hi> on the <hi>South-ſide</hi> of their <hi>dwelling houſes, Barnes, Stables,</hi> and <hi>Out-houſes.</hi> The <hi>Gentleman</hi> of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119037:18"/>
                           <hi>Kent,</hi> whom I mentioned before, uſeth this courſe: and to keep the <hi>Vines</hi> from hurting his tiles, and that the winde may not wrong his <hi>Vines,</hi> he hath a frame made of poles, or any kinde of wood, about a foot from the tiles, to the which he tyeth the <hi>Vines;</hi> by this meanes his <hi>Vines</hi> having the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the yard, ſides of the houſes, and tiles do ripen very well, and bear much; ſo that one old <hi>Vine,</hi> hath produced nigh a hogs-head of <hi>wine</hi> in one year: and I wiſh all to take this courſe; which is neither chargeable, nor troubleſome, but very pleaſant; and if all in this <hi>Iſland</hi> would do thus, it's incredible, what abundance of <hi>wine</hi> might be made, even by this petty way.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 If that any <hi>Gentleman</hi> will be at the charge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> let him chooſe a fine ſandy warm hill, open to the <hi>South-eaſt,</hi> rather than to the <hi>South-weſt:</hi> for though the <hi>South-weſt</hi> ſeemeth to be hotter; yet the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> ripeneth better, as I have ſeen in <hi>Oxford Garden;</hi> becauſe the <hi>South-eaſt</hi> is ſooner warm'd by the ſun in the morning; and the <hi>South-weſt</hi> winds, are the winds which blow moſt frequently, and bring raine, which refrigerate the plants; and ſuch a place is very requiſite; for in other places <hi>Vines</hi> do not thrive, even in <hi>France:</hi> for if you travel betwixt <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Orleans,</hi> which is above 30 leagues, yet you ſhall ſcarcely ſee a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> becauſe it is a plain Champian-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. So likewiſe betwixt <hi>Fontarabia</hi> to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> in the <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> parts of <hi>France,</hi> for an 100 miles together; becauſe the land is generally a barren ſandy plaine, where onely <hi>Heath</hi> abounds and <hi>Pine-trees,</hi> out of which they make <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine</hi> &amp; <hi>Rozen,</hi> by wounding of them; and <hi>Tarre</hi> &amp; <hi>Pitch,</hi> by the burning of them: and if any finde ſuch a fine warm hill, and do dung and fence it well, he hath a greater advantage of moſt of the <hi>Vineyards</hi> of <hi>France</hi> by this conveniency, than they have of our <hi>Iſle,</hi> by being a hundred miles more <hi>South;</hi> for moſt of their <hi>Vineyards</hi> are in large fields not encloſed, on land that is ſtony, and but indifferently vvarme. But ſome wil ſay, that the wet weather deſtroyes us. It's true, that the wet will deſtroy all things; <hi>Sheep, Corn,</hi> &amp;c. yet no man will ſay, that therefore <hi>England</hi> will not produce and nouriſh theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119037:18"/>
and if extraordinary wet years come, they ſpoil even the <hi>Vines</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> but take ordinary years and our moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is not ſo great, (though ſome abuſe us, and call <hi>England matula Coeli</hi> but the <hi>Vines,</hi> eſpecially thoſe I have mentioned before, will come to ſuch perfection as to make good <hi>wine:</hi> and if extraordinary raines fall; yet we may help the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity by <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> as I ſhall tell you anon: or at worſt make <hi>vineger</hi> or <hi>verjuice,</hi> which will pay coſts.</p>
                        <p>Further theſe advantages we have of <hi>France.</hi>

                        <p>For there is ſo much irrationality in ſome profeſſions that they muſt be forced even like bruts to underſtand their own good. In <hi>King Edward</hi> the 6 days ſomthing was enacted to this purpoſe, as I am informed.

                        <p n="2">2 It were convenient, that every Pariſh through the Nation ſhould have a ſtock to ſet their poor to work, that the young children and women might not run up and down idle, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or ſtealing (as they do in the <hi>Countrey</hi>) of <hi>Apples, Peaſe, Wood, Hedges,</hi> and ſo by little and little, are trained up for the <hi>Gallowes.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3 That a ſevere law ſhould be enacted againſt thoſe who run up and down and will not worke: for if all know, that they may have work at home, and earne more within doores ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, then by running rogueing up and down, why ſhould they not compell them to it? and though ſome may think the Pariſhes will loſe much by this way; becauſe that the ſtock wrought will not be put off, but with loſſe, as perhaps 10 <abbr>l</abbr> will be brought to 8 <abbr>l</abbr> yet let them conſider how much they ſhall ſave at their doors, how many inconveniencies they are freed from; their hedges in the Countrey ſhall not be pulled, their fruits ſtolne, nor their Corne purloined; and further, that the poor will be trained up to worke, and therefore fit for any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: yea and in their youth, learn a calling by the which they may get an honeſt livelyhood; and I dare ſay, their Aſſeſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the poor, would not be ſo frequent, nor the poor ſo numerous: and the benefit which redounds to the <hi>Nation,</hi> would be very great.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The charitable deeds of our forefathers, ought to be enquired after, that they be not miſplaced, as uſually they are, but be really beſtowed for the good of the poor, that are laborious (as in <hi>London</hi> is begun) and if there be any that will not work, take Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, who beſt knew what was beſt for them.

How advantageous will this be to thoſe who have drained the <hi>Fens,</hi> where queſtionleſſe <hi>Hempe</hi> will flouriſh, and exſiccate the ground. (for <hi>Hempe</hi> deſireth ſtiffe moiſt land, as <hi>Flax</hi> light and dry,) and likewiſe to thoſe in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> where land is very cheape? I hope in a little time <hi>Ireland</hi> will furniſh us with theſe commodities, if we be idle; for there land is very cheap, and thoſe ſeeds need no incloſure; for cattle will not touch them, neither doth it fear the plunderer, either in the field or barn.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It's profitable to the ſower. I know that they uſually va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue an Acre at 10 or 12 <abbr>l</abbr> which coſteth them uſually but half the money. Whether there be <hi>Flax,</hi> that will yield 30 or 40 <abbr>l</abbr>

                        <p n="3">3 To the place where it is ſown; becauſe it ſets many poor to work. I wiſh it were encouraged more in the <hi>North</hi> than it is; becauſe there is many poor, who could willingly take pains, and though <hi>ſpinning of linnen</hi> be but a poor work; yet it is light, and may be called <hi>Womens recreation,</hi> (and in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>beſt Citizens wives</hi> think it no diſgrace to go about <hi>ſpinning</hi> with their <hi>Rocks</hi>) and though in ſome part the poor think it nothing to earn 4 or 6 <abbr>d</abbr> 
                           <hi>er</hi> day, and will as ſoon ſtand with their hands in their pockets, as worke cheap; yet in the <hi>North</hi> they account it well to earne 3<abbr>d</abbr> or 4<abbr>d</abbr> by <hi>ſpinning,</hi> which they may do.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, it would be very beneficiall to this <hi>Nation,</hi> and ſave many thouſand pounds, I may ſay 100 thouſands, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, either in caſh or good Commodities; and we ſhould not be beholding to <hi>Holland</hi> for <hi>fine linnen</hi> and <hi>Cordage,</hi> nor to <hi>France</hi> for <hi>Poldavices, Locrams, Canvaſes, nets,</hi> nor to <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> for <hi>thread;</hi> but might be ſupplyed abundantly with theſe neceſſary commodities even at our own doors.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Lime,</hi> which is made of divers ſorts of <hi>ſtones,</hi> is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing for moſt <hi>Lands,</hi> and produceth a moſt pure grain: 160 buſhels is uſually laid on an Acre, but I ſuppoſe that if men did lay but half the dung on the ground, as they uſually do, as alſo <hi>lime</hi> and <hi>Chalk,</hi> and <hi>dung</hi> and <hi>lime</hi> it oftener, it would be better <hi>Husbandry:</hi> for much <hi>dung</hi> cauſeth much <hi>weeds,</hi> and cauſeth <hi>Corn</hi> to lodge; and too much <hi>Chalke</hi> doth too much force the land, ſo that after ſome good crops, it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth barren many years.

and dew engender a <hi>nitrous</hi> fatneſſe, which is the cauſe of <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility;</hi> but dung is exhauſted by the Sun, as it appeareth by the <hi>folding</hi> of <hi>Sheep,</hi> which profit little, if it be not preſently turned in; therefore a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> if his time would permit, ſhould turne up the ground with an howe for to ſowe <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neps,</hi> as <hi>Gardiners</hi> do.

It's in moſt places in <hi>England,</hi> but not known by all: the beſt markes to know it, is to expoſe it to the Aire, and to ſee if the Sun or Rain cauſe it to ſhatter, and if it be <hi>unctuous,</hi> or rather to take a load or two, and lay it on the midſt of your fields, and to try how it mendeth your lands. It's excellent for <hi>Corne,</hi> and <hi>Paſture;</hi> eſpecially on dry lands. In <hi>Eſſex</hi> the ſcourings of their ditches they call <hi>Marle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and trumpery <hi>(viz.)

But theſe are not in the power of the poor <hi>Husbandman</hi> to remedy; I therefore paſſe them by: yet hope that in little time we ſhal ſee theſe <hi>Inconveniencies remedied;</hi> becauſe they much diſcourage <hi>Improvements</hi> and are (as I ſuppoſe) <hi>badges</hi> of our <hi>Norman</hi> ſlavery.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, it ſeemeth to me very reaſonable, and it wil be a great encouragement to laborious men, to <hi>improve</hi> their barren lands, if that they ſhould have recompence for what they have done, according as indifferent men ſhould judge, when they leave it, as is the cuſtome in <hi>Flaunders.</hi>

                        <p>I have likewiſe obſerved ſome <hi>Deficiencies</hi> in <hi>Woods,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>12</hi> Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Woods.</note> which I ſhall briefly declare, with the beſt way to <hi>Remedy</hi> the ſame.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 It's a great, <hi>fault</hi> that <hi>generally</hi> through the <hi>Iſland</hi> the <hi>Woods</hi> are deſtroyed; ſo that we are in many places very much neceſſitated both for fuel, &amp; alſo for timber for building and other uſes; ſo that if we had not <hi>Coales</hi> from <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> and <hi>Boards</hi> from <hi>Norwey, Plough-ſtaves</hi> and <hi>Pipe-ſtaves</hi> from <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> we ſhould be brought to great extremity: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Mechanickes</hi> would be neceſſitated to leave their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Deficiency,</hi> is that our <hi>Woods</hi> are not ordered as they ſhould be; but though <hi>Woods</hi> are eſpecially preſerved for timber, for building and Shipping; yet at this time it's very rare to ſee a good <hi>Timber-tree</hi> in a <hi>Wood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3 That many of our <hi>Woods,</hi> are very thinne, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with ſuch ſorts of <hi>Wood,</hi> as are convenient for the place.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 That we ſell continually, and never plant or take care for poſterity.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Deficiencies</hi> may be thus <hi>Remedyed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1 To put in execution the <hi>Statutes</hi> againſt <hi>grubbing of Woods,</hi> which are ſufficiently ſevere. Its well known, we have good
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119037:28"/>
lawes; but it's better knowne, they are not executed. In the <hi>Wilde of Kent,</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> which lies far from the <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> and formerly have been nothing but <hi>Woods,</hi> liberty is granted for men to grub what they pleaſe; for they cannot want firing for themſelves, and they are ſo ſeated, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firewood, nor timber can be tranſported elſewhere. I know a <hi>Gentleman</hi> who proffered their good <hi>Oak-timber</hi> at 6 <abbr>s</abbr> 8 <abbr>d</abbr> 
                           <hi>per</hi> tun, and the land in thoſe parts in general is very good. About <hi>Tunbridge</hi> there is land which formerly was <hi>Wood,</hi> is now let for 30 <abbr>s</abbr> 
                           <hi>per</hi> Are; ſo that to keep ſuch lands for <hi>Wood,</hi> would be both loſſe to the <hi>owner,</hi> and to the <hi>Iſland:</hi> But in other parts of the <hi>Iſland</hi> it is othervviſe, and men are much to be blamed for deſtroying both timber and fuel. I have ſeen at <hi>Shooters-hill</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> ſome <hi>Woods</hi> ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed up vvhich vvere good ground for. <hi>Wood,</hi> but novv are nothing but <hi>furze,</hi> vvhich is a great loſſe, both to the <hi>owner</hi> and to the <hi>Countrey.</hi> For the land is made vvorſe then it vvas formerly. I conceive there are Lands, vvhich are as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ordained for <hi>Woods, viz. Mountainous, Craggy, une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven land,</hi> as <hi>ſmall hils</hi> for the <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Olives; plain lands</hi> for <hi>Corne;</hi> and <hi>low moiſt lands</hi> for <hi>Paſture:</hi> vvhich lands if they be ſtubbed, do much prejudice the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 That all <hi>Woods</hi> ſhould have ſuch a Number of Timber-trees <hi>per</hi> Acre, according to the <hi>Statute.</hi> There is a good lavv for that purpoſe, but men delude both themſelves and the lavv, that they every <hi>felling</hi> cut dovvn the <hi>ſtanders</hi> vvhich they left the <hi>folling</hi> before, leaſt perchance they ſhould grovv to be <hi>Timber,</hi> and leave 12 ſmall <hi>ſtanders,</hi> that they might ſeem to fulfil in ſome meaſure the <hi>Statute;</hi> but it's a meer fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie, and cauſeth the <hi>Statute</hi> to fail of it's principal end, vvhich is to preſerve <hi>Timber.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3 The beſt <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt thinneſſe of <hi>woods,</hi> is to plaſh them and ſpread them abroad, and cover them partly in the ground, as every <hi>Countreyman</hi> can direct; by this meanes the <hi>wood</hi> vvil ſoone grovv rough and thick. It's good <hi>Husbandry</hi> likevviſe to fil your <hi>woods</hi> vvith <hi>ſwift growers,</hi> as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119037:28"/>
                           <hi>Aſhes, Sallow, Willow, Aſpe,</hi> which are alſo good for <hi>Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles, Hoopes. Sycamore</hi> is alſo a <hi>ſwift grower.</hi> In <hi>Flaunders,</hi> they have a kinde of <hi>Salix,</hi> called by them <hi>Abell-tree,</hi> which ſpeedliy groweth to be timber.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 That ſome law be made, that they which fel, ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>plant</hi> or <hi>ſowe.</hi> In <hi>Biſcay</hi> there is a law, if that any cut down a <hi>Timber-tree,</hi> he muſt plant three for it, which law is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution with ſeverity: otherwiſe they would ſoon be undone; for the <hi>Countrey</hi> is very mountainous and barren, and dependeth wholly on <hi>Iron Mines,</hi> and on <hi>Shipping:</hi> their <hi>Woods</hi> are not <hi>copſed</hi> there, but onely <hi>Pollards,</hi> which they lop when occaſion ſerveth. I know one, who was bound by his <hi>Land-Lord</hi> to plant ſo many trees yearly, which according he did, but alwayes in ſuch places that they might not grow. In <hi>France,</hi> near to the borders of <hi>Spaine,</hi> they ſowe <hi>Aſhkey,</hi> which when they grow to ſuch a greatneſſe, that they may be ſlit into four quarters, and big enough to make <hi>Pikes,</hi> then they cut them down; and I have ſeen divers Acres together thus <hi>planted:</hi> hence come the <hi>excellent Pikss,</hi> called <hi>Spaniſh-Pikes.</hi> Some Gentlemen have ſowen <hi>Acornes,</hi> and it's a good way to encreaſe <hi>Woods.</hi> Though the time is long, I doubt not but every one knoweth, that it's excellent to plant <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes</hi> along the waters ſide, and <hi>Aſhes</hi> nigh their houſes for firing: for they are good pieces of <hi>Husbandry;</hi> and it's pitty that it's not more put in practiſe. There is a Gentleman in <hi>Eſſex</hi> who hath planted ſo many <hi>Willowes,</hi> that he may lop 2000 every year: if others were as Ingenious, we ſhould not want fire-wood; <hi>Oſiers</hi> planted in low moriſh grounds do advance land from 5 <abbr>s</abbr> 
                           <hi>per</hi> Acre to 40 <abbr>s</abbr> 50 <abbr>s</abbr> 3 <abbr>l</abbr> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; it's much uſed Weſtward of <hi>London:</hi> theſe <hi>Oſiers</hi> are of great uſe to <hi>Basket-makers.</hi> There is a ſort of ſmall <hi>Oſier</hi> or <hi>Willow</hi> at Saint <hi>Omars</hi> in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> which groweth on <hi>Iſlands</hi> which floate up and downe; it's farre leſſe than that which the <hi>Weſterne</hi> men call, <hi>Eights,</hi> with this they make their curious fine <hi>Baskets:</hi> this plant is worth the procuring, being ſo nigh: <hi>John Tredeſcat</hi> hath ſome plants of it. There
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119037:29"/>
is a plant likewiſe in <hi>England</hi> called the <hi>ſweet Willowes;</hi> it's not onely good for ſhade and firing; but as I am inform'd, the leaves do not ſoure the graſſe, but that the cattel wil eat them ſooner than <hi>Hay:</hi> if this be ſo, it may be of ſingular uſe for <hi>Meadowes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5 That thoſe things which mightily deſtroy <hi>Woods,</hi> may be reſtrained, as <hi>Iron-workes</hi> are; therefore the <hi>State</hi> hath very wel done to pul downe divers <hi>Iron-workes</hi> in the <hi>Forreſt of Deane,</hi> that the timber might be preſerved for <hi>Shipping,</hi> which is accounted the tougheſt in <hi>England:</hi> and when it is dry as hard as <hi>Iron,</hi> the Common-people did uſe to ſay, that in <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> dayes the Spaniard ſent an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> purpoſely to get this <hi>Wood</hi> deſtroyed: how true this is I know not; but without queſtion it's admirable <hi>Wood</hi> for Shipping, and generally our <hi>Engliſh Oake</hi> is the beſt in the world for Shipping; becauſe it's of a great graine, and therefore ſtrong: but the <hi>Oakes</hi> of other <hi>Countreys</hi> have a finer graine, and more fit for <hi>Wainſcot;</hi> and in this kinde our Forefathers have been very provident; for we have an Act of long ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, prohibiting <hi>Iron-workes</hi> within 20 miles of <hi>London,</hi> and within 3 miles of the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Thames:</hi> though you may finde <hi>Iron-ſtone</hi> in divers places, as in the great gravel-pit at <hi>Woolwhich.</hi> There are ſome Ingenious men, who lately have got a <hi>Patent</hi> for making <hi>Iron</hi> with <hi>Sea-coale:</hi> I hope they wil accompliſh their deſires; for it would wonderfully advance this <hi>Iſland,</hi> and ſave <hi>Wood.</hi> There are two faults in Sea-coale, in reſpect of melting <hi>Iron-oare.</hi>

                        <p>It's a great <hi>Deficiency</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> vvithout queſtion,<note place="margin">

                        <p n="2">2 Our <hi>Honey</hi> is the beſt in the vvorld, and <hi>Wax</hi> a ſtaple Commodity. Further we know, that that cold <hi>Countreys,</hi> not comparable to ours as <hi>Moſcovia</hi> have farre greater quantity than vve have; ſo that it's incredible vvhat quantity is found in the <hi>Woods,</hi> if <hi>the ſtory of the man</hi> be true, vvho fel up even to the eares in <hi>Honey,</hi> and had there periſhed, had not a <hi>Bear,</hi> on vvhich he caught hold, pulled him out.

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 We are <hi>Deficient</hi> in the ordering of them. Not to ſpeak of the negligence of particular men, which is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: nor to write a general ſtory of the ordering of them; becauſe it requireth much paper: and Mr. <hi>Leveret</hi> and <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler;</hi>

eſpecially the latter, hath written ſo exactly, and upon his own experience that little can be added to it: onely in a point or two I differ from him; of the which I wil ſpeake briefly.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That we muſt take and deſtroy all the <hi>Bees</hi> for their <hi>Honey,</hi> and not drive them, as they do in <hi>Italy</hi> once or twice yearly.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That if a <hi>ſwarme</hi> be poor with little <hi>Honey,</hi> that that <hi>ſwarme</hi> ought to be taken; becauſe it is poore; ſo that the rich ſtockes are deſtroyed, becauſe they be rich, and the poor ſwarmes, becauſe they be poor: ſo that be they rich or be they poore, they muſt be deſtroyed. An <hi>Italian</hi> reporteth, that in the City of <hi>Askaly,</hi> there was a law made, that none ſhould deſtroy a <hi>ſwarme</hi> of <hi>Bees,</hi> unleſſe he had a juſt cauſe; accounting it a part of extream injuſtice and cruelty, to take away without cauſe, both the goods and lives of ſuch good and faithful ſervants. I am credibly informed, that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman beyond the Seas, getteth many 100<abbr>l</abbr> yearly, by keeping <hi>Bees</hi> after a new and Ingenious Manner, which is thus. He hath a roome made very vvarm and cloſe; yet vvith glaſſe-vvindovves, vvhich he can open at his pleaſure, to let the <hi>Bees</hi> fly abroad vvhen he pleaſeth, vvhere he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his <hi>Bees</hi> and feedeth them all vvinter; vvith a <hi>ſweet Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> made of <hi>Moloſſoes, Flowers, ſweet Wine, Milke, Raiſins,</hi> &amp;c. (for vvith ſuch things as theſe, they uſually feed the <hi>Bees</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>) and oftentimes in ſummer, vvhen the vveather is rainy, vvindy, or ſo diſpoſed, that the <hi>Bees</hi> cannot conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently go abroad, he feedeth them at home, vvith divers ſvveet things, and gathereth divers flovvers, and layeth them amongſt them, and ſticketh up many freſh boughes in divers places of his Roomes, that in <hi>ſwarming-time,</hi> they may ſettle on them; by theſe meanes he preſerveth all his ſvvarmes, and gathereth an incredible quantity of <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>wax;</hi> and truly this vvay ſeemeth to me very probable: for</p>
                        <p n="1">1 We knovv the <hi>Bees,</hi> (even as vve ſay of the <hi>Aunts</hi>) vvil vvorke continually, even night and day, vvinter and ſummer,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119037:30"/>
if that they were not hindered by darkeneſſe, cold, and moiſture.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That <hi>Bees</hi> do not onely make <hi>Honey,</hi> (for I ſuppoſe, that they have a peculiar propriety of making <hi>Honey,</hi> as the <hi>Silk-wormes Silk</hi>) out of <hi>Mildewes</hi> or <hi>Honey,</hi> but alſo out of all ſweet things, as <hi>Sugar, Moloſſoes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That many ſweet things may be had, far cheaper than <hi>Honey;</hi> which (I ſuppoſe) the <hi>Bees</hi> wil tranſmute into perfect <hi>Honey.</hi> This way, I conceive, would be very advantageous to us in <hi>England,</hi> for the preſerving of <hi>late ſwarmes,</hi> and alſo for the enriching of <hi>old ſtocks,</hi> ſo that we need not deſtroy them, but might drive them from <hi>hive</hi> to <hi>hive,</hi> and ſet them to work again; and truly I think there is no place in the world ſo convenient for this purpoſe as <hi>England;</hi> becauſe that though our Winters be long, yet they are not very cold; but <hi>Bees</hi> would be ſtirring in them: and further our Summers are ſo ſubject to windes and raines, that many times there is ſcarce a fine day in a whole week: and Further <hi>Moloſſoes, Refuſe Sugar, Sweet Woort, Milke,</hi> &amp;c. may be had at reaſonable rates.</p>
                        <p>I hope ere long to give an exact account of this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſire thoſe who have any Ingenuities in this kind, freely to communicate them. I have not obſerved many things more of importance concerning <hi>Bees,</hi> in my travels; onely in <hi>Italy</hi> they make their <hi>hives</hi> of <hi>thin boards,</hi> ſquare in 2 or 3 partitions, ſtanding either above one another, or very cloſe ſide to ſide, by the which meanes, they can the better borrow part of their <hi>honey</hi> when they pleaſe. In <hi>Germany</hi> their <hi>hives</hi> are made of ſtraw, to the which they have a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-doore, as they call it, which is nigh the top of the <hi>Hive,</hi> that the <hi>Bees</hi> when they are laden, may the more eaſily enter and diſcharge themſelves of their burthens.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 We are to blame, that we do not imploy our <hi>Honeys</hi> in making <hi>Metheglin:</hi> It's true, that in <hi>Hereford-ſhire</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> there is ſome quantity of this liquor made; but for want of good cookery it's of little worth; but uſually of a browne
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119037:31"/>
colour, of an unpleaſant taſte: and as I ſuppoſe commonly made of the <hi>refuſe honey, wax, dead Bees,</hi> and ſuch ſtuffe, as they ordinarily make it elſewhere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the good houſe-wife thinkes any thing good enough for this purpoſe; and that it is pitty to ſpoyle good <hi>Honey</hi> by making <hi>Meade:</hi> but I know that if one take <hi>pure neat honey,</hi> and ingeniouſly clarifie and ſcum and boil it, a liquour may be made not inferiour to the beſt <hi>Sack, Muskadine,</hi> &amp;c. in colour like to <hi>rock-water,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ill odour or favour; ſo that ſome curious Pallates have called it <hi>Vin Greco, rich and racy Canary,</hi> not knowing what name to give it for its excellency: This would bring very great <hi>Profit,</hi> not onely to the <hi>Publique,</hi> by ſaving many 1000<abbr>l</abbr> disburſed for <hi>Wines</hi> through all the world; but would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantageous to private families, who uſe to entertaine their friends very nobly, <hi>Wines</hi> being at preſent intolerably dear and naught; Thope therefore ere long to ſee it put in execution. An excellent drinke not much unlike this may be made of <hi>Sugar, Moloſſoes, Raiſins,</hi> &amp;c. of the which I have already ſpoken, yet thinke it fit to put you in minde of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>

out of its corruption, (as divers ſorts of lice from <hi>Animals</hi>) and that theſe <hi>Inſects</hi> do uſually feed on that plant, out of which they were made, as <hi>Lice</hi> on the ſame <hi>animals</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they were engendred. I know a Gentleman here in <hi>London,</hi> who hath 3 or 400 <hi>Inſects,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">M. <hi>Marſhal.</hi>
                           </note> and can give a very good account of their original feedings. And alſo Mr. <hi>Moreney</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> hath a large book of the ſame ſubject. But to returne to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: I ſay that we had <hi>Silke-wormes</hi> firſt from <hi>Perſia.</hi> In <hi>Juſtinian's</hi> time about 1000 or 1100 years ago, ſome Monkes preſented a few to him at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> where in his time they began to plant <hi>Mulberries:</hi> from thence it came to <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> about 3 or 400 yeares ſince: for the <hi>Auncient Writers</hi> of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> as <hi>Cato, Pallad, Golumell,</hi> do not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe creatures: and at length theſe have paſſed over the Mountains into <hi>France</hi> within an 100 years; where they flouriſh ſo much, that if we will believe their own <hi>Authours,</hi> they bring greater profit than the <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Corne</hi> of that large <hi>Countrey.</hi> I know that <hi>France</hi> hath <hi>Silke</hi> enough to maintaine their exceſſe of apparell, and to export <hi>Pluſhes, Velvets,</hi> &amp;c. Now then if that theſe wormes can thrive, not onely in the parched <hi>Perſia;</hi> but alſo in <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> yea in <hi>France;</hi> which differeth not much from the temper of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> why ſhould we thinke, that they are confined to that place, and muſt move no farther Northward? for they have come many 100 miles toward the <hi>North,</hi> why not one 100 or two more? and further we ſee that <hi>Mulberries,</hi> which is their food, thrive here as well as in any place. But ſome will object, that our Aire is too cold and moiſt. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That thoſe who write of <hi>Silk-wormes,</hi> ſay, that you muſt take heed, that you make not the place too hot: for too much heate may deſtroy; and therefore that you muſt ſet the windowes open to let in the cold Aire.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 We know, that moiſtneſſe of aire rather encreaſeth ſuch <hi>Inſects,</hi> and nouriſheth them. Indeed if moiſture hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it's becauſe that it too much corrupteth their food, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119037:32"/>
cauſeth a flux amongſt them: but this eaſily is prevented, as I ſhall ſhew you anon. But to be ſhort, it is not onely my opinion that <hi>Silke-wormes</hi> will thrive here, but the ſolide judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>King James</hi> and his Council confirmeth the ſame: as you may ſee by his letter to the <hi>Deputy-Lievetenants</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very County; wherein alſo many weighty reaſons are contein'd to convince men of the ſame, which letter followeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, we finde by experience, that <hi>Silke-wormes</hi> wil thrive here, and therefore the matter is out of queſtion: for divers <hi>Ladies, Gentlewomen, Scholars, Citizens,</hi> &amp;c. have nurſed up divers wormes to perfection, though they have had little skil in the managing of them; and likewiſe not ſuch accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations as are neceſſary for them; and more would they have done, if they could have had <hi>Mulberry-leaves.</hi> I am informed that one near <hi>Charing-Croſſe</hi> maketh a good living by them: as alſo another by <hi>Ratliffe-Croſſe;</hi> and therefore if we can bring up an 100, why not a 1000, yea, 100000, if we had food for them? Truly, I know no reaſon to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, neither could I ever finde one that could ſpeak any thing to the purpoſe againſt the buſineſſe. And further I muſt tell you, that the ordering of this <hi>worme</hi> is very eaſie, none need to be bound prentize to the trade; the ſpeciall buſineſſe is to be carefull in feeding them, and keeping them ſweet; which things children uſe to do. He that would learne this Art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, let him read <hi>Boneil,</hi> or an Authour W.S. Printed 1609, about <hi>Mulberries,</hi> and ſold in <hi>Paul's Church-yard,</hi> by <hi>Eleaz. Edgar;</hi> but becauſe that the books are out of print, I will give you a few <hi>Rules.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, endeavour to get ſtore of <hi>Mulberry-trees,</hi> which are of 2 ſorts, the <hi>white</hi> and the <hi>black.</hi> The <hi>white</hi> groweth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and hath a fine leafe, and ſweeteſt, and therefore fitteſt for the young wormes. This is eaſily propagated by <hi>Slips,</hi> as <hi>Quinces, Codlings.</hi> The <hi>Black Mulberry</hi> is difficultly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by <hi>Slips;</hi> but muſt be raiſed from <hi>ſeeds,</hi> ſovven either at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> when the <hi>Mulberries</hi> are eaten: or kept in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119037:32"/>
dry ſand till the ſpring; and then ſowe or howe them in, as other ſeeds and ſtones, and muſt be diligently weeded. This groweth not to be ſo great a tree as the former: the leaves are rougher and harſher, and fitteſt for the wormes. When they are ſtrong and ready to ſpin, when your trees are grown to a good bigneſſe, you may plant them forth, as is uſually done for <hi>walkes</hi> or <hi>Orchards,</hi> or in waſte places, as they do in <hi>Italy,</hi> (for the <hi>Fruit</hi> is little worth, onely the <hi>Leaves</hi> are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,) where I have ſeen the trees as bare of leaves at Mid-ſummer as at Mid-winter. There are 2 ſorts of <hi>Silke-wormes,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Calabrian.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> is the ſmaller and more tender, and maketh a finer ſilke. The <hi>Calabrian</hi> is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more hardy, and maketh more <hi>Silke,</hi> but courſer. This ſort ſeemeth to be the beſt for this <hi>Countrey.</hi> When the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-trees</hi> begin to bud, take the <hi>egs</hi> of your <hi>Silke-wormes,</hi> and lay them on a piece of <hi>ſtuffe</hi> or <hi>ſay,</hi> (ſome uſe to <hi>Bathe</hi> them firſt in warme <hi>Malmſy,</hi> and ſay that it maketh them ſtronger,) and carry them about you in the day in a <hi>Box,</hi> in the night lay them under your <hi>Bed,</hi> or in a warme <hi>Oven,</hi> till the wormes begin to come forth, then lay a piece of paper of the wideneſſe of the box, cut full of holes on them, and on the paper lay <hi>Mulberry-leaves,</hi> and as faſt as they hatch they will crawle forth, and ſtick to the <hi>Mulberry-leaves;</hi> which remove into other <hi>boxes,</hi> till all be hatched: then when they have paſt their ſecond ſickneſſe, feed them on <hi>ſhelves</hi> 2 foot broad and 18 inches one from another: the Roome where you keepe your Wormes, muſt neither be a low place, nor nigh the tiles; but a middle Roome, warme and dry, yet ſometimes a little cold air is good.</p>
                        <p>Take heed of <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Hens, Robinred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſts, Sparrows,</hi> and other birds; for they will eat them.</p>
                        <p>They have 4 <hi>Sickneſſes,</hi> the firſt 12 dayes after they are hatched; and from that time at the end of every 8 dayes: their ſickneſſe laſteth 2 or 3 dayes, and then they are to be fed but very little.</p>
                        <p>The whole time that the wormes do feed, is about nine
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119037:33"/>
vveekes: feed them twice daily at leaſt: at the firſt vvhen they are ſmall, give them a fevv leaves; and as they grovv greater, more, and feed them oftner. Let your leaves be dry and vvell aired upon a Table or cloth before you give them; and gather not your leaves, till the devv be off; and in dry ſeaſons if you can poſſibly, you may keep your leaves gathered 3 or 4 dayes or longer.</p>
                        <p>Keepe your <hi>ſhelves</hi> and <hi>boxes</hi> very clean: but take heed you touch not your vvormes vvith your hands, vvhen you remove them; but move them not vvhen they are ſick.</p>
                        <p>In cold moiſt vveather, ſet a <hi>Pan</hi> of <hi>coales</hi> in the Roome, and burn a little <hi>Benjamin, Juniper,</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially vvhen they are young, <hi>(viz)</hi> the firſt 5 vveekes; but aftervvards, unleſſe it be extraordinary cold, give them Aire, and keep them not too hot, and let the Roome be wel ſented vvith <hi>Herbs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let not your <hi>Wormes</hi> be too thick on the ſhelves: if any dye or be ſick, ſpeedily remove them, leaſt they infect the reſt.</p>
                        <p>As ſoone as by the cleare <hi>Ambour</hi>-colour of your <hi>wormes,</hi> you perceive that they would ſpin; make <hi>Arches</hi> betwixt your ſhelves, <hi>with heath</hi> made clean, branches of <hi>Roſemary, Laven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp;c. where the <hi>wormes</hi> will faſten themſelves, and make their <hi>bottomes</hi> in 2 or 3 dayes, and about 12 or 14 days after, will come forth: before which time, you muſt take away the <hi>bottome,</hi> which you will uſe for <hi>Silke,</hi> and kill the vvorme vvithin, by laying the <hi>bottomes</hi> in the ſun 2 or 3 dayes, or in an hot <hi>Oven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>bottome</hi> vvhich you vvill keep for <hi>ſeed,</hi> lay in a vvarme place, till the <hi>wormes</hi> come forth: which put on ſome pieces of old <hi>Say, Grogran, Velvet,</hi> made faſt to ſome wall: there they will engender, and the Male having ſpent himſelf falleth down and dyeth; ſo the Female, when ſhe hath laid her egs, which egs when they are <hi>gray,</hi> you may gently take them off vvith a knife, and keepe them in a piece of <hi>Say</hi> in a dry place, till hatching time come.</p>
                        <p>The vvinding of the <hi>Silke</hi> off the <hi>bottome</hi> requireth a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vvheel, vvhich an <hi>Artificer</hi> muſt make: 1 <abbr>l</abbr> and 2 ounces of the bottome yieldeth from 1 ounce to 3 of <hi>Silke.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:119037:33"/>An ounce of Spaniſh ſeed yeeldeth ordinarily 6.8. or 10. <hi>li.</hi> of <hi>Silk.</hi> and the <hi>worms</hi> will eat 250. <hi>li.</hi> of <hi>leaves:</hi> the <hi>Calabrian-worms</hi> being greater, do eat nigh 300. weight, and yeeld 11. or 12. pound of <hi>Silk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To conclude, I deſire all men ſeriouſly to conſider, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage this buſineſſe will bring to this <hi>Iſland,</hi> if it be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Truly I know nothing doth hinder but want of <hi>Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-trees,</hi> which will in little ſpace come to a conſidrable greatneſſe. And though I commend thoſe who endeavour to advance this work in <hi>Plantations,</hi> and prefer it before Tobacco; yet I know that it cannot be for want of hands; whereas in <hi>England</hi> we have plenty of women, children, old folks, lame, decrepite. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who are fit to be overſeers of this work. And I wonder Gentlemen do not go about a thing ſo pleaſant and profitable, (for 3, 4, or 5. at moſt will attend as many <hi>worms</hi> as will make 40. or 50, <hi>li.</hi> worth of <hi>Silk,</hi> in 2, or 3. moneths) and the <hi>worms</hi> eat onely leaves, which are of no value: neither is there any conſiderable trouble about the <hi>worms</hi> unleſſe it be the 12. or 15. laſt days. I hope, if that particular men will not endeavour to advance this work for their private profit, yet the <hi>State</hi> will for the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> it being the beſt way I know to ſet all the poor Children, Widdows, old and lame people on work, and likewiſe will ſave this Nation many 100 thouſand pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> And further, the way to accompliſh this work may be done without grievance to the Subject, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to comand every one to plant or ſow ſo many <hi>Mulberry ſeeds</hi> which may eaſily be procured from beyond Seas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I leave States matters to States men, I am none.</p>

as to encreaſe among their people the knowledge and practiſe of all Arts and Trades, whereby they may be both weaned from idleneſſe and the enormities thereof, which are infinite, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſuch induſtries and labours as are accompanied with evident hopes, not onely of preſerving people from the ſhame and grief of penury; but alſo raiſing and increaſing them in wealth and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, the Scope which every free-born ſpirit aime that, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of himſelf onely, and the eaſe which a plentifull eſtate bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to every one in his particular, but alſo in regard of the honour of their Native Countrey, whoſe commendations is no way more ſet forth then in the peoples Activeneſſe and Induſtry. The conſideration whereof, having of late occupied our minde, who alwayes eſteeme our peoples good, our neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations: We have conceived as well by the diſcourſe of our own reaſon, as by information gathered from others, that the making of <hi>Silk</hi> might as well be effected here, as it is in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> where the ſame hath of late years been put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. For neither is the climate of this <hi>Iſle</hi> ſo far diſtinct or differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in condition from that <hi>Countrey;</hi> eſpecially from the hither parts thereto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that it is to be hoped, that thoſe things which by induſtry proſper there, may by like induſtry uſed here, have like ſucceſſe, and many private perſons who for their pleaſure have bred of thoſe worms, have found no experience to the contrary, but that they may be nouriſhed and maintained here, if proviſion were made for planting of <hi>Mulberry-trees,</hi> whoſe leaves are the <hi>food</hi> of the <hi>worms.</hi> And therefore we have thought good thereby to let you underſtand, that although in ſuffering this invention to take place, we do ſhew our ſelves ſomewhat an adverſary to our profit, which is the matter of our <hi>cuſtomes</hi> for <hi>ſilk</hi> brought from beyond the ſeas, will receive ſome dimunition: Nevertheleſſe, when there is queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo great and <hi>publick utility</hi> to come to our <hi>Kingdome</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> in general; and whereby (beſides multitudes of people of both ſexes and all ages) ſuch as in regard of impotency are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for other labour, may be ſet on work comforted and relieved; we are content that our private benefit ſhall give way to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and therefore being perſwaded that no well-affected ſubject will refuſe to put his helping hand to ſuch a work as can have no other private end in us, but the deſire of the welfare of our people,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119037:34"/>
we have thought good in this form onely to require you (as a perſon of greateſt authority in that County, and from whom the generality may receive notice of our pleaſure) with more conveniency then otherwiſe) to take occaſion either at the Quarter-Seſſions, or at ſome other publick place of meeting, to perſwade and require ſuch as are of a ability, (without deſcending to trouble the poor, for whom we ſeek to provide) to buy and diſtribute in that County, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ten thouſand Mul-berry plants, which ſhall be delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them at our City of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the rate of two farthings the plant; or at 6 <abbr>s</abbr> the hundred, containing five ſcore plants. And becauſe the buying of the ſaid plants at this rate may at the firſt ſeem chargeable to our ſaid Subjects, (whom we would be loath to burthen) we have taken order that in March or April next, there ſhal be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſaid place a good quantity of Mulberry-ſeeds, there to be ſold to ſuch as will buy them; by means whereof the ſaid plants will be delivered at a ſmaller rate then they can be afforded being carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from hence: having reſolved alſo in the mean time, that there ſhal be publiſhed in print; a plain inſtruction and direction, both for the increaſing of the ſaid <hi>Mulberry-trees,</hi> the breeding of the <hi>Silk-worms,</hi> and all other things needfull to be underſtood, fur the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of a work every way ſo commendable and profitable, as well to the planter, as to thoſe that ſhall uſe the trade. Having now made known unto you the motives as they ſtand with the publick good wherein every man is intereſſed; becauſe we know how much the example of our own Deputy Lievtenants and Juſtices will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this cauſe; if you and other your neighbours will be content to take ſome good quantities hereof, to diſtribute upon your own lands we are content to acknowledge thus much more in this ditection of ours; that all things of this nature tending to Plantation, increaſe; of ſcience, and works of induſtry, are things ſo naturally pleaſing to our own diſpoſition, as we ſhall take it for an argument of extra-ordinary affection towards our perſon; beſides, the judgement we ſhall make of the good diſpoſitions in all thoſe that ſhall expreſſe in any kind their ready minds to further the ſame: and ſhall eſteem that in furthering the ſame, they ſeek to further our honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment (having ſeen in few years ſpace paſt, that our brother the French King, hath ſince his comming to that crown, both begun and brought to perfection the making of ſilks in his Country, where

For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not to ſpeak of Gun-powder and Printing, nor of the New-world and the wonders there, which notwithſtanding are but of a few 100. years ſtanding: I ſay twenty Ingenuities have been found even in our days, as Watches, Clocks, Way-wiſers, Chains for Fleas, divers Mathematical Inſtruments, Short-writing, Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes, by the which even the ſmalleſt things may be diſcrned, as the egs, eys, legs and hair of a Mite in a Cheeſe: Likewiſe the Seleno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, which diſcovereth mountains in the Moon, divers Stars, and

new Planets, never ſeen till our days. But to return to our pur pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſay that in Husbandry it is even ſo; for the Ancients uſed divers plants which we know not; as the Cytiſus-tree, ſo much commended for Cattel; as alſo their Medick fodder, which <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi> ſaith endureth 10. years, and may be mowen 4 years, 7. times in a year, and one Acre he eſteemeth enough for 3 horſes. This fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der likewiſe is accounted very ſweet and healthfull, whereas the plants which are uſually called Medicaes with us, are annual plants, and have no ſuch rare proprieties. So we are ignorant what their <hi>Far</hi> or fine Bread Corn was, what their <hi>Lupine, Spury,</hi> and an hn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of this kind, as you may read in <hi>Mathiol.</hi> or <hi>Dioſcorides:</hi> ſo on the contrary, infinite are Plants which we have, and they knew not, as well appeareth by their ſmall and our large Herbals; and dayly new Plants are diſcovered, uſefull for Hushandry, Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks and Phyſick; and therefore let no man be diſcouraged from proſecuting new and laudable ingenuities. And I deſire Ingenuous Gentlmen and Merchants, who travel beyond Sea, to take notice of the Husbandry of thoſe parts <hi>(viz.)</hi> what grains they ſow? at what time and ſeaſons? on what lands? how they plough their their lands? how they dung and improve them? what Cattel they uſe? and the commodities thereby? alſo what books are written of Husbandry, and ſuch like? and I intreat them earneſtly, not to think theſe things too low for them, and out of their callings; nay, I deſire them to count nothing trivial in this kind, which may be profitable to their Countrey, and advance knowledge. And truly, I ſhould thank any Merchant that could inform me in ſome trivial and ordinary things done beyond Sea, <hi>(viz.)</hi> how they make <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viare</hi> out of Sturgeons Rows? in <hi>Muſcovia,</hi> how they boil and pickle their Sturgeon, (which we Engliſh in <hi>New-England</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not as yet do handſomely?) how the <hi>Bolognia</hi> Sauſages are made? how they ferment their Bread without Yeſt? of what materials di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of Baskets, Brooms, Frails are made? what ſeed Grout or Grutze is made of? and alſo how to make the <hi>Parmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſane</hi> Cheeſes of <hi>Italy,</hi> which are uſually ſold here for 2. <abbr>

But ſome will object and ſay, that many things are of little worth and profit. To theſe I anſwer, that God hath made nothing in vain, every thing hath his peculiar uſe, and though ſome things ſeem to be of little worth and contemptible, as Sand, Loame, Chalke; yet it hath pleaſed the wiſe Creator to make theſe things very neceſſary for mans comfortable ſubſiſtance, which they that want theſe things can teſtifie: As for example, in <hi>New-England,</hi> where there is no Chalk nor Lime-ſtone, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to burn <hi>Oyſter-ſhells, Cockles,</hi> to make <hi>Lime;</hi> or elſe they could hardly build any houſes. The like I may ſay of Sand and Loam in divers places, where they are wanting.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I ſay that moſt of thoſe things I have ſpoken of, are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in one place or other. To inſtance in ſome of the meaner ſort, at <hi>London Brick-men</hi> give 50 <abbr>l</abbr> per Acre, only for Loam to make Bricks, and pay 3 <abbr>l</abbr> per Acre, of yearly Rent, and are to leave the Land worth the ſame yearly Rent; likewiſe I know a Chalk cliffe in <hi>Kent</hi> not two Acres of ground, valued at many 100 <abbr>l</abbr> and that one Colum of Chalk which is 10. foot ſquare, is valued at 40, or 50 <abbr>l</abbr> at 8 <abbr>d</abbr> 
                           <hi>per</hi> load. The Oker Mines of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> are of great value, and ſo would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that kind, if they could be found; ſo is the Black-lead Mine. Alſo the pits of Clay, Marle, Coale, Turffe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore I deſire all Countrey-men to endeavour to know all ſorts of Stones, Clayes, Earths, Oares, and to teach their Children the uſe of them, that they may know that this ſand is for building, this Loam for Bricks, this Clay for Pots, this Marle for Corn-land: and if that they ſhall find any Stones, Earths, which they know
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119037:39"/>
not, that they would lay them up, till that they meet with ſome ingenious man, that can inform them. The richeſt Mines of the world, have been found out by theſe meanes, if we will believe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories. And this I am ſure of, that by this means, they may much advance their knowledge, and be more profitable to the publique, their Neighbours, and alſo to themſelves.</p>

Not to trouble my diſcourſe with <hi>Spelt, Zea, Tiphine-Wheat,</hi> or <hi>Olew, Far, Siligo, Alica,</hi> which were uſed amongſt the Auntients; but now unknown not only to the Countreyman, but even to the learnedeſt <hi>Botanicks:</hi> ſo I may ſay that the ordinary Yeoman is ignorant of the diverſities of <hi>Barley's,</hi> for there is not only the ordinary <hi>Barly,</hi> but alſo big ſprat-Barly, which hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been ſowen in <hi>Kent</hi> with good profit; alſo Winter-Barly ſowen in Winter, Barly with 4.6. rowes, naked Barly, which require divers diſpoſitions in Land: ſome delighting in finer, others in ſtiffer grounds. So there is alſo Winter and Summer-Rie, and 20. ſorts of Peaſe, the ordinary Schew, the Raith or Early-ripe Peaſe, the Roncivals, Haſtivers, Hotarſes, Gray-Peaſe, Green-Peaſe, Peaſe without skins, Sugar Peaſe, whoſe ſhels are ſweeter then the Peaſe it ſelf, and have been within theſe 10. years plentifully ſowen in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire</hi> with profit; alſo <hi>Fulham, Sandwich</hi>-Peaſe, &amp;c. which require divers ſorts of land and ſeaſons: ſo alſo there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of Oats, white, black, naked, which in <hi>New England</hi>
                           <pb n="69" facs="tcp:119037:39"/>
ſerveth well for Oatmeal without grinding, being beaten as they come out of the barn; <hi>Scotch, Poland,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo Buck-wheat, Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; divers ſorts of Tares, of Hemp and Flax, altogether unknown to moſt Countrey-men, but I hope that hereafter rhey wil be more inquiſitive after them: for divers of them may be of good uſe on their lands.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Defficiency</hi> in this kind, is, that they are ignorant of the Plants and Graſſes which naturally grow among us, and their Uſes, which likewiſe were made for to be food for Cattel, and alſo for the ſervice of man. This ignorance cauſeth them to admire, and to eſteem even as miraculous, ordinary and trivial things; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how it cometh to paſſe, that in one Meddow an Horſe thriveth very much and ſpeedily, and yet a Bullock will not in that place; and contrariwiſe in a Medow cloſe by the former, the Bullock will thrive, and the Horſe not: ſo alſo how it commeth to paſſe that Conies and Sheep will thrive well, where there is ſcarcely any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and yet come to nothing on Commons, where there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantity of Paſture; which proceedeth from this cauſe, that ſome kind of Plants are more agreeing and ſweeter to one ſort of Cattel then to another, and every Beaſt almoſt hath ſome Plant or other, which they love exceedingly. I ſuppoſe, that the obſervances of this kind, might be very uſefull in Husbandry. Theſe <hi>Deficiencies</hi> I will draw to three Heads.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I ſay that divers Plants (not to ſpeak of Fruits, becauſe we have already ſpoken of them) that grow naturally in our Iſland, may be very ſerviceable to the Husbandman, both for his Paſtures and Corn-lands. To inſtance in ſome few: we ſee that divers ſorts of wild Vetches, Chiches, Tares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> grow wild in divers places which though they bear not ſo great and large crops, as ſome others alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy uſed; yet who knoweth what they would do, if they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured as other grains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in land proper for them: for we ſee that the transplanting of Plants into gardens, doth very much meliorate or better them; and without doubt all thoſe grains which are in uſe with us, were at firſt picked out of the fields and woods; and by ingenious men found uſeful for man or beaſt, and of late divers have been found not known to our forefathers, as Saint Foin Lucern; and why may not we find divers Graſſes, Vetches, Medicaes, Wild Peaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which as yet are ſcarce taken notice of.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="70" facs="tcp:119037:40"/>2. There grow divers ſorts of wild Peaſe, but to ſpeak of two onely.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Sort which groweth on the ſtony beaches of the ſea, where there is little or no earth, the roots are many foot deep in the ground. In Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days in a dearth, the poor people ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered divers ſacks full of them, and they were no ſmall relief, to to them, who hath tried whether they would thrive better on bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter land?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Sort groweth on dry barren land, and is commonly called the everlaſting Peaſe; which continually groweth out of the ſame root. In Gardens I have ſeen it grow 10 years together, and larger at the 10 years end, then at the firſt. I have alſo ſeen it flouriſh on barren grounds, where Oats were burned away: who knoweth but theſe and other Plants may be ſerviceable, if not for man, at leaſt for beaſts or Pigeons; for in New-England the great flights of Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are much maintained by theſe, I am ſure it were good to make experiments of theſe and divers others.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Head, is the <hi>Ignorance of the MechanicaI uſes of Herbs and Trees,</hi> for even for theſe uſes moſt Plants have ſome peculiar propriety. To inſtance in a few. We know that Elm is for wheels; and tbe beſt wood to make Herrings red, Oak is for the Shipwright, Joyner, Tanner; Horn-beams, Beech, for the Milwright; Line-tree for baſs-ropes; old Elder without pith is very tough and fit for Cogs of Wheels, Tooth-pickers; Pear-tree for Mathematical inſtruments and ingravers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oſiers for baskets; Walnut for Gunſtocks; Aſp for Hoops; Box, Aſh for a 100 uſes; and much more might be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of this kind, if time would permit. So likewiſe divers Plants are for Painters, as you may ſee in <hi>Battees</hi> experiments: ſome for the Dyers, but as yet we know but four, (<hi>viz.</hi> Woad, Would, Green-wood, and Madder) amongſt 1200 Plants &amp; upward; which grow wild with us. I could wiſh ſome ingenious man would take the pains to ſearch out the Mechanical uſes of Plants; ſurely it were a good way to advance Mechanicks, who in their callings uſually go round; as horſes in a mill, and endeavour very little to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or know the cauſes of their operations, I know a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who promiſeth ſome things in this kind, and I hope will be as good as his word.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Head, is the ignorance of the very Phyſical uſes of Plants: for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119037:40"/>
though many hundred Plants do grow amongſt us; yet but few of them are uſed Phyſically: whereas there is ſcarce any one but may be uſefull in this kind. And truly in my opinion it is a great fault that we ſo much admire thoſe things, that are far fetched and dear bought; when as oft-times they are gathered in unſeaſonable times, and corrupted by long voyages by ſea, counterfeited by Merchants; yea we have very oft <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and rank poyſons, and do neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thoſe medicines which God hath given us here at home. I am credibly informed that in former times, <hi>Virga aurea</hi> was in great uſe with us. and uſually ſold for eight pence <hi>per ounce,</hi> and brought from France: but ſo ſoon as it was found growing plentifully in our hedges, it was caſt forth of the Apothecaries ſhops, as of little vertue. And though ſome will object, that our Plants have little vertue. I ſay its falſe; for God hath tempered them for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions: and we ſee very oft that one ſimple medicine doth more good then the great compoſitions of the ancients, which are rather <hi>ad pompam</hi> then for health, and ſeem to ſavour ſomewhat of the <hi>Mountebank;</hi> becauſe <hi>Opium</hi> is alwayes an ingredient. And further we ſee, that where any Endemicall or National diſeaſe reigneth, their God hath alſo planted a ſpecifique for it: As the <hi>Cochleare</hi> or <hi>Scurvy-graſſe</hi> for the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, where it is very frequent, and alſo in <hi>Holland, England.</hi> So in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> (from whence the great <hi>Pox</hi> firſt came, and where it reigneth very much, that not only man, but other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are infected with it, ſo that even <hi>Dogs</hi> die of that diſeaſe in our <hi>Northern</hi> Plantations, perhaps catching this infection, by mingling with <hi>Indian Dogs,</hi>) there grow the ſpecifiques for this Diſeaſe, as <hi>Gujacum, Salſaperilla, Saſſafras,</hi> and the <hi>Salvages</hi> do eaſily cure theſe diſtempers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Further we ſee, that even the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures, can find not only meat, but alſo Medicines for themſelves; as the <hi>Dog, Couchgraſs</hi> for a vomit: the <hi>Dove, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vein;</hi> the <hi>Weaſel Kue;</hi> the <hi>Swallow, Celandine,</hi> the <hi>Toad Plantine;</hi> and where is our reaſon that we cannot?</p>
                        <p>I therefore deſire all Countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>people, to endeavour to know theſe Plants which grow at their doores: (for God hath not planted them there for no purpoſe; for he doth nothing in vain,) and to collect together the plain ſimple <hi>Medicaments</hi> of their <hi>Grand<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="1">1. To begin with the <hi>Elephant,</hi> the greateſt, wiſeſt, and longeſt lived of all Beaſts: which abound very much in the Eaſtern parts of the world; as <hi>China, India,</hi> and are accounted very ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both for the Warres, and for carriage (15. men uſually ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on his back together) they are not chargeable to keep; why may they not be of uſe even here, when I am credibly informed, an <hi>Elephant</hi> lived divers years here in a Park? ſo that they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the coldneſs of this Climate.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Buffle,</hi> which is as big as an <hi>Ox,</hi> and ſerviceable both for the Plough, and for their Milk: their skins make the beſt <hi>buffe,</hi> they will fare very hard, and live in <hi>Fens</hi> and <hi>bogs,</hi> where nothing elſe can. In the Duke of <hi>Florences</hi> Countrey near <hi>Piſa,</hi> are many of them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The honeſt and patient <hi>Aſſe,</hi> which was very much uſed in the old time for carriage, (as the Horſe for the War, and the Oxe for the Plough,) and in many Countries at this time; they will eat Thiſtles, and live even with nothing. They may ſave poor men (who are not able to keep an Horſe, becauſe he is a great feeder,) much labour.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Mules,</hi> which is a very ſtrong and proud beaſt, and will carry far more then an Horſe, and are more ſure footed. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they might be ſerviceable to the Carriers here, as they are beyond the Seas.</p>

alſo divers ſorts of Fowls, of good uſe; as a kind of Duck with a crooked bill, which layeth conſtantly as Hens do, as alſo Hawks of divers ſorts of good value, which perhaps the Countrey-man loveth not; becauſe they are enemies to his Poultry.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, that we do not endeavour to advance the beſt kinds of this Cattel, which are amongſt us. And</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To begin with horſes. The French-man that writeth a book called the Treaſure politick, ſaith, that in England in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>hs</hi> days, we had not above 3 or 4000 horſe worth any thing for the war, and thoſe onely in Noblemens ſtables, which thing perhaps did the more incourage the Spaniard to invade us; but at this time we are known to have very many thouſand of horſe not inferiour to the beſt in the world: yet I ſuppoſe, that we might much meliorate our breed by Spaniſh Jennets, Barbary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we are not ſo careful to increaſe good horſes as we ſhould be.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We are too negligent in our kine, that we advance not the beſt ſpecies: for ſome ſorts give abundance of milk, and better then others: ſome ſorts are larger, more hardy, and will ſooner fat, <hi>&amp;c. Lancaſhire</hi> and ſome few Northern Counties, are the onely places where they are a little careful in theſe particulars.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We are not curious in procuring the beſt ſorts of ſheep, for greatneſſe, ſoundneſſe, and fine wool. I wonder that ſome of our ſheep-maſters have not procured of thoſe exceeding fine-woolled ſheep of Spain; whoſe wool coſteth the Mrchant nigh 10 <abbr>s</abbr> 
                           <hi>per pound,</hi> before it is exported: I ſuppoſe that it would for a time mend our wool, if not continue ſo for ever: for theſe ſheep were firſt carried forth out of England, if we may beleeve ſtories, <hi>Spain</hi> not affording ſuch ſheep before. Dutch ſheep, are reported to have two or three Lambs ordinarily. Dutch ſheep are very great, with great tailes; but their wool is very courſe, not onely becauſe of their courſe feeding; but alſo becauſe in hot countries, they ordinarily mingle with Goats, and therefore in <hi>Venice</hi> ordinary Porters will ſcarce eat any Mutton. And here I cannot but relate, that all ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers very much wonder at 2 things in our ſheep, (not to ſpeak of the fineneſſe of wool,) And</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That our ſheep if they be ſound, ſeldome or never drink, even in Summer; though they go on the drieſt Chalky lands: as it plainly appeareth in Kent, where there is ſcarce water for the great
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119037:42"/>
Cattel, which proceedeth from the moiſture of our air, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of rains and dews.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That our ſheep do not follow their ſhepheards as they do in all other Countries: for the Shepheard goeth before, and the ſheep follow like to a pack of dogs, this diſobedience of our ſheep, doth not happen to us, as Papiſt Prieſts tell their ſimple flocks; becauſe we have left their great ſhepheard the Pope; but becauſe we let our ſheep range night and day in our fields without a ſhepheard; which other Countries dare not for fear of Wolves and other rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous beaſts, but are compelled to guard them all day with great dogs, and to bring them home at night, or to watch them in their folds.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Deficiency</hi> in this kind, is the neglect of Fiſh-ponds, which are very profitable: for fiſh uſually live by ſuch worms and flies as are ingendred in the ponds, and require no charge. Concerning the ordering of them, and the profit of them, read Mr. <hi>Vaughans Golden Grove.</hi> And ſurely it would be a great benefit to this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, if we had fiſh at reaſonable rates. I cannot therefore paſſe by two extream abuſes, which exceedingly deſtroy fiſh, and are in no wiſe to be permitted.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That divers poor men keep many Swine, and in nets, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe catch many veſſels of the young fry of fiſh and feed their Swine with them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Fiſhermen in the River have the meaſhes of their nets ſo ſtreight, that they take many ſorts of fiſh, when they are too ſmall, and do deſtroy more fiſh then they take. I hope theſe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes wlll be reformed with all ſeverity. To this head I may adde Decoys, which are very frequent in <hi>Holland,</hi> and profitable; but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare with us in <hi>England:</hi> yet it may be very profitable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Deficiency, is the ignorance of the inſects of this Iſland. And though it may ſeem ridiculous to many, to affirm that <hi>Magots, Butterflies,</hi> ſhould be of any importance; yet I deſire them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that we have our Honey, the ſweeteſt of foods from <hi>Beas,</hi> which are Cattel of this kind: alſo all our <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="1">1. That we are ignorant of the divers Diſeaſes of Cattel and their Cures. Not to runne over all the diſeaſes of Cattell and their Cures, which would be too long, and you may read them in Mr. <hi>Markams</hi> works, the Countrey Farmer, and others. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in two, which ſome years ſweep away Cattel, as the Plague doth men, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Murreine amongſt great Cattel, and the Rot amongſt Sheep. And though divers have wrote concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cures of theſe Diſeaſes; yet we do not find that effect which we deſire: and therefore I hope ſome will attempt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this Deficiency, and write a good Treatiſe about the Diſeaſes of Cattel. Of theſe 2. Diſeaſes, I ſhall briefly declare my mind: And.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Of the Murreine, which proceedeth from an inflamation of the blood, and cauſeth a ſwelling in the throat, which in little time ſuffocateth the Cattel. The eſpecial Cauſes of this Diſeaſe, are an hot and dry ſeaſon of the year; which dryeth up the waters, or at leaſt doth ſo putrifie them, that they are unwholſome; and alſo the letting of Carrion lie unburied. This Diſeaſe is thought to be infectious; but perhaps it may proceed from one common cauſe, as the rottenneſs of Sheep. The beſt way to keep your Cattel from this Diſeaſe, is to let them ſtand in cool places in ſummer, &amp; to have abundance of good water, and ſpeedily to bury all Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and if any of your Cattel be infected, ſpeedily to let them blood, and to give them a good drench, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by theſe meanes divers have preſerved their Cattel; when their Neighbours have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Concerning the rot of Sheep, not to ſpeak of the Pelt-rot, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119037:43"/>
Sheep that are ſtarved; but of the ordinary rot, called by ſome the white rot, and is a kind of dropſie, their bellies are full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and their liver diſcoloured. I have ſeen out of the livers of ſheep tending to rottenneſſe, living Creatures, leaping like ſmall <hi>Flounders;</hi> which without queſtion in little time will deſtroy the liver, and conſequently produce an indiſpoſition not unlike to the Rot. The common people ſay, that theſe worms are cauſed by the over-heatings of ſheep, and that Rottenneſſe proceedeth from a plant called <hi>Cotyledon,</hi> or <hi>Marsh Penny-wort,</hi> which is of a very ſharp taſte, and therefore not likely that ſheep will eat it; but it may be a ſigne of wet rotten Land, as broom is of ſound and dry land. This is certain, that in wet moiſt years, ſheep die very much of the Rot; and in dry years on the ſame ground, they hold ſound: and yet I have heard that in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is far moiſter then <hi>England,</hi> rottenneſſe of ſheep is not known. It were therefore well worth the labour of an ingenious man, to inquire into the cauſes of theſe indiſpoſitions in ſheep.</p>
                        <p>The meanes, which have been found very effectual for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe Diſeaſes, are theſe: firſt, to drive your ſheep up to dry Lands, or to keep them in the fold, till the dew be off the graſſe, or to feed them ſome dayes with fine dry hay, eſpecially of ſalt Meadow, or to put them into ſalt Marſhes; for in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſheep never rot, or to drive them to ſome ſalt River, and there to waſh them, and make them drink of the water, this will kill the skab, and alſo the ticks, and faſten the wooll; but if you have not the conveniencies before ſaid, then rub their teeth with ſalt, or rather make a ſtrong pickle with ſalt and water, and force them to drink thereof. Some dry Pitch in an Oven, and add to the pickle, and have found very good ſucceſs: for theſe Medicines do exoficcate the ſuperfluous humidities, open obſtructions, and kill worms. Some commend the Antimonial Cup, as a catholick Medicine againſt all Diſeaſes of cattel.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We are ignorant of divers ingenuities, concerning feeding and fatting of Cattel and other Creatures. To inſtance in ſome; And</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Of the Horſe who is a great feeder. In <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Hartford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> they uſually cut all their <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Peaſe</hi> ſmall, and give them with their Chaffe; by this means the Horſes ſooner fill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119037:43"/>
and eat all the ſtraw up: ſome put his Horſe-meat into a bag, and ſo order it that a little only lyeth in the Manger; which when that is eaten up, more falleth down, and not before; by this way Horſes do not blow their meat, nor throw it out of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with their Noſes. A further good peece of Husbandry they uſe, which is this, when their Horſes are well fed at night, they fill the Rack with Wheat or Barly-ſtraw, and ſo leave them; the Horſe perceiving that that which is in the rack is not very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, lyeth down and taketh his reſt, which is as good to him as his meat: if he riſe in the night, and fall to the rack and manger, as he uſually doth, and findeth nothing but ſtraw, he ſleepeth till the morning; but if it be Hay, Tares, or Peaſe, the Jade will pull it all down and ſpoil it, and likewiſe will be hindred from his reſt; by the which double damage doth inſue. <hi>Currying</hi> and dreſſing of horſes ought not to be forgot, it is half as good as their meat. Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and Elecompaine roots are the eſpecial ingredients for this Phyſick. 2. Of the feeding &amp; fatting of Cows. We uſually feed Cattel with ſtraw in racks in the yard, or turn them to the fields, and there let them feed as much and how they pleaſe; which hath many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences: as firſt Cattel ſpoil as much with their heels as they eat, eſpecially if the ground be moiſt, or if the Flie be very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and they blow and ſtench and tumble much, and if the Flie be buſie they run up and down, and over-heat themſelves, and fat very little, ſo that oftentimes in <hi>Iune</hi> or <hi>Iuly</hi> they fatten as little as at Chriſtmas, and moſt of their dung is loſt by theſe means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in <hi>Holland</hi> they do thus: They keep their Cattel houſed winter and ſummer; for the Winter-proviſion, they lay in not onely hay, but alſo grains,) which they buy in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and bury in the ground:) and alſo Rape-ſeed Cakes, and ſow Turneps, not onely for themſelves, but their Cows alſo; with the which Turneps being ſliced, and their tops, and Rape-ſeed Cakes, and grains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they make meſhes for their Cows, and give it them warm; which the Cows will ſlop up like Hogs, and by this means they give very much milk. In the Summer time they mow the great Clover-graſſe, and give it them in racks; ſo that their Cattel are not troubled with the pinching froſts nor rains, nor with the parching Sun in Summer, neither with the Flie, nor do they over-heat themſelves or ſpoil half ſo much meat; and are always as fat
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119037:44"/>
as their Maſters, or Bacon-hogs. The Dung and Urine they charily preſerve, and thereby keep their meadows of Clover-graſſe (which are conſtantly mowen twice or thrice yearly) in good heart: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Cattel ought not to go amongſt Clover-graſſe, becauſe it uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally groweth with long Haum (as they call it) like Peaſe, which if it be broken will not thrive. In Bermudas they have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar way of fattening their Cattel, not uſed any where elſe that I know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is with Green Fennel, that groweth in that Iſland plentifully.</p>
                        <p>There is a plant in Eſſex called Myrchis or Cow-purſley, which groweth faſt and early in the ſpring, which they give their Cattel at the beginning of the year, and they eat it well.</p>
                        <p>It is an ill cuſtome that is uſed almoſt every where, to let Hogs lie in their dirt and dung, when they are fattening; for all creatures generally do hate and abhor their own dung: and an hog is the eleanlieſt of all creatures, and will never dung nor ſtale in his ſtie, if he can get forth, which other creatures will: and though he tumble in the dirt in Summer; yet that is partly to cool himſelf, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to kill his lice, for when the dirt is dry, he rubbeth it off, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the lice thereby.</p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>Hugh Platts</hi> in his writings ſetteth down divers ingenious ways of fattening Poultry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and more may be found out day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Jews have a peculiar way of fattening Geeſe, with Milk, Figs, Raiſins, and other ſweet things, by which they make the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of an extraordinary greatneſſe, and is a diſh much valued by them.</p>
                        <p>In Moor-fields there is one that keepeth many hundreds of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys with grains and bran: and ſome others who keep the great laying Ducks, with theſe things and bloud, to their great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. I have ſeen a book tranſlated out of French, which teacheth how to gain divers hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> by fifty pound ſtock in hens. I ſuppoſe about <hi>London</hi> where Eggs are ſo dear, great profit might be made by them. Turkeys may be kept with good profit, where there are many Meadows as in Suffolk. In <hi>Bark-ſhire</hi> many keep tame Pheaſants, and have gained well thereby.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We do not know how to improve the comodities proceeding
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119037:44"/>
from Cattel to the higheſt: as for example our ordinary butter might be better ſcented and taſted: ſome Ladies have fine ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in this kind. We cannot make Cheeſe comparable to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſan, nor ſo good as the Angelots of <hi>France,</hi> our ordinary Cheeſe is not comparable to the Holland Cheeſes, where alſo divers ſorts of Cheeſes are made of divers Colours: but I cannot much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their green Cheeſes, which are made of that colour by Sheeps-dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I hope in ſhort time our good Houſ-wifes wil ſcorn that any ſhall excel them.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. <hi>Deficiency, Is the want of divers things,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>20.</hi> Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, Of the want of divers things which are neceſſary for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
                           <hi>which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the accompliſhment of Agriculture</hi>—As</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That we have not a <hi>Syſtema</hi> or compleat book of all the parts of Agriculture. Till the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days, I ſuppoſe that there was ſcarce a book wrote of this ſubject; I never ſaw or heard of any. About that time: <hi>Tuſſer</hi> made his verſes, and <hi>Scot</hi> wrote about a Hop-garden, <hi>Gouge</hi> tranſlated ſome things. Lately divers ſmall Treatiſes have been made by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as Sir <hi>Hugh Platts, Gab. Platts, Markham, Blith,</hi> and <hi>Butler,</hi> who do well in divers things; but their books cannot be called compleat books, as you may perceive by divers particular things, not ſo much as mentioned by them. The Countrey Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tranſlated out of French is enough; bt its no ways framed, or ſquared for us here in England: and I fear the firſt Authors went on probabilities and hear-ſays rather then experience, I hope ſome ingenious man will be incouraged, to undertake a work ſo neceſſary and commendable.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, that Gentlemen try ſo few experiments for the advance of this honeſt and labourious calling; when as many experiments might be made for a ſmaller matter; for half a Pole ſquare, will give as certain a demonſtration, as an Acre, and a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as a Hogſhead. I hope in time there will be erected a Colledge of experiments, not onely for this, but alſo all other Mechanicall Arts.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, That Gentlemen and Farmers do not meet and communicate ſecrets in this kind, but keep what they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented themſelves, or known, from others; as <hi>Sybils</hi> leaves: I mean as rare ſecrets, not to be communicated. I hope that we ſhal ſee a more communicative ſpirit amongſt us ere long. And Sir I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119037:45"/>
but deſire you, if you have any things more in your hands of <hi>Gabriel Platts,</hi> or any mens elſe, that you would with ſpeed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, That we want a place to the which men may reſort for to find ſuch ingenious men, as may be ſerviceable for their ends and purpoſes; and alſo know where to find ſuch ſeeds and plants as they deſire, as the great <hi>Clover-graſſe, Saint Foin, La Lucern,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, That men do uſually covet gteat quantities of land; yet cannot manage a little well. There were amongſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romans ſome appointed to ſee that men did Til their lands as they ſhould do, and if they did not. to puniſh them as enemies to the publick; perhaps ſuch a law might not be amiſſe with us: for without queſtion the publick ſuffereth much, by private mens negligences; I therefore wiſh men to take <hi>Columel</hi>'s Councel; which is, <hi>Laudato ingentia Rura, Exiguum Colito.</hi> For <hi>melior eſt culta exiguitas,</hi> &amp;c. as another ſaith, or as we ſay in Engliſh, <hi>A little Farm well tilled is to be preferred:</hi> for then we ſhould not ſee ſo much waſt land, but more induſtry, greater crops, and more peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imployed, then are at this preſent, to the great profit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>

                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>21</hi> Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, that becauſe of our ſins we have not the bleſſing of God upon our labors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note>21. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, <hi>That by reaſon of our ſins we have not the bleſſing of the Lord upon our Labours.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this the reaſon, that although the Husbandman hath been laborious and diligent in his calling theſe laſt years; yet our Crops have been thin, his Cattel ſwept away, and ſcarcity and famine hath ſeized on all parts of this Land; and if we had not been ſupplyed from abroad, we had quire devoured all the Creatures of this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland for our ſuſtenance, and yet we could not be ſatisfied, but muſt have devoured one another. And therefore to conclude, though I deſire the Husbandman to be diligent and laborious in his calling, yet I counſel him to <hi>break off his ſins by Repentance,</hi> to have his eys towards him who is the <hi>Giver of every good thing,</hi> and to pray daily to him for his bleſſings, who <hi>giveth freely to them that ask, and upbraideth not.</hi> And although all callings ought to look up to him that is <hi>on high;</hi> yet rhe Countrey-man eſpecially; for he hath a more immediate dependance on him then any other: for if the Lord with-hold his <hi>fat dew from Heaven,</hi> or the <hi>former
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119037:45"/>
or later Rain, it is in vain</hi> that the Husbandman <hi>riſe up early, and go to bed late, and eat the bread of earofulneſſe:</hi> for we know, that it is the Lord <hi>that maketh barren places fruitfull,</hi> and he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>that turneth fruitfull Lands into barrenneſſe,</hi> (as the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was very fruitfull even in the time of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but now a barren deſart) and therefore, I again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Countrey-man to walk as it becommeth a <hi>Christian, in all Sobriety, Righteouſneſſe and Godlineſſe: not to truſt to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his own labours,</hi> and good Husbandry; <hi>but on the Lord that hath made all things:</hi> for though even <hi>Paul himſelf doth plant, and Apollo doth water; yet it is onely the Lord that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth increaſe</hi> and plenty, <hi>which he will not deny to thoſe that fear him; for they ſhall want nothing that is good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus Sir, I have written to you very largely my thoughts concerning the Husbandry of this Iſland, and partly what I have ſeen in many travels. Good Sir, be not offended at my long and impertinent ſtories, my rude language, and unmethodical diſcourſe. It was, if not to ſatisfie; yet ſomwhat to gratifie the univerſal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your ſpirit, and care of the publick, which God hath inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you withall. And theſe are onely my firſt thoughts, which in haſte I have hudled up together. I hope (if the Lord ſend life and health) my ſecond thoughts ſhall be better: But whatſoever I have done, pray look on it, as comming from one who is deſirous to ſerve you, and to advance the Publick good, according to the talent the Lord hath given him.

                        </opener>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſeveral things obſerved and ſet down during my ſtay in the Country, are theſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. I Learned the whole way and art, of making and ordering of Woad, <hi>viz.</hi> the time when they ſow it, when firſt they weed it, and cut it. I ſaw the manner of their gathering it, grinding, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, drying it, and after ſweating, and curing it. Informing my ſelf of the whole charge and profit of it: have made divers Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on it, and taken order for ſome ſeed to be ſent to me, for other more compendious and profitable trials, anſwerable to the Nature and Philoſophy of it,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This and ſome other things, gave me occaſion to make the beſt inquiry I could of Houſewives and of Fowlers, for all ſorts of dying weeds, and herbs, uſed in the dying of wool; or of nets, which I have carefully collected to improve to a more then ordinary uſe; ſome being very remarkable.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Among other generall inquiries and adventures, I heard of one at <hi>Ware,</hi> that charr'd Sea-coal; procured an errand and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations thither; went, was civilly uſed, and ſatisfied in the truth and manner of the thing, and found the Gentleman who was the firſt Author of it to be one <hi>Airs,</hi> now dead an ingenious man, a great Malſter, made much profit of it: it drying Malt as ſweet as if the Sun it ſelf did it; it is cheaper then either wood or ſtraw; and may be many otherways applied.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I went into the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> to ſee one of the Holland-mills for dreyning; though ſet up there and kept by certain Frenchmen. The Invention ſeemed to me but mean and rude, and Mr. <hi>Wheelers</hi> way much more ingenious.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. I ſaw at <hi>Wickleſon</hi> the manner of your <hi>Holland Sluces.</hi> The ruines alſo of a <hi>Cochlea,</hi> for the emptying and dreining of water, of which <hi>Vbaldus</hi> hath writ a whole Treatiſe. Likewiſe a pretty kind of <hi>Pinnace</hi> with Ordnance, ſomewhat like a cloſe <hi>Liter,</hi> but flat-bottommed; which rowed with wheels inſtead of Oars, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it ſeems formerly with admirable ſucceſſe, for the taking in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119037:46"/>
of <hi>Crowland,</hi> and which gave me a proof of what I for many years have thought poſſible, and of very great uſe and ſervice, and ſtill think it of unknown value, if it were skilfully indeed framed, and applyed as it might be.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Lord <hi>F. W.</hi> aſſured me of a Gentleman in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> that made above 10000. <abbr>
                              <hi>l.</hi>
                           </abbr> ſterl. of a piece of ground, not 40. yards ſquare, and yet there was neither Mineral nor Mettal in it, He after told me, it was onely a ſort of fine Clay, for the making a choiſe ſort of earthen ware; which ſome that knew it ſeeing him dig up, diſcovered the value of it, and ſending it into <hi>Holland,</hi> received ſo much money for it: it is a ſtory not to be deſpiſed.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. His Lordſhip told me the way of making of <hi>Spunk</hi> or <hi>Touch wood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Lordſhip's Bailiff, ſhewed me a ſmall plat of ground, ſcarce an Acre and half, wherein he aſſured me, he had in one year 21. hundred of <hi>Hops;</hi> and falling out then to be ſcarce in other places, he made of that ſmall parcel of ground 4. ſcore. <abbr>
                              <hi>l.</hi>
                           </abbr>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. At <hi>Milton</hi> I ſaw a Spring, that might have been made big enough to ſerve a large Town; which my friend <hi>Wheeler</hi> had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered, and broke up; every man oppoſing him in it, and deriding his confidence, till he made it appear, and ſhamed them. Hereupon he gave me ſeveral marks of knowing and finding out Springs under ground.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. From Springs we converted our diſcourſe to Pipes, for the carrying along of Water under ground to any Houſe or Town; wherein he imparted ſome Secrets to me, both of the fitteſt Wood and Trees for Pipes, and preſerving them whole Ages from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ways extreamly rational, and not hitherto obſerved or found out by any.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. This drew on ſome diſcourſe of woods, their differences and ſeveral applications: in which he told me many ſingular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. After this, I ſaw at <hi>Melton</hi> an excellent Model of a Garden, Orchard, and Walks; and being further curious, my friend related a Witty invention he once put in practiſe, to plant an Orchard in a Moriſh place, where never grew a Tree.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. I caſually met with one <hi>Boughton,</hi> a moſt ſingular rare man in carving or cutting out Figures in ſmall or in great Stone;

                        <head>The last <hi>Anſwer</hi> concerning <hi>Lucern.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe information about the Lucern that I have got from my Friend, being a very particular one, and containing a very full anſwer to all the Queſtions propounded by your Friend; is ſuch as followeth: It requireth a rich ground, but ſomewhat looſe and light, ſo as a ſtiffe Clay, and ſuch other tough grounds, are no-wayes fit for it; The ground muſt not be over-dry nor over-moiſt, but in a mean; yet ſomewhat more inclining to moiſture, then to the contrary. It muſt be ploughed three times, the firſt time in <hi>October,</hi> and the ſecond and third, towards the Spring. Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it doth not love Dung, and cometh much better in a ground that is ſufficiently rich of it ſelf, then that which hath been inriched by dunging; and where Dung is made uſe of, it muſt be very ſtale and well rotten, and long before the ſowing-time. It cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the cold, and therefore muſt not be ſowen till rhe cold weather and all the danger of it be quite paſt, <hi>viz.</hi> about the beginning or midſt of <hi>April.</hi> The Quantity of the ſeed, is the ſixth part of Corn, that the ſame ground would require: ſo as only one Buſhel of Lucern is to be ſown on that ſpace of ground, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119037:48"/>
6. Buſhels of Corn. It muſt be carefully weeded, eſpecially in the beginning. And to the end, that it may take the more firm root, ſome <hi>Oats</hi> muſt be mixed with it, but in a very ſmall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is to be cut as ſoon as it beginneth to flower, which in the hot Countries <hi>(Provence, Languedock</hi> and <hi>Spain)</hi> it doth 5. or 6. times, and ſome years 7. or 8. times in a Summer; but in this Climate it uſeth to be cut twice a year, about the end of <hi>Iune,</hi> and about the end of <hi>Septemb.</hi> Being cut, it muſt be turned very oft, that it may dry the ſooner, and be carried off the ground the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that may be; and it muſt be kept in cloſe Barns, being too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for to be kept in Reeks, open to the Aire as other Hay, It is good for all kind of Cattel, as Kine, Sheep, Goats, and as well for the young ones (Calves, Lambs, Kids) as for the others; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all it agreeth beſt with Horſes. It is much more feeding then any other Hay: inſomuch, as any lean beaſts will ſoon grow fat with it; and to the Milch-beaſts, it procureth abundance of milk: but it muſt never be given alone, eſpecially to beaſts that have not been long uſed to it: but muſt ever be mixed with ſtraw, or with ſome other Hay; for otherwiſe it over-heateth them, and filleth them too much with blood; and that ſo ſuddenly, as it greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangererh their health, and their life too; which it doth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to Kine: to whom it is more dangerous, if too plentifully gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then to any other Cattel. After the laſt cutting, you may let your Cattel graze on your Lucern-fields, and that all Winter long, until the beginning or middle of <hi>March.</hi> Of once ſowing you will have your Meadow continue good for 10. or 12. years. and until 15. and afterwards too, it will ſtill continue to bear; but the Hearb will then notably decay in goodneſs. Wherefore it is beſt to turn it then to ſome other uſe. Kine muſt never eat of this Hearb green; but only dryed, and that moderately too, as hath been ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Horſes eating their fill of it green in the Spring, are purged thereby, and grow fat by it in 8. or 10. dayes time: If one deſire to have of the Grain, one may let ſuch a proportion of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow as one will; grow up to ſeed, after the ſecond cutting, any year except the firſt only: and when the ſeed is ripe, the tops of the Hearb, with the Codds wherein the ſeed is incloſed, muſt be cut in a dewie morning, and put into ſheets, for fear of looſing the ſeed, and muſt be beat out with Flails upon the ſame, when that it is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119037:49"/>
well dryed: and afterwards the remaining part of the Hearb muſt be mowen cloſe to the ground; after which it continueth to ſprout out again after the uſual manner. The Hay thereof wil keep good 2. or 3. years; and one Acre is ſufficient to keep 3. Horſes all the year long.</p>

                        <p>THe Gentleman, who had given me the note about the Lucern, hath told me ſince two particulars more, which he had forgot to put into it: The one, that not onely to other Cattel, but even to Horſes with whom that Hay agreeth beſt of all other beaſts: it is not to be given but in winter; becauſe that in the Summer it would too much heat their bloud: And the other, that this hay muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well dried, before it be carried off the ground; and to that end turned very often: becauſe that being put up with any the leaſt moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, it will quite ſpoil, much more then any other Hay. Now theſe and all the other particulars, which I have had from the Gentleman, have been confirmed to me by many others. And yet within theſe 2. or 3. dayes I met with a Phyſition of <hi>Rochel,</hi> who aſſuring me that the Lucerne was very common in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, made me a relation of it agreeing with the former, onely in theſe 3. points, <hi>viz.</hi> That of once ſowing it will continue 10. or 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years; That it is cut twice a year, ſerving afterwards for Paſture all Winter; And that it wonderfully fatteneth all kind of Cattel; but very much different from it in all the others, and in ſome of them point blank contrary to it. For he ſaith, that it is to be ſowen in the beginning of <hi>March;</hi> that it deſireth a temperate ground, but rather dry then wet, and no wayes fat nor clayiſh, but ſtony and gravily; that it need not be mixed with any other Hay, but may be given alone, and all the year long; in Summer as well as Winter, not only to Horſes, but to Cowes and other Cattel. He added, that the proportion of the ſeed, is the charge of a Porter for four Arpents or French Acres. Which particulars I thought good to impart unto you, that your friend comparing them with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119037:49"/>
might make his beſt profit of them; and this <hi>Rochellois;</hi> (or <hi>Rocheller</hi>) who hath lived three or four years in <hi>England,</hi> thinks that Lucern will come admirably well in that Country.</p>

                           <p>THe meaning of theſe words—<hi>The quantity of the Seed is the ſixth part of Corn that the ſame ground would require</hi> —is this, That whatever quantity of Wheat or Barley an Acre of ground would require of the ſeed of Lucern; you muſt take but the ſixth part of that quantity of the ſeed of Lucern; ſo as that ground which for its ſowing requireth ſix buſhels of <hi>Corn,</hi> doth require but one buſhel of Lucern-ſeed.</p>
                           <p>An <hi>Arpent deterre</hi> (which how much it is in Engliſh meaſure <hi>Cotgrave's</hi> Dictionary will perfectly tell you) requireth 10. <abbr>

                              </abbr> of that ſeed, as ſeveral Grain-ſellers (of whom I went to inquire for it) have unanimouſly told me: the ſeed being exceeding ſmall, and to be ſowen wonderfully thinl. As for Saint Foin or Holy Hay, I have ſeen it grow here about Paris in ſeveral places, in rich fat grounds, and thoſe both high and dry, and others low and Marſhy. It is cut but once a year, much what about the ſame time of other Hay, and a great deal of the ſeed of it is required for ſowing the ground with it. But being once ſowen, it laſteth 10 or 12 years, as well as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca or Lucern, wherewith alſo it correſpondeth altogether in its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Uſes.</p>

From <hi>Paris</hi> I am advertized (for certain) of one, who did laſt year, 1649, ferment one grain of Wheat, which this year hath produced him 114 Ears, and within them 6000 Grains, which is more then 80 Ears, and 600 Grains of your Engliſh friends.

Only ſince I find my ſelf taken notice of by the ſame party, and the experiment I made the laſt year of Barly, weighed in the ſcales with this, and found too light; I ſhall take leave to ſay, that (beſides all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is or may be conceived to be betwixt the ſoyles; that of <hi>France</hi> hath a manifeſt advantage in the elevation and powerful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Sun.)

after the blade was ſprung up. And whereas your friend menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons 600. out of 80. eares, thoſe eares contained one with the other at the leaſt 30 ſingle Corns, which is 2400. That beſides that, <hi>Wheat</hi> is no whit inferior to <hi>Barly,</hi> but rather more inclined to its proper nature to branch and ſpread: it is alſo allowed as long time again to grow, and therefore may better ſpread to many eares then Barly. That my ears of <hi>Barly</hi> rated at 30. one with the other, (which they were at leaſt, ſome having 38. a thing I ſuppoſe rarely (if ever) ſeen in <hi>England</hi> before) are full as high as his <hi>Wheat</hi> ears rated at 52. And the ſeeming great difference between 2400 and 6000. when looked into, will prove not to be in the number of eares, which differ no more then as 14. to 10. but in the nature of the Grains, there being univerſally as many more in an eare of wheat as in an eare of Barly. That if (as it is moſt like) he in <hi>France</hi> did only try concluſions, to what height nature might poſſibly be ſcrued by art, and that what is here related, was the effect of that trial; that holds not compariſon with mine, which is generally practicable, without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expence of time or ſtock more then in the common-way. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I affirm, in all poſſible humble reverence and ſubmiſſion to Gods good pleaſure, power and providence; that when I ſhall make uſe of good feed rightly prepared, good Land in right condition, and all other helps which I know and can uſe; I ſhall not doubt for ſmaller numbers of the ſame grain <hi>(viz.)</hi> Wheat, to produce 200. or 300. eares, and in them 10000. 12000. or 15000. Corns, (and ſomewhat like that, for whole fields together, and that here in <hi>England,</hi>) howſoever let us alwayes remember to give all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble praiſe to God, <hi>whoſe bleſſing only makes rich.</hi>

                        <p>I Find dayly more and more, that it is too true, that moſt men love money, that they even worſhip it in their hearts, as the onely <hi>Sammum Bonum.</hi> I need not go far for proof, ſince they have brought one to my hand. That (having ſo fair and juſt offers made, in order to the Corn-buſineſſe; as I have preſented to them by your hands,) will by no means (though ſo very much to their own profit and the Publick Good) part with their monies; and yet ſtick not to demand (in effect) the diſcovery from me of that talent of knowledge, which God hath made mine by his free gift; as the reward of my induſtry, and faithfull love to my native Countrey; An eſtate (if I miſtake not) better gotten then by any of the common means; by which men grow rich dayly. Surely the commodities cannot be leſſe then equal. The moſt wiſe and vertuous men that ever lived, have preferred Art, Induſtry, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity far before money· Money (eſpecially the abuſe of it) is become the very poyſon of the world, againſt which Art and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry is an Antidote or Cordial. Money is counted and enjoyed by a thouſand thouſands, Art and Induſtry but by a few. And things of excellent uſe are accounted Jewels, eſpecially when rare and ſcarce. The Profeſſors of Art and Induſtry, beſides their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate aim alſo at a Publick good: theſe prefer their private gain (too often) before the being and well being of the whole world; nay of their own ſouls. Theſe are ever ready to part with invaluable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon eaſie conditions: Thoſe will not upon any conditions whatſoever (but ſuch as pleaſe themſelves or are full of oppreſſion) part with their monies, (no not to ſave a Brothers, or hardly a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or a Childs life.) And finally if they judge it improvidence to part with a little of their eſtates, onely for a time, to return again to them ſhortly, like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove with an Olive branch, a double branch of Peace and Proſperity: I deſire to be excuſed, if I upon better grounds hold it prophane, to ſell a better right then a birth-right for leſſe then a meſſe of pottage; even for juſt nothing, and for ever. I can never forget the exceeding great ingenuity to the world, ſhewed and given by Mr. <hi>Gab. Platts,</hi> as will more fully appear, when you ſhall have printed thoſe writings of his which he left to

your truſt and cuſtody, and the worlds baſe ingratitude that let ſuch a man fall down dead in the ſtreet for want of food, without a ſhirt to hih back; none (but your ſelf that want not an inlarged heart but a fuller hand to ſupply the worlds defects) being found with ſome few others, to adminiſter any relief to a man of ſo great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

They may without much prejudice (to Corne) be planted in the furrowes where it growes; ſo as the ground be moiſt, and you keep them well pruned, and leave onely a buſh at the top of the tree.

For you ſee that your Open-hartedneſs in this kind hath provoked another Friend of mine of very pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique deſert in the Common-wealth of Learning, to impart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me his Obſervations of the ſame nature. And although his Annotations now and then, are Animadverſions rather then Enlargements, yet it is not unprofitable to the Publique, nor diſadvantageous to us; that our errours and miſtakes (for who can pretend to be without them:) be laid open and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. I ſuppoſe you would be as loath as I, that any by your meanes or mine, ſhould be led into a by-way, and inſtead of gaining become a loſer, in making triall of what we offer for his advantage I could wiſh that my worthy Friend who hath imparted theſe his thoughts unto me in the following extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Letters, had ſpared ſome expreſſions; &amp; bin leſs cenſorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perſons of ſome, of whom others have a high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable opinion, as <hi>Helmont</hi> &amp; <hi>Glauber:</hi> but he is to be born with all in this, as we would be borne with all by him and others; in the freedome which we might take of giving our opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his failings. Alſo I am confident, that that learned Gentleman is not intereſſed by any prejudice of paſſion, or perſonall diſaffection againſt any of them; but that as a man of a free ſpirit he doth give his judgement through his zeal and love to every truth as it lies in his apprehenſion; let every one have his freedome in things which are well meant for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; and the beſt way to rectifie one anothers miſtakes, will be to ſtrive to ſet each other a Copy, of better and more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate expreſſions in the like Caſes, wherein there may be a miſtake or failing: If we were skilfull to provoke one another, onely to the affections of love and of good workes; and by
<pb facs="tcp:119037:56"/>
our own uſefull experiments diſcreetly diſpenſed towards the Publique, could draw forth the profitable (but buried) skill of others, unto common uſe to be imparted unto all; what could not be done for eaſe of the poor, and the relief of common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities? Truly, although neither God by his directions how to make uſe of all his gifts; nor Nature his handmaid by her ſupplies of things neceſſary and comfortable for our livelihood are wanting to us. Yet we by the untowardneſſe of our ſpirits, and the ſhutting up of our bowels, and the enviouſneſſe of our diſpoſitions, bring a ſcarcity upon our ſelves, and upon others, whil'ſt we are not faithfull and liberall ſtewards of our talents, for the benefit of thoſe, for whoſe ſake God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed them upon us: therefore I ſhall deſire you, as you have begun, to continue in well doing, for you know the promiſe, <hi>that in due time you ſhall reap the fruit of all your labours, if you faint not.</hi> And leaſt you ſhould imagine, that you are at this diſtance forgotten by us, give me leave to preſent you with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother taske proper for your thoughts in the place where now you are, that the advantages of Nature, which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> may not lie undiſcovered, and without improvement, at this ſeaſon vvherein the Replanting of the vvaſt and deſolate places of that Countrey, is ſeriouſly laid to heart by many: I ſhall therefore deſire you to look upon this Alphabet of Interrogatories, and conſider vvhat Anſvvers your Obſervations vvill afford unto them; or vvhat you can learne from the Obſervations of others to clear them; and as you have opportunity, do, as my Friend from <hi>Paris</hi> hath done; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me vvith vvhat Gods providence ſhall ſend unto your hands, that as I have begun, I may put it out to uſe: and requite you more plentifully, as I hope I ſhall be able to do, vvith the increaſe, vvhich it ſhall yield, by this vvay of Trading, vvhich I have taken up freely to beſtovv my paines and coſt upon others, that all may ſee the goodneſs of God in the vvorks of his hands, and have cauſe to be thankfull unto him for the ſame, and that ſo many eminent talents vvhich God hath put into your hands, may not (ſeeing he hath given you a heart to uſe them) lye idle for vvant of Objects, and fit Commodities vvherevvithall to be trading vvith him, vvho ſubſcribes himſelf alvvays,</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119037:57"/>
the <hi>Parerga;</hi> upon which I ſhall freely give you my ſenſe, that being communicated to him, he may mend them in the next Edition, if ſo he ſee it fitting: What he ſaith out of <hi>Helmont page</hi> 13. <hi>The ſmuttineſſe of corne, and the foule diſeaſe to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in</hi> France, <hi>together about</hi> 1530, <hi>and the latter to have had ſome originall from the former.</hi> To ſay nothing of the ſmall credit of that Authour, even in things ſubject to his own knowledge and experience, (I being able to convince him of moſt palpable lies out of his own writings) a more credible Authour than he ſhould not be alleaged, much leſſe heeded; if oppoſite to ſo notorious a truth; as that of the foule diſeaſe, it's originall in <hi>France,</hi> as well as in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> full 36 yeares ſooner than <hi>Helmont</hi> ſayes <hi>(viz.)</hi> in the year 1494: and nothing could be advanced more abſurd or ridiculous in the judgement of all ſound Phyſitians, than to attribute the originall of that diſeaſe in any wiſe to ſmutty corne, as he doth. The imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſmutty corne, conſiſteth altogether in a ſimilar diſtemper, and that of the more ſpirituous part, conſequently not at all ſubject to the eyes, and ſo not to be found out by the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, to the contrary of what our Authour ſuppoſeth, <hi>page</hi> 15. <hi>The corne ſowne in July, produced ſuch an increaſe, page</hi> 18. I cannot imagine, how Corne ſowne in Summer can come to good, or what humane wit or skill can hinder it from running up; and ſpending it ſelfe, before the coming in of winter. His Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy <hi>of the blackneſſe of the Moor-loghs,</hi> as communicated by the blackneſſe of the earth or turffe, <hi>page</hi> 25. is no wayes receivable.

The opinion of the Suns deſcending lower, page</hi> 30. although juſtly (as I hold it rejected by <hi>Moeſtlinus, Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanus, Keplerus, Morinus, Bullialdus, quibus omnibus praeit Ptolomaeus,</hi> ought not to be ſpoke of ſo contemptuouſly, ſeeing that one of the greateſt Aſtronomers that ever was, <hi>(viz.)

than halfe a degree; I know not what makes our Authour ſpeake of the Suns deſcending many degrees lower. It is true, that thoſe 35 minutes amount to many thouſands of miles, which expreſſion therefore would be both more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and more ſutable to the vulgar capacity of moſt Readers, than that of minutes or degrees; This is what I have obſerved till page 30: further than which I am not yet come: And foraſmuch as I have never an Engliſh Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary here, I would be glad of the expoſition of ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh words not ſo well underſtood by me, as howing (ſo oft ſpoke off) and the how; Wheats-lodging, page 18.

In <hi>Cumberland,</hi> out of a certain kind of ſand they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſalt; it were worth the while to tell in a few words at leaſt, how they proceed in the doing thereof; Not onely notice ſhould be taken by the Husbandman, or Countrey-Gentleman of the different colour, odour and taſt of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as our Authour wiſheth them to do, <hi>eadem pag.</hi> 85. but alſo and much more (as a thing of a much greater and more particular concernment to them) of the wonderfull and vaſt difference of waters (in which none of thoſe three qualities is notably to be diſcerned) for the ſeverall uſes of ordinary houſe-keeping of Husbandry, and of ſeverall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, <hi>page</hi> 86. <hi>if we may believe</hi> Glauber, <hi>there is ſcarce any ſand without gold;</hi> I am very ſure that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth him herein, as in many other things, will finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe very fouly deceived; <hi>Ibidem, ſave what is taken out of their Ditches.</hi> For the word Ditches no wayes proper here, ſhould be ſubſtituted Bogs, Fens, or Moores; <hi>It is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent good fuell,</hi> yea, many ſorts of them are moſt excellent

fuel. An Engliſhman ſpeaking of turffe, ſhould not name <hi>Holland</hi> onely, but <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in which two Countreys turffe is of very great and general uſe, <hi>page</hi> 87. <hi>There is a ſtone in</hi> Durham, <hi>out of which they make ſalt,</hi> I would we vvere told the manner hereof: <hi>Ibidem, Lead is found in</hi> Durham-vvall: I would faine know what <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-wall</hi> is, whether a Town or Countrey, and in what part of <hi>England,</hi> and why <hi>Derby-ſhire,</hi> where thoſe famous Lead Mines are, is not at all named here, <hi>page</hi> 94. <hi>Opium is alwayes an ingredient,</hi> this is too generally ſpoken, page 95. I am not well ſatisfied with what he ſayes of tranſplanting Elephants into <hi>England,</hi> and making them of common uſe there, for many reaſons; and I believe it would prove as hard a taske to people in <hi>England,</hi> with any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtore of Black Foxes, Muske-Cats, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of thoſe Animals named, page 96. in theſe words.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119037:61"/>
me, that at <hi>Roven</hi> (where ſhe hath lived a good while) and in all the Countrey round about it, they feed their Cattle uſually in this maner. Of Turnips (not of the beſt, but refuſe ones, ſuch as being worm-eaten, or otherwiſe faulty, are not good for mans meat) they boil a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in a great Kettle, whole as they are, with their leaves on their tops; til they be tender, adding thereto good ſtore of branne; (of Wheat onely, becauſe that, that of Rye, is ſcowring, and ſo not proper for them) and afterwards of the cakes of Rapeſeed, or Linſeed; which cakes having a ſingular faculty of fatting Cattle, they put much leſſe of them into the Meſh for Milch-Cowes, (for fear of ſpoiling their Milke) than for other kind: of this they give them twice a day, ſo as it maketh the greateſt part of their feeding, much more than the hay, which they give them betwixt whiles: and thus they feed them onely in Winter-time, becauſe that all the Summer long they keep them abroad at graſſe: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be uſed in <hi>Holland</hi> as your friend ſaith, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell of my own knowledge: having never there ſeene it, nor heard of it: but in <hi>France</hi> it is of very old ſtanding, as appeareth by theſe words of <hi>Columella lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Rapa non homines ſolum, verum etiam boves paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt, praecipuè in Gallia, ubi Hyberna cibaria praedictis pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus, id olus praebet.

                     <p>YOu ſhall have now the concluſion of my Annotations upon your Legacy according to your deſire.</p>
                     <p>In the bottome of page 104: your friends ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as if the excellency of Butter and Cheeſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended wholly of the handling of it, and that Cheeſe like to <hi>Parmeſan</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Cheeſe, might be made in <hi>England,</hi> if the ſame induſtry
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119037:62"/>
were uſed there, as in thoſe Countreys, which is nothing ſo: For though Art and Induſtry can do very much in this particular, as in moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whereof I have ſeen moſt remarkable examples both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet there is ſome thing in the particular nature of different waters and different Soiles, and of the food for Cattle thereon growing: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in that Cattles milke, and in the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Cheeſe made thereof, which no Art nor humane skill can ſupply or imitate, no more than the ſame kind of Beere can be brewed in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the ſame kind of Wine be made to grow on all grounds. And this is moſt manifeſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that in <hi>Holland</hi> it-ſelf there are made ſeverall ſorts of Cheeſes hugely different among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which difference is moſt remarkable in thoſe two excellent ſorts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Edam</hi>-cheeſe (being that kind which is ſo much tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into forreign Countreys, and every where known by the generall Name of <hi>Holland</hi>-cheeſe) and the <hi>Stolke</hi>-cheeſe. And if it ſhould be thought, that that diverſity proceedeth from the different makings of Cheeſe, uſed in the ſeverall parts of that Countrey; I can aſſure you, that if you make <hi>Edam</hi> and <hi>Stolke</hi> boors exchange their habitations, and keep all their own faſhions, each of them ſhall make Cheeſes, not ſuch as they were wont to make at home, but as uſed to be made in the places to which they are come. The like may be ſaid of the green-Cheeſes, made in <hi>Holland</hi> of Sheepsmilke, eſpecially thoſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119037:63"/>
of Graveſand, Teſſel, and Grind; all three moſt excellent ones; and yet extreamly differing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves. And not to go for examples of this, further than <hi>England</hi> it ſelfe; It were againſt all reaſon and experience, to thinke that, that notable difference betwixt <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>-cheeſes, cometh onely from the different way of making it. Another thing, which I find fault withall in the ſame Diſcourſe, is, that the Author nameth the French Angelots among the excellent ſorts of Cheeſe; whereas they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo, neither in their qualities, nor in their price, they being ſold for two Sols a piece, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they uſe to weigh half a pound. I do likewiſe miſlike, that he for to inſtance in the beſt kinds of Cheeſe; he fetcheth <hi>Parmeſans,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>-cheeſe from abroad, without taking notice; that at home in ſeverall parts of the Land, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in <hi>Mongomery-ſhire,</hi> Cheeſe is made equall to the beſt of theſe kinds; and at <hi>Chedder</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> that which in my judgement is farre to be preferred before them, and to any other cheeſe in the world. Page 105. I cannot brook, that he complaineth <hi>England</hi> hath not a Syſtema, or a Compleat Book of all the parts of Agriculture; and reckoneth <hi>Markham</hi> among them, who have writ onely divers ſmall Treatiſes of it: whereas <hi>Markham</hi> hath comprehended in his works, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever belongeth to any part of Husbandry and of Houſewifery too; with very few and ſmall omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſuch as in no wiſe can rob him of the name
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119037:63"/>
of a generall writings; his workes alſo having that excellency, that they are altogether ſquared for <hi>England,</hi> and go on experience rather than on Probabilities, and hear-ſays; to the contrary of what our Authour ſeemed to taxe in him, aſwell as in other writers of that kind; which maketh me ſuſpect; that either he hath not at all been converſant in <hi>Markham's</hi> writings; or that in reading of him he hath been ſtrangely fore-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he being in my opinion, one of the moſt excellent of his kind; and in many particulars to be preferred before the moſt excellent of them all. It is true what is ſaid <hi>pag. 106. There were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancient Romans ſome appointed, to ſee that men did till their Land as they ſhould;</hi> but that which followes: <hi>and if they did not, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them as Enemies to the Publique;</hi> is too hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolically ſpoken, there being a vaſt difference betwixt puniſhing one as an enemy to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and a ſimple fining of him, which was all the puniſhment inflicted for that fault, as you may ſee in the twelvth Chapter of <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> his fourth Book. In theſe words, <hi>pag. 107. he that turneth fruitfull Lands into barrenneſſe, as the land of Canaan, very fruitfull heretofore, but now a barren Deſart.</hi> Our Author ſaies nothing, but what is common in the mouth and pens of almoſt every body, and yet the truth thereof is very queſtionable, as an obſervant Reader will eaſily finde by the exacteſt and lateſt writers of that Countrey, among whom <hi>Eug. Royer</hi> is to be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119037:64"/>
placed in the very firſt ranke. And thus I make an end, having nothing to ſay to any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the following pages of your Legacy; the reprinting whereof with thoſe alterations and amendments I have hinted to you, I doe moſt earneſtly wiſh for, it being indeed a moſt excellent piece; and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end fraught with moſt excellent obſervations and experiments.</p>
