            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Theſe are moſt high matters, &amp; by litle and litle are to be declared, in the progreſſe of this doctrine: but for this time it ſhall ſuffice to learne the names, &amp; to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo much as you may. The Vnitie of God ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, that beſides all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is one thinge that hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13191:4"/>
not had beginning, but hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been, and euer ſhall bee, and hath made all other thinges, and maintaineth and gouerneth them, and is aboue all, moſt high, moſt noble, moſt glorious, moſt potent, abſolutely Patrone of all thinges: and this is called God, who is one onely, becauſe there can not bee more then one true Diuinitie, that is to ſaye, one onely Nature and Eſſence, infinitely potent, Holie, good, and ſo foorth. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Diuinitie, is founde in three perſons, which are called the Father, the Sonne, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt, which three perſons are one onely God, becauſe they haue the ſelfe-ſame Diuinity and eſſence. As for example, if three perſons here in earth, called Peter, Paul, &amp; Iohn, ſhould haue one &amp; the ſame ſoul, &amp; one &amp; the ſame bodie, they ſhould be called three perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, becauſe one is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13191:5"/>
Peter, an other Paul, and an other Iohn: and yet they ſhould be one man onely, and not three men, not hauing three bodies, nor three ſoules but one bodie and one ſoule. This is not poſsible amongſt men, becauſe the being of a man is dererminat &amp; limited, and therefore cannot be in many perſons. But the being of God &amp; his diuinitie is infinite. And there fore the ſelfe-ſame being, and the ſelfe-ſame Diuinitie of the Father, may be, and is found in the ſoone, and in the Holie-Ghoſt. There bee then three perſons, becauſe one is the Father, another is the Sonne, and the third is the Holie-Ghoſt. And yet they are one God onely, becauſe they haue the ſame Diuinitie, the ſame being, the ſame power, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, goodnes, &amp;c.</p>

In like manner, you haue
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13191:11"/>
to thinke, that God beholding him ſelfe, with the eye of vnderſtanding, in the glaſſe of his Diuinitie, doth produce an Image moſt like vnto him ſelfe.

Tell me then, if Chriſt be the Sonne of God omnipotent, how happened it, that he was not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Father, out of the handes of Pilate? Or rather, if the ſame Chriſt be God, wherefore did hee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13191:16"/>

Yet he did not hide himſelfe but went to meete his enemies.

                  <p>For manie reaſons. But the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reaſon was, to ſatiſfie vnto God for our ſinnes. For you haue to know that the offence is meaſured according to the dignitie of him who is offended: and contrariewiſe the ſatisfaction is meaſured accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dignitie of him who doth ſatisfie: as for example, if a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant ſhould geue his Prince a blow, it ſhould be eſteemed a moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous offence, according to the greatnes of the prince: but if a prince ſhould giue his ſeruant a blowe, it were a ſmal matter, according to the baſe eſtate of the ſeruant. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, if a ſeruant take off his cappe vnto his Prince, it is but little eſteemed, but if the Prince ſhould take off his, vnto his ſeruant it would be a notable fauour, according to

the rule we ſpeake of. Now becauſe the firſt man, and with him al we haue offended God, who is of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite dignitie, the offence did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire infinite ſatisfaction: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was neither man nor Angel of ſo great dignitie, therefore the Sonne of God came, who being God and of infinite dignitie, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken mortal fleſh, in the ſame fleſh he ſubmitted him ſelfe for the honour of God to the death of the Croſſe, and ſo ſatisfied with his paines for our faults.</p>

But in this depth of the earth, there are foure, as it were, great caues: one for the damned, which is the deepeſt of al, and ſo it is agreable, that the proud Diuels, and the men which imitate them, be in the loweſt place, and furtheſt from heauen that can be. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond caue, which is ſomething higher, are thoſe ſoules, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the paines of Purgatorie.

perpetuall priuation of eternall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. In the fourth, which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, remained the ſoules of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Prophets, and other Holie men, that dyed before the comming of Chriſt; for albeit, thoſe holy ſoules had not any thing to be purged, yet they could not enter into glory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt by his death had ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the gate of eternall life: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they remained in that higher place, called, <hi>the place of holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Abrahams boſome,</hi> where they ſuffered no paines at all, but enjoyed a ſweete repoſe, expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the comming of our Lord with great joy.

                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son of God, roſe of himſelf, to wit, by vertue of his God-head, he reunited his ſoule to his bodie &amp; ſo began to liue againe. But other dead men can not returne to life, by their owne power. And therefore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13191:22"/>
it is ſaid, they were raiſed by others. As we al at the day of Iudgment, ſhal be raiſed by Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>He remained fourtie dayes, as you may conſider, by numbring the dayes, betwixt the feaſts of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurection, and Aſcenſion. And the reaſon of his ſo long ſtay was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13191:23"/>
he would, with manie &amp; diuers apparitions, eſtabliſh the Myſterie of his moſt true Reſurrection. For that the ſame ſeemeth as it were the moſt hard. And he that beleeueth it, hath no difficultie to beleeue the reſt. For he that riſeth, was certainly dead before: And he that was dead, was firſt borne: And ſo he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth the Reſurrection of Chriſt, findeth no labour in beleeuing his death, and natiuitie. And likewiſe, for ſo much as the earth is not a conuenient place for glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but heauen, therefore he that beleueth the Reſurrection of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, can eaſely beleeue his going vp into heauen.</p>

                  <p>The reaſon is eaſie. For that Chriſt being God and man, went vp into heauen, by his owne powre, as he alſo roſe by his owne powre.

                  <speaker>M</speaker>
                  <p>You muſt not imagine, that the Father is on the left-hande of the Sonne: nor that the Father is in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, hauing his Sonne on the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and the Holie-Ghoſt on the left corporally. For as well the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the Sonne, according to his God-head, and the Holie Ghoſt, are euery where. Neither can it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid, that one is on the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of an other: but to bee at the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13191:24"/>
right hand in this article, ſignifieth to be in equal height, glorie, and maieſtie: becauſe when one is ſide by ſide of an other, one is not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor lower then the other. And to vnderſtand this maner of ſpeach, the holie Scripture in the Pſalme 109. which beginneth: <hi>Dixit Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus Domino meo: &amp;c.</hi> doth once ſaye, that the Sonne doeth ſitte at the right hand of the Father: and an other time ſaith, that the Father is at the right hand of the Sonne: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing vs, that they are in deed in equal height: as we haue ſaid. So that Chriſt, when he went vp into heauen, aſcended aboue all the Quyars and orders of the Angels, &amp; of the bleſſed ſoules. which he cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, &amp; ariued vnto the high throne of God, and there ſtayed, not going aboue his Father, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning vnder him, but reſting (as we may ſay) ſide by his father, as

And ſo the humanitie of our Lord, to wit, his fleſh and ſoule, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

his purple robe, ſitteth in his royal throne, &amp; al the Princes of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſit below him, the kings robe is in a more eminent place, then the Nobles them ſelues are, becauſe it is in the ſelfe ſame throne with the King.

And this for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſes. Firſt, for Gods honour, becauſe manie nowe ſeeing bad-men in proſperitie, and good-men afflicted: imagine that God doeth not gouerne the world well. But at that time, it ſhall be cleerly ſeen, how God hath ſeene &amp; noted all things, and how with great juſtice, he hath giuen vnto the bad, ſome temporall proſperitie, in recompence of ſome good works of theirs, of ſmal mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, intending afterwards, to giue them eternall paine, for their mortall ſins.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13191:27"/>

                  <p>God is called the Holie ſpirit by excelencie, becauſe he is the chiefeſt ſpirite, and moſt holie and author of al created ſpirites, and of al holines. Like as a mongſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ther are manie that are fathers and holie, either by office, or by goodnes of life, to wit, manie good Biſhops, or Prieſts, or religious men: and yet there is none called Holie Father, but the Pope:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13191:28"/>
becauſe this name belongeth vnto him alone by excellencie, being the head of al other fathers, and ought to be the moſt holie of al by goodnes of life, as he is by office, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto vs the perſon of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>It is called holie for three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: firſt, becauſe the head there of, which is Chriſt, is moſt holie: like as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13191:32"/>
one that hath a fayre faice, is ſaid to be a faire man, though he haue ſome crooked finger, or ſome blot on his breaſt or ſhoulders. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all faithfull people are holy, by faith and profeſsion, for they haue one moſte true and diuine faith, and make profeſsion of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Sacraments, and of a moſt iuſte law, which doth not command any thing, but that which is good, and forbiddeth nothing, but that which is euill. Thirdly, becauſe there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the Church ſome aſſuredly good, not onely by faith and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but by vertues and maners al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: Whereas among Iewes, Turkes, Heretiks and ſuch like people, who are out of the Church, none at all can truely be good.</p>

And this Communion is not onely heere vpon earth, but our Maſſes, prayers and other good workes, helpe thoſe that be in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie: And the prayers of ſuch, as are in heauen helpe vs, &amp; the ſoules alſo in Purgatorie.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13191:33"/>
do they alſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of the good workes of the faithfull, or no?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M</speaker>
                  <p>For this they are called excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, becauſe they haue not the communion of the Saints, for they are like bowes cut from the tree, or like members ſeparated from the bodie, which do not enjoy the good humors, that are ſpread amongſt the other bowes, and vnited mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And by this you may gather, what account is to be made of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, ſeeing he cannot haue God for his Father, that hath not the Church for his Mother.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>S</speaker>
                  <p>Are then the excommunicated out of the Church, as the Iewes, and other Infidels be?</p>

                  <speaker>M</speaker>
                  <p>So it is: but there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the Iewes and Turkes are out of the Church, becauſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer entred in, being neuer baptiſed; the Heretikes, which are baptiſed,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13191:33"/>
and haue loſt their faith are out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are gone foorth, and fled away of themſelues, and therefore the Church enforceth them by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers puniſhments, to returne vnto the Holy faith: As when a ſheepe fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the fold, the ſhepheard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him with his ſtafe to returne. But other excommunicated which haue baptiſme and faith, and did enter in, and not goe out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, are driuen out by force. As when the ſhepheard driueth foorth an infected ſheepe, and leaueth the ſame a pray for the Wolfe. Yet true it is, that the Church driueth not out the excommunicated, to the end they ſhould euer remaine out, but to the end they ſhould repent of their diſobedience, and demaund to returne being humbled, and ſo bee receiued againe into the boſome of their mother, and to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints.</p>

that al euills in this life, and in the life to come, do ſpring from it; but alſo, for that ſinne is the cauſe, that man becommeth an enemie to God. And what can be ſaid worſe, then to be enimie vnto him, who can do al that he wil, and none can reſiſt him: &amp; who can defend him, with whom God is angrie? And contrariwiſe, in this life a greater good can not be found, then to be in grace: for who can hurt him, whom God defendeth al things being in the hands of God? Briefly you know, that amongſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral thinges life is moſt eſteemed, becauſe it is the foundation of al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good things: and death is moſt abhorred becauſe it is contrarie vnto life. So then ſeeing ſin is the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al death of the ſoule, and the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, is the life of the ſame ſoule: you may eaſely conſider, how great a benefit is receiued, in the church ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it only, is the remiſſion of ſins.</p>

Whereupon in a certain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the water of a fountaine is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Liue-water, becauſe it mooueth: and water of Pooles, is called dead, becauſe it ſtandeth ſtill. So the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are ſaid to haue eternal life, for that they can worke all that they wil, with all their inwarde, and outwarde powers, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment.

But the damned in hell, notwithſtanding they liue (for they ſhall neuer bee conſumed) yet they are ſaid to haue eternall death, becauſe they are ſtill tyed vnto the fire and torments, and are enforced euer to ſuffer that which they would not: neither can they do anie thing, that they would. So that the bleſſed in heauen enjoy all good, without any mixture of euil: and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in hell, do ſuffer all euill, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <speaker>S</speaker>
               <p>What is to be vnderſtood, by the kingdome of God?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>The kingdome of God may be vnderſtood three maner of waies: for we finde a kingdome of nature, a kingdom of grace, and a kingdome of glorie. The kingdome of nature is that, where with God gouerneth al the creatures, as abſolute Lord of al things. For albeit peruerſe men do euil, and obſerue not the law of God, yet God doth raigne ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that when it pleaſeth him he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth their diſignmentes. And though he permit them ſometimes to haue their deſires, afterwardes hee puniſheth them ſeuerely: and there is none that can reſiſt his wil, nor that can do otherwiſe, then he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13191:43"/>
ordaineth or permitteth. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace is that, wherewith God gouerneth &amp; ruleth the ſoules, &amp; harts of good Chriſtians, giuing them ſpirite and grace to ſerue him willingly, &amp; to ſeeke his glorie aboue all things. The kingdome of glorie ſhalbe in the other life, after the day of iudgement: for that then God wil raigne with all the Saints, ouer all things created, without any reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the force of the diuels ſhal be taken away, &amp; alſo of al peruerſe men, who ſhalbe ſhut vp in eternall priſon of hel. In that time ſhal death alſo be extinguiſhed, &amp; corruption, with al the tentations of the world &amp; of the fleſh, which now trouble the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God. So that ſhalbe quiet &amp; peaceable kingdome, with ſecure poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of perfect &amp; eternal felicity</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Which of theſe three kingdomes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſpoken of, in this petition?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>Not of the firſt: for that is not to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13191:44"/>
come, but is now come. Neither of the ſecond, for that is ſpoken of in the firſt petition, &amp; is in a great part already come. But here is ſpoken of the third, which is to come, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected with great deſire, of al thoſe that know the miſerie of this life: &amp; ſo in this petition we demand our chiefe good, and the perfect glory of both ſoule and bodie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S</speaker>
               <p>If the kingdome of God (which we deſire may comequickly) ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin after the day of Iudgment, then we deſire &amp; demand that this world ſhould ſpeedely end, &amp; that the day of iudgement ſhould come ſhortly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>So it is: for thought the louers of the world can haue no worſe newes, then to heare the day of Iudgement named: yet the citiznes of heauen, who liue now as pilgrimes, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed men here below in earth, haue no other greater deſire: Where vpon S. Auguſtin ſaith, that like as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13191:44"/>
before Chriſt came into the world, al the deſires of the Saincts of the ancient law, were directed to the firſt comming of Chriſt: ſo now al the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of holie men of the new law, are directed to the ſecond comming of the ſame Chriſt, which wil bring vs perfect beatitude.</p>

               <speaker>S</speaker>
               <p>Let vs paſſe vnto the third petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What do thoſe wordes ſignifie: Thy wil be done, in earth, as it is in heauen.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>In theſe words is demanded grace, to obſerue wel the law of god. For that the eternal life, which is the end of man being demanded in the ſecond petition, it was conuenient, that the principal meanes to arriue vnto that end ſhould be demanded next after: &amp; this principal meanes is the obſeruing of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, as our lord hath ſaid: if thou wilt enter into eternall life: keep the commandements: &amp; for ſo
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13191:45"/>
much as wee are not able of our ſelues, to kepe all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſuch ſorte as we ought, therefore we demand of God, that his wil be done by vs: that is, that he geue vs grace to fulfil his wil, in obeying wholly, and in al things his holie commandements.</p>

               <p>We are bound at the leſt, not to murmour, nor to grudge at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God: becauſe al that he ſendeth or permitteth, he doth it to a good end: to wit, to giue vs occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of greater merite, if we be good: or els to purge vs if we be bad?</p>

It may be alſo ſaid that we deſire; and demaund, that ſinners, ſignified by the earth, may obey God, as the Saints do obey him who are ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by heauen, Or els that the whole Church, ſignified by the earth may intirely obey God, as Chriſt, who is ſignified by heauen, obeyd him.</p>

But you haue to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that in this prayer, ſpirituall bread is principally demaunded, which is the meate of the ſoule: and ſecondarily corporall bread, which is the food for the body. And by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bread, is vnderſtood the moſt holy Sacrament of the altar, that is the celeſtial and diuine bread, which merueilouſly nouriſheth the life of the ſoule: &amp; likewiſe the word of god is vnderſtood, which by preaching or reading of ſpirituall bookes, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no little to nouriſh the ſame life of the ſoule. Finally is vnderſtood, the inſpiration of God, prayer, and euery other thing, which helpeth to maintaine and increaſe grace in vs, the which (as is ſaide) is the life of the ſoule. By corporall bread is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood all that is needful vnto vs, to maintaine the life of the bodie, which is as an inſtrument of the ſoule, to do good workes.</p>

               <p>With great myſterie this bread is called ours, for if we ſpeake of the bleſſed Sacrament, that is our bread, becauſe of our ſaluation it was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the holy ghoſt, in the wombe of the bleſſed Virgin, and in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manner, bakte in the Ouen of the holy Croſſe, &amp; ſerued vp, on the table of the Altar, by the handes of Prieſts.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13191:48"/>
wee will not bee ſolicitous for the morrow, not knowing whether wee ſhall be liuing to morrow or no. And ſo our Lorde hath taught vs, not to trouble our ſelues, with things that be not preſent.

               <p>There ariſeth a new doubt to me, of that which you haue ſaide: for if wee ought not to trouble our ſelues with any thing, but with that which is preſent they doe euill, that make prouiſion of corne, of wine, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries, for the whole yeare.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Our Lord, when he taught vs, not to trouble our ſelues with things not preſent, meant nothing elſe, but to deliuer vs of ſuperfluous cares, which do greatly hinder prayers, &amp; other things of greater importance, that belong vnto the gaining of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life. And therefore when the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13191:48"/>
care for things to come, is not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous: but neceſſarie, as to make ſuch prouiſion as you ſpeake of, it is not euil to think of that, which is to come.

            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>We haue already, in the foure pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions that goe before, demanded of god, that he wil giue vs all things, as wel eternall as temporal: now in the three following, we demand, that he wil deliuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al euil paſt, preſent &amp; to come: And ſo you ſee it is true which I ſaid before, that in this prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is contained al that we can deſire. Wee demaund then in this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that God deliuer vs from euill, that is paſte, to witte, from the ſinnes which wee haue committed, ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13191:49"/>
for ſo our Lorde declared vnto the holy Apoſtles, when he taught them this prayer; that by debts they ought to vnderſtand ſinnes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>For three cauſes. Firſt, becauſe euery man that ſinneth, remaineth debter to ſatisfie God for the injurie which he hath done him. Secondly, becauſe he that ſinneth, doth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the law of God; and becauſe the ſame lawe promiſeth rewarde to all that obſerue it, and puniſhment to him that doth not obſerue it, there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he that obſerueth it not, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth debter to paye the penaltie. Thirdly, becauſe each one of vs is bound to cultiuate (or manure) the vineard of his ſoule, and to yeeld to God the fruite of his good workes. Therefore hee that doth not good workes, &amp; much more he that doth euil works, inſteed of good, is debter
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13191:49"/>
to god, who is the true lord of al vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards: &amp; becauſe al we do often faile aſwel in doing that we ought not, as in doing that we ought: therfore it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient that oftentimes euery day we humbly deſire of God that hee remit our debts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S</speaker>
               <p>Wherefore is it added, as we alſo forgiue our debters</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>Here likewiſe by debtes, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the offences iniuries, which we receiue of ouer neighbours. And wee deſire of God, that hee will pardon our offences, as wee pardon them, that haue offended vs: for that like as he who pardoneth the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces receiued of his neighbour, is more diſpoſed to receiue pardon of his offences committed againſt God ſo contrariwiſe, he that will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the iniuries of his neighbour, doth make himſelfe vnworthie, that God ſhould pardon him. Finally, in ſaying that we pardon the iniuries of our neighbours, wee make knowne,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13191:50"/>
that mercie doth pleaſe vs, and that we make account, that to pardon is a magnanimous &amp; a notable thing. To the ende that when we demande mercie of God, he may not anſwere vs, how wouldeſt thou that I ſhould vſe mercie towards thee, ſeeing thou doeſt hate mercie towards others? &amp; how doeſt thou demand pardon of me, ſeing thou eſteemeſt pardoning as an act of a baſe minde.</p>

               <p>In this petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is demanded help againſt euil to come: to wit, againſt tentations, which are occaſions that make vs fall into ſin. Here you haue to know that principally it is deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that God permit vs not to bee vanquiſhed &amp; ouercome by te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: &amp; becauſe tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, &amp; the victorie doubtful, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we demand alſo that God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13191:50"/>
vs not to bee tempted, chiefly when he ſeeth that the victorie ſhall not be ours, but the diuels: &amp; of this you are to draw an excellent leſſon, to wit, that not only the diuel ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ouercome vs, but alſo that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſo much as tempt vs, if God doe not permit him.</p>

               <p>I doe not well vnderſtande that ſpeach: Lead vs not into tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for it may ſeeme to haue this ſenſe, that god vſeth to lead men into tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and that we deſire him not to do it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>To bring or lead into tentations whether it be to tempt to euil, or to cauſe one to fall into ſinne, is proper to the diuel, &amp; pertaineth in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God, who greately hateth ſinne. But after the manner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in Holie Scripture, when God is ſaid to induce or leade into tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is nothing elſe, but to permit that one be tempted, or ouercome by tentation: ſo the ſenſe of this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13191:51"/>
is no other but as we haue ſaid, that knowing our owne weakenes &amp; frailtie, and on the othet ſide, the ſubtiltie and force of the diuel, we deſire of God, not only that he wil not permit vs to be ouerthrowne by temptations, but alſo that he permit vs not to be tempted, if he ſee not, that we ſhall remaine victorious.</p>

               <p>This laſt petition doth in parte confirme the former petitions, and partly it addeth ſome things more. And therefore it ſaith: But deliuer vs from euill, that is, I do not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that thou remit vnto vs our ſinnes paſt, and defend vs from ſins to come: but moreouer, that thou deliuer vs alſo from all preſent euil.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13191:51"/>
and commeth not to particulars, as to pouertie, ſicknes, perſecutions, &amp; the like, For that oftentimes it doth ſeeme vnto vs, that a thing is good for vs, which God doth ſee is euill. And contrariwiſe it ſeemeth to vs, that a thing is euil, which God ſeeth is good for vs. And therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inſtruction of our Lord, we demand, that he deliuer vs from all that which he ſeeth is euil for vs, be it proſperitie or aduerſitie.</p>

               <p>The grace of God worketh three principall effects in the ſoule. It wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth out the ſinnes which are as ſpottes that defile the ſoule: it ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſame ſoule with giftes and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13191:53"/>
vertues: and finallie, it in-ableth to doe meritorious workes, gratefull to the diuine Majeſtie. Our Ladie is full of grace, becauſe touching the firſt effect, ſhe neuer had any ſpot of ſinne, neither Original nor Actuall, neither mortal nor venial: Touching the ſecond, ſhe had al the vertues &amp; gifts of the holy ghoſt, in the higheſt degree. Touching the third, ſhe did works ſo gratefull vnto God, and ſo meritorious, that ſhe was worthie to be aſſumpted in bodie and ſoule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al the orders of Angels.</p>

               <p>this is an other ſingular praiſe of the bleſſed virgin which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to vs that our Lord hath bene with our Ladie from the beginning of her conception, with a perpetual aſsiſtance, gouerning her, directing her, and defending her. And hereof it commeth that ſhe neuer commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13191:54"/>
anie ſinne, either in thought, in worde, or in deed. Wherevpon God hath not only adorned this moſt holy virgin with al graces, but he would alſo remaine alwaies with her as guardian of ſo great a treaſure.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>This is the third praiſe, which is geuen to our B. Ladie, in which is declared, that ſhe is not only ful of al the graces, which can belong to a virgin: but of thoſe alſo which can belong vnto a wife, and therby doth abſolutly ſurpaſſe al other women, which haue bene, or ſhal be. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of a married woman is fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunditie, and this was not wanting to the bleſſed Virgin, ſeeing ſhee hath brought foorth a childe, which is more worth, then a hundreth thouſand Children. It may alſo be ſaid, that ſhee is a Mother of a verie great number of Children: for that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13191:55"/>
all good Chriſtians are brothers to Chriſt, and conſequently are childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our Ladie, not by birth and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which maner only Chriſt is her childe: but by loue and mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie affection, which ſhe had towards all. Whereupon ſhe is worthely ſaid to bee bleſſed amongſt all women: becauſe others had either the glorie of virginitie without fecunditie, or the benediction of fecunditie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Virginitie: ſhe only had joyntlie by a ſinguler priuiledge of God, the honour of perfect virginitie, with the benediction of the higheſt and moſt happie fecunditie.</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13191:55"/>
to the tree, and the glorie of the child redoundeth to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And becauſe Ieſus is not onlie true man, and bleſſed amongſt men; but is alſo God, bleſſed aboue all things, as S. Paul teacheth vs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his mother is not onely bleſſed amongſt women; but ſhee is bleſſed amongſt all the creatures, as well in earth as in heauen.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>To the end we may vnderſtand, that we haue need to make recourſe often to the helpe of God, and of the Saints: being in the middeſt of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies viſible &amp; inuiſible. And that we ought not to thinke it ſufficient to haue recourſe to the armour of praier in the beginning of our works but that we muſt do the ſame in the progreſſe and in the end. There is alſo an other myſterie in this ringing thriſe to the <hi>Aue Maria.</hi> That is, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Church would haue vs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to remember the three principal myſteries of our Redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, the Paſsion, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And therfore willeth that wee ſalute our B. Ladie in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in memorie of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our lord: at midday, in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the paſsion: &amp; at night, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13191:56"/>
of the Incarnation. Becauſe as we are certaine that our Lord was mayled on the Croſſe at midday, &amp; roſe in the morning, ſo it is probably thought, that the Incarnation was in the night.</p>

               <p>Many reaſons may be alleadged concerning the excellencie of this law. Firſt, for that this law was made by God, &amp; written by himſelfe, firſt of all in the hearts of men, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in twotables of ſtone: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe this is moſt ancient lawe of all others, &amp; as the fountain of all the reſt.

               <p>The end of al the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes is the loue of God, and of our neighbour: for they al teach vs, not to offend God, nor our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: and for this cauſe they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into two partes and were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as I haue already ſaid) in two tables of ſtone.

               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>In thoſe words are yelded foure reaſons, to ſhew that God can geue a law, and that we are bounde to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it. The firſt reaſon is in the word, I am the Lord, becauſe God being our chief and higheſt Lord, who hath created vs of nothing, he may doubtles geue vs a law, as to his proper ſeruants. The ſecond is in that word, God, becauſe that word ſignifieth that our Lord is not only Lord (or Maiſter) but he is alſo ſupreme Iudge, and gouernour, and as ſuch a one can geue a law, and puniſh thoſe that obſerue it not. The third is in that word, thine, becauſe beſides the bond which we haue to obey God, as ſeruants their maiſter and as ſubiects their Prince; we haue an other bond, by reaſon of the packt which God doth make with vs, and we with him, in holie Baptiſme. For therein God taketh vs for his owne
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13191:59"/>
adopted children, and we take him for our proper Father: as God alſo taketh all the faithfull for his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular people, and the faithfull take God for their owne proper God and Lord. The fourth is in thoſe wordes, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of ſeruitude; for that beſides ſo manie other bondes, there is this of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: for that God hath deliuered vs from the ſeruitude of the diuel &amp; of ſin, which was ſignifyed by that ſeruitude of Egipt and of Pharao, from the which the ſame God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the people of the Iewes.</p>

Hee that beleeueth in God, taketh God for God: becauſe he taketh him for the chiefe veritie: and in this the Heretiks do ſinne, for they doe not beleeue in him.

that hee taketh him for the chiefe goodneſſe, and in this poynt thoſe do ſin, that loue any creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer more then god, or equal with God.

                  <p>The holie Church is the ſpouſe of God, and hath the holy Ghoſt for her maſter. And therefore there is no danger that ſhe ſhould be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or that ſhe ſhould doe or teach others to do any thing that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the commandements of God. And to come to the particular, wee doe honour and call vpon Saintes, as friends of God, who can helpe vs with their merits and prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: but wee doe not take them
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13191:63"/>
for gods, neither adore them as God: neither importeth it that we knele, becauſe this reuerance is not proper to God alone: but is done alſo vnto creatures of high dignitie, as to the Pope: and in manie places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons kneele vnto their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours So that it is no maruel if that be done vnto ſainctes, who raigne with Chriſt in heauen. which is done vnto ſome men in earth.</p>

                  <p>We do not pray to the Reliques which we know wel do not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: but we honour the holie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, as thoſe which haue bin the inſtruments of the holy ſoules, to do many good workes, and ſhal againe in their times be liuing bodies, and are to vs in the meane time deare pledges of the loue, which the Saints
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13191:64"/>
did, &amp; do beare vnto vs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we doe praye, before the ſame Reliques vnto the Saintes, deſiring them by theſe deare pledges which we keepe of them, that they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to helpe vs, as wee remember to honour them.</p>

                  <p>So it is, for the Images of our Lord, of our Ladie, &amp; other Saints, are not taken by vs for gods: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they cannot be called Idols, as thoſe were of the Gentils: but they are holden for Images, which make vs to remember our Lord, our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and other Saints: &amp; ſo they ſerue ſuch as ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not read in place of books. For that by Images they learne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny myſteries of our holy faith: &amp; the life and death of many Saints. And the honour we do vnto them, we do it not becauſe they are figures of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or of mettal, or becauſe they are

well-coloured &amp; wel made: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they repreſent vnto vs our Lord, our Ladie, or other Saints: and for that we know that the Images do not liue nor haue ſenſe, being made by the hands of men: we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but we pray before them, vnto thoſe whom they repreſent vnto vs, to wit, our Lorde, our Ladie, or other Saints.</p>

                  <p>God worketh al the miracles: but he worketh them often by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion of Saints, and chiefly of our bleſſed Ladie: &amp; oftentimes he doth them vnto thoſe, who praye vnto the Sainctes before their Reliques or Images, and ſometimes hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Reliques and Images, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſuch miracles, to ſhew vnto vs, that our deuotion towards

                  <p>When God the Father is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in forme of an old man, and the Holie Ghoſt in forme of a doue, and the Angles in forme of young-men, that which they are in themſelues is not painted: becauſe as you haue ſaid, they are ſpirits without bodies, but that forme is painted, in which they haue ſomtimes appeared. And ſo God the Father is painted like an old-man, becauſe he appeared in that forme in a viſion to Daniel the prophet. And the Holie Ghoſt is painted in forme of a doue, becauſe in that forme he appeared vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt when he was baptiſed by Saint Iohn Baptiſt. And the Angls are painted in forme of yong men, for that they haue ſomtimes ſo appeared. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer you are to know, that manie thinges are painted, to make vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, not what they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelus, but what properties they haue or what effecte they vſe to worke.

So it may be ſaid, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is painted in forme of an olde man, to make vs vnderſtand, that he is moſt ancient, to wit, eternal, &amp; before al created things. And the Holie Ghoſt is painted in likenes of of a doue, to ſignifie the giftes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, puritie, &amp; ſanctitie, which the Holie Ghoſt worketh in vs. And the angels are painted like yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they are alwaies, faire &amp; ful of ſtrength: and with winges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are readie to paſſe why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhal pleaſe God to ſend them: and with white garments, and with holie ſtoales, becauſe they are pure, and innocent, and miniſters of his diuine Maieſtie.</p>

And this is euil: for it is a kinde of tearing the moſt holie name of God.

three things ought to accompany it, to wit, truth, juſtice &amp; judgement, as God himſelfe doth teach vs, by the mouth of the Prophet Ieremy.

                  <speaker>M</speaker>
                  <p>A Vowe is a promiſe made to God of ſome good thing grateful to his diuine Majeſtie. Where you haue to conſidder three things. Firſt that a Vowe is a promiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſufficeth not to the making of a Vowe to haue a purpoſe, &amp; much leſſe a deſire to do any thing: but the expreſſe promiſe is required, either by word of mouth, or at the leaſt in heart. Againe you haue to conſider, that this promiſe is to be made to God, to whom Vowes doe properly belong. And when you heare that a Vow is made to our Ladie, or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saints, you muſt vnderſtande that the ſame is principally made to God, but in the honour of our Lady, or other Saints, in whome God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in a more particular maner and more excellently then in other creatures. So that a Vow made to a Saint is nothing elſe but a promiſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13191:69"/>
made vnto God, to honour the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of ſuch a Saint, with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: that is to honour God himſelf in his Saint. Thirdly, you haue to know, that a Vow cannot be made but of a good thing, and grateful to God, as holy virginitie, voluntarie pouertie, and the like things. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that ſhould vowe to commit anie ſinne, or anie act not pertaining to the ſeruice of God; yea or anie good thing, which ſhould hinder a greater good, ſhould not make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a thing grateful to his diuine Maieſtie, and therefore ſhould not do him honour, but diſhonour, and he ſhould ſinne againſt this ſecond commandement. As he alſo ſinneth greeuiouſly againſt the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that maketh a vow and fulfilleth it not ſo ſoone as he can. For God commandeth in holie Scripture, that whoſoeuer maketh a vowe, do not only remember to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13191:70"/>
it, but alſo that hee ſlacke not to do it.</p>

                  <speaker>M</speaker>
                  <p>God comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in the laſt part of this ſeconde commandement, that a man ſhal not blaſpheame: but contrariwiſe, that he praiſe &amp; bleſſe his holy name. And firſt, foraſmuch as appertaineth to the praiſe, there is no difficultie at all: being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that all good things comming vnto vs from God, and all the works of God being full of wiſdome, of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and of mercie; it is reaſon that in all things he be praiſed, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But touching blaſpheamie, it is neceſſary you know that blaſphemy is nothing elſe, but an injury done in wordes to God in himſelfe or in his Saints. And there are found ſix ſorts of blaſphemies. The firſt, when that is attributed to God, which is falſe,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13191:70"/>
as that he hath hornes, or like indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.

                  <p>It is ſo great, that it is in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the greateſt of all other: which may be vnderſtood by the pain that it meriteth. For that in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God commandeth, that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers ſhould preſently be ſtoned by al the people. As the ciuil lawes do alſo puniſh blaſphemers with death. And S. Gregorie writeth that a litle child of fiue years old, hauing learned to blaſpheme God, and not being corrected by his father, died in his fathers lap, and his ſoule was carried away by diuels (that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red viſibly) into hell fire.

                  <p>The third commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which is of keeping holie feaſts, is ſomthing differing from the others, becauſe al the others, to wit, the two that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the ſeauen which follow, are wholy natural, and bind not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians, but Iewes and Gentils alſo: but this third is in part natural, and bindeth all men, &amp; in part is not natural, neither bindeth it al: for that to ſanctifie the feaſts, that is, to haue ſome daies for holie, &amp; to be ſpent in holie works, &amp; chiefly in the ſeruice of God, is a naturall precept: for that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13191:72"/>
natural reaſon teacheth it to al men; and ſo in al partes of the world ſome day is obſerued feſtiual. But the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of ſuch a day, that is, that it ſhould be one, rather then an other, is not natural. And therefore with the Iewes the principal feaſt was Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye, with Chriſtians it is the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>

                  <p>There are two principal reaſons. The firſt is becauſe, on the Saturday God finiſhed the frame of the world: and therefore he would, that day ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified in memory of this great benefite, of the creation of the world: Which ſerued alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the error of certaine Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (who ſaid that the world had alwaies bene) for that celebrating the feaſt in memorie of the creation
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13191:72"/>
of the world, it muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that the worlde had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe a man hauing cauſed his ſeruants, and hand-maides, and his cattle to worke and wearie themſelues ſixe daies of the weeke, God would that the ſeauenth daye, which is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, the ſame ſeruants &amp; maides, yea, his Oxealſo and Aſſe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that maſters ſhould learne to bee pittifull towardes their labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and not to bee cruell, but to haue compaſsion alſo of their very bruit beaſtes.</p>

                  <p>What is the cauſe that we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do not obſerue the Saturday, as the Iewes doe, ſeeing there is ſo good reaſon to obſerue it?</p>

                  <p>With great reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Saterday into the Sunday, as hee hath alſo done Circumciſion into Baptiſme, the Paſchal lambe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bleſſed Sacrament, &amp; al other
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13191:73"/>
good thinges of the old Teſtament, into better thinges in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Wherefore, if the Saturday was celebrated in memorie of the creation of the worlde; becauſe in that day the worke of the creation was ended: with more reaſon the Sunday is celebrated in memorie of the ſame creation: for that in the ſunday the ſaid creation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gune: and if the Iewes did geue to God the laſt day of the weeke, then Chriſtians do better, who geue him the firſt. Moreouer vpon the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, memorie is made of three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal benefites of our Redemption. For Chriſt was borne on the ſunday, on ſunday he roſe, and vpon Sunday he ſent the Holie Ghoſt to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Finally the Saturday did ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the repoſe which the holie ſoules had in Limbo: the Sunday ſignifieth the glorie which the holie ſouls haue now, and the bodies ſhal haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13191:73"/>
in heauen. And therefore the Iewes did celebrate the Saterday, becauſe when they died they went to repoſe in Limbo: but chriſtians celebrate the ſunday, becauſe when they dye they go vnto the glorious bliſſe of heauen: which yet is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, if they haue done wel accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the holie Law, which God hath geuen them.</p>

The ſecond thing is, that in the commanded feaſtes we are bound to be preſent at the holie Sacrifice of Maſſe.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13191:74"/>
or the greateſt part thereof, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſpiritual reading, in viſiting Churches, in hearing ſermons, and in doing like holie exerciſes: for this is the end, for which feaſtes were inſtituted.</p>

The ſecond, that they be not neceſſary for the ſeruice of God: for which it is allowed to ring the Bels, and to doe other workes in the Church that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be done another day. And beſides theſe conditions,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13191:75"/>
it is alſo lawfull to do ſeruile workes, vpon the holie day, when licence is granted by the Prelate for reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe.</p>

                  <p>Three thinges are vnderſtood, helpe, obedience, &amp; reuerence. Firſt, wee are bound to helpe &amp; aſsiſt our father &amp; mother in their neceſsities.

And it is great reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that children hauing receiued life of their father &amp; mother, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to preſerue vnto them the ſame life. Further wee are bounde to obey our father &amp; mother, as S. Paul ſaith in all things in our Lorde, that is, in all things which are conformable to the will of our Lord: for that when our father or mother commandeth vs any thing, which is contrary to the wil of God, then we muſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the commaundemente of Chriſt, hate our father and mother, that is, not obey or giue eare vnto them, no otherwiſe then if they were

our enimies. Finally we are bound to reuerence our father &amp; mother in bearing them reſpect, and honoring them in words, &amp; exterior behauior, as is conuenient: &amp; ſo great account God made of this in the olde teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he commanded that who ſoeuer durſt curſe his father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould be killed.</p>

                  <p>Truely the bonde is reciprocall, and all one, betwixt the parents and the children. For euen as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are bound to help, to reuerence, and to obey their parents: ſo the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are bound to prouide for the children, not only meate &amp; clothes,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13191:76"/>
but alſo that they be taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. But the law of parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their children, is ſo naturall and ordinarie, that there is no neede of any other written law, to put Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in mind of their bond towards their children. But contrariwiſe it is often ſeene, that children are not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable in loue towardes their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. And therfore it was neceſſary to admoniſh them by this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of their dutie: neither is God contented with a bare commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but hath adjoyned a promiſe, and a threatning to make them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it.</p>

                  <p>It is grounded in all lawes: in the law of Nature, in the written lawe, and in the law of Grace. In the lawe of nature it is found, that the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch Iudas would haue put to death a woman called Thamar, who had bin his ſonnes wife, and being now widdow was founde with childe. Whereby it appeareth, that in that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13191:80"/>
time, before the Law of Moſes was giuen, by the inſtinct of nature, men did know that fornication was ſinne. After in the lawe of Moſes, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is forbidden in many places. And in the Epiſtles of S. Paul, wee reade many times, that fornicators ſhall not enter into the glorie of heauen. Neither is it true, that forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth no hurt nor injurie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. For it hurteth the ſame woman, who thereby looſeth her fame: it hurteth the childe which is borne a baſtard: it doth injurie to Chriſt, for we being all members of Chriſt, hee that committeth fornication, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the member of Chriſt, the member of an harlot. Finally, hee doth injurie to the Holie Ghoſt, for that our bodies are the temple of the Holie Ghoſt, and ſo he that defileth his bodie with fornication, defileth the temple of the Holie Ghoſt.</p>

Secondly, al vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are made by lending of money with couenant, that it ſhal be reſtored with ſomething more: And theſe are reduced to roberie, becauſe he that taketh vſurie, exacteth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hathlent. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, al the damages which are done to our neighbour, though he that is the occaſion thereof, gaine nothing thereby: As when one burneth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans houſe. And this is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſometimes to theft, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to roberie, according as the harme is done ſecretly or manifeſtly. Fourthly, he that payeth not that he is bouud to pay, ſinneth againſt this

commandement, as much as if hee ſhould ſteale, in that hee keepeth an other mans goods againſt the wil of the owner.

                  <p>There is no doubt at all but that when the deſire of adulterie is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, the deſire alſo of fornication and of all other diſhoneſties, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to bee forbidden, for that the ſame reaſon is of all theſe ſinnes.</p>

                  <p>S. Gregory the Pope hath taugth vs, that in an euill deſire there are three degrees. The firſt is called ſuggeſtion; the ſecond delectation; the third conſent. Suggeſtion is when the diuell putteth into the minde a diſhoneſt thought, which is accompanied with a ſuddaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of euill deſire: and if to this ſuggeſtion, there be reſiſtance made preſently, ſo that it come to no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, a man doth not ſin, but merite before God: but if the ſuggeſtion paſſe to a ſenſuall delectation, and there bee no conſent of reaſon and will, then a man is not without ſome veniall ſinne: but if to the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and delectation, the conſent of reaſon and will be annexed, ſo that a man perceiue it and deſire it, and willingly remaine in ſuch a deſire &amp; thought, it is a mortall ſinne, and this is that which is properly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in this commandement.</p>

                  <p>The reaſon is this, becauſe a man doeth not deſire principally any thing, but that which bringeth him ſome good, at the leaſt in apparance. And ſo hee deſireth adulterie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it bringeth delight he deſireth

theft, for that it bringeth profite: murder bringeth no good at all, &amp; therefore it is not deſired for it ſelfe, but only to attaine to adulterie, or to theft, or to ſome other his deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for this cauſe, though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of murder, be a moſt grieuous ſin, yet God did not forbid it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly: for that it might be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as forbidden, when murder it ſelfe was forbidden.

I wil therfore declare vnto you what a ſacrament is, how many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments there bee, by whom they were inſtituted, and ſome other fewe things: and after we will come to the declaration of euerie one of them in particular.</p>

               <p>A Sacrament is a holy Myſtery, by which God beſtoweth his grace, and with all it repreſenteth exterior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the inuiſible effect, which grace worketh in our ſoule. For if wee were ſpirits without bodies, as the Angels
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:13191:91"/>
are, God would giue vs his grace ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually: but becauſe we are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a ſoule and a bodie, therefore our Lord condeſcending to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, geueth vs his grace by means of certayn corporal actions, which as I haue ſaid, together with certain exterior ſignes declare to vs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward effect of grace. As for example holie Baptiſme, which is one of the Sacraments, is done by waſhing the bodie with water, and therwith cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon the moſt holie Trinitie. By means of which ceremonious wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, God geueth his grace, &amp; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it in the ſoule of him, that is baptiſed. And it inſtructeth vs, that as that water waſheth the bodie, ſo grace waſheth the ſoule &amp; clenſeth it from al ſinne.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S</speaker>
               <p>If I haue wel vnderſtood, three conditions are requiſit to the nature of a Sacrament: firſt, that it be a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, or as we would ſay, an
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13191:92"/>
exterior action: the ſecond, that God by it giue his grace: the third, that the ſame ceremonie haue a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with the effect of grace, and ſo repreſent and ſignifie it exteriorly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>You haue vnderſtood it very wel. Now you haue to know further, that theſe Sacraments are in al ſeauen, &amp; are called Baptiſme, Confirmation or Chriſme, Euchariſt, Penance, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Vnction, Order, and Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. The reaſon wherfore they are ſeauen is this: for that God would proceed in giuing vs ſpiritual life, as he vſeth to proceed in giuing vs our corporal life. Touching corporal life, firſt is needful to be borne, ſecondly, is needfull to grow, thirdly, is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be nouriſhed: fourthly when a man falleth ſicke, it is needful he vſe phiſicke: ſiftly, when he muſt fight, he hath need to arme himſelfe: ſixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is needfull, that there bee ſome to gouerne and rule thoſe that are now
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13191:92"/>
borne &amp; growne; ſeuenthly, is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full there be ſome to multiplie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: for ſeeing thoſe that are borne do die, if others ſhould not ſucceed, mankinde would ſoone decay. So then touching the ſpiritual life, firſt it is needfull that Gods grace bee borne in vs, &amp; this is done by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: ſecondly, it is needfull that the ſame grace increaſe and bee made ſtrong: &amp; this is done by Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: thirdly, is needful, that it be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and maintained, &amp; this doth the Euchariſt worke: fourthly, is needfull that it be recouered, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it is loſt, and this is done be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of Penance. Fiftly, is needfull that at the poynt of death, a man arme himſelfe againſt the infernal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimy, who then, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer aſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs, &amp; this doth extreme Vnctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worke: Sixtly, is neceſſary that there be in the church ſuch as may guid &amp; gouerne vs in ſpiritual life, &amp; this is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13191:93"/>
done by Orders. Seuenthly, is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that there bee in the Church, ſuch as do multiplie mankinde, and the number of the faithfull thereby, and this is done by the Sacrament of Matrimonie.</p>

Moreouer all the Sacraments are as certaine condicts, by which the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts Paſsion is deriued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. And ſure it is, that none can beſtow the treaſure of Chriſts paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in that maner and by thoſe meanes, which chriſt hath ordained.</p>

               <p>There were many Sacraments in the olde Teſtament, but they were different from ours in foure things. Firſt, thoſe were moe in number the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ours, and therefore the old law was harder then the new law. Secondly, thoſe were not ſo eaſie to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as ours are. Thirdly, thoſe were more obſcure, whereby fewe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what they ſignifyed: whereas ours haue ſo cleere ſignifycation, that euery one may vnderſtande them. Fourthly, thoſe did not giue grace, which ours do: but did onely figuratiuely foreſhew and promiſe it. So that our Sacraments are much more excellent: being fewer, more eaſie, more cleere, and more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, then thoſe were.</p>

               <p>They are al great, &amp; euerie one of them hath ſome peculiar great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. The greateſt of al is the moſt holie Sacrament of the Euchariſt, for in it is contained the Author of grace, and of al goodnes which is Chriſt our Lord, yet touching the neceſsitie, the moſt neceſſarie of all are Baptiſme &amp; Penance. In reſpect of the dignitie of thoſe that can mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacramentes: the more worthie are Confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Order, becauſe theſe two Sacraments, can not be geuen ordinarily, but by a Biſhop. In reſpect of the facilitie, the moſt eaſie is Extreme Vnction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by it ſinnes are remitted with out trouble of penance: touching the ſignification, Matrimonie is the greateſt, becauſe it ſignifieth the vnion of Chriſt with the Church.</p>

Firſt is required true and naturall water, which muſt be applied to the partie that is Baptiſed: Secondly, at the ſame time when the water is vſed,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13191:95"/>
theſe wordes muſt be ſpoken: <hi>I Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thee in the name of the Father, &amp; of the Sonne, and of the Holie Ghoſt.</hi> Thirdly, it is neceſſarie, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that baptiſeth haue intention to baptiſe, that is, to giue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Chriſt hath inſtituted, and which Holie Church vſeth to giue, when ſhee baptiſeth. For if one had intention only to ieſt, or to waſh only the body of ſome foulenes, hee ſhould ſinne moſt grieuouſly, and it were no baptiſme, and ſo the poore ſoule were not baptiſed.</p>

                  <p>It worketh three effects. Firſt it reneweth a man perfectly, giuing him the grace of God, by which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the childe of the diuel, he becommeth the childe of God, and of a ſinner becommeth iuſt; and it doth not only waſh the ſoule from all ſpot of ſinne, but it deliuereth it alſo from all the paines of Hell, and of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13191:95"/>
Purgatorie. In ſo much, that if one ſhould die immediatly after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, hee ſhould goe directly into Heauen, as if he had neuer commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſin. Secondly, Baptiſme leaueth in the ſoule a certain ſpiritual marke which cannot by any meanes be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, by which it ſhall for euer be knowne, yea alſo in thoſe which goe to Hell, that they receiued Baptiſme, and that they had been of the ſheepe of Chriſt. As by the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar marks it is knowne in this world, to whom ſlaues or cattle do belong. And this is the cauſe why Baptiſme can not bee taken oftner then once: for it is neuer loſt, this effect thereof remayning for euer printed in the ſoule. Thirdly, by Baptiſme a man entreth into the Church, and is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of all the benefits thereof, as a childe of holie Church, and maketh profeſsion to bee a Chriſtian, and to be readie to obey thoſe that in place
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:13191:96"/>
of Chriſt gouerne the Church.</p>

at the leaſt, without deſiring it, can not enter into heauen: and becauſe litle infants, are in great danger to die eaſely, and can not at that age haue any ſuch deſire of Baptiſme; it is therefore neceſſarie to baptiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with all ſpeede that may be. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they knowe not what they take, the Church ſupplyeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which by the godfather &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother anſwereth and promiſeth for them, and this ſufficeth: becauſe as by the meanes of Adam wee are fallen into ſin, and into the offence of God, not knowing any thing: ſo God is contented, that by meanes of Baptiſme, and of the Church, we bee deliuered from ſinne, and turne into his grace, yea though we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereof.</p>

                  <p>The Hoaſt which you ſee vpon the Altar, before it be conſecrated, is nothing elſe but a litle bread, made in forme of a thin Wáfer cake: but immediatly, when the Prieſt hath pronounced the conſecration, there is preſent in the Hoaſt the true bodie of our Lord: and becauſe the true bodie of our Lord is liuing, and vnited to the Diuinitie, in the perſon of the Sonne of God, therefore toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the bodie is the blood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and the ſoule, and the Deitie, and ſo whole Chriſt, God and man. In the ſame maner in the Chalice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſecration, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a litle wine with a litle
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13191:99"/>
water, but ſuddenly the conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being ended, there is the true blood of Chriſt: and becauſe the blood of Chriſt is not forth of his bodie, therefore in the Chalice, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the blood, are the body, the ſoule, and the Deitie of the ſame Chriſt, and ſo whole Chriſt, God, man.</p>

                  <p>So it is, that in the Hoaſt there remaineth the figure and alſo the colour, and the taſte of bread, which was there before, but not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bread, which was before. And ſo vnder the forme of bread, there is not bread, but the bodie of our Lorde. And the better to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, I wil giue you an example You haue heard that Lots wife was
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13191:100"/>
conuerted into a ſtatute of ſalt: thoſe that ſaw the ſtatute, did ſee the figure of Lot his wife, which then was not any more Lots wife but vnder the figure of a woman was ſalt. As there fore in that conuerſion, the inward ſubſtance was changed, &amp; the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhape remayned: ſo in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, the inward ſubſtance is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from bread into the bodie of our Lord, the outward figure of bread remaining, which was there before. The ſame alſo you are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of the Chalice, that is, that there is the figure, the taſte, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour &amp; the ſmel of wine: yet is there not the ſubſtance of wine, but the blood of our Lord, vnder that forme of wine.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13191:100"/>
but the power of God is alſo great who can do greater things then we can vnderſtand: and ſo Chriſt when he ſaid, in the holie goſpel, that God could make a camel, which is a beaſt bigger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a horſe, to paſſe through the eye of a nedle, he added, that with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things are impoſsible; but with God al things are poſſible.</p>

                  <p>It is not needfull to vnderſtand the wonders of God, but it ſufficeth to beleue them, ſeeing we are certain that God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deceiue vs. Yet I wil giue you an example for your conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. It is ſure that our ſoule is but one &amp; is whole in al the members of the body, al wholly in the head, al in the feet, yea whole in euery litle part of our bodie; what marueill is it then, that God can make the body of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13191:101"/>
his Sonne to be in many Hoaſts, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one and the ſame ſoule to bee whole &amp; intire, in ſo many &amp; ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and diſtinct parts of the bodie? It is read in the life of S. Anthonie of <hi>Padua,</hi> that the ſame time hee was Preaching in a citie of Italie, he was alſo by Gods power in <hi>Portugal,</hi> to do ſome other good works. And if God could make Saint Anthonie, to be in two places at one time, ſo farre diſtant, &amp; that in his proper forme, wherefore can he not make that Chriſt be preſent in manie Hoaſts, vnder the forme of the ſame Hoaſt?</p>

                  <p>Tel me, I pray you, if Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Heauen when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the Hoaſts, or remaineth he ſtil in Heauen?</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13191:101"/>
example of our ſoule: when one is a childe of few daies old, and very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as you ſee; and being meaſured, is founde to bee but one Palme in length, after increaſing, he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth double ſo bigge as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and ſo being meaſured, he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue two Palmes. Now I demande of you, if the ſoule which was firſt in one palme only, hath left that palme to come into the ſecond or no? Sure it is that it hath not left it, neither is it inlarged, becauſe it is inuiſible, ſo that without leauing the firſt, it commeth alſo into the ſecond: euen ſo our Lord leaueth not heauen to come into the Hoaſt, neither lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the one Hoaſt to be in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he is preſent in Heauen &amp; in all the Hoaſtes at once.</p>

                  <p>Three things are requuired, the firſt is, that the partie doe confeſſe himſelfe of all his ſinnes, &amp; procure that he be in the grace of God, when hee goeth to communicate, for that one of the cauſes, wherefore this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is giuen to vs, vnder the forme of bread, is to the end we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that it is giuen to liuing men, &amp; not to dead-men, to nouriſh the grace of God, and to increaſe it. The ſecond thing is, that wee be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together faſting, that is, at the leaſt from midnight forward we haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nothing: no not ſomuch as a litle water. The third, that we wel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what we do, and that we haue deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto ſo great a myſterie: &amp; therfore this ſacrament is not giuen to children, neither to fooles, neither to any other that hath not the vſe of reaſon.</p>

                  <p>It reconſileth God vnto the world, &amp; obteyneth manie benifits, not only for the liuing, but alſo for the dead, that are in purgatorie. You muſt vnderſtand that in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament they offered vnto God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Sacrifices of beaſtes, but in the new Teſtament in place of al thoſe Sacrifices, is ſucceeded the Maſſe, in which by the hands of the Prieſt is offered vnto God, the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Sacrifice of the bodie and bloud of his Sonne, which was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in al thoſe ſacrifices of the old Teſtament.</p>

                  <p>It maketh vs mindful of ſo great a benifite, and in flameth vs to loue him againe, that hath loued vs ſo much. And therefore like as God in the old Teſtament, would haue the Iewes not only to eate Manna, which he ſent them from Heauen, but alſo haue them keep one veſſel ful of the ſame, in memorie of all the benefits he ſhewed them, when he brought them out of Egipt: ſo Chriſt would that this moſt holie Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould not only be eaten by vs, but alſo that it be conſerued on the Altar, and ſometimes carried in Proceſsion, that when ſoeuer we ſee it, we may remember his infinite goodnes towards vs. But in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the holie Maſſe is a briefe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the whole life of our lord, that the ſame may ſtil remaine in our mindes.</p>

                  <p>I wil declare it briefly. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troitus</hi> (or beginning) of the Maſſe, doth ſignifie the deſire which the holie Fathers had of the comming of our Lord. The <hi>Keyrieleiſon</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the voice of the ſame Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Prophets, demanding of God, this comming of chriſt, ſo long deſired. <hi>Gloria in excelſis,</hi> ſignifieth the Natiuitie of our Lord. The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers next following, ſignifie his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation &amp; offering in the Temple. The Epiſtle, which is reade at the lift end of the Altar, ſignifieth the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of S. Iohn Baptiſt. Who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited al men to Chriſt. The Gradual ſignifieth the conuerſion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the preaching of S. Iohn. The goſpel, which is read at the right end of the altar, ſignifieth the preaching
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13191:104"/>
of our Lord, which bringeth vs from the left hand vnto the right: that is, from temporal things to eternall, &amp; from ſinne to grace: lights alſo are carried, &amp; incenſe burned to ſignifie that the holie Goſpel hath lightened the world, &amp; filled it with the good ſauors of the glorie of God. The Crede ſignifieth the firſt conuerſion of the holie Apoſtles, and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of our Lord. The ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after the Creede ſignifie the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret practiſes of the Iewes againſt Chriſt. The Preface, which is ſongue with a lowd voice, and endeth with <hi>Oſanna in excelſis,</hi> ſignifieth the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne enterance which Chriſt made into Ieruſalem on Palme-ſunday. The Canon ſignifieth the Paſſion of our Lord. The eleuation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Hoaſte and Chalice, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to vs, that Chriſt was eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the Croſſe. The <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> ſignifieth, the praier of our Lord
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13191:105"/>
whiles he did hang on the Croſſe: the breaking of the Hoaſt ſignifieth the wound made by the ſpeare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his ſide. The <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the lamentation of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, at the taking downe of Chriſt from the Croſſe. The communion of the Prieſt, ſignifieth the burial of Chriſt. The Poſt-communion ſong with ioy, ſignifieth the Reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> ſignifieth the Aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion. The benediction of the Prieſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the comming of the Holie Ghoſt. The Goſpel at the end of Maſſe, ſignifieth the preaching of the holie Apoſtles, when being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the holie Ghoſt, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach the Goſpel through the whole world, and ſo begane the conuerſion of the Gentils.</p>

                  <p>Penance ſignifieth three things. Firſt it ſignifieth a certaine vertue by which a man repenteth himſelfe of his ſinnes, and the contrarie vice is called impenitence, to wit, when a man wil not repent, but wil perſeuer in ſinne. Secondly we cal penance the paine &amp; affliction, which a man taketh to ſatisfie to God, for the euil he hath done, And ſo we ſay that one doth great penance, becauſe he afflicteth himſelfe much, with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings and other auſteritie. Thirdly penance ſignifieth a Sacrament, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt to remit ſinnes of thoſe, who after Baptiſme haue loſt the grace of God, and do againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the ſame, and deſire to returne into his fauour.</p>

the Prieſt. For that chriſt hath made the Prieſt judges of ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after Baptiſme, and giuen them authoritie in his place, to remitte them, ſo the ſinner confeſſe them, and bee otherwiſe diſpoſed as hee ought to be. So in this conſiſteth the Sacrament, that like as the ſinner confeſſeth his ſinnes exteriorly, and the Prieſt exteriorly pronounceth abſolution: ſo God inwardly by meanes of thoſe words of the Prieſt, looſeth that ſoule from the band of ſinne, with which it was tyed, and reſtored it to grace, and deliuereth it from that it had deſerued, to haue been caſt head-long into hell.</p>

                  <p>We reape foure very great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities by this Sacrament. The firſt is that which was ſaide euen now, that God doth pardon vs the ſinnes committed after Baptiſme, and doth change the eternall paine of hell, into a temporall paine, to bee ſuffered in this life, or in Purgatory. The ſecond, that the good workes which wee had wrought, during the time we were in grace, and were loſt by ſin, are reſtored to vs by meanes of this Sacrament. The third is, that we bee looſed from the band of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, if perhaps we were tyed therewith. For you muſt knowe that Excommunication is a moſt grieuous puniſhment, which depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs of the prayers of Holye church, of lawfully receiuing the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, likewiſe of conuerſing with faithful people, &amp; finally of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:13191:108"/>
buriall, and from this ſo terrible a puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wee are deliuered, by the Sacrament of penance, according to the authority, which the Confeſſors haue of the Biſhoppe or of the Pope. Albeit this abſolution from Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication may alſo be geuen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sacrament, by the Prelate, though he be no Prieſt. The fourth and laſt fruit is, that wee are made capable of the indulgences which the Popes do often geue.</p>

By pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is vnderſtoode the hearing of Maſſe, ſaying of the ſeuen Pſalmes, the Offfice of the dead, and other like things.

                  <p>Extreame Vnction, is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which our Lord inſtituted for the ſick. It is called Vnction, becauſe it conſiſteth in annoynting the ſicke with holie Oyle, and receyting ouer him certaine prayers. And it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Extreame, as being the laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Vnctions, which are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the church.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:13191:110"/>
For the firſt vnction is giuen in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, the ſecond in confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the third in Prieſthood, the laſt in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: &amp; it may alſo be called extreme for that it is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the end of the life</p>

                  <p>They are three.

The third is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the health of the bodie, if that be expedient for the eternal ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame ſicke perſon.

                  <p>The Apoſtle S. Paul hath cleered this doubt, hauing written, that who ioyneth himſelfe in Mariage doth wel, but he that doth not ioyne himſelf, but keepeth virginitie doth better. And the reaſon is, becauſe Mariage is a thing humane, virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is Angelical. Mariage is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature, Virginitie is aboue nature. And not only virginitie but widowhood alſo is better then mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Therefore whereas our Sauiour ſaid in a parable, that the good ſeede yelded in one field thirtie fold fruit; in an other threeſcore, in an other a hundred fold: the holie Doctors haue declared, that the thirtie fold fruite is of Matrimonie, the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore fold of widowhood, hundereth fold of virginitie.</p>

But there be ſome other things profitable alſo, to the end we pretend of obtayning eternall ſaluation, to wit, Vertues and Vices, good workes and ſinnes. For albeit wee haue ſpoken alreadie of theſe things in general, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Creede, and of the Commandements, yet it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable to ſpeake of them more diſtinctly and in particular.</p>

               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>Vertue is a qualitie which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the ſoule, and maketh a man good. For as ſcience maketh a man a good Philoſopher, and art maketh one a good artificer: ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:13191:113"/>
maketh a good man, and cauſeth him to doe that which is good, and that with facilitie, readineſſe and perfection. Whereas hee that hath not vertue, though hee may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do well, yet he ſhall not doe it without difficultie and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof to giue you ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, vertue is like to art, and practiſe. For you ſee one that hath art, to play on the Citerone or Lute, playeth both wel &amp; with facilitie, although he neuer look vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtrings, where as an other that hath not the art, or hath not practiſe, may well touch the ſtrings, and make them ſounde, but hee ſhall neither doe it readily nor ſo well. Euen ſo hee that hath the vertue (for example) of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, faſted with great facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and cheerefulneſſe, when it is needfull, and hee faſteth perfectly, expecting the conuenient houre, and eating meates appoynted, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:13191:114"/>
once only, but he that hath not this vertue, or contrariwiſe is a glutton, it ſeemeth a death to him to faſt, and if perhaps hee faſt, he can not well expect the due houre of dinner, and after at night, in place of a drinking as the cuſtome is, he will make ſo large a collation, as wanteth little of a ſupper.</p>

               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>The cauſe is, for that faith doth relie vpon infallible veritie, for ſo much as all that faith propoſeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, is reueiled from God, &amp; God is veritie it ſelf. Wherefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that, which God ſayeth, ſhould be falſe. And ſo when faith propoſeth anie thing vnto vs, which
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13191:115"/>
appeareth contrarie to reaſon, as for example, that a virgin ſhould bring forth a child, it is neceſſarie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that humaine reaſon is feeble, &amp; may eaſely be deceiued, but God can not be deceiued nor deceiue vs.</p>

               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>It is neceſſarie to beleue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, al the Articles of the Crede, which before I haue declared.

vices, which are in the extreames, One vice contrarie to Prudence, is Imprudence, that is, inconſideration and raſhnes: and it is in thoſe, that do not conſider what they haue to do; &amp; ſo either they looke not to the true end, or they vſe not the true meanes. The other vice is ſubtiltie: or carnal pollicie: and it is in thoſe that with great diligence think of the end, &amp; of the meanes, but they direct al things to their priuat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, for the gaining of ſome worldlie benefit. And therfore they endeuour ſubtilly, to deceiue their neighbour, to bring to paſſe their buſines to their owne purpoſe.

euery one that is his own: and ſo the office thereof is to make things iuſt, &amp; to put equalitie in humaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts: which is the foundation of quietnes &amp; of peace.

                  <p>They are two. One is Iniuſtice, that is, when one taketh that which belongeth to an other, or in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracts giueth leſſe then he ought, or taketh more then is due to him. The other is too much juſtice, that is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one is too rigorous, &amp; wreaſteth things by pretence of juſtice more ſeueerely then reaſon requireth. For in ſome caſes, it is neceſſarie, that compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bee mixed with juſtice.

                  <p>They are Intemperance, and Inſenſibility. Intemperance is, when one is too much giuen to delights, and therefore committeth exceſſes in eating, and ſuch thinges as doe hurt both the ſoule and the bodie. Inſenſibilitie is, when a man vſeth the other extreame, and ſo flyeth all pleaſures, that he wil not eate things neceſſarie for his health, to auoyd that little delectation, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:13191:119"/>
meats doe naturally bring. But the vice of inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance is much more common amongſt men, then the vice of inſenſibilitie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all holie men, by word and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, haue exhorted vs to faſting, &amp; to mortification of the fleſh.</p>

               <p>To attaine to the perfection of Chriſtian life: For they are as the ladder, by which wee clime vp, from the ſtate of ſinne by diuers degrees, euen to the higheſt of ſanctitie. But you muſt knowe, that the Prophet numbreth theſe ſteppes comming
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:13191:120"/>
downwards. For he did ſee as it were a ladder which came from Heauen. Neuertheles we will recoont the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, as going vpwards &amp; aſcen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding from earth to heauen. The firſt degree then is, the Feare of our lord, which doth terrifie a ſinner, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thinketh that he hath God almighty his enemiet the ſecond degree is Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie: For he that feareth puniſhment which God threatneth againſt a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, beginneth to become godlie, &amp; deſireth to obey and ſerue God, and to worke his holie will in all things. The thirde degree is Knowledge, for that hee vvho deſireth to vvorke the vvill of God, demaundeth of God that he will teach him, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie commandements, &amp; God part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Preachers, partly by books, &amp; partly by inwarde inſpirations, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him all that is neceſſarie. The fourth degree is Fortitude, for hee that knoweth, and is willing in all
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13191:120"/>
thinges to ſerue God, findeth many difficulties &amp; tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the world the fleſh &amp; the diuel. And therefore god at that time of need giueth him the gift of Fortitude, that he may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome al difficulties. The fift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is Counſell, for when the diuell cannot preuaile by force, he turneth himſelf to decepts, and vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of good, prouoketh the juſt man to fall: yet God doth not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, but giueth him the gift of Counſell, by which he preuaileth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the deceipts of the enemy: the ſixt is the gift of Vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, for when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is wel exerciſed in actiue life, and hath had many victories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the diuel, god doth draw him &amp; exalt him to contemplatiue life, and with the gifte of vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, maketh him to vnderſtande and penitrate diuine Myſteries. The ſeauenth, is the gift of Wiſdome, which is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plement of perfection
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:13191:121"/>
For he is wiſe that knoweth the firſt cauſe of all thinges, and according thereto, formeth al his actions: which none can doe, but hee that joyneth perfect charitie, to the gift of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. For by the vnderſtanding he knoweth the firſt cauſe, and by charitie, hee directeth and diſpoſeth all thinges vnto it, as vnto the laſt ende.

               <p>Chriſt our Lord, in the three firſt degrees, teacheth vs to take away the impediments of perfection, whereby we aſcend vnto felicitie. The generall and ordinarie impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are three; the deſire of goods, of honors, and pleaſures. So Chriſt ſaith in the firſt degree, that the poore in ſpirit are bleſſed, that is, thoſe who willingly diſpiſe goods. In the ſecond he ſaith, that the meeke are bleſſed, that is, thoſe that geue place to all, not reſiſting thoſe, that put themſelues before, and thruſt them behinde. In the third he ſaith, that thoſe are bleſſed that weepe, that is, thoſe that ſeeke not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and pleaſures of the world, but attend to do penance, and to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:13191:122"/>
be waile their ſinnes. In other two degrees he teacheth vs the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the actiue life, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in fulfilling all that wee are bound vnto by iuſtice, and by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Therefore he ſaith in the fourth degree, that thoſe are bleſſed, that hunger and thirſt iuſtice. And in the fift he ſaith, that the mercifull are bleſſed. In the laſt two, he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to perfection of the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue life: and therfore he ſaith in the ſixt, that they are bleſſed, that haue a cleane hart, for they ſhall ſee God, that is, they ſhall ſee him in the life to come, in glorie; and in this they ſhall know him by grace of contemplation: &amp; in the ſeuenth he ſaith, that the peaceable are bleſſed becauſe they ſhal be called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; that is, bleſſed are they who hauing added perfect charitie, to contemplation, haue made al their repoſe in God, and pacified all
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13191:122"/>
the Kingdome of the ſoule, and ſo they ſhalbe children of God, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Father, holie and perfect. In the eight ſentence no new degree of perfection is contained, as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine doth well ſay, but there is declared a manifeſt ſigne, to know if one be arriued to perfection: &amp; this ſigne is to ſuffer willingly vniuſt perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the like as that gold is tried in the fornace, ſo is a iuſt and perfect man in tribulations.</p>

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:13191:123"/>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M</speaker>
               <p>Three things may excuſe vs. The firſt is when a man hath not the meanes to do them: and ſo that good Lazarus, the poore begger, of whom it is read in the Goſpel, did no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall workes of mercie, becauſe himſelfe had need, in a manner of all thoſe workes, and ſo was crouned for his patience. And this is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, that the rich may ſaue themſelues, by ſhewing mercie,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:13191:123"/>
&amp; the poore by the way of patience, and ſo he that hath not knowledge or prudence for himſelfe, is not bound to teach or giue counſaile to others. The ſecond cauſe is, when a man ſerueth God in a higher ſorte, then the actiue life is, and by reaſon of that ſtate, hath no occaſion to do manie workes of charitie, ſo the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Eremits, that remayne incloſed in ſolitarie places, or in their cels, to contemplate heauenlie thinges, are not bound to leaue that holie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and goe to ſeeke thoſe, to whom they may do workes of mercie. The third cauſe is, when a man doth not finde anie that hath notorious need of his mercie: for that we are not bound to ſuccor anie but thoſe, who can not help themſelues, or haue not others that will and can help them. True it is, that perfect mercie doth not expect the time of the bond, but is readie to ſuccour in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13191:124"/>
it can, and all that it can.</p>

Firſt, that there be ſome act committed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that is, to doe and worke a thing forbidden, or not to doe a thing commanded. As for example,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13191:124"/>
to blaſpheame is a committing, not to heare Maſſe is an omiſsion.

And by the lawe of God, is not only vnderſtood, that which he hath giuen by himſelfe, as the ten commandements are, but that alſo, which he giueth vs by his vicar in earth, the Pope his holines, and other ſuperiors, aſwell ſpirituall as temporal: becauſe al are the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, &amp; haue authoritie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: thirdly, is required, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or omitting be voluntarie: for

whatſoeuer is done without conſent of the will, is no ſinne. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if one blaſpheme when he ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or hath not the vſe of reaſon, or probably knoweth not, that ſuch a word is blaſphemie: in ſuch a caſe a man ſinneth not: becauſe there is no conſent of the will.</p>

               <p>Vice is an euill habite, or an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil cuſtome of ſinning, procured by often ſinning. Whereof commeth, that a nan ſinneth more eaſely: and with more boldnes and alacritie. As (for example) we do call one a bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemer, or a gameſter, when he is woont to blaſpheme, or vſeth gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. So that to blaſpheme is a ſin, &amp; to be a blaſphemer is a vice. And ſo we may ſay of al the other ſinnes.</p>

euill, &amp; diſpleaſeth God more then any thing elſe, which appeareth by this, that God ſpareth not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy &amp; looſe the moſt noble things that hee hath, to puniſh finne. If a Prince had a veſſell of ſiluer, or of gold moſt fayre and moſt precious, and finding in it ſome ſtincking li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quore, ſhould be ſo diſpleaſed there with, that he ſhould breake it &amp; caſt it into the bottome of the Sea, you would doubtles ſay, that Prince had a wounderfull great hate againſte that liquore. So God hath made two moſt precious veſſels: one of ſiluer, which is man, &amp; one of gold which is an Angell. And for that hee hath found this ſtincking liquore of ſin, in the one and in the other, he hath broken them, and caſt into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of hell to perpetuall miſerie, all thoſe Angels that ſinned, and daily caſteth into the ſame place of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all thoſe men that die in their

For you haue to know, that when God made the firſt man, and the firſt woman, called Adam and Eue, he gaue them ſeuen gifts. Firſt, he gaue them his grace, by which they were iuſte, and the friends of God, &amp; his adopted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Secondly, he gaue them great
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:13191:126"/>
knowledge, how to doe well and to ſhunne euill. Thirdly, he gaue them obedience of the fleſh to the ſpirite, that it ſhould not be mooued to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful deſires againſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee gaue them promptnes and great facilitie to do well, and to flie euill, and but one moſt eaſie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to obſerue. Fiftly, hee freed them from all labour, and feare. For the earth brought foorth fruites ſufficient for mans life of it ſelf: neither was there any thing that could hurt man: Sixtly, hee made them immortall, that is, that they ſhould neuer haue dyed, if they had not ſinned. Seauenthly, hee would after ſome time haue tranſlated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into Heauen, to ſuch an eternal and glorious life, as Angels haue. But the firſt man and woman, inueigled by the Diuell, did not obſerue that commandement, and ſo they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt God, and thereby loſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13191:127"/>
thoſe ſeuen giftes, which I ſpoke of. And becauſe God gaue them thoſe giftes, not only for them ſelues, but alſo for all their poſteritie, therefore they loſt them, for themſelues and for vs all: and made vs partakers of their ſinne, and of all their miſeries: as we ſhould haue bene of all their graces, and other benefites, if they had not ſinned. This then is Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſinne, an emnitie with God, and a priuation of his grace, with which priuation wee are borne. Whereof proceedeth ignorance, euil inclinations, difficultie to do well, and facilitie to do euill, the paine &amp; trauel to prouide to liue, the feares and periles in which we remaine, moſt certaine death of the bodie, &amp; alſo eternall death in hell, if before we dye, we be not deliuered of ſinne, &amp; returne not into the ſauour of God.</p>

               <p>It is already ſaide before, that the remedie is the Paſsion &amp; death of Chriſt our Lorde. For ſo God would that hee that ſhould ſatisfie for the ſinne of Adam, ſhould bee himſelfe without ſin: and the ſame was God and man, and ſo hee was infinitely acceptable to God, and did obey, not in an eaſie thing, as that was, which was commanded to Adam, but in a moſt hard thing, as was the ignominious death of the Croſſe. And this remedie is applyed to vs by holie Baptiſme, as hath bin ſaide. And albeit God doth not ſtraight-waies render vnto vs, all thoſe ſeauen gifts, yet he hath reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vs, the moſt principall which is his grace, by meanes whereof, we are made iuſt, the friends and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God and heires of Heauen.

               <p>To know when a ſinne is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, you muſt obſerue two rules, one
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13191:128"/>
is, that the ſinne be contrarie to the charitie or loue of God, or of our neighbour. The other, that it bee with full conſent of the will. For when either of theſe two things is wanting, it is not mortall but veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And a ſinne is then ſaid to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt charitie, when it is againſt the lawe in a matter of weight, as when it is a ſufficient offence to breake friendſhip: but when it is in a ſmall matter, ſuch as ordinarilie breaketh not friendſhip: It is not then againſt charitie: but is ſaid, not to be according to charitie. And ſo ſuch as commonly breaketh friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is againſt the law, becauſe it is againſt charitie, which is the end of the law, ſuch as commonly breaketh not frendſhip, is not againſt the law, but not acording to the law, becauſe it is not againſt charitie, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to charitie. Take an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to ſteale a great quantitie of money,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:13191:129"/>
is a mortal ſinne: becauſe it is againſt the law of God, being in a matter of weight, and in the iudgement of moſt men ſufficient to breake frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſo is againſt charitie: but to ſteale a farthing, or a pinne, or a like thing, is not a mortall ſinne, but a venial, becauſe it is in a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which although it be not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to charitie, yet it is not againſt charitie: becauſe it is not a thing that in reaſon can breake frendſhip. In like manner we may ſay of being voluntarie. For when a thing is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law, in a matter of weight, and fully, voluntarie, it is a mortall ſinne: but if it be not fully volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as if one haue a thought, or a ſodaine deſire to ſteale, or to kill, or to blaſpheme, and preſently percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his error, before he fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his will, it is only a veniall ſin. Therefore a man muſt ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his gard, and preſently as he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware

               <p>Pride is a ſinne, by which a man thinketh himſelf to be more then he is, and ſo preferreth himſelfe aboue others, not willing to haue others a boue him nor equall with him. The
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:13191:130"/>
ſinnes which it produceth, are vaine glorie, and vaunting of him ſelfe, contending with others, diſcorde, diſobedience, and the like. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie is to attende with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to holiehumilitie, that is, to know that a man is nothing of him ſelfe &amp; that al we haue, is the gift of God, and to thinke that others are better then wee, and therefore to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme our ſelues leſſe then others, in minde to ſubmit our ſelues to all, &amp; outwardly to honor all others ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their degrees.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in deſiring more then is ſufficient and not willing to giue the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to the poore, as we are bound. Thirdly, in louing thoſe goods, wee haue too much, though they be our owne, and not ſuperfluous. And this appeareth when a man is not found readie to looſe his goodes, in a caſe that is neceſſarie, for the honour of God. And therefore Sainte PAVL ſaith, that couetouſneſſe is (in ſome ſort) Idolatrie, for that the couetous man preferreth his goods before God, ſeeing hee is contented rather to looſe God then his goods. The ſinnes then which proceed of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe are manie, as Theft, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brie, deceipts in buying and ſelling, crueltie towards the poore, &amp; other

               <p>Enuie is a ſinne, by which one is diſpleaſed at the good of an other: for that it ſeemeth to diminiſh his owne greatnes. Where you haue to conſider, that when the good of an other diſpleaſeth you, for that he is not worthy to haue it, or becauſe hee vſeth it not well, it is no ſinne. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when you are diſpleaſed, that you alſo haue not the good, which
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:13191:132"/>
others haue, and chiefly vertue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and the like goodnes, this alſo is no ſinne, but rather is a holie and commendable emulation. But when it diſpleaſeth you, that an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſome goodneſſe, becauſe it ſeemeth to you that it darkneth your glorie, and you would that he had it not, to the end he were not your equal or your better, it is the ſin of Enuie. And it bringeth forth many ſins, as peruerſe iudgemente, ioy of an other mans euill, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and detraction. For that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious ſeeketh to diminiſh the good name of his neighbour. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſometimes it induceth to commit murder: as Cain did, who for enuie killed his brother: and the Iewes for enuie procured the death of our Lord. The remedie, is to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in brotherlie charitie, &amp; often to thinke that Enuie hurteth more him that enuieth, then him that is
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:13191:133"/>
enuied. For that the enuious affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth and fretteth himſelfe inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and oftentimes God doth exalt him that is enuied, by that means by which the enuious would haue aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. So wee ſee that the diuel for enuie cauſed man to loſe the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Paradiſe, &amp; god by that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wrought, that chriſt came into the world, &amp; ſo gaue vs the celeſtial paradiſe: The brothers of the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch Ioſeph, ſold him for enuie, and God by that occaſion brought to paſſe, that Ioſeph became lord of his brothers. Saul for enuie perſecuted Dauid, &amp; God cauſed Saul to loſe the kingdome &amp; gaue it to Dauid.</p>

               <p>Anger is a diſordinate deſire of reuenge. But you muſt knowe that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:13191:134"/>
moderat &amp; ordinate anger is good. Whereupon the Pſalme ſaith: Bee you angrie and ſinne not. And S. Baſil ſaith, that anger is like to a dogge, which is good when he bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth againſt enemies, but more whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hurteth friends. The diſorder of anger conſiſteth in three thinges. Firſt, in deſire to be reuenged of him that deſerueth it not, and that hath not offended vs. Secondly, in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to reuenge by priuate authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for that to puniſh and to vſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge againſt malefactors, doth not belong to any, but to Superiors, as to the Prince, or Magiſtrate. And for ſo much as God is the Supreame Prince, he ſaith, that to him reuenge principally belongeth. Thirdly, in reuenging for hatred, and not for zeale of juſtce, and in exceeding in the maner, &amp; in other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The ſinnes which come of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate anger, are contentions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jourious
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:13191:134"/>
words, furious behauior, outragious actions, as of mad-men: for immoderat anger is like to mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The remedie is to be exerciſed in the vertues of meekeneſſe, and of patience, conſidering the examples of holie men and of Chriſt himſelfe, who by ſupporting and ſuffering, haue triumphed more gloriouſlie then worldly men do by endeuoring to be reuenged of their enemies.</p>

And it is a mortal ſinne, when one giueth &amp; taketh loathſomnes to do well, &amp; is diſpleaſed for that he is bound to obſerue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God, and to walke in the way of vertue. The ſinnes which he produceth, are light eſteeming the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:13191:135"/>
eaſelie yeelding him ſelfe to vices: deſperation of wel-doing: hatred and diſlike of ſuch as would draw or force a ſinner to leaue ſinne and to take a good way. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is, neuer to be idle, to read good bookes, to conſider the great reward which God promiſeth to thoſe that are diligent and obſeruing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and the eternall and intollerable puniſhments, which is prouided for the negligent.</p>

Hell is the laſt euil, that melefactours are to haue, and they are to remaine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for euer, without poſsibilitie euer to change.

               <p>Concerning death, you may conſider theſe four points. Firſt, that death is moſt certaine, and none can eſcape it. The ſecond, that the houre of death is vncertaine, and manie die when they leaſt thinke of it. The third, that in death all the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life do end: and then the vanitie of the world appeareth. The fourth, that at their death eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one repenteth the euill he hath done, and the omiſsion of good, which he might haue done: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is great folie to do that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are ſure to repent vs. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iugement, you may conſider theſe points. Firſt, that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhal be geuen of a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant matter, to wit, of the chiefeſt good, or the greateſt euil. Secondly,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13191:137"/>
it ſhalbe geuen by the higheſt Iudge who knoweth all things, and whom none can reſiſt. Thirdly, it ſhall bee geuen in the preſence of the whole world, where none can hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Fourthly, there wil be no hope to flie the ſentene, or the execution of Gods Iuſtice. Concerning Hell, conſider that it is large, long, high and deepe. Large, for that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth all the paines that can bee imagined. Long, for that they are eternall. High, for that they are all moſt bitter in the higheſt degree. Depe, becauſe they are all abſolute paynes, without mixture of anie ſort of conſolation.</p>
               <p>Concerning Heauen, conſider in like maner, that it is large, for that it conteyneth all the goodnes that can be imagined, and more alſo then we can imagine or deſire. It is long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all thoſe Beatitudes are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. It is high, becauſe they are moſt
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:13191:138"/>
high and noble, It is deepe, becauſe they are pure good without any mixture of euill. And here you may adde, that the commodities of this life, haue no one of theſe conditions: for that they are few, ſhort, little, and alwaies mixed with vexations, and troubles of mind. And likewiſe the euils of this world are few, ſhort, litle, and alwaies tempered with ſome conſolation. Wherupon you are to conclude, that all thoſe haue truly loſt their wittes, that for loue of the commodities of this life, or for feare of preſent tribulations, loſe the happines, or fall into the euils, of the world to come.</p>
