         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He enſuing Sermons, as they
had their Birth for your ſakes,
ſo are they now offered into
your hands; and they come
unto you, upon the ſame
important errand, upon which their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
hath been ſent among you, <hi>viz.</hi> to
ſhew you the Path of life, and to bring you
into, and eſtablish you in, that holy ſtate
and way that leads to everlaſting Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>The chief hindrances of Sinners eternal
Happineſs (next to that innate enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God and Godleneſs, which is rooted
in their hearts) are, their prejudices againſt,
and their ignorance of the good wayes of
the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:153036:4"/>
Sathan and his Inſtruments have made it
their buſineſſe, by thoſe vollies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and unreaſonable calumnies, which
they are continually diſcharging againſt
holineſſe, to render it in the judgement of
the World, an empty and contemptible
thing.</p>
            <p>Two things there are, amongſt many
others, which they lay to the reproach of
it. The one that it is folly; whatever there
may be in this Godlineſſe, yet it is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſo many difficulties, dangers, and
hazards, and will be ſuch an unſufferable
prejudice to all that will have much to
do with it, that it is a fooliſh thing, upon
ſuch hazards and diſadvantages to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
upon it. If this will not do, but the
conſciences of Men, whilſt they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the real worth and excellency of it,
ſtand convinced, that it is not Folly but
wiſdom, to adventure on any difficulties,
to run any hazards, for ſo glorious a prize:
then comes in the ſecond reproach, That
it is but a device, a ſpecious contrivance,
to take up eager heads, to amuſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the buſie, and keep in awe weak
ſouls, when if it be enquired into, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
its glorious pretences, it will be
found nothing elſe but imagination, meer
<pb facs="tcp:153036:4"/>
fancy, and no reality at all in the heart of
it.</p>
            <p>Theſe impreſſions I have endeavoured,
according to my might, to wipe away from
your hearts; and the hearts of ſuch as
read, what you have heard, in the enſuing
diſcourſes; where, I hope, you will ſee, both
ſufficient reaſon, whence to put to ſilence
the ignorance of foolish men, to eſtablish
your hearts in the firm belief, and reſolved
embracing of it: and abundant encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to hold on your holy courſe to the
end.</p>
            <p>The other hindrance of a Godly Life, is
mens ignorance; They walk not in the way
of the Lord, becauſe they know not the way
of the Lord; ſome rude and dark notions of
Religion poſſibly they may have, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Spirit and life of Godlineſs ſtands, and
how to ſet upon an holy and heavenly courſe
they cannot tell. This hindrance I have in
part prevented in that Deſcription I have
given of a godly man, and more fully remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in thoſe Directions which I have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
for the obtaining and carrying on a
godly Life.</p>
            <p>Brethren, my hearts deſire and Prayer for
you is, that what I have done may be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
to your ſouls; <hi>that you may be ſaved,</hi>
as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; that you may be
brought into, and eſtabliſhed in the way of
<pb facs="tcp:153036:5"/>
truth, and may be found walking in the way
of Righteouſneſs. And if the Lord ſhall be
pleaſed ſo to follow theſe my endeavours
with his Bleſſing, that they may contribute
any thing to this end; if the Lord shall ſo
animate theſe (otherwiſe) dead words, by his
quickening Spirit, that any ſouls of them
that are without may be added to the
Church, that any cubits may be added to
the ſtature of thoſe that are within, it shall
be a Crown to me, and exceeding Cauſe of
rejoycing. Let the Lord Almighty have the

2. To be guilty of <hi>no connivance</hi> at them, but rather

            <p>Of theſe ſtrict Rules in the Text, he preſſes the
ſtrict obſervation: See that ye walk circumſpectly,
with an eye to every duty, to every direction; not
only the greater and more weighty duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but the leſſer and ſmaller parts of it, even
to all that the Lord <hi>requires.</hi>

            <p>1. A ſtrict charge; <hi>See,</hi> or look diligently and
carefully to it.</p>
            <p>2. The matter given in charge, <hi>Walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly,</hi>
which ſome render <hi>walk warily;</hi> others, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately,
exactly,</hi> others <hi>walk preciſely,</hi> and that a

<hi>This is wiſe walking, not as fools, but as wiſe:</hi>
Intimating, that to walk looſely, is to walk fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to walk circumſpect, is to walk wiſely, as men
of wiſdom.</p>
            <p>The obſervations from theſe words, are chiefly
theſe two:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſtians muſt be Preciſians.</p>

with the Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 9. Are made a ſpectacle

whom Heaven and Earth are divided, and the

<hi>The World is not worthy;</hi> Of whom the World ſay,

They are the <hi>Apple of mine eye;</hi> Of whom the world

whom God ſayes, They are the <hi>Sons of Wiſdom,</hi>
but men ſay, They are fools. And, as God, and
Men are thus divided, ſo are men no leſs divided
amongſt themſelves. Some few ſay concerning
theſe, as they concerning Chriſt. <hi>They are good men:</hi>
Others ſay, <hi>No, but they are deceivers of the people.</hi> A
Preciſian, with the moſt, is grown into a Proverb
of Reproach, a mark of Infamy To be a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,
a Fornicator, a Swearer, is no reproach, in
compariſon, of being noted for a Puritan.</p>
            <p>Well, but let us enquire a little more narrowly
into the way and manner of this ſort of people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
whom the World is thus moved, and hath been
in all Ages.</p>
            <p>In order hereunto I ſhall ſhew you,</p>
            <p>Firſt, What a Preciſian is; and ſecondly, prove
to you, againſt all the World, that he is no Fool,
but a truly, yea, the only wiſe man, which if I
do not, through the help of God, make evident
to the Conſciences of impartial and unprejudiced
perſons, let me paſſe for a deceiver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:153036:12"/>
Touching the former, What a Preciſian is, a
Scripture Preciſian. Let me firſt tell you, to prevent
miſtakes, who he is not.</p>
            <p>1. Not a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> a painted Sepulchre, whoſe
Religion is a meer ſhew: who hath the Form of
Godlineſſe without the power; who is pure in his
own eyes, and yet not cleanſed from his filthineſs;
who is exact about the punctilio's of Religion, and
hath a great Zeal about the <hi>minima Leges,</hi> the lower
and more circumſtantial matters, and neglects the
weightier things of the Law, this is not he.</p>
            <p>2. Not a <hi>Phanatick,</hi> properly ſo called, (though
that be a vizard put upon him by ſome, as the Hides
of Beaſts were put upon the Chriſtians of old) not
a <hi>Phanatick,</hi> I ſay, whoſe Religion is all Fancy. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
Enthuſiaſms, the Dreams and Viſions
of his own Heart; Neither is this he. Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is not a Caſtle in the air, but is a building that
hath Foundation.</p>
            <p>3. Not a <hi>Phrenetick,</hi> no ſon of violence or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
who not knowing what ſpirit he is of, calls
for fire from Heaven to ſet all in combuſtion, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing be not exactly faſhioned according to his
own mind. Neither is this he, <hi>The Wiſdom that is
from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable; the ſervants
of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By a Preciſian, I mean a ſincere circumſpect
Chriſtian, one whoſe care and endeavour is, <hi>To
walk uprightly, according to the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi>
who withdrawing himſelf from the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Faſhions and Luſts of the World, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153036:12"/>
himſelf the ſinful Liberties thereof, doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
himſelf to keep a good conſcience towards God
and men. This is the perſon againſt whom the
great hate and envy, and ſevere cenſures and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
of ungodly men, are chiefly intended, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what colour, or diſguiſe ſoever they are carried;
the enmity is not betwixt ſinners and Hypocrites,
but betwixt Sinners and Saints; the ſeed of the
Serpent, and the ſeed of the woman, not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but the true ſeed, <hi>Iſraelities</hi> indeed, are the
Men whom the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> perſecute <hi>Gal. 4. 29. He
that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him not that
pretended to be, but was born after the Spirit.</hi> Of
this Perſon, or of this ſort of people, I ſhall give
you a more full deſcription in theſe two Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By their Make, or Conſtitution.</item>
               <item>2. By their Way, or Converſation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. By their Conſtitution, they are made and cut
out exactly according to the pattern, they are born
of the Spirit, born of God and they bare the expreſs
Image of their Father upon them: <hi>Col. 3. 10. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
after the Image of Him that created him;</hi> they
are of a new <hi>Make,</hi> from what they were, there is
a mighty change wrought in and upon them,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>We are changed into the
ſame image,</hi> In our firſt birth, we were brought
forth in the Image of our firſt Father, <hi>Geneſis</hi>
5. 3. <hi>Adam begat a Son in his own Image,</hi> that is,
a fleſhly and earthly Image. The firſt man was of
the Earth, earthly, and ſuch are all his natural
Progeny, an earthly ſeed, an earthly Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153036:13"/>
he that is born of the Spirit, is brought
forth in a ſpiritual frame, <hi>John 3. 6. That which
is born of the Spirit is ſpirit:</hi> He that is born
from above is of an Heavenly <hi>Nature,</hi> as well
as <hi>Original.</hi> The change that Religion makes
on men, is not ſuch a low and inconſiderable
thing as ſome Men make it, ſtanding only in
ſome little Reformation of the Life, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
chiefly in the renewing of the Sonl after the
Image of God, the forming of Chriſt upon the
heart of Inner Man. As that ſecond change,
which ſhall be at the Reſurrection, will be the
transforming of our <hi>vile bodies,</hi> into the likeneſſe
of Chriſts Glorious Body; ſo this firſt change is a
transforming of our <hi>vile ſouls</hi> into the likeneſſe of
his glorious Spirit. Chriſtians are the Temples of
the Lord, and as <hi>Moſes</hi> made the Tabernacle exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
according to the pattern ſhewed him in the
Mount, ſo theſe ſpiritual Temples are made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
according to their pattern, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 3. They
are the Epiſtles of Chriſt, written not with Ink, but
with the Spirit of the living God, not in Tables of
ſtone, but in fleſhly Tables of the heart.</hi> Carnal
Men plead hard for their Chriſtianity, they are
all Chriſtians, all Diſciples, all the people of God,
though they be ignorant, Unbelieving, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Senſual, yet ſome kind of Profeſſion (ſuch
as it is) there is among them, a profeſſion of
Faith, a profeſſion of Repentance, which,
though it amount to little more than bare (<hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>)
I believe, I repent, I am ſorry for my Sins,
yet this muſt paſſe for Chriſtianity. But (as
Chriſt once ſaid to the tempting <hi>Jews (whoſe
is this Image and ſuperſcription?</hi> Where is the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153036:13"/>
Divine Stamp and Impreſs? Where is your like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to Chriſt? Is there not ſtill the Viſage of the
Old man? Is there not the old Pride, the old En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
the old Enmity againſt Holineſſe, the old
Guile, and Falſhood, and Luſt ſtill ſpread over
you? Is this the Image of Chriſt? Chriſtians that
are truly ſuch, are preciſely formed according to
this pattern; they have Face for Face, Limb for
Limb; Grace for Grace; all the Grace that is in
Chriſt, is truly, though not yet perfectly coppied
out upon them, though the Characters may be
ſomething blotted and obſcured, by reaſon of the
remainders of corruption, yet there they are; the
ſame mind, the ſame heart that was in Chriſt, is in
them. A true Chriſtian is a Tranſcript of Chriſt.
<hi>As he is, ſo we are in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This inward change; this forming of Chriſt
upon the heart, is the very Soul and Life of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
you may as well call him a <hi>Man</hi> whoſe
Soul is not in him, as you may call him <hi>a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
who hath not the Spirit of Chriſt in him.
Let no man count himſelf a Chriſtian from any
outward priviledges, much leſs from any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Paint</hi> of Chriſtianity, but from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Prints</hi> of it upon his heart. Thou hopeſt
thou art a Chriſtian, but where is the Image and
ſuperſcription of Chriſt upon thy heart? Doſt
thou not find, not only an unlikeneſſe to Chriſt,
but a diſlike of Chriſt, an inward loathing of
the holineſſe of Chriſt, and a riſing of heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſtrictneſſe of that holy life which he
requires? Doſt thou not find a favour of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſse
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153036:14"/>
and fleſhlineſſe beating the ſway and rule in
thine heart? Doſt thou not find principles, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether to looſeneſſe and licenciouſneſſe? Is
this thy likeneſſe to Chriſt? Doſt thou not find an
emptineſſe of the Light, Life, Love, Grace of
Chriſt in thy Soul? Whatever thou haſt of Chriſt
without, thou haſt nothing of Chriſt within. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not thy ſelf, God is a Spirit, and his eye
is firſt upon the ſpirits and ſouls of men; he loves
truth in the inward parts, he loves holineſſe in the
inward parts; <hi>He is a</hi> Jew <hi>which is one inwardly,</hi>
and he is a Chriſtian which is one inwardly: He
is not a Chriſtian, who is only outwardly ſo. Nay
further, as he is not a Chriſtian, which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſo, ſo neither he that hath ſomething of the
inwards of a Chriſtian, and hath not radically all
the Graces of Chriſt in him; he that hath faith, and
hath not Charity, he that hath the light of a
Chriſtian, and not the love, he that hath the deſires
of a Chriſtian, and not the conſcience of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
he that wants any one of the vital parts of
Chriſtianity, hath nothing at all; a thorow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
is throughout conform to the pattern. And
thus you have a deſcription of Scripture Preciſians,
by their Make or Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>II. I ſhall deſcribe them by their Converſation,

                  <item>and that

            </p>
            <p>1. By the end of their Converſation; What
is it that theſe Men would have, or whither are
they bound? They cannot be content to go
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153036:14"/>
along with their Neighbours, to live and do as
others: whither is it that they are going, or
what is it that they would have? Why this is it,
they are travelling Heaven-ward, trading to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Country; they are bound for the holy
Land, for the holy City, they are going towards
<hi>Sion</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is above. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 58. 5.
<hi>They ſhall ask the way to</hi> Sion <hi>with their faces
thitherward. Sion</hi> was the ancient ſeat of Gods
reſidence among his People, the place of Gods
ſolemn ſervice, where he was wont to meet his
People, and appear unto them. This <hi>Son</hi>
which was here below, the place of Gods <hi>gracious
preſence,</hi> was a type of that <hi>Sion</hi> which is above,
Heaven, the peace of Gods glorious <hi>preſence;</hi> this
ſort of people are travelling Heaven-ward; they
are thoſe <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims</hi> here on Earth,
mentioned, <hi>Heb. 11. 13, 14. That are ſeeking a
Countrey,</hi> not an earthly, but an Heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
as is there expreſt. There are two things in
the forementioned Text, that diſcover whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are travelling. 1. The inquiry they
make, you may gueſſe whither a Traveller is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when you hear him ask diligently the
way to ſuch or ſuch a place. <hi>They ſhall ask the
way to Sion.</hi> 2. Their ſetting their faces thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward,
<hi>They ſhall ask,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with their. Faces
thither-ward.</hi> Their ſetting their Faces towards
<hi>Sion,</hi> notes two things. 1. Their <hi>looking wiſhly</hi>
towards it, a Travellers eye is much towards his
journeys end; Chriſtians that are making Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward
are much and often looking Heaven-ward;
a Chriſtians heart is in his eye, and his
eye is on his home. 2. Their ſetting their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153036:15"/>
thither-ward, notes the bending of their courſe
thither-ward. 'Twas ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 51.
<hi>He ſet his face to go to Jeruſalem.</hi> Chriſtians ſet
their faces Heaven-ward, and thither they bend
their courſe. They are much in asking the way,
<hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved? who ſhall aſcend into
the holy Hill? what manner of perſons must we be,
that we may get thither? and they take the way that
leads thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is a further Deſcription of this ſort
of people, they are men for another Country,
men for another world; they are born from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and they ſeek things Above; they are riſen
with Chriſt, and they are aſcending unto Chriſt;
their treaſure is above, their hopes are above,
and thither are they haſtening; whatever they
have of this worlds goods for the ſupport of
their life, yet theſe things are not the ſcope and
end of their life: They ſeek that glory, honour,
and Immortality which comes from God, and they
are going on from ſtrength to ſtrength, till they
come and appear before God in <hi>Sion.</hi> And herein
lies a ſpecial difference betwixt them and all others
whatſoever: Worldly men are men for this world,
for a wordly happineſs, for a wordly heaven, an
heaven on earth; or if they have any thoughts or
hopes of another heaven, yet they think not ſo
much of it as to ask the way thither, How ſeldom
do we hear any ſuch queſtion put by them, <hi>What
muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> What muſt I do to be Rich?
Which is the way to Honour and temporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment?
or how may I eſcape trouble and ſave my
ſelf harmleſs? Theſe iniquities, and ſuch like, are
ordinarily in their hearts and mouths: but ſuch
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:153036:15"/>
a ſerious queſtion as this, <hi>What muſt I do to be
ſaved?</hi> comes ſo ſeldom from any of them, that
'tis a wonder how the Devil with all his skil can
make them once believe or hope that ever they
ſhall attain to that ſalvation: or if they do ask
the way to Heaven. Yet it is not with their faces
but with their backs thither-ward: whatever
little talk there may fall in ſometimes about Souls
and eternal ſalvation, yet their faces are ſet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, they bend their courſe to <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
towards their wealth or their wickedneſs. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
O ye fooliſh wordlings, you ſay every one of
you, you hope for ſalvation, but which way are
your faces ſet? whither are you going? Is that way
of Swearing, Lying, and Luſt, and carnal Liberty,
and Covetouſneſs, and Senſuality, to which you
give up your ſelves, is this the way of Life? In this
a ſincere Chriſtian is differenced from all others in
the world, he fixes his heart, and his hope, and
aims upon an eternal happineſs, and he bends his
courſe towards the obtaining of it.</p>
            <p>2. By their courſe or motion towards this end.
And here I ſhall give you a three-fold deſcription
of them:
<list>
                  <item>1. They are ſuch as walk in a right way.</item>
                  <item>2. They are upright and exact in the way.</item>
                  <item>3. From this way they will not be turned aſide
by any flatteries of the world on one hand
or frowns on the other.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. They are ſuch as walk in the right Way
which is called ſometimes <hi>the way of the Lord,</hi>
ſometimes <hi>the way of Truth,</hi> ſometimes <hi>the way
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:153036:16"/>
of Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſometimes <hi>the way of Life,</hi> Pſa. 1.
1, 2. Pſal. 116. 1. They underſtand which is the
right way by theſe three pair of way-marks.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Old and Good way.</item>
               <item>2. The New and Living way.</item>
               <item>3. The Strait and narrow way.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, The Old and Good way, that is the right
way, that is the way they are commanded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after and take, <hi>Jer, 6. 16. Stand ye in the ways
and ſee, ask for the old paths, where is the good way,
and walk therein. Stand ye in the ways and ſee.</hi> There
are many ways in the world, ſome that are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
the way of Death, and not a few that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be the way of Life. If you would know
which of theſe ways is the right, ask for the old
Path, the Good way: <hi>The old path,</hi> that which was
from the begining. Godlineſs is no innovation,
it is as old as the world, 1 <hi>John. 1. 1. That which
was from the begining declare we unto you.</hi> Then it is
the <hi>good</hi> as well as the <hi>old way.</hi> Antiquity alone is
not enough to prove that we are in the right; there
is an <hi>evil way</hi> that is an <hi>old way,</hi> the way of ſin is
very ancient. The Right way is the Old and
Good way; there is a threefold good, Profitable,
Pleaſant, and Honeſt. Though the Right way
have both profit and pleaſure in it: yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Character of it is, <hi>the honeſt way,</hi> the way of
Righteouſneſs, Mercy, Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mic. 6. 8. <hi>He
hath ſhewed thee, O man: what is good; to do juſtly, to
love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> This is
good, the good way. <hi>Phil. 4. 8, 9. whatſoever things
are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:153036:16"/>
things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>theſe things do, and the God of Peace ſhall be with
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The new and living way. Three
things, it may be, you will ask me about this.</p>
            <p>1. What is this new and Living way.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Chriſt is this way, <hi>John 14. 6. I am
the way.</hi> Hebr. 10. 19. <hi>Having therefore boldneſs to
enter into the holieſt;</hi> verſe 20. <hi>By a new and living
way, which he hath conſecrated for us,</hi> &amp;c. a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
that walks Heaven-ward walks in Chriſt,
<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6. He walks in Union with Chriſt, in the
Name, and ſtrength, and ſpirit of Chriſt, he that
is not in Chriſt is out of his way, whatever good
there ſeems to be in the way he is going, yet it is
not ſaving good.</p>
            <p>2. Whether there be two right wayes?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, No but one; it is true, there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made alſo of the way of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but theſe make not two diſtinct ways, but
are one and the ſame way; <hi>faith in Christ, and
obedience to the Law of God,</hi> are the one way of
Life: He that walks in God walks in Chriſt, it is
through Chriſt, and our Union with him, that
we are ſtrengthened and enabled to do the will of
God, it is through Chriſt that what we do is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of God; there is no act of obedience, be it
never ſo excellent for the matter of it, that is a
ſtep to the Kingdom of God, that hath not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Chriſt in it, that is not done through
his Spirit, and ſprinkled with his Blood: and
ſo on the other ſide, whatever faith, and hope,
and confidence we have in Chriſt, if it be not
ſuch a faith, ſuch an hope as brings forth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:153036:17"/>
to the will of God, it cannot ſave us: this
way of faith and obedience, this is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight way,
and the one and only way of Life. In all that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Aſſembly and Church of the firſt-born,
that are already in Heaven, there is not one ſoul
but entred by this one way. <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> with the whole generation of Saints now in
glory, they all went the ſame way, they walked
with God, and lived and dyed in Faith, and now
inherit the Promiſes. And all the reſidue of Saints
that are yet in their Pilgrimage; yea, whoever
ſhall be in the Ages to come, muſt by this one way
enter into the Kingdom of God. This is the good
and old way which was from the beginning, this
is the new and living way which ſhall be to the
end, <hi>Tit. 2. 8. Theſe things I will that thou affirm
conſtantly, That they which have believed in God
might be carefull to maintain good works; theſe
things are good and profitable for men.</hi> If this be ſo,
if this be the one and only way of Life, then in
what caſe are the ſinful unbelieving world? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are ye going, Oh ye ſons of folly? You tell
us, you hope to be ſaved, what in your unbelief
and folly? Search and ſee if in the whole Book
of God you finde any other way of Salvation,
but Faith in Chriſt, and obedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>3. How can one and the ſame way be old, and
yet new? I anſwer, 'Tis <hi>old,</hi> and yet not <hi>antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
'tis <hi>new,</hi> and yet no <hi>Innovaſion;</hi> 'tis old, becauſe
it was from the beginning; 'tis new, becauſe now
in the latter end of the world it hath been newly
caſt up, made more plain, eaſie and open.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:153036:17"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſtrait and narrow Way, <hi>Matth.</hi>
7. 14. <hi>Strait is the Gate, and narrow is the way
that leadeth unto life.</hi> Chriſtians muſt go <hi>by a line,</hi>
there is no Elbow-room for Luſt to expatiate,
every ſtep on this hand, or on that, is a deviation;
it is a Way that is hedged in; the Commandment
is the hedge, which limits us within a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
path: Chriſtians muſt live <hi>by Rule,</hi> they muſt
not eat nor drink but <hi>by Rule,</hi> they muſt not buy
nor ſell but <hi>by Rule,</hi> they muſt not work nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it
ſtill, they muſt not ſpeak nor keep ſilence <hi>but by
Rule,</hi> Gal. 6. 16. <hi>As many as walk according to
this rule, peace be upon them.</hi> 'Tis alſo a narrow
Way, the word might have well been tranſlated,
<hi>a troubleſome,</hi> or <hi>painfull way;</hi> the Verb from
which the word comes, ſignifies to oppreſs: there
are many preſſures and afflictions to be met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in this Way, the Croſs is a Chriſtians <hi>Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark;
Through many Tribulations we muſt enter into
the Kingdom of God:</hi> The way of ſin is a plain,
there is neither hedge nor ditch to limit them,
there is neither buſh nor brake to diſcourage
them.</p>
            <p>Now this is the way which circumſpect Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
take; this <hi>Good and Old Way,</hi> this <hi>New and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Way,</hi> this <hi>Strait and Narrow way,</hi> this is the
Right Way, and this is alſo the moſt Excellent
Way. For,</p>
            <p>1. It is the Way of Truth, <hi>Pſal. 11. 30. I
have choſen the way of truth:</hi> John 14. 6. <hi>I am
the Way, and the truth, and the life:</hi> It is the
Way which the Truth or Word of God doth
preſcribe to us, it is the <hi>true Way,</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in all the parts of it that which it declares
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153036:18"/>
it ſelf to be: The way of ſinners is a lye, a way
made up of lyes; The evil <hi>works</hi> of ſinners are lyes,
<hi>Prov. 11. 16. The wicked work a deceitfull work,</hi> the
work of a lie; the words ſignifie, their words are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words, their very duties are a lye, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 12.
<hi>Ephraim compaſſeth me about with lyes:</hi> that is, with
lying Duties, lying Prayers, lying Sacrifices, lying
Praiſes, their <hi>Prayers</hi> are no <hi>Prayers,</hi> their Sacrifices
are no Sacrifices, they do but diſſemble with God,
and deceive themſelves in all their performances,
their hopes are a lye, their comforts are a lye, their
Refuges are a lye; the way of ſinners is wholly
made up of lyes: But the way of Chriſtians is a
true way, their Duties their Comforts, their Joyes,
their Hopes have truth and reality in them, <hi>Pſalm</hi>
25. 10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth
to them that keep his Covenant.</hi> Now look what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
there is of truth above a lye; ſo great is the
Excellency of this way of Chriſtians above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wayes.</p>
            <p>2. It is the way of Righteouſneſs and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
Holineſs hath a glory in it, every thing by
how much the more pure it is, by ſo much the
more precious in its kind. What other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
have the Angels of light above the Devils,
but their holineſs? What was it that transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Angels that fell into Devils, but the
loſs of their holineſs? Wherein ſtands the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creatures likeneſs to the God of glory,
but in their holineſs? This is the divine Nature
they are made partakers of, the Spirit of God
and of Glory reſting upon them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153036:18"/>
Holineſs hath ſuch a ſelf-evidencing excellency, that
the conſciences of carnal men do often, whether
they will or no, give their <hi>teſtimony</hi> to it. Who is
there almoſt, whoſe <hi>luſt</hi> hath <hi>transformed</hi> into ſo very
a <hi>Brute,</hi> but many times, even when <hi>his tongue</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
it, his <hi>Conſcience</hi> gives his <hi>Tongue</hi> the lye?
Who is there, whoſe Luſt hath ſo totally put out his
Light, that doth not, in his ſerious <hi>Judgment,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That a gracious, humble, meek, merciful, ſober
heavenly life, is really more excellent (though <hi>not</hi> ſo
ſutable to his brutiſh appetite) than lewdneſs and
ſenſuality? There is ſuch a beauty and Majeſty in
holineſs that doth command an acknowledgment
of it, from all ſorts of knowing men.</p>
            <p>3. It is the way of God, not only the Way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Lord</hi> hath <hi>commanded</hi> them to <hi>walk</hi> but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Lord</hi> appears to <hi>them,</hi> wherein they have the
Viſion and Fruition of God; and therefore a godly
life is often expreſſed by <hi>walking with God,</hi> by <hi>living
in followſhip</hi> or <hi>communion,</hi> or <hi>acquaintance with God,</hi>
Pſal. 16. 8. <hi>I have, ſet the Lord alwayes before me,</hi>
Pſal. 17. 15. <hi>I will behold thy face in Righteouſneſs.
Enoch</hi> walked with God, <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God;
Good company will make any way pleaſant, how
craggy or dirty ſoever our way may be under foot,
it's pleaſant to ſee the <hi>Sun ſhine</hi> over us, Pſal. 50. 23.
<hi>To him that ordereth his Converſation aright, will I
ſhew the Salvation of God.</hi> The Lord meets his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in his Wayes, and cauſes all his goodneſs to paſs
on before them, proclaiming his Name. <hi>The Lord
gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great
kindneſs.</hi> This Viſion of God makes all the labours
and difficulties of this <hi>way</hi> ſweet &amp; pleaſant to <hi>them;</hi>
certainly this is a bleſſed way, for God is in it. Where
is bleſſedneſs to be had but in God? how is bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:153036:19"/>
to be had in God, but in beholding and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him? wherein ſtands the bleſſedneſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but in the Viſion and Fruition of God? Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
let all the ungodly world ſay all they can, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and diſparage the way of Righteouſneſs, as a
wretched, diſconſolate, and contemptible way; yet
till they can confute your ſenſes, and make you not
to believe what you taſte and ſee, be not diſcouraged,
neither let them delude you into any better opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their ways of ſin, from any pleaſure, credit,
eaſe, or gain, that is in them; God is in the way of
Righteouſneſs, and there alone to be found and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
and therefore this is the moſt bleſſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way.</p>
            <p>4. It is the way of the Kingdome; the proper excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the means ſtands in this, That it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
bring about its end; that's our beſt way that
will bring us ſafely home. This way is called the way
of life, <hi>Pſal. 16. 11. Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life.</hi>
2 Pet. 1. 5, 11. <hi>Add to your faith vertue, to vertue
knowledge, to knowledge temperance, patience, godlineſs,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>For ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
into the everlaſting Kingdom:</hi> If there were no
other excellency of this way, yet this is enough to
commend it, and exalt it above all other ways, that
it's the way to Heaven. If the way of Holineſs and
Righteouſneſs, were in all other reſpects, as deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and uncomfortable a way as the world imagine
it; If Godlineſs were in it ſelf as great a burden
and bondage, as carnal men account it; If all the
reproaches, and ſlanders, and calumnies, and lying
reports, that ungodly men caſt upon the way of the
Lord, were true; yet this, that it's the way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
bleſſedneſs, would anſwer all that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
againſt it. If you were to go to <hi>London</hi> upon a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153036:19"/>
buſineſs, wherein your life and all that ever you had
were concerned, you would not ſtand reaſoning thus;
Is not the way to <hi>York</hi> a better and more pleaſant
way? Whatever the way to <hi>London</hi> be, how long, or
how dirty, or how dangerous, or how hard to finde
ſoever it be, yet your life &amp; eſtate depending on your
going thither, leaving all other wayes &amp; diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, you would take the way that leads thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The way of the Lord, whatever you have to ſay
againſt it, to diſcourage or make you unwilling to
travel it, yet 'tis the only way you have to ſave your
ſouls, the only way to eternal bleſſedneſs; when you
have made all your objections, and all your excuſes,
you muſt take up this holy courſe of life, or you
can never come into the Kingdom of God. The
way of carnal Jollity and Merriment is as you think
a more pleaſant and delightful way: But is this
your way to Heaven? The way of covetouſneſs and
worldlineſs, you count a more gainful and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way; but is this the way of life? The way of
ſloth fulneſs and idleneſs, is you think an eaſie way;
but is this the way of the Kingdom? The ſtrict and
ſevere way of Holineſs, hath little carnal delight,
eaſe and worldly profit in it; but is not this the
way to everlaſting life? Heb. 12. 14. <hi>Follow peace
with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall
ſee God.</hi> Now if all this be ſo, (ſearch ſinners,
ſearch and conſider if it be not ſo, conſult the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
conſult your Reaſons and Conſciences, and
ſee if you find them not all bearing witneſs to this
Truth) and if theſe things be ſo, as hath been ſaid,
then come all ye fooliſh, and vain-hearted perſons,
and judge of the unreaſonableneſs of theſe ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
demands of the looſer ſort to the people
of God, who in ſcorn and deriſion will be often
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:153036:20"/>
asking of them, why muſt you be ſo nice? Why ſo
preciſe? Why ſo ſtrict, and making ſo much ado a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
every ſmall matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? Why cannot you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to do as others, and take the ſame liberty as
others? Why, 'tis all one as if they ſhould demand
of them. Why will you keep your way, the way
of Life? Why will you be ſaved? Why can't you
be content to be damned as well as others? Is there
not a great deal of wiſdom and reaſon in ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionings
and ſcoffing demands? If you ſtood by a
dangerous mighty Bogue, through which there was
one narrow tract of firm ground, and ſhould ſee a
company of poor Creatures even ſunk, and almoſt
ſwallowed up, and choak'd in the mud and mire,
on the one hand and the other, and yet ſhould you
ſee them laughing, and mocking, and jeering at
thoſe who keep the narrow tract of firm ground,
that would bring them ſafely over; Would you not
ſay, they were all mad or bewitched? This is the
caſe of fooliſh Worldlings, they are ſunk in the Mud,
they are even ſwallowed up and choaked with their
luſts, and ready to periſh, and yet they fall a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and deriding of them, who will keep the ſure
way. Sinners, what do you mean? you are ſinking;
you are ſinking; a few ſteps further and you will
be ſwallowed up. Why will you not come back,
and get into this ſafe way? Leave your ſcoffing at
the Saints, and learn of them, leave your judging
and cenſuring, and follow them in the ſame holy
ſteps that they are going in, before you.</p>
            <p>II. They are upright and exact in the way, they
walk on in the ſtraight way, with a ſtaight foot,
Pſal. 119. 1. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way,</hi> or
the perfect, or entire in the way, <hi>Pſal. 32. 1. I ſaid
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:153036:20"/>
I will take heed to my wayes, that I offend not. It's</hi>
ſaid of <hi>Caleb,</hi> Numb. 14. 24. <hi>That he followed the
Lord fully.</hi> Luk. 1. 6. 2 Cor. 1. 12. <hi>This is our rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in all ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and godly ſincerity, we have had our converſation in
the world,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 20. <hi>Ye are witneſſes, and God
alſo, how holily, and justly, and blameleſly we behaved
our ſelves among you.</hi> Obſerve it, they lived a holy,
harmeleſſe, blameleſſe life, and that holineſſe which
appeared upon them, was not a cheat, or juggle, to
'deceive the world, but was really what it appeared
to be; and for this they appealed to a threefold
witneſs. 1. A witneſs in their breaſts, the teſtimony
of their own Conſciences; <hi>This is our rejoycing, the
teſtimony of our Conſciences.</hi> 2. A witneſs in the
world; <hi>Ye are witneſſes,</hi> your eyes have ſeen what our
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe hath been; be but true witneſſes, and then be
you witneſſes; ſpeak but what you have ſeen, and
ſpeak the worſt (<hi>among you that believe</hi>) the world
will be ready to ſay, you are too crafty to let us
know what you do in ſecret, when you are amongſt
your ſelves; I, but ſays he, let them that believe,
ſpeak, thoſe that have been with us publickly and
privately, what our converſation hath been; if it be
ſaid, they are of your own party, and will not ſpeak
all they know, then he appeals to a third witneſs,
a Witneſs in Heaven, (<hi>and God alſo</hi>) he that

betwixt their <hi>aims,</hi> or what they are preſſing
and reaching towards, and their attainments, or
what they have reached to. The aims of theſe
cricumſpect Chriſtians in their whole courſe, are

at perfection, <hi>Phil. 3. 14. I preſs towards the mark;</hi>
they would keep their way without the leaſt wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
they would not tread one ſtep awry, they
would not ſpeak one word amiſs, they would not
think one thought amiſs, they would not neglect
any one duty, nor commit any one ſin, but would
be what the Apoſtle would have them to be, <hi>Holy

<hi>Aims,</hi> and as to their <hi>Attainments,</hi> though they
fall ſhort of their deſires, they cannot do as they
would, <hi>The good that I would, I do not:</hi> yet they do
their beſt, they follow the Lord with the beſt of
their underſtanding, ſerve the Lord with the beſt of
their ſtrength, and when they have done their beſt,
they mourn and grieve that 'tis no better.</p>
            <p>That I may more diſtinctly open this exact and
upright walking in the <hi>way</hi> of the Lord, which
their hearts are ſet upon, I ſhall conſider it,

            </p>
            <p>1. Their exact walking, as it hath reſpect to
the Commandment, ſtands, 1. In having reſpect
to every <hi>Commandment,</hi> to the whole Word of God,
Pſal. 119. 6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have
reſpect to all thy Commandments,</hi> Mat. 28. 20. <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you.</hi> The life of a Chriſtian is a buſie life,
the Words of God finds us much work to do, we
have work for every faculty and member; our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
have their work, our wills, affections,
conſciences, tongues, ears, eyes, hands, have
all their particulars works aſſigned them; every
grace hath its work, faith hath its work, love hath
its work, patience hath its work; every luſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:153036:21"/>
makes us work, to reſtrain, deny, watch, crucifie
them; theſe are weights and clogs that will hang
on, and will hinder us from all other works, if we
let them alone; theſe are working againſt us
continually, and apt to ſet us on work againſt our
ſelves; a working miſchief and ruine to our ſouls,
if they be not continually looked to, and kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
We hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our proſperity finds us much work, to keep our
ſelves humble, heavenly, watchful, in an holy fear
and jealouſie, leſt the contentments and pleaſures
of this life, make an invaſion, and inrode upon our
hearts, and ſpoyle us of our <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>comforts.</hi>
Our afflictions find us work, to keep our ſpirits
from ſinking and fainting, from murmuring, and
envying at thoſe whoſe way doth proſper. We
have all the ſet and ſolemn duties of Religion to
attend upon, we have praying work, and hearing
work, and Sacrament work, and reading work,
and heart-ſearching work, and meditating work:
We have work to be done for others, our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and acquaintance, our friends and our
enemies, our families, our ſervants, our children,
we have not only work to do for them as men,
but work to do for God with them, God hath
work for us to do among our neighbours, God
hath work for us to do in our families, and for our
friends and enemies, inſtructing work, reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
work, praying work, works of mercy and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp;c. we have a continual ſucceſſion of work,
every day hath <hi>its</hi> buſineſſe: <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt have
no ſleeping <hi>dayes,</hi> their very Sabbaths muſt be
working dayes; we muſt be at work for our ſouls,
even on thoſe dayes wherein we muſt do no bodily
work. <hi>There remains a reſt for the People of God:</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:153036:22"/>
ſuch a reſt, wherein they ſhall work no more, nor be
weary any more, wherein all their work ſhall be <hi>to
eat of the fruit of their doings,</hi> but on this ſide that
reſt, there is no reſt, but we muſt be full of labour.</p>
            <p>You ſee the Word hath provided much work for
Chriſtians; now thoſe that are circumſpect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and in the way will be through pac'd, and ſtick

but as the Apoſtle, <hi>Col. 4 10. Endeavour to ſtand

if they be duties, if the word ſayes; <hi>This
muſt be done,</hi> this is that which the Lord requires, an
upright heart will yield and ſtoop to them. Brethren
if there be any one thing required in the whole
Book of God that you cannot conſent to, but allow
your ſelves in the ordinary neglect of concerning
which you ſay with <hi>Naaman, The Lord ſpare me in
this one thing,</hi> whatſoever elſe you do you can have
no comfort that your hearts are upright.</p>
            <p>2. In having reſpect to the moſt <hi>ſpirituall and
inward part of the Commandment;</hi> the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
contains <hi>fugienda</hi> and <hi>facienda,</hi> ſins to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
and duties to be performed; and both theſe
are either outward or ſpiritual. 1. As there are
outward ſins to be avoided, ſins of the mouth, ſins
of the eyes, ears, hands, ſo there are inward ſins,
ſpiritual wickedneſſes, <hi>evil thoughts.</hi> Jer. 4. 14. <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
luſts,</hi> Mat. 5. 28. <hi>inordinate affections, an evil
conſcience,</hi> and the like: now ſincere Chriſtians

ſpiritual wickedneſſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
purged, <hi>their hearts ſprinkled from an evil
conſcience,</hi> their affections and luſts mortified,
<hi>Gal. 5. 24, They that are Chriſts, have crucified the
fleſh with the affections an luſts;</hi> their care is, not
only that they be no drunkards, or ſwearers, nor
lyars, nor railers, nor oppreſſors, nor of proud,
froward, fretful, impatient carriages and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;
but they would not covet, they would not
luſt, they would not be of proud, impatient,
fretful, envious, unpeaceable hearts, they would
not that an evil thought, not a vain thought
ſhould lodge within them. 2. As there are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
duties to be performed, as praying, hearing,
works of mercy, &amp;c. ſo there are ſpiritual duties,
purely ſpiritual, as the internal acting of faith, and
love, and hope, and the fear of God, the ſouls
chooſing of God, cleaving to God, rejoycing,
delighting in God, meditating of him, &amp;c. Exact
Chriſtians have a ſpecial reſpect to thoſe <hi>ſpiritual
duties,</hi> in the exerciſe whereof ſtands chiefly their
living in a holy fellowſhip, communion, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with God; and for outward <hi>duties,</hi>
their care is to perform them <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> they pray
with the mouth, and pray with the ſpirit; they praiſe
the Lord with their lips, and offer up their hearts
as a ſpiritual ſacrifice; they hear with their ears,
and with their underſtanding alſo; they labour to
bring their ſouls under the Word, to pour forth
their ſouls in prayer, to draw forth their ſouls in
their very alms, <hi>Iſa. 58. If thou draw forth thy ſoul
to the hungry,</hi> Pſal. 69. 10. <hi>I chaſtened my ſoul

pray in thy Cloſet, or in thy Family, or in the
Congregation, in an outward formal way, and
doſt not pour out thy Soul in prayer, thou prayeſt
like a <hi>Libertine;</hi> thou that faſteſt, and doth not
<hi>chaſten thy Soul with fasting,</hi> thou <hi>faſteſt like a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;</hi>
thou that heareſt, and doſt not bring thy
ſoul under the word, thou <hi>heareſt like a Libertine;</hi>
this is looſe praying, and looſe hearing, looſe from
the Rule, which requires the exerciſing of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
man as well as the outward.</p>
            <p>3. In obſerving the <hi>command to the utmoſt;</hi> and
here I ſhall give a fourfold further deſcription of
them.</p>
            <p>1. They endeavour <hi>to get up their hearts to the
higheſt pitch of affection, care, and activity:</hi> They
would be the beſt Chriſtians, the moſt humble, the
moſt mortified, the moſt patient, the moſt exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
and active Chriſtians: <hi>not ſlothful in buſineſſe,
but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12. 11.
2 Cor. 7. <hi>Yea, what care; yea, without clearing of your
ſelves; yea, what indignation; yea, what vehement
deſire; yea, what zeal,</hi> &amp;c. A ſincere Chriſtian
would be a zealous Chriſtian, in his ſincerity ſtands
the height of it. Zeal is not a diſtinct grace, but
the <hi>height of every grace:</hi> Love in the height of
it, Deſire in the height of it, Care and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to follow God in the height of it: A zealous
Chriſtian exerciſes every grace, performs every
Duty, and doth it <hi>with all his might;</hi> he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſpare, or to favour himſelf, <hi>but will ſpend
and be ſpent in the work of the Lord;</hi> the fleſh will
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:153036:23"/>
be pleading for a little eaſe, for moderation, it will
be ſolliciting the Sobl as <hi>Peter</hi> did <hi>Chriſt, Pitty thy
ſelf,</hi> favour thy ſelf, thou wilt never hold out at
this rate, thou wilt pull all the Country about thine
ears if thou beeſt thus hot and forward, but the Soul
returns the ſame anſwer as Chriſt did to him, <hi>Get
thee behind me Satan,</hi> hold thy peace ſlothful heart,
let me alone, for I will ſpeak for God while I have
a tongue to ſpeak; while I have an heart, while I
have an hand, while I have an eye, while I have a
ſoul, while I have a being, I will follow on after the
Lord, I will ſerve him, I will praiſe him, I will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
all I am, and have, to him, and then come on
me what will.</p>
            <p>2. They are <hi>ſtudying and ſeeking out opportunities
for ſervice.</hi> Such Chriſtians are of <hi>ſtrict lives,</hi> but
of <hi>large hearts;</hi> of <hi>ſtrict conſciences,</hi> but of <hi>large
deſires</hi> and aims. Grace ſets limits to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
but none to their holy affections; they
never do ſo much for God, but they are ſtudying
how they may do more, <hi>Iſa. 32. 8. A liberal
Man deviſeth liberal things;</hi> a merciful man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth
merciful things: a righteous man deviſeth
righteous things, he doth not only exerciſe
Liberality and Mercy; and work Righteouſneſs,
when he hath an opportunity put into his
hands; but he ſits down and conſiders what great
things the Lord hath done for him, what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
loving kindneſſe the Lord hath ſhewed to
him, and thereupon ſtudies and caſts about
what greater things then yet he hath done he may
do for the Name of God: as it is ſaid of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Proverbs 6. 14. He deviſeth miſchief continually:</hi>
And <hi>Pſalm 64. 6. They ſearch out iniquity, they
accompliſh a diligent ſearch;</hi> ſearch out for every
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:153036:24"/>
opportunity to work wickedneſſe to ſatisfie their
luſt: So Righteous men ſearch out, and make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
ſeach after opportunities to work Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
2 <hi>Sam. 9. 3. Is there not yet a man left of the
houſe of</hi> Saul ſaith <hi>David) to whom I might ſhew the
kindneſs of God?</hi> Is there not yet a poer Sool in
diſtreſſe, to whom I might ſhew kindneſs for the
Name of God? Is there not yet a poor Family in
miſery, to whom I might ſhew mercy? Is there not
yet a poor ſinner to whom I might give counſel? Is
there not yet a poor Saint to whom I might admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
comfort for the ſake of my God? As it is ſaid
of the Devil, <hi>He goeth up and down ſeeking whom he
may devour;</hi> So may it be ſaid, of ſuch, they go up
and down ſeeking whom they might, ſave and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
out of the ſnares of the Devil; other men,
what good ſoever they do, it is as little as may be;
their conſciences will not let them be quiet, but
ſomething muſt be done, when they have done ſo
much as will but keep conſcience quiet thy have
done: A ſincere Chriſtian hath his love to ſatisfie,
his deſires to ſatisfie, as well as his conſcience; he
loves much, and it is not a little duty that will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
ſtrong love.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>They ſhun occaſions and temptations to ſin;</hi> they
would keep at as great a diſtance from ſin as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
they are careful to keep far enough within
their line, they dare not venture to their utmoſt
border leſt they go beyond it ere they are aware:
A wary Chriſtian, having obſerved what things
have proved ſnares and temptations to him, and
have drawn him aſide to iniquity formerly, will
take heed how he comes nigh them again: If carnal
ſociety hath cool'd and damp'd his heart and left a
fleſhly ſavour <hi>upon his Spirit,</hi> he will take heed how
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:153036:24"/>
he comes into ſuch company again: If going to his
utmoſt liberty in the uſe of the Creatures, either
Meat, Drink, or Apparel, hath inticed him beyond
his bounds, he will be wary how he allows himſelf
the like liberty, and will deny himſelf the freedom
he might uſe, rather than again run himſelf upon
danger; he is ſenſible of his weakneſſe to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a temptation, and thereupon is the more
watchful that he run not into temptation; men that
are bold to venture into temptation, to venture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
evil company, to venture themſelves among fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and vain perſons, eſpecially when they have
proved what a ſnare ſuch have been, again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to them, it is a ſign that they have little fear
of ſin, care of their ſouls or conſciences, or regard
to God, or godlineſſe: a circumſpect Chriſtian dares
not venture ſo: prophane men wonder at them,
why they will be no more free, nor familiar with
them, not ſo much as to fit and be merry with
them: <hi>They think it ſtrange</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that
you run not with them:</hi> Oh, the reaſon is, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of the hook, and therefore dare not meddle
with the bait.</p>
            <p>4. They <hi>abſtain from all appearance of evil,</hi> that
is the command, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. 22. Abſtain from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of evil;</hi> they would live, not only, <hi>ſine cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
but <hi>ſine labo,</hi> not only without any fault, but
without any flaw or ſcar upon them. <hi>Oportet Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaris
uxorem abſque ſuſpitione vivere.</hi> To the end
they may cut off all occaſion from them that ſeek
occaſion againſt them, they would do not only
things honeſt, but things of good report too; they
enquire concerning what they are about to do, not
only a <hi>Liceat,</hi> but a <hi>Deceat;</hi> not only whether
it be lawful, but whether it be comely; there may
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:153036:25"/>
be divers things that may be lawful in themſelves,
which are yet unſeemly, may look with an evil
face: <hi>All things are lawful,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but
all things are not expedient.</hi> A circumſpect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
endeavours both to keep a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi>
and to keep a <hi>good Name;</hi> he would keep a good
Conſcience for his own ſake, and a good Name, as
far as may be, for his Brethrens ſake; his deſire
is both to <hi>hold up the power of Religion,</hi> and to <hi>keep
up the credit of Religion;</hi> and therefore it is he
herein exerciſes himſelf, both to keep a <hi>conſcience
void of guile in the ſight of God, and a converſation
void of offence in the ſight of men.</hi> The Servants
of Chriſt ſee that there are many eyes upon them,
that will eſpy the leaſt ſpot upon them, and
therifore their care is, to keep themſelves <hi>unſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the World;</hi> to carry themſelves ſo, that if it
be poſſible the World may have nothing to ſpot
them withall; they are ſenſible how obnoxious
they are to the ſevere and rigid cenſures of the
World, and that all the reproaches that fall on
them, fall on the Lord and his Goſpel: what an
out-cry is there in the World againſt thoſe that
fear God, as if they were bryars and thorns, the
fire-brands of the World, and the troubles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that run the World upſide down, as if there
were no Lions in the world but Chriſts Lambs, as
if Chriſts Sheep were all <hi>Wolves;</hi> and therefore to
prevent this, and to put to ſilence the ignorance
and malice of evil men, they endeavour as much
as may be to gain upon the hearts, and to get the
good opinion of all men; to walk ſo, that they
may not only profit, but pleaſe others, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel the more lovely with them; they
would not only <hi>wrong no man, defraud no man, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:153036:25"/>
no man,</hi> but they would <hi>diſpleaſe no man;</hi> give
no many any occaſion of offence or diſtaſte at them
and their way; Sinners, as much as the poor
Saints, are cryed out againſt for troubleſom and
unquiet, yet they are deſirous rather to pleaſe
than provoke you; they would pleaſe all the world
as far as they may without hurting themſelves or
them: indeed they would not ſin againſt God to
pleaſe men: they would not wound their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to ſave their credits; they would not lye, nor
diſſemble, nor flatter, nor connive at you, nor
comply with you in ſin to gain your good will, but
as far as they can, in order to your good, they are
willing to become <hi>all things to all men;</hi> let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
but to do their duty to God, to your and their
own Souls; and if that do not diſpleaſe you, they
are willing in all things to do their beſt that they
may not offend you.</p>
            <p>And thus have I given you the deſcription of theſe
men by the exactneſſe of their walking according to
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which ſtands in their endeavour, to
have reſpect to <hi>every command,</hi> to the moſt <hi>inward
and ſpiritual part</hi> of every Command, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
every command to the <hi>utmoſt;</hi> to this I ſhall
add two things.</p>
            <p>1. When they have done all that they can, after
this care and circumſpection, they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
themſelves <hi>unprofitable Servants;</hi> they are
<hi>thankful,</hi> and bleſſe God for helping them on in his
way; but yet they are <hi>humble,</hi> they are ſo far from
boaſting that they have done ſo much, that they
are aſhamed that they have done no more: Whilſt
they admire the Grace of God towards them,
they abaſe and <hi>abhor themſelves in duſt and aſhes,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>I laboured more abundantly than
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:153036:26"/>
they all, yet not I,</hi> (no thanks to me) <hi>but to the
Grace of God that was with me:</hi> Some comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
difference there hath been (bleſſed be God) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
my Converſation, and the wayes of many
others; but, <hi>who hath made me to differ from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
or what have I, that I have not received?</hi> and
if I have received it, why ſhould I boaſt, as if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
received it not? Something through the Grace
of God hath been done, ſome ſervice hath been
performed; but what's all this to what I might
have done? what's all this I have done, to what
I have left undone? How ſmall is my ſervice, if
it be compared with my ſins? How few are
my duties, if compared with my neglects? Wha's
all I have done for God, to what I owe to the
Lord, to that which he hath done for me <hi>who hath
redeemed my life from death, and crowned me with
loving kindneſſe?</hi> But oh! What's all I have done,
to what God hath promiſed to do for me? What's
my <hi>Work</hi> to my <hi>Reward?</hi> What's my Race to
my Crown? Such humbling ſelf-abaſing thoughts
as theſe do Chriſtians exerciſe themſelves in, to lay
them low, even in the duſt before the Lord. The
prophane World brand them for a proud Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who ſay to their Brethren, <hi>Stand aſide, I
am holier than you.</hi> What more common in ſuc'h
mouths, preciſe, but as proud as the Devil? It's
true, and Chriſtians will freely acknowledge it, and
take the ſhame of it upon them, that this peſtilent
Evil, <hi>Pride,</hi> is a weed that is apt to ſpring up in
the Richeſt Gardens; we can hardly be lifted up to
an holy courſe, but we are apt to be puft up with a
vain conceit, we can hardly do well, but we are apt
to think too <hi>well</hi> of <hi>what we do,</hi> many a precious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,

that is, <hi>Is it their folly that they are not fools?</hi> Stand

            <p>2. As it reſpects Conſcience; And thus I ſhall
give this double deſcription of theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> circumſpect
Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>1. They take great care of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>2. They give good heed to Conſcience.</p>
            <p>1. They take great care of Conſcience, and take
great pains about their Conſcience. Their care
they take is twofold:</p>
            <p>2. About the informing and inſtructing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>2. About the keeping Conſcience tender.</p>
            <p>1. They take great care about the informing and
inſtructing their Conſciences; Conſcience is to be
made the <hi>inward guide</hi> of their way. As the word is
to be their guide without them, ſo Conſcience is
to be their <hi>inward guide.</hi> Their care therefore is,
that it may not be a <hi>blind guide.</hi> Hence it is
that they are ſo much in ſearching and ſtudying
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:153036:28"/>
the Scriptures; they are much converſant in their
Bibles, they are obſerved to be frequent in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sermons, diligent in. Nothing, and Repeating
what they hear; are often putting their doubts, and
opening their difficult caſes, to thoſe that are able
to reſolve them, and all this to get their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
enlightned, and inſtructed in the will of God:
Though there are many things that they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of, yet there is nothing that they are willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant of, their deſires and prayers to the
Lord, are the ſame with the <hi>Pſalmiſts,</hi> Pſal. 119. 19.
<hi>Hide not thy Commandments from me:</hi> and with <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hus</hi>
in <hi>Job, What I know not, teach thou me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They take great care to keep their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
tender. Tenderneſs of conſcience, is ſometimes
taken for weakneſs of conſcience; a weak conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
is that which is both weak-ſighted, and is not
able to diſcern between things that differ, but is
very ſubject to miſtakes, it miſtakes good for evil,
lawful for unlawful, and its alſo full of troubleſom
and unreaſonable fears, and endleſs ſcruples, which,
as the crudities abounding in a weak ſtomack, do
make it keck and riſe, not only at that which is
hurtful, but ſometimes at that which is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
enough, it often fears, where no fear is;
this tenderneſs their endeavours are to cure, and
not to cheriſh. True tenderneſs of conſcience
is the perfection of it; a truly tender conſcience
is a ſound conſcience, which is quick of ſenſe,
and preſently feels, and ſmarts, and is put to
pain with any thing that is really an offence to
it. A tender conſcience is as the eye, the leaſt
duſt that's blown into it, will make it ſmart and
this not from ſoreneſs, but wickedneſs of ſenſe.
The dim-ſighted world look upon all tenderneſs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153036:28"/>
as weakneſs, and count all ſuch, whoſe conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
cannot down with any thing, as a company of
ſickly, weakly, brain-ſick ſpirits; and all their
Doubtings and Diſſatisfactions, to be humor and
conceit, and peeviſhneſs, and cauſleſs fears; but
this tenderneſs is ſo far from being the <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> that
it is the health and ſoundneſs of the heart; it was
the commendation, and not the reproach of King
<hi>Joſiah.</hi> 2 King. 22. 19. <hi>That his heart was tender.</hi>
Theſe temper circumſpect Chriſtians are very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of keeping their hearts in; and therefore any
thing that would brawn or harden them, they
carefully ſhun; as the eye that cannot endure the
duſt that falls into it, is quick at its ward, to keep
off any thing that would be noxious to it; and this
is the reaſon why Chriſtians can bear any thing
rather than ſin, becauſe it's this alone that's hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to conſcience; they are hardy enough to bear
afflictions, theſe are no prejudice to conſcience;
it is not againſt their conſciences to ſuffer, but it is
to ſin; affliction may perplex the thoughts, and
too much diſquiet and diſtemper the paſſions, but
will never trouble conſcience.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Tender Conſciences! Who more stubborn,
and peremptory, and obſtinate, and ſtiffe in their way
thau theſe? Do you call this tenderneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> There is a threefold-ſtiffeneſs: Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.</p>
            <p>1. In a refuſing to receive conviction, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing wherein they are faulty, or in an
error.</p>
            <p>2. In a refuſing to revoke their errors, upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153036:29"/>
conviction that they are in a fault; let either of
theſe be charged upon them, and let the charge be
made good, and then call them ſtubborn, obſtinate,
or what you will.</p>
            <p>3. In a refuſing to act contrary to their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to do that which Conſcience is not ſatisfied in;
which, after their moſt free &amp; fair debate, moſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
enquiring into, and moſt impartial, weighing, all
that is or can be ſaid for it, their conſcience ſtill tells
them, they ſhould ſin in doing it: Hereupon, though
all their Friends ſhould come and perſwade, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
them; though all their Adverſaries ſhould fall a
ſcoffing and reproaching them, a threatning &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
them, yet ſtill they refuſe to yield. This ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is that ſtedfaſtneſs which the Lord requires in
them, and is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with
true tenderneſs, that it is their tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>If an Idolater ſhould come and perſwade ſuch to
worſhip an Idol; if he ſhould threaten them with the
fiery furnace, with the Lions Den, and yet they will
not; Is this their ſtubborneſs? Or, is it not their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs?
If an Adulterer ſhould perſwade them to
uncleanneſs; If a Libertine ſhould come and think
to ſcoff them out of their ſtrict &amp; holy courſe, or to
tempt them but to ſome little indulgence to their
fleſh, in ſome ſuch way as this; Why? What hurt is
there in a little mirth? What great matter is it, to
take a little liberty now and then? Why ſhould you
think your ſelves wiſer than other men &amp; yet they
will not hearken? will <hi>you</hi> call this their obſtinacy, or
their tenderneſs? Here be obſtinate creatures indeed:
they will not be Idolaters, they will not be unclean,
they will not be Libertines, they will not be liars, nor
diſſemblers, they will by no means be perſwaded to
rebel againſt God and Conſcience, and therefore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:153036:29"/>
they be obſtinate. Perſwade them to that which is
good, convince them that they are in an error, and
then try whether they will be obſtinate: tell them,
<hi>Friends, you walk diſorderly,</hi> unchriſtianly; you are
uucharitable, ccnſorious, contentious, proud, vain,
and convince them of it, and ſee if they will not
hearken to you, &amp; thank you for your admonition.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, prove your ſelves to be conſcientious
by your tenderneſs, however the World go about to
blaſt and reproach you with your conſciences, and
call your uprightneſs hypocriſie, your tenderneſs
obſtinacy, yet part not with it ſo, but ſtill reſolve
with <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 27. <hi>Till I dye, I will not remove my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
from me.</hi> There is a double way wherein we
may be ſaid to remove our integrity.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By departing from it.</item>
               <item>2. By belying it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. By departing from our integrity, by turning
aſide to iniquity, by being found falſe to God and
conſcience, and by a liberty in ſinning, exchanging
this truth &amp; tenderneſs of heart for hardneſs &amp; hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie.
Take heed you do not thus depart from <hi>your</hi>
Integrity. Beloved, you live in a world wherein
conſcience is like to coſt <hi>you</hi> dear; if <hi>you</hi> will own any
ſuch thing as conſcience, or conſcientious walking,
you are like to ſmart for it. Look to it that <hi>your</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
be ſound, ſuch as is worth the ſuffering for;
do not ſuffer for the name of conſcience; or <hi>conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi>
but for the thing: <hi>look</hi> to it, that whatſoever <hi>you</hi>
ſuffer for conſcience, <hi>you</hi> ſuffer nothing from conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
for <hi>your</hi> wronging, or abuſing, or violating of it;
Sufferings for <hi>conſcience,</hi> for an upright conſcience,
are precious; Sufferings from conſcience, from an
evil and abuſed conſcience, will be bitter. Let all the
world be againſt you rather than conſcience: whom
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153036:30"/>
the world ſmites for conſcience God will <hi>heal,</hi> whom
the world judges God will juſtifie; but if our hearts
condemn us, who ſhall plead for us, or comfort us?
Carry your ſelves ſo, that conſcience may be your
comforter; not your tormentor: There is no torment
like the ſtings and revenges of an abuſed conſcience:
Keep your conſciences tender, and they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hurt <hi>you,</hi> nor ſuffer <hi>you</hi> to be hurt by others;
keep your integrity; and it will keep you. The
Pſalmiſt prayes, <hi>Pſ. 25. 21. Let integrity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
preſerve me.</hi> Let me not think to ſhift my ſelf of
trouble, by ſheltering my ſelf under ſin; let me not
go about to make my peace with my troubleſom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
by caſting in my lot with them; let me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
think to be beholding to iniquity for my ſafety;
<hi>let integrity preſerve me.</hi> Preſerve thou me in mine
integrity, and let it preſerve me. Chriſtians, give
the world leave to talk and do what they will, but
when they have ſaid and done their worſt, <hi>keep you
honeſt, and you ſhall keep you ſafe:</hi> Your conſciences
will be your confidence, and your ſecurity; <hi>He that
walketh uprightly ſhall walk ſure.</hi> Be not reproached
out of your refuge, let not the world find you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
againſt your duty, nor yet yielding to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
be not ſtubborn, but yet be ſtedfaſt, yield to
reproofs while you ſlight reproaches.</p>
            <p>Let us be ſo gentle, flexible, eaſie to be entreated,
ſo fearful to offend; ſo ready to pleaſe all men, in all
things, which are not againſt conſcience, its peace
&amp; purity, that we may convince them, that in thoſe
things wherein we fix and do not yield, it is becauſe
we <hi>cannot,</hi> not becauſe we <hi>will not,</hi> and let us yet be
ſo ſtedfaſt in thoſe things which would be a wound
&amp; defilement to <hi>conſcience;</hi> that we may let them ſee
it is but a vain attempt for them to think to <hi>reproach</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:153036:30"/>
or perſecute us out of our integrity; let us be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely

            <p>1. By putting Religion in ſuch things in which
Cod hath put none, laying other bonds and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
on our necks, then thoſe which the Holy
Ghoſt hath laid on us: the abridging and cutting
our ſelves ſhort of that Chriſtian liberty, which the
Lord hath not only allowed, but commanded us to
maintain and ſtand faſt in.</p>
            <p>2. By putting more Religion in any thing then
God hath put in it, by laying a greater weight and
ſtreſs upon the leſſer and ſmaller things<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Religion
than God hath layed on them. By the leſſer duties of
Religion, I mean not any <hi>moral duties:</hi> the loweſt of
theſe, the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> loweſt duties of mercy, juſtice, charity,
truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be <hi>reckoned</hi> among the <hi>weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the law,</hi> wherein we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſtrict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we cannot be too juſt, or too true, or too mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
nor too zealous for truth, juſtice and mercy,
<hi>Mat. 5. 19. He that breaketh the leaſt of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,

things of Religion, I mean the circumſtantials of the
worſhip of God, the outward forms of worſhip, the
geſtures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be uſed in it. This is a being righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
overmuch, to put more in theſe circumſtantials
then the Scripture hath put, to be ſo zealous for or
againſt them, as if Religion ſtood or fell with them,
1 <hi>Cor: 7. 19. Circumciſion is nothing, and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
is nothing, but the keeping the Commandments of
God:</hi> ſome there were that did hotly contend <hi>for
Circumciſion,</hi> and did put much of their Religion in
that; others were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as hot <hi>againſt it,</hi> &amp; this was much of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:153036:32"/>
their Religion, both theſe the Apoſtle checks, telling
them that <hi>circumciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion
is nothing;</hi> theſe are not the things wherein Religion
ſtands; keep the <hi>Commandment,</hi> fear <hi>God,</hi> walk before
<hi>God</hi> in <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> let your zeal be ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
that way, but trouble not your ſelves ſo much about
theſe <hi>leſſer matters.</hi> Yet two things muſt here be added</p>
            <p>1. This is not ſo to be unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtood, as if Chriſtians
were to <hi>ſwallow</hi> all things of this nature without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
whether they be agreeable to the Word of
<hi>God</hi> or not, a due <hi>regard</hi> muſt be had to the ſatisfying
of <hi>Conſcience</hi> even in the ſmalleſt things; we may not
yeild to practiſe any little things which are againſt
our <hi>Conſciences,</hi> though we may not ſpend our zeal
about them, as if <hi>Religion</hi> lived or died with them.</p>
            <p>2. Even againſt theſe leſſer things there ought to
be zeal expreſt, if they ſhould be like to prove deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the ſubſtantials of Religion, and hinder the
main end which they pretend to promote; by this
it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ppears what I mean by turning aſide <hi>to the right
hand,</hi> or being righteous over-much.</p>
            <p>By curning aſide to the <hi>left hand,</hi> I mean the ſame
which <hi>Solomon</hi> there doth, by being <hi>wicked overmuch,
Neither be thou wicked overmuch.</hi> This is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
as if there were any wickedneſs which is
not too much, a little is too much, it checks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains
all liberty to ſin, though in many things we
ſin all, yet let not ſin get the head of thee, keep it
under, keep it down as much as is poſſible, leaſt it
grow to that height that it prove thy ſpeedy ruine;
by turning aſide therefore to the left hand, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all declinings to licentiouſneſs; Either,</p>
            <p>1. By making duties no duties, making ſins to be
no ſins, and ſo making the way of life broader than
Chriſt hath made it; and ſtretching out liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153036:33"/>
our line, as turning aſide to the right hand,
ſtands in the infringing of our liberty, in impoſing
ſuch burthens, which God hath not impoſed; ſo
turning to the left hand, ſtands in taking up a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which God hath impoſed; making it no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
matter of Conſcience to be ſtrict, not only in the
Circumſtantials, but neither in the Subſtantials of
Religion; ſo blinding Conſcience, and bribing it
over to ſide with luſt, that it accounts it not a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to be ſo ſtrict and ſo preciſe in any thing, but
that there may be a greater latitude allowed, and
a remitting of our care and zeal, eſpecially in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of any hazard or danger, that our zeal and
ſtrictneſs is like to coſt us.</p>
            <p>2. Making bold with duties and ſins, neglecting
known duties, running upon known ſins, making
ſhipwrack of Conſcience to ſatisfie luſt; when
though Cor-ſcience ſtands convinced, that holineſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
in the ſtrictneſs of it, is our duty, and that licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs,
and living after the fleſh, is our ſin; yet
we will indulge to our ſelves, our fleſhly liberty.</p>
            <p>Now this is another Character of circumſpect
Chriſtians, they will walk according to conſcience
in all things, without turning aſide either way, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the right hand, or the left; they are not
willing to turn aſide to the right hand, either by
putting Religion in thoſe things in which God
hath put none, or by putting more of Religion in
any thing, than God hath put in it; their zeal is
for the ſubſtantials and weighty things of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as for the circumſtantials, though they will
not act in theſe contrary to Conſcience, yet they
liſt not to be contentio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s a about them, nor cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of thoſe, who agreeing in the main, to differ
in theſe things from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:153036:33"/>
               <hi>But their great care is not to turn aſide to the
left hand; they will not for fear of being too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
grow profuſe and profane; but as the Apoſtle,
Hebr.</hi> 13. 18. They have a good Conſcience, willing to
live honeſtly in all things, endeavouring to deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs
and worldly luſts, and to live righteouſly, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
and godly in this preſent evil World, being holy
and harmleſs, the children of God without rebuke in
the midſt of a crooked generation.</p>
            <p>III. From this way they will not be withdrawn,
either by any hopes or advantages on the one
hand, or, by any fears or dangers on the other;
they have not taken up Religion on ſuch ſlight
grounds, as to be either flattered, or frighted out
of it. Chriſtians, at their firſt engaging in the way
of the Lord, do ſit down and conſider, what it will
coſt them to be Chriſt's Diſciples; they count
all the charges, they caſt up all the damages that
they can be ſubject to, before-hand; and fore-ſee,
that there is enough in Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſt to make amends for
all, and to ſave them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>armleſs at the laſt, whatever
falls. They count upon tribulations, loſſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and the greateſt of temptations; and if
they did not fore-ſee, that the gain of Godlineſs
would countervail all the loſſes and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
it's like to be attended with, they would not
have adventured on it; but ſeeing for a certainty
they can be no looſers, hereupon they ſet up their
ſtaffe, determining not to depart for ever. They
take Chriſt and his wayes for <hi>better for worſe,</hi> for
richer for poorer, in proſperity and affliction;
they reſolve to ſtand or fall, to ſuffer and reign,
to live and dye with him. They promiſe to him,
as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi,</hi> Ruth 1. 14. <hi>As the Lord liveth
I will not leave thee; whither thou goeſt I will go,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153036:34"/>
where thou lodgeſt I will lodge:</hi> They will take their
Lot with Chriſt where ever it falls; Chriſt hath
ſaid to them, <hi>I will never forſake you,</hi> Heb. 13. 15.
and they have ſaid the like to him; he that hath
not thus engaged, is no true Chriſtian; this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
reſolution to be ever the Lord's, never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him, is of the eſſence of true converſion; he is
no true Convert, that is content to follow Chriſt
in fair weather only, as far and as long as he ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may; a ſincere Convert will follow Chriſt
abſolutely and unalterably. Now, being thus
engaged, whatever befalls them, it is no more
than they looked for; they are called fools, and
counted ſtubborn, and refractory, ſelf-will'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelf-conceited;
and they looked to be counted ſuch,
and ſo it moves them not: they are ſet upon by
flatteries, and tempted by outward proſperity;
but it cannot prevail, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee,</hi> ſays
<hi>Peter, Germana illa beſtia non curat pecuniam:</hi> 'Twas
ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> Money will do nothing with them,
Preferment will do nothing with them, Priſons,
Baniſhment, Death it ſelf can do nothing with
them; <hi>None of theſe things move me, neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ount I
my life dear unto me, ſo that I may finiſh my courſe
with joy,</hi> Acts 20. 24.</p>
            <p>And as they will not be drawn to a total Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
from Chriſt, ſo neither will they be brought to
allow themſelves in any little deviation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.
17, 18. <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have we not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
thee, neither have we dealt falſly in thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
our heart is not turned back, neither have our
ſteps declined thy way:</hi> in what caſe they were, you
may ſee in the foregoing part of the <hi>Pſalm; Thou
haſt caſt us off, thou makeſt us to turn our backs upon
our Enemies,. and they that hate us, ſpoyle for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153036:34"/>
themſelves; thou makeſt us a reproach to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
a ſcorn and deriſion to them that are round about
us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Though all this be come upon us, yet have we
not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Our hearts are not turned back:</hi> We do not
repent of our choice; we do not wiſh our ſelves
back amongſt the proſperous world; we think never
the worſe of the Lord, or his way; we have as good
a will to the Lord, high an eſteem of his waies, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we had before we were thus afflicted; there's not
the leaſt abatement of our love and affection; If we
were now to begin again, if we were now to chooſe
whom we would ſerve, and know as much as we do
now, we ſhould make the ſame choice; our heart
runs out the ſame way, and in the fame ſtrength that
ever it did; thoſe many waters that have run upon
us, have neither quenched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no, not ſo much as cool'd
our love; <hi>neither have our ſteps declined from thy way:</hi>
We have neither been turn'd back in our affection,
nor turn'd aſide in our practiſe; through the grace of
God our hearts have been kept upright, and we have
made <hi>ſtrait ſteps to our feet,</hi> Dan. 6. 10. We read, that
when a Decree was made, <hi>That whoſoever ſhould ask
any Petition for thirty days ſpace, either of God or man,
ſave of the King, ſhould be caſt into the Lions Den;</hi> Yet
<hi>Daniel</hi> would not forbear to pray to his God; <hi>When
he knew that the Writing was ſigned, he went into his
houſe, and his Windows being open in his Chamber, he
kneeled upon his kneee Three times a day, and Prayed,
&amp;c.</hi> Carnal men would have been ready to have
ſaid, What a preciſe <hi>Fool</hi> was this <hi>Daniel?</hi> What great
matter was it, that he ſtood ſo much upon? it was not
the committing a ſin that he was urged to, but only
the forbearance of a Duty; he was not required to
fall down before an <hi>Image,</hi> as the <hi>three Chrildren</hi>
were, or to worſhip any falſe <hi>God;</hi> but to forbear, for a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153036:35"/>
time, to pray to the true God: If it had been the
worſhipping before an Image that had been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſome would have reaſon'd thus; Why, what great
matter had that been, to bow in the houſe of <hi>Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
to bow before an Image, or an Altar, this is not
praying to them? There is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>worſhipping an Image, &amp; worſhipping God before
an Image;</hi> What is there in all this? But this, which
<hi>Daniel</hi> ſtands upon, hath not ſo foul a face; twas only
the <hi>forbearance</hi> of his duty to God, and that only for
a time: Was this ſuch a crime to forbear praying for
a few weeks, for the ſaving of his life? Or, if he would
needs pray, he might have done it ſecretly, and kept
his devotion to himſelf; Muſt he needs keep his
hours, and open his windows too? Yea, he muſt do
it, and he will do it: <hi>Daniel</hi> would not only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
his courſe of Prayer, but he would not give his
Adverſaries occaſion to think, that he was afraid to
pray; he held it his duty (being called out to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his Religion) to let his Adverſaries know,
that he had not ſuch a ſlight and low eſteem of it,
that he was afraid to truſt his God with his ſafety,
whileſt he continued in the exerciſe of his duty. It's
true, that in matters circumſtantial, ſuch, wherein
there may be variation without prejudice to the
ſubſtantials of Godlineſs, ſuch which are not againſt
their conſciences, which they may ſubmit to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſining againſt God; here they are not ſtiff, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory,
but for peace ſake, &amp; in order to the gaining
upon the hearts of others, they are willing, with the
Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 9. 20. <hi>To become all things to all men,</hi> in
ſuch things wherein they can ſatisfie themſelves,
they are willing, as far as may be, to gratifie the
minds of others.</p>
            <p>But for the Subſtantials of Religion, the matters
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153036:35"/>
of Faith, the matters of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs,
the worſhipping of God in Spirit and Truth, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own Ordinances and Inſtitutions, or any
thing elſe of the ſame import with theſe; here they
are reſolved, whatever come upon them, on become
of them, not to relinq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſh, or be drawn aſide from
them, by any ſolicitations whatſoever; they muſt
obey God, rather than men; they muſt follow God,
though therein they forſake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and provoke all the
world: In matters which God hath left to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
they are willing to uſe their liberty, according
as it may be behooveful for the Goſpel. In matters
that concern their perſonal intereſt, as men, they
liſt not, they ought not to be contentious; ſpare
them but the liberty to keep a good conſcience,
give them leave to fear God, and worſhip God; give
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> leave to be holy and righteous, and to walk
before the Lord in their integrity; and for any thing
elſe, you may perſwade them to it with eaſe: But, if
you entice them away from their God, or impoſe
upon them, to the prejudice of a good conſcience,
you were as good ſpare you labour, ſpeak no more
to them in ſuch matters, they are at a point, God
they will follow, a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> they will <hi>maintain</hi>
whatever come on them, to the end of their days.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you a deſcription of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Preciſians,
which is ſummarily this; They are

            <p>Concerning theſe men, I ſhall now prove, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd
make evident to the Conſciences of all impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Petſons, in the ſecond place, That they are
no fools, but truly Wiſe men.</p>
            <p>In order hereto, I muſt firſt diſcover what's meant
by Fools; A Fool is a man void of underſtanding (we
are not now diſcourſing of natural Fools, but of
thoſe that are ſuch upon a moral account) a man
void of true wiſdom. Wiſdom is of Two ſorts:</p>
            <p>1. Fleſhly Wiſdom, a Carnal Policy; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in an underſtanding where the intereſt of the
fleſhlies, &amp; in the ordering &amp; managing of our ſelves,
and our affairs ſo, that we may adva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> and ſecure
this intereſt. By the intereſt of the fleſh, I mean, all
thoſe things which pleaſe and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he that can order his affairs, and ſteer his

his outward concernments, that which way ſoever
the world go, he may live in peace, and quiet, &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and plenty, and pleaſure, this is a fleſhly wiſe
man. Concerning this wiſdom, the queſtion is not,
in this it will eaſily be granted, <hi>That the chilren of
this world are wiſer in their generation, than the children
of light,</hi> can make a better ſhift to live in the world,
to keep themſelves whole in all changes and caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the Apoſtle diſclaims this wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we had our converſation in the world, not <hi>in fleſhly
wiſdom, but in the Grace of God, and in ſimplicity and
godly ſincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Spiritual wiſdome, which conſiſts, 1. in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
where our main intereſt lies, which is
not in things temporal, meat, &amp; drink, and cloaths,
&amp; money, and houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;. lands, and pleaſures, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
but in things Spiritual, in the love &amp; favour
of God, in a good Conſcience, in Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; and in things eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
in that Glory, Honour, and Immortality, which
ſhall be given of God. 2. In ordering our ſelves and
waies ſo, as to make the beſt proviſion for ſecuring of
this our great &amp; eternal intereſt, that whatever miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
there may be in things of lower value and
leaſt durance, that wherein our eternal happineſs
ſtands, may be ſecured to us; this is called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>The wiſdome which is from above,</hi> wiſdome to
Salvation; and this is the only true Wiſdome. God
hath made and will make all fleſhly wiſdom appear
to be folly; concerning this true Wiſdom, this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Wiſdom it is, that I ſhall now make good,
That circumſpect preciſe Chriſtians are no fools, but

their Religion and yours, are not two wayes of
Religion, but as to the principles of it, are but
one and the ſame; the difference betwixt you and
them, is this, you take up a little part of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which you both profeſs, and you will have
but a little to do with that little of Religion which
you do take up; you little mind or ſtudy, or are
exerciſed in that which you count your Religion;
theſe preciſe ones, take up the whole of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and they give themſelves wholly to the

to ſearch the Scripture, that they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the will and way of the Lord, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
their hearts, and order their lives in all
things according to it; So that now, if you will
anſwer two eaſie queſtions, you ſhall thereby, be

firſt queſtion is, <hi>Who are moſt like to be in the right?
either theſe who endeavour to practiſe all that they
profeſs, or thoſe, who though they profeſs the truth,
do practiſe ſcarce any thing of it; but a ſmall part of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:153036:41"/>
it, and that the lower, and leſs conſiderable part of it,
the bare outſide of it:</hi> This is no hard queſtion, I
hope you'l acknowledge to be reſolved; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
queſtion ſhall be as eaſie; <hi>Who is like to be in
the right, the diligent Chriſtian, that makes it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſtudy his Religion, or the careleſs Chriſtian, that
ſeldom ſpends a ſerious thought about it?</hi> Anſwer but
theſe two queſtions, and then your ſelves will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to give a reaſon, why it's more like they ſhould
be in the right than you. Brethren, ſhew your ſelves
men, here are a company of poor creatures of you,
who have ſpent your time in ignorance and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as to the matters of God and your ſouls, who
little meddle with that of Religion, which your
ſelves ſay you muſt do if you will be ſaved; you
ſay you muſt believe, you muſt repent of your ſins,
you muſt pray to God for forgiveneſs, and yet what
great ſtrangers are many of you from theſe things?
it may be if you conſider it, you have often gon
whole daies and weeks together, and have ſcarcely
ever prayed, no not ſo much as after your own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
nor ſcarce had any thoughts of Repentance,

eternal ſtate, their daily ſtudy and buſineſſe;
now, what an unreaſonable thing is it to imagin,

that houſe, and it fell not.</hi> Pſal. 26. 12. <hi>My food
ſtandeth in an even place.</hi> All other perſons and
parties ſtand upon ſlippery places, and have but an
uncertain ſtanding. When they are in the height
of all their glory and confidence, they are often
gon in a moment. A Chriſtian ſtands ſure; which
way ever the wheel of Providence moves, it moves
in favour of the upright; he is ſtill uppermoſt,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:153036:42"/>
when he is undermoſt; he hath the better, when
he hath the worſt; all the viciſſitudes and returns
of Proſperity and affliction, do make no change
upon him as to the main; he is as happy under
all his outward loſſes, as in his greateſt gains; he's
as honourable under the greateſt contempt that's
poured out upon him, as under the higheſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
applauſe: he's as ſafe in the greateſt dangers,
as when there is no danger appearing; he's built
upon that Rock, whence the greateſt winds and
waves can never beat him down: he's <hi>built upon
the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles,</hi> Epheſ.
2. 20. He hath Religion, Righteouſneſs, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
yea, the Truth and Strength of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God to uphold him: if ever a Chriſtian
falls, Chriſt muſt fall with him; if ever a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
falls, the Scripture muſt fall with him: That
Word, concerning which Chriſt hath ſaid, Matth.
24. 35. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my
Word ſhall not paſs away.</hi> He ſhall never be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of his hopes, unleſs faithfulneſs can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint:
he ſhall never be deceived, till Truth
becomes a lye: he ſhall never wholly be overcome,
unleſs Almightineſs become weakneſs. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
world built all their hopes and comforts on
the ſand, on the wiſdom of the fleſh, on the riches,
ſtrength, and multitude of their partakers, on the
ſucceſſes of their carnal counſels: they bottom
their very ſouls upon meer facies, and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
upon that wood, hay, and ſtubbble, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
Inventions, and Traditions of men; nay
they have their foundation in the dirt and mire,
they ſtrengthen themſelves in their wickedneſs.
If iniquity be able to ſupport them, if Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
be able to exalt them, if Unrighteouſneſs can
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:153036:43"/>
ſecure them, they have ſomething to lean upon; but
if Righteouſneſs be it that muſt carry it, if a good
conſcience, ſimplicity and godly ſincerity; if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and faithfulneſs of God, an intereſt in Chriſt,
be the only ſure refuge, then where are the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the ungodly? When they are in the
height of all their glory, 'tis but one turn of the
wheel, and they are thrown off their legs, their
hopes and their joys vaniſh, and all their thoughts
periſh. If God and Chriſt, and Scriptures, and
Conſcience be of any Conſiſtency, Chriſtians have
enough. If unrighteouſneſs and wickedneſs ſhould
carry it in this world, never ſo clearly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly;
yet if righteouſneſs and holineſs will but
carry it in the world to come, Chriſtians are ſafe
enough. Carnal men, who build their hopes on
this earth, when the earth is ſhaken, their hopes are
ſhaken, their hearts are ſhaken, and they are even
at their wits ends. But ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 112.
7, 8. <hi>The heart of the righteous ſhall be eſtabliſhed, he
ſhall not be afraid of any evil tydings; his heart is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
truſting in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 46. 2, 3. <hi>Therefore we
will not fear, though the earth be removed, and the
mountains be carried into the Sea, though the waters
thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains
ſhake with the ſwelling thereof.</hi> Though all the earth
ſhould be in an uproar, though the whole world
ſhould be turned topſie turvy, yet we will not fear,
though the mountains ſhake, yet our hearts ſhall
not ſhake. Are they not wiſe men, that are gotten

What have they gotten by their Wiſdom?
Where is the Income and Revenue, that all their

wiſdom hath brought them in? If you were to give
us an account of their loſings, you might eaſily
bring in a long Bill; ſome of them have had ſo little
wit, as to loſe all they have; but, will you take your
Bill, and write down their gains? Why, if you will
hearken to me a while, I will ſhew you what they
have gained: They have gotten great treaſure; as
poor as any of them ſeem to be, they are the richeſt
men in the world. Particularly.</p>

the world, and I have none, Oh! but I have Chriſt
to be my friend: Other men live at eaſe, in their

Kingdom of heaven; whilſt others have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the ſpoyles here below, ſcrambling for ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
and fancies, ſharing the Dominions and
Dignities, and Preferments, and Pleaſures of this
world amongſt them; theſe have been laying up
in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt
the time to come; doth this ſpeak them ſuch a
fooliſh company as you would make them? Have
they made ſuch a wiſe choice, and taken ſuch a
wiſe courſe, and yet muſt they go for fools? Is
this your ſerious and ſober judgment? Do you
in earneſt think, that in that change which the
Goſpel hath made upon them, they are changed
for the worſe? that in the choice which they have
made of God, rather than the world, of Chriſt, in
ſtead of their luſts, of things eternal, before things
temporal, that they have herein choſen to their
loſs? Is this your thought, will you write down
this as your judgment, and put your hand to it,
and be content that this writing ſhould be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the laſt Judgment, as the Teſt by which you
will be tryed, whether you are wiſe or fooliſh?
Are you Chriſtians, and do you believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and are you not yet aſhamed that any ſuch
thoughts ſhould come into your hearts? Will you
ſay, The Devil is the beſt Maſter, and he's a fool
that will not be his ſervant, but Chriſt is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ard
Maſter, and none that's wiſe will venture after him?
Will you ſay, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a fool, in refuſing to
be called the ſon of <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Daughter, chooſing
rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God,
than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin form ſeaſon,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:153036:48"/>
that the Apoſtles, and the Diſciples were fools,
that <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> were
fools; with the reſt of thoſe holy Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who denied themſelves, took up their Croſs
and followed Chriſt, and that the Scribes and
Phariſees, and Publicans, and Harlots, and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
and Gluttons, that made a mock and a ſcorn
of him and them, had more wit than they? Is
not this the very thing you ſay in charging folly
upon thoſe, whoſe aim and deſire is to walk in
the ſame ſteps that thoſe primitive Chriſtians wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in before them? Is this your Chriſtianity? Is
this your reaſon and Religion, and honeſty?
ſpeak out your hearts in plain termes. No man
would hearken to Chriſt, unleſs he were a fool:
no man would be holy, unleſs he were a fool: no
man would leave his luſts and his pleaſures, and his
liberties, and his vanities, unleſs he had firſt loſt
his wits: Or, at leaſt, no wiſe man would take up more
of Chriſtianity, than the name, and the ſhell, and
the ſhadow: none but a fool would make ſure
work for his ſoul, would go through with Chriſt
and Chriſtianity, would be an inward, hearty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
univerſal, ſincere Chriſtian. Would any
wiſe man put it out of doubt, that Chriſt is his, put
it out of doubt, that his ſoul is ſafe, that he's paſſed
from death to life, and ſhall never come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation?
What do your bruitiſh hearts and
wayes ſpeak leſs, or rather than this? Sinners, is
this all the wiſdom or honeſty you have, thus to
ſpeak or think? If it be, Be it known unto you all,
that theſe fooliſh Saints have more wit, than to
count the reproaches of ſuch bruitiſh ſpirits, to be
any diſparagement to them or their profeſſion, and
therefore if you will, mock on, and go on, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire

your ſelves and the oaks which you have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,

you deſpiſe theſe and their wayes; but however,
whilſt they have this aſſurance, that God doth not
count them what you call them, that [<hi>You</hi>] will
not call them <hi>at laſt,</hi> what you call them <hi>now;</hi> you
muſt give them leave (though they think never ſo
meanly of themſelves) yet, ſtill to have the ſame
high thoughts of their God, of their Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of

have a better opinion of theſe men, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
reproaching them; think with your ſelves
upon what hath been ſaid: Theſe men may be
wiſer than we are aware of, they may be honeſt

were better that a milſtone were hanged about his neck
and he were caſt into the midſt of the Sea:</hi> And what
if they ſhould be ſo? In what caſe are you then,
that have reproached and perſecuted them? but I
muſt be bold to tell, there's no <hi>May be,</hi> in the
matter. I queſtion not, but if you would imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
weigh what hath been ſpoken, and what ſhall
yet farther be ſpoken, you will ſee, that if God
hath any people in the world, theſe are they; and
therefore my advice is, that you <hi>refrain from theſe
men, and let them alone, leſt,</hi> if you do go on, you <hi>be
ſound fighters againſt God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But where be there any ſuch? There be ſome
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:153036:49"/>
that make a fair ſhew, and make ſpecious pretences to
the ſtrictneſs of Religion, but they are hypocrites and
deceivers, and theſe are they that we only ſpeak againſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Let this be granted, That ſuch men as
have been deſcribed, (<hi>if</hi>) there be any ſuch, are
truely wiſe men; that men of ſuch Principles, that
men of this profeſſion (if) they really be what
they profeſs, and live according to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that theſe are men of wiſdom; do but grant
that godlineſs is wiſdom, and the fear of the Lord
is underſtanding: I would that I could bring you
thus far, heartily to grant, that godlineſs hath an
excellency in it, and that a life led according to
thoſe Principles of godlineſs, which have been
laid before you, is the moſt excellent life: Hence
theſe two things will unavoidably follow, 1. That
by how much more exactly and ſtrictly any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
live according to the Principles of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
by ſo much the more have they attained to
of true wiſdom: If Godlineſs be our wiſdome
and excellency, then by how much the more
preciſely godly any perſons are by ſo much the
more wiſe and excellent; by how much the more
preciſe a Chriſtian or godly man is, by ſo much
the more he is a Chriſtian or a godly man; and
therefore, let never any man be blam'd for that
he is ſo much, but that he is no more preciſe.
2. By how much the more <hi>looſely</hi> any perſons live
from the Rules of Religion, by how much the
more liberty they take to walk after the fleſh, by
ſo much the more <hi>fooliſh</hi> they are; and ſo you may
without controverſie conclude, that whatever
theſe preciſe people be, you that are Libertines (to
be ſure) are <hi>fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Are there none ſuch? What, hath God no
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:153036:49"/>
people in the world? hath the Devil gotten all?
God hath a people ſomewhere, and a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whom he hath choſen to ſalvation, whom he
hath redeemed, and called, and juſtified, and
ſanctified, and ſet apart for himſelf, from the reſt
of the world, all are not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> all are not Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but there are ſome whom God hath peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet apart to himſelf, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he reſt of men; and
where are theſe to be found, if not among theſe
preciſe walkers? the peculiar people of God are,
as hath been ſufficiently proved, an holy people,
an hearing people, a praying people, a zealous
people, a watchful, gainful, induſtrious, ſober;
meek, merciful, patient people, and all this in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity:
Now, where ſhall we <hi>look</hi> to find out ſuch
a people? Muſt we rake the kennels, and ſearch
the ſinks of the earth? Muſt we ſeek in the Ale-houſes,
or Taverns, or Play-houſes? Shall we
take out the drunkards and riotous, the ſwearers
and lyars, the covetous and oppreſſors, the vain
ones of the earth, the blind People, that bruitiſh
generation that knows not, nor mind not the Lord
or his wayes, and ſay of any of theſe, ſurely here
they be, theſe are the people of God; here be
the men that are no hypocrites, theſe are that
<hi>Royal Prieſthohd,</hi> that holy Nation, that peculiar
people, whom God hath called to ſhew forth his
praiſe before the world? Sinners, if you have ſo
much reaſon or conſcience, as to conclude that
none of theſe are they, then tell us farther, who,
or where they are, or elſe at laſt acknowledge, that
if God hath a people any where, 'tis amongſt thoſe
that you have reproached.</p>
            <p>3. If you ſay, there be hypocrites among them,
and theſe are they that you ſpeak againſt, and not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:153036:50"/>
gainſt thoſe that are upright, let me give you this
double advice.</p>
            <p>1. Take heed you miſtake not the mark: do
not ſhoot at Saints indeed, under the name and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
of hypocrites: do not count that hypocriſie,
which God accounts ſincerity; you may be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
(as I told you before) and what if you ſhould
be miſtaken? what if it ſhould prove, not only that
the men which you reproach for hypocrites, God
ſhould account ſincere: but if the very thing which
you call their hypocriſie, the Lord counts their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
what if it ſhould be ſo? Then you have
ſhot a fair ſhot; every reproach which you have
thus caſt out, is as ſo much dirt which you have
thrown into the Face of God, ſo many darts which
you have ſhot into the Apple of God's Eye: You
who are ſo free in reproaching Profeſſors, take heed
that it be not found, that the ground of all your
evil language againſt them, and evil uſage of them,
be not for that they are, but for that they are not
hypocrites.</p>
            <p>2. If they be hypocrites, and only ſuch that you
ſpeak againſt, take heed you miſtake not your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
do not caſt that upon them for a reproach,
which is good; do not take good names to reproach
evil men. If they be hypocrites any of them, and
you know them to be ſuch, call them hypocrites;
but do not take the name of Saint, or Preciſian, or
holy Brother, and put them as marks of diſgrace
and ſcorn upon them; he that calls a Saint hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
reproaches the Chriſtian; he that in ſcorn
calls an hypocrite Saint, or holy Brother, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. But I have yet a greater requeſt unto you
then to have a good opinion of theſe men, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:153036:50"/>
no longer to reproach them; my requeſt to <hi>you</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, <hi>That you would come in and be of this number.</hi>
Some of <hi>you</hi> it may be, will be ready to reply, he
ſhall have hard work that will perſwade me to be a
Preciſian; and truly, I am afraid ſo too, if all that
the Devil can do, will hinder it; if all that <hi>your</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
reaſon and fleſhly luſts can do, if all that <hi>your</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
companions can do will hinder it, I ſhall be ſure
enough not to <hi>prevail</hi> with <hi>you;</hi> yet know, that the
motion which I make to <hi>you,</hi> is from the Lord, and
if <hi>you</hi> deny me, <hi>you</hi> therein deny him; and
if <hi>you</hi> deny him; <hi>you</hi> muſt come upon it, there's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<hi>day</hi> coming when he will deny <hi>you;</hi> You ſay,
<hi>you will</hi> not be perſwaded, but what is it <hi>you will</hi>
not be perſwaded to: Why, this is it, <hi>you will</hi> not
take the Yoke of Chriſt upon <hi>you, you will</hi> not be
advis'd, nor be rul'd by him; ſo as to live as he
would have <hi>you live,</hi> but <hi>you</hi> will have <hi>your liberty</hi>
ſtill to <hi>walk</hi> according to <hi>your</hi> own mind and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rt;
that is, <hi>you will</hi> not be Chriſtians; Will <hi>you</hi> not?
Are <hi>you</hi> in good earneſt? Are <hi>you</hi> content that
the Lord ſhould take <hi>you</hi> at <hi>your</hi> word, and for
ever give <hi>you</hi> up to <hi>your</hi> hearts luſt, and let <hi>you</hi>
alone to <hi>walk</hi> in <hi>your</hi> own counſels? Are <hi>you</hi>
content from henceforth to give up <hi>your hope</hi> in
Chriſt? are <hi>you</hi> content to be damn'd: Brethren, this
is the choice <hi>you</hi> are put to, either an <hi>holy</hi> Life, or
everlaſting Death; either <hi>you</hi> muſt ſubmit to the
Yoke of Chriſt, or <hi>you</hi> can have no benefit by the
Croſs of Chriſt; either <hi>you</hi> muſt kiſs his golden ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
or be broken in pieces with his Rod of Iron;
refuſe to follow him in his Kingdom of Grace, and
<hi>you</hi> thereby ſhut <hi>your</hi> ſelves out of the Kingdom of
Glory: Whereof, that I may the more effectually
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:153036:51"/>
convince you, I ſhall yet farther prove to you, both
by Scripture and reaſon, that this ſtrict and preciſe
way of life, is ſo undoubtedly and abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſalvation, that whoſoever doth not thus
walk, cannot eſcape the damnation of hell.</p>
            <p>I know carnal men are confident that they ſhall
be ſaved without ſo much ado, and this is that which
hardens them in their ſins, their ſtrong conceit that
the way is not ſo ſtrait and narrow as many would
make them believe; they doubt not but they have
found out a ſhorter and eaſier way than this; and
what is this eaſier way? Why, 'tis but <hi>call upon God
for mercy, keep thy Church, do no body any wrong, be no
drunkard, no ſwearer, no adulterer; or if thou be
ſometimes overtaken, ask God forgiveneſs, cry God mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and then hope well, never deſpair of Gods mercy,
fear not, thou ſhalt be ſafe enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I ſhall make it plain to you, that this looſe
and eaſie way of Religion, will certainly leave eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſoul that goes no further, to periſh everlaſtingly;
and that this ſtrict holy life, which hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
is indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
the matter I am upon is weighty, a miſtake
in your Religion is mortal, if that which you have
taken up for the way of life be not ſo, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for ever; and that this your eaſie way is not
it I ſhall now make evident.</p>
            <p>1. From Scripture; Let us but ſeriouſly examine
and weigh thoſe many high expreſſions which we
find in Scripture, in the <hi>Commands, Exhortations, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
Inſtances, Promiſes,</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> recorded
in it; in all which, the one way of life is deſcribed,
and then let any reaſonable man judge, if all this
amount to no more than that poor, and pitiful, and
empty thing, which carnal men count their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:153036:51"/>
1. <hi>For Scripture-commands conſider theſe,</hi>
Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, looking diligently
leſt any man fail of the grace of God. Work out your
ſalvation with fear and trembling; not ſloathful in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord; Put off
concerning the converſation, the old man which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
according to the deceitful luſts, and put on the
new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and
true holineſs: Waſh thine heart from thine iniquities,

good, to the uſe of edifying, that may miniſter grace
to the bearers. Walk in love, love one another, love your

perſecute you; render to no man evil for evil, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
evil with goodneſs; mortifie your members which
are upon the Earth, walk in the ſpirit, abſtain from all
appearance of evil, be watchful; ſtand with your loyns
girded, and your lights burning.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>For Scripture-inſtructions, conſider theſe,</hi>
The Grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to all men, teaching us, that denying all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

and to keep himſelf unſpotted of the World. They that

ſhall be in danger of the judgement. He that looketh on
a Woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery
with her in his heart. Of every idle word men ſhall give
account at the day of Judgment. If any Man ſeem to
be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, that Mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:153036:52"/>
3 <hi>For Scripture-inſtances;</hi> David <hi>is ſaid to be</hi> a
man after Gods own heart, &amp; did that which was right in
the ſight of the Lord; &amp; turned not Aſide from any thing
that the Lord had commanded him all the dayes of his
life, ſave only, &amp;c. <hi>Of</hi> Joſiah <hi>it is recorded,</hi> That his
heart was tender and perfect with the Lord his God, and
that he turned not aſide to the right hand, or to the left.
Paul <hi>profeſſes that he ſerved the Lord inſtantly,</hi>
night and day; that forgetting thoſe things which are
behind, he reached forth to the things that are before,
preſſing to the mark, &amp;c. The life which I now live in
the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God. To me to
live is Chriſt, to dye is gain. I ſo run, not as uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſo fight I, not as one that beateth the air, but I keep
under my body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt preaching
to others I my ſelf ſhould become a caſt-away.</p>
            <p>

pure in heart, they that are perſecuted for righteouſneſs
ſake, for they ſhall ſee God, theirs is the Kingdom of
heaven; they ſhall be comforted, filled, and great is their
reward in heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Scripture-prayers, conſider theſe,</hi> The God

God of peace make you perfect in every good work, to do
his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in
his ſight.</p>
            <p>Multitudes of ſuch like Scriptures might be added,
but theſe may ſuffice. Now wherefore are all theſe
things written? Wherefore are theſe ſtrict commands
given, theſe holy lives of Saints left upon Record,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:153036:52"/>
theſe promiſes made, and theſe prayers kept upon
the file? Are they not all written for our <hi>learning,</hi> to
let every man and woman underſtand what manner
of perſons they muſt be, what manner of <hi>Lives</hi> they
muſt <hi>live,</hi> if they will be ſaved? If leſs, or a lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
would ſerve, to what purpoſe is this waſte. If
it be ſo, People may forbear to charge Preciſians
with keeping more ado than needs, and lay in their
charge againſt the Scriptures, for requiring more
than needs. But do <hi>you</hi> think indeed, that the
Scriptures have ſpoken theſe things in vain? If it
be not in vain, if all this be comprehended under
the one thing needful; if all this do but ſhew us
the one and <hi>only</hi> way of Life; if we muſt be thus
renewed and changed in our minds, and muſt thus
<hi>holily</hi> and <hi>unblameably</hi> order our Lives, or elſe
we cannot be ſaved, as the Scriptures mentioned
many of them expreſly affirm, then what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of that poor confident multitude we are now
dealing with? Does all this amount to no more
than keeping <hi>your</hi> Church, ſaying your prayers,
<hi>learning</hi> and ſaying over the Creed, and the Ten
Commandments, living peaceably with your
Neighbours, paying every man his own, crying
to God for mercy when you have committed a
fin, and the like? Can you call this cold, lifeleſs
way, your ſtriving <hi>to enter in at the ſtrait gate?</hi>
Is this your <hi>working out your ſalvation with fear and
trembling?</hi> Is this all that is meant <hi>by fighting the
good fight of Faith, by wresting againſt Fleſh and
Blood, againſt Principalities and Powers, by being
inſtant in Prayer, fervent in Spirit,</hi> watching and
running, and <hi>preſſing towards the mark?</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
if there be one way of Life; if all this
which hath been repreſented to you out of the

            <p>But if this be not ſufficient, I ſhall yet make it
more evident by <hi>Reaſons</hi> drawn from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which I ſhall give you in theſe <hi>Six Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Goſpel requires, as indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ſalvation, <hi>inward holineſs,</hi> or the renewing
of the heart, or inner-man. Needs this any proof
to them that underſtand the Scriptures? There
muſt be <hi>another Spirit.</hi> Numb: 14. 24. <hi>A new heart,</hi>
Ezek. 36. 26. <hi>A cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an heart,</hi> Pſal. 73. 1. <hi>A true heart,
or an upright heart, ſprinkled from an evil Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
Hebr. 10. 22. Ezek. 18. 31. <hi>Make you a new
heart, and a new ſpirit, for why will ye dye?</hi> Jer.
4. 14. <hi>Oh</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>waſh thine heart from wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
that thou mayeſt be ſaved.</hi> What do theſe
Scriptures, eſpecially the addition in the two laſt,
<hi>For why will ye dye?</hi> And [<hi>that thou mayeſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>]
What do theſe import leſs than this, That
there is no ſalvation poſſible, there is nothing
but certain death and deſtruction, to thoſe
whoſe hearts are not waſhed and made new,
<hi>John 3. 3. Except a man be born again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter into the Kingdom of God. Except ye
be converted, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of
God.</hi> What is the product of this new birth, or
this converſion, but a new creature? Some
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153036:53"/>
there are, it is true, that interpret this Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is made ſo neceſſary to Salvation, to be
nothing elſe but the coming of perſons from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,</hi>
or <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> to the owning
and embracing the Chriſtian Faith.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if this be
true, then all that believe Chriſt to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>
and are baptized, and live in the profeſſion of the
Chriſtian Faith, ſhall be ſaved, Come ye Drunkards,
come ye Adulterers, Lyars, Covetous, with all
the profane Root of Nominal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>riſtians, and keep
an Holy-day to the memory of theſe two Doctors,
who bring you ſuch a large and eaſie Goſpel, as will
carry you all to Heaven, with all your luſts and
lewdneſs upon your backs. But is this true? Is this
Goſpel? Is this all the converſion that is neceſſary
to Salvation? It cannot be: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, There are many that embrace the Chriſtian
Faith that are Hypocrites, and ſhall Hypocrites be
ſaved?</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are many ſuch Converts that
walk diſorderly, <hi>whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory
is their ſhame, who minde earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3. 18.
Of whom the Apoſtle here tell us, that <hi>their end is
deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This inward Holineſſe which the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
ſtands not in ſome ſudden and unconſtant
good thoughts, or ſome tranſient good affections,
but is an <hi>holy frame or habit;</hi> thus much is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in the fore-mentioned expreſſion, <hi>Another
Spirit, a new Heart, a new Creature.</hi> An holy thought,
a good deſire is another thing from a new heart;
they cannot ſo much as evidence, that the heart
is renewed; as in a renewed heart there may be
ſome evil thoughts, and evil luſts ariſing and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:153036:54"/>
working, ſo ſome good thoughts and affections may
ſpring up in an evil heart; true holineſs is not a
fit, but a frame; there may be fits of paſſion, or of
pride, or of envy (too often in a Saint, and yet in the
main he may be a Saint ſtill: There may be fits of
devotion, fits of zeal ſometimes in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inner, and
yet he is a ſinner ſtill. Holineſs is the temper and
conſtitution of a Chriſtian, his new nature that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth
in him.</p>
            <p>3. This inward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>bitual Holineſs ſtands in an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
compliance of the heart with the whole
Will of God; the heart that is formed after the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of God, is conformed to the Will of God, <hi>Pſal.
40. Thy Law is within my heart;</hi> not a piece, but the
whole; every word and tittle of it. The Law is
within me. The Law is ſaid to be within the heart
of a Saint in a double ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e:</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is publiſhed, and revealed, and made
known in the heart; it is underſtood by the ſoul,
there is the light of the Word ſhining in every
Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is embraced, approved, conſented
to, there is the love of the Law in the heart of a
Chriſtian; the heart cloſes with it, and all that it
requires, as a good word, and worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian doth not only accept the Promiſes.
of the Goſpel as good words and comfortable
words, but can heartily write, <hi>Good is the Word of
the Lord,</hi> upon every precept; he likes his Duties
as well as his Priviledges, his work as well as his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
This cowardlineſs of heart is ſet forth in
thoſe expreſſions of a willing mind, a ready mind, a
forward mind. And as his heart is towards his
works, ſo is it for any work the Lord calls it to: he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:153036:54"/>
hath <hi>reſpect to all the Commandments;</hi> he would not
be without one leaf, no nor one line of the whole
Word of God; he is <hi>ready to every good work?</hi> he
would not have one duty abated to him of all that
God hath required; he would not have one ſin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to him of all that God hath forbidden him:
He that ſayes concerning any one word in the whole
will of God, This I muſt have ſtruck out, or be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
within it, ere I can be a Chriſtian, his heart
is not upright: He that would have any one ſin to
be no ſin, any one duty to be no duty, any one ſin
to be allowed him, or any one duty to be abated
him, is no Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>4. This inward habitual Holineſs is ſuch as beares
the ſway, and hath the perheminence in the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though ſin be there ſtill, yet where there is true
Grace, ſin is an underling, and brought into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
it hath loſt that power and intereſt which it
had in the Sould before, and the heart is now given
up to God; the ſtream runs Heavenward, the ſtream
of the thoughts, the ſtream of the affections run
that way; God and the way of Holineſſe hath a
greater ſhare and greater power in the heart than
all the world; there is more love to God, ſtronger
reſolutions for following God, than can be bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced
by the higheſt intereſt of the fleſh. God
and the World ſtand as two ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tors for the heart,
but God carries it from the world; ſo that, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it followed the world with the neglect of
God, now it will follow God with the neglect of
the World; before it would, it may be, mind God
and godlineſs, as far as it could without prejudice
to its worldly intereſt, ſo far as it could with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or eaſe, or ſafety; but now it will mind
the world and its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hly intereſt, ſo far only as is
conſiſtent with godlineſs and a good conſcience;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:153036:55"/>
this is ſincerity, and the cleareſt, and moſt certain
evidence of it. Can we imagin that we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> love God
ſincerely, when we love the World better? whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
we love our eaſe, or credit, or pleaſures, or carna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
friends better? When theſe can do more with us,
and command farther, than God and golry, <hi>Matth.</hi>
10. 37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me,
is not worthy of me.</hi> Luke 14. 33. <hi>Whoſoever he be of
you that forſake not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
If there be any certain unqueſtionable Truths
in the whole Doctine of the Goſpel, this is one of
them, That whoſoever hath true ſaving Grace,
hath more love to God and holineſs, than to all
things elſe whatſoever. Though it be controverted,
Whether common grace and ſaving grace do not
differ more than indegree, yet this is without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
That ſaving grace doth contain in it an
higher degree of love to God, than to all things
elſe.</p>
            <p>5. This inward, habitual, prevailing holineſs,
where ever it is, will infallibly bring forth this ſtrict,
preciſe, and holy life. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That holineſs in the heart will bring forth
holineſs of life, is as naturally certain, as that he
that hath the life and reaſon of a man, will act as a
man; as that a root will bring forth ſuch branches
and fruit, as partake of the kind and nature of the
root, as that a fig-tree will bring forth figs, that an
olive-tree wil bring forth olives.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is as certain, that according to
the proportion of holineſs in the heart, ſuch will
be the proportion of it in the life; if holineſs
bear the ſway in the heart, it will bear the rule in
the life; if that little good that is in the heart, be
held as an underling in the Soul, thereafter will the

in its perfection; and love and longing, will infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
bring forth labouring, and following after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Therefore,</p>
            <p>6. Whoſoever is not truely a perſon of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe

This ſo clearly follows from the former Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that it needs no further proof. He that is not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:153036:56"/>
inwardly, habitually, univerſally ſanctified; he that
loves any thing more than God or godlineſs, that is
he that is not converted and new born, and ſo be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one that favours looſeneſſe and ungodlineſſe; he
will have his time for you, to convince you, and
reprove you out of theſe vain conceits, and make
you know that he hates and deteſts both you and

is a Friend to thoſe holy Ones, which for a time

You will not now be perſwaded, but God will

Iſa. 1. 6. That man is a <hi>great ſinner,</hi> Jer. 17. 9. <hi>The

that were good were very good, and thoſe that

<hi>wicked,</hi> but <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> and in the plural number,
<hi>wickedneſſes:</hi> There is a complication of all ſorts
of wickedneſſes, and ſin is ſo rooted, and (as it

God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the

            <p>2. <hi>That ſin is the greateſt of evils:</hi> The Apoſtle to
ſet forth the formidable appearance that ſin had
by the Law, expreſſes it thus, <hi>Rom. 7. 13. That ſin

more evil and odious to expreſs it by, than it ſelf.
If he had ſaid, that ſin might appear to be a ſnare,
a Serpent, a Viper, a Devil, an Hell that had been
much, but yet not enough to ſet forth this evil of
evils: Sin never is ſeen in its perfect odiouſneſs,
but when it ſhews its own naked face, and looks
like it ſelf: We can never know how great an evil
ſin is, till we know how good the Lord is, how

The unrulineſs and ſtubbornneſs of the wills of

            <p>By how much the more excellent the ſoul is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the body in its nature, by ſo much the more
vile and miſchievous, being depraved with ſin! The
ſoul of man is the <hi>prime ſubject of the image of God</hi>
in man; there was much of God to be ſeen in the
body, or externals of man, but the face of God,
the glory of God was ſtamped upon his ſoul; the

the Devil:</hi> Satan is rudely limb'd, and ſome darker

            <p>3. The Doctrines of <hi>Redemption</hi> is a real Truth:
Need I prove this? That <hi>Chriſt is true;</hi> the true
Meſſiah, true God and true Man; had a true Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and a true Soul; That <hi>his ſayings were true;</hi>
He was a <hi>true Prophet;</hi> That <hi>his ſufferings were true;</hi>
He was a <hi>true Prieſt;</hi> That as he was truly dead, ſo
he as truly roſe, aſcended, and is the Lord, both
of the dead and of the living, and is a <hi>true King;</hi>
That he hath truly and fully accompliſhed his
whole undertaking. Am I ſpeaking to <hi>Jewes</hi> or
<hi>Pagans,</hi> that I need prove this? Am I not ſpeaking
to Chriſtians, who muſt prove themſelves lyars,
their profeſſion a lye, and their faith vain, if they
deny theſe things? But wherefore was all this?
What came Chriſt into the world for? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was he born? Wherefore did he live, dye,
riſe, aſcend? What was the intent of all this?
Why, it was, to make a total and bleſſed change
upon the miſerable condition, of whomſoever of
this ſinful world ſhall embrace and give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him; 'twas to make this old world new;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:153036:65"/>
this crooked world ſtrait, this miſerable world
bleſſed; 'Twas <hi>to bring deliverance to the captives,
and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound,</hi>
Iſa. 61. 1. <hi>To make an end of ſin, to finiſh tranſgreſſion,
and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs,</hi> Dan. 9. 24.
'Twas to undo all that miſchief which ſin and the
Devil hath wrought and brought upon this world,
1 <hi>John 3. 8. For this cauſe the Son of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted,
that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi>
'Twas <hi>to aboliſh death, and bring life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
to light.</hi> 'Twas <hi>to redeem from all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of
good works,</hi> Tit. 2. 14. 'Twas, <hi>that being delivered
from our enemies, we might ſerve him without fear,
in holineſs and righteouſneſs, all the dayes of our
lives,</hi> Luk. 1. 74 75. <hi>That they who live, ſhould not
henceforth live to themſelves, but to him that dyed
for them, and roſe again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 15. Hereupon
ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit. 2. 11, 12. The grace of God,
which bringeth ſalvation, teacheth us, that denying
all ungodlineſs and worldly l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſoberly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi>
And laſtly, to redeem us, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 4. To an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
incorruptible, undefiled, and that fades not
away, reſerved in heaven for us. 1. To an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
Chriſtians are not brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and redeemed from their houſe of bondage, and
then left to ſhift for themſelves, or to periſh in
the wilderneſs, they are redeemed to <hi>an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
they are a <hi>purchaſed people,</hi> and there is
for them a <hi>purchaſed poſſeſſion.</hi> 2. An <hi>incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and undefiled inheritance,</hi> an enduring poſſeſſion,
and an <hi>holy habitation.</hi> Holineſs is a great part
of the bleſſedneſs of the Saints. Sinners, you
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:153036:65"/>
that deſpiſe holineſs, deſpiſe one of the riche ſtjew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
in the Crown of glory. 3. <hi>Reſerved in heaven;</hi>
there's the good land where their inheritance lies;
that's the Country which Chriſt hath purchaſed for
his ranſomed ones; <hi>The whole land is theirs, theirs is
the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that Redemption which by the Goſpel is
preached unto you; and if Chriſt had failed of
performing and accompliſhing of any of all this,
he had been but an incompleat and imperfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
            <p>By the way, learn what great reaſon there is, that
the Goſpel ſhould have better entertainment, than
for the moſt part it meets withal in the world; one
would think, who conſiders what entertainment it
hath, and the Miniſtry of it, that it were ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
word, and a dreadful errand that it came upon;
if Chriſt had come to deſtroy the world, could he
have had leſs welcome? If the Goſpel were as the
Law, not only a <hi>dead, but a killing Leter, a Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Death and Condemnation:</hi> If the Miniſters of
the Goſpel had been Meſſengers ſent up from the
bottomleſs Pit, to <hi>deceive the Nations,</hi> to deſtroy
Souls, to drag them down to everlaſting darkneſs,
there could hardly have been a greater hate and
out-cry, then there is againſt it and them. Surely
ſuch a meſſage, and ſuch meſſengers, deſerve bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
welcome, and better uſage.</p>
            <p>But to our purpoſe; You have heard what that
Redemption is, which the Goſpel brings us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Now doth Chriſt do his work by haives? Deliver
out of Priſon, and leave his ranſomed Ones in
their vile Priſon-garments; change their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and never change their Conditions,
redeem them from death, and not redeem them
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:153036:66"/>
from iniquity? Was this the intent of Chriſt in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for ſinners; that they might play the beaſts and
the rebels more ſecurely? Did this grace abound,
that ſin might ſuper-abound? Doth the law of faith,
make void the law of righteouſneſs? Doth it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
it? What's the import of thoſe ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
forementioned; <hi>That he might redeem from
all iniquity, and purifie a peculiar people zealous of good
works, that we might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs
and righteouſneſs; that they that live, ſhould not live
to themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to him that dyed for them, that denying
all ungodlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. Is not all this included in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
which Chriſt hath wrought? And what
doth all this import other, then that godlineſs we
are pleading for? Is this a part of that which
Chriſt hath redeemed us to, and is there nothing
in it? Hath Chriſt ſweat, and groaned, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and travel'd in pain, and all this to bring forth
a lye? Hath he dyed to purge, and purifie, and waſh,
and cleanſe his people, and when all comes to all,
at this nothing but a cheat? Did Chriſt dye but in
conceit, and ariſe and aſcend but in conceit? As
certain as it is that Chriſt did not barely perſonate
a Redeemer, ſo certain it is, that his redeemed do
not barely perſonate Saints. Let all the world be
Judges, what honour thoſe perſons have for Chriſt,
that have no better opinion of the fruits of his
Death. Hence it appears.</p>
            <p>1. That the Redemption of a ſinner, is the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ſin; Chriſt dyed to ſave men from their
ſins, not in them, to redeem from iniquity all as
well as from wrath.</p>
            <p>2. That Redemption and Regeneration are
linked together: He that is bought from being a

Redemption of Chriſt.</p>

Chriſt? Hope to be ſaved by Chriſt, and refuſe
to be ſanctified: Will Chriſt redeem thoſe from the
Curſe, who will not be redeemed from iniquity?
Jer. 7. 9. <hi>Will ye ſteal and murther, and commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
and ſwear falſly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And come and ſtand

            <p>You muſt count Chriſt to be no Chriſt, no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
or but an half, or deceitful Redeemer, if
you count your ſelves good Chriſtians while you
are yet in your ſins. You muſt have another Chriſt,
another Goſpel, ere ever you can be ſaved in your
ſinful ſtate, Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to
them which are in Jeſus Chriſt, who walk not after
the fleſh, but after the Spirit:</hi> This is Goſpel,
wherein you have the Redeemeds Charter, and
the Redeemeds Character: His Charter, <hi>He ſhall
not come into condemnation,</hi> His Character, <hi>He
walks not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit;</hi> that
is, He is a man of a godly life. Whom doth the
Goſpel ſecure from condemnation? Why, thoſe
that are in Chriſt. But who are they? Why, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe who walk not after the fleſh, but after
the Spirit: thoſe that walk otherwiſe can have
no benefit by the Goſpel. You all ſtand as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed

malefactors guilty of death; you have ſinned,
and what have you to ſay, why you ſhould not dye,
and have your ſentence of condemnation paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you? May be you will call for a <hi>Pſalm of mercy,
my Book, Lord, my Book,</hi> the Goſpel will, I hope, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
me. No ſinner, thou canſt not have it, thou
art one that <hi>liveſt after the fleſh,</hi> and canſt not have
the benefit of the Goſpel. This is the Law, and the
Goſpel ſays not one word to reverſe it; <hi>If ye live
after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye:</hi> Chriſt never intended the
benefit of his Redemption to any of you, whether
you would repent or no, be holy or no: you may
as well write for Goſpel this, <hi>He that believeth ſhall
be damned,</hi> as this, <hi>He that obeyeth not the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall
be ſaved:</hi> And you may as well ſay, that <hi>ſinning is

obey the Goſpel.</hi>

            <p>1. That there is ſuch a grace as Regeneration,
and that neceſſary to ſalvation, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 3. Verily,

            </p>
            <p>2. That the change that is wrought by Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is a great and a mighty change; it is as
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:153036:68"/>
great as the making ſomething of nothing: Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
is a <hi>new Creation;</hi> it is as great as the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
up of perſons from death to life. Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is a <hi>Reſurrection: You hath he quicked, who were
dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> Eph. 2. 1. There is as great
a power, as much of Divinity manifeſted in quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a dead ſoul, as in raiſing a dead body. When
God would confirm the faith of the <hi>Jews</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Converſion and Reſtauration, after their
cutting off, which the Apoſtle tells us ſhall be as
<hi>life from the dead;</hi> he evidences that he was able to
accompliſh it by his making dry bones to live: <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi>

there was a great ſhaking, and bone came to his
bone, and they were covered with ſinews, and with fleſh,
and the breath of life was breathed into them and they
ſtood upon their feet a great Army: Theſe bones, ſaith
the Lord, are the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah. That is,
as they lay in their ſtate of rejection from God;
and if the Lord could not have made the bones
to live, he had failed of his confirmation of their
faith, touching the Redemption of this dead
people.</p>
            <p>When the Miniſters of the Goſpel are ſent forth
to preach to ſinners, it is even as likely a ſervice,
as if they had been ſent among the Tombs and
the Graves, to propheſie to the Skulls, and the
Bones, and the duſt of the dead? And if there
were not a Divine and Almighty power accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
their Miniſtry, their ſucceſſe would be the

little Children, of whom I travel in birth, untill Chriſt

            </p>
            <p>1. That the reſult of this union with Chriſt is
a <hi>new Life,</hi> 1 John 5. 12. He that hath the <hi>Son</hi> hath
Life, <hi>Generatio unius eſt corruptio alterius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Generation there is a Death and a
Life.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>Death,</hi> Coloſ. 3. 3. <hi>Ye are dead,</hi> that is,
Your ſins are dead, your old man is dead; <hi>Our old
man is crucified with him,</hi> Rom. 6.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>Life:</hi> There is new ſenſe and motion,
there is a living power communicated to ſouls uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Chriſt, whereby they are enabled to move
and act in ſuch an holy, ſpiritual and heavenly
way, as was impoſſible before. Grace is a living
thing, that ſpirits, and animates all the Faculties
a new, that puts life into all the duties and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
of the Saints; which though for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them they might have been done before, yet
they were but the dead carcaſſes of duties, rather
than the things themſelves.</p>
            <p>2. This new Life is a <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w Nature;</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi>
participation of the Nature of Chriſt, a change
of the qualities of the ſoul: they are <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
that have paſſed the <hi>new Birth:</hi> The ſecond
<hi>Adam</hi> as well as the firſt brings forth his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in his own likeneſs: The <hi>divine Birth</hi> is
the bringing forth of the <hi>divine Nature: 2 Pet.</hi>
1. 4. As they ſaid vainly, <hi>the Gods are come down
in the likeneſs of men:</hi> It may be here ſaid truly;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:153036:69"/>
Men are raiſed up in the likeneſs of God, renewed
after his Image, made partakers of his holineſs:
Thoſe that put any thing leſs in this charge than
the new creature, make Regeneration to be as very
a contradiction as the Popiſh Tranſubſtantiation.
Bread is made a God, and yet bread is ſtill: a brute
is made a Saint, and yet remains a brute ſtill. A God
under the accidents of bread, and a Saint under the
qualities of a Swine.</p>
            <p>3. This new nature is a <hi>glorious nature,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
in it that <hi>divine light,</hi> whereby the Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
are inabled to underſtand and look into the depths
of eternity, the inviſible things of God, the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the glorious Goſpel, that <hi>divine love,</hi> and
faith, and hope, and the whole train of glorious
graces, together with thoſe <hi>principles of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
Truth, Mercy, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby they are
made capable of injoying fellowſhip and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God, of bearing his Name, ſhewing forth his
Vertues and Praiſes before the world, and doing
his will: In ſum, it is the Image of God, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of Chriſt written upon the Tables of their
hearts: And thus much thoſe Scriptural expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>New creatures, partakers of the Divine Nature,
partakers of his holineſs, children of light,</hi> with the
life, do ſignifie and import.</p>
            <p>What a ſtrange piece of vanity ſhould we
make of the Scriptures, if all theſe high and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
expreſſions ſhould ſignifie no more than that
empty and pitiful thing that carnal men do count
their Religion, or godlineſs, that ever that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
Sottiſh, formal, brutiſh generation,
which have no more of the knowledge of God
than an Heathen, no more of the life of God
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153036:69"/>
than a Stock, no more of Religion, than to ſay
over a Prayer by rote; So far from being parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the new Nature that they know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any ſuch thing, or what it is: That
ever ſuch a blind, ſenſeleſs multitude ſhould be
imagined to be the perſons whom the Scripture
means, by <hi>new Creatures, the Children of God, the
Children of Light, the Images of God:</hi> Much more
that thoſe that live after the fleſh, who are proud,
covetous, ſenſual, filthy, beaſtly in their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet if they have been baptized, and paſſed
under that ſacramental Regeneration, and do but
ſay, now and then, <hi>I repent,</hi> or <hi>God forgive me,</hi> that
theſe alſo are the children of God, and have all
that new Birth which is neceſſary to their ſeeing
the Kingdom of God, Who can with any colour of
reaſon imagine? Such as can make themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this, have made ſuch a forfeiture of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
that they may be like in time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that <hi>the Devil is God, and that Hell is Heaven;</hi>
and may even take up the Alcoran for their Bible,
and let the Scriptures go for a Fable.</p>
            <p>Sinners, conſider with your ſelves, is there any
ſuch thing as the new Birth? Can there be a New
Birth, without a New Life? Doth Chriſt bring forth
<hi>Dead Children,</hi> or do dry bones live? Doth the
Goſpel bring forth <hi>monſtrous births,</hi> Children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
eyes, without an head, without an heart, or
with the heart of a beaſt under the face of a man?
Doth it bring forth Serpents, Vipers, Dogs, Swine,
for its Children, and muſt the Kingdom of Heaven
be peopled with ſuch Inhabitants as theſe? If
theſe be the Children of the Kingdom, where or
who are the Children of this World? are the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniels,</hi>
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, in whom there is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:153036:70"/>
no guile: Are theſe the true ſeed, and the Saints
ſpurious? are theſe the ſons, and the Saints baſtards?</p>
            <p>Or if you will let theſe vile ones of the earth go
as none of the ſeed; take the beſt of carnal men, that
have the faireſt face of Religion, and form of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
without the in-ſide, the new nature; are theſe
they? Is the ſhadow the ſubſtance, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
but a ſhadow? To ſay that the inward life
of godlineſs, the ſpirit and ſoul of Chriſtianity, is
but a conceit, and this out-ſide is all, this Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
is as good reaſon, as to affirm, that a picture
is a man, and that a living man is but a picture; and
as good Divinity as I my ſelf heard Preached at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
about thirty years ſince, by a zealous Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
for the lawfulneſs of Sports on the Lords
Day; who Preaching about the obſervation of the
Sabbath, and diſtinguiſhing betwixt the Subſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and the Circumſtantial duties of that day, ſaid,
That <hi>Preaching is a Religious Ceremony, Praying is a
Religious Ceremony, but bowing at the Name of Jeſus,
ſtanding at the Creed and Goſpel, Holy and Religious
Feaſting, Holy and Religous Dancing; theſe are the
Substantials.</hi> Hence it follows,</p>
            <p>1. That Regeneration is not a <hi>Suppoſitious</hi> change,
or the counterfeit of a change; there is ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
hereby put betwixt perſons and perſons;
the Regenerate and the Unregenerate are not one
and the ſame, no more than the living and the
dead.</p>
            <p>2. It is not a bare <hi>Relative</hi> change, as Juſtification
and Adoption are held to be; there is a change of
nature wrought by it, and not barely of Relation.</p>
            <p>3. It is not a <hi>Superficial</hi> change, or meerly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that goes only skin-deep; it is not, as 'tis
ſaid concerning Baptiſm, only <hi>the waſhing away
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:153036:70"/>
of the filth of the fleſh,</hi> the cleanſing of the out-ſide,
and leaving luſt to reign within: Regeneration is
the change of the man, and not barely of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>4. In this change we may read all godlineſs, we
may read the uſe of things very much in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
we may know wherefore they are much the
better, if we underſtand what they are; Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
may he read in his operations; we may
underſtand much of our work, by obſerving Gods
work upon us: As God, in making men <hi>living ſouls,</hi>
does thereby tell us, he expects other things from
them, than from dead <hi>ſtocks and ſtones;</hi> and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them <hi>reaſonable ſouls,</hi> intimates, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
they ſhould live other lives than <hi>dogs</hi> or <hi>ſwine,</hi>
ſo in making them Chriſtians, making them parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the Divine Nature, he makes it evident, that
he expects they ſhould live another life than <hi>other
men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new life, or life of godlineſs, may be read
in our new birth, or new natures: The Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
are ſaid, <hi>Eph. 2. 10. To be created in Chriſt Jeſus
unto good works, which God had before ordained that
they ſhould walk in them: Created unto good works,</hi>
that notes two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Intended to good works.</item>
               <item>2. Fitted to good works.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. That in their new making, they were intended
to good works, this was Gods minde and meaning,
he fore-ordained that they ſhould walk in them:
He did not ſet up ſuch a light in man to be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a buſhel; he beſtowed not ſuch a talent on man,
to be bound up in a Napkin.</p>
            <p>2. That in their new making, they were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:153036:71"/>
to good works, <hi>created to good works,</hi> that is,
they were brought forth in ſuch an holy nature,
indued with ſuch a Divine light, ſuch holy princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
powers, affections, diſpoſitions, and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as fitted them for an holy active life; And
this Divine, and excellent ſtructure of this new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
do both ſignifie what life it is intended to;
and that this life to which it is intended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is indeed
an excellent life; there is ſomething ſure in this
godly life; God did not new make men for nothing;
and ſomething of worth and real excellency, or
elſe he would not have been at ſuch coſt in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
men for it; if there were no other godly life,
than that which the carnal world count godlineſs,
there needed no new Creation to fit men for it,
What is there in the whole frame of the Religion
of the vulgar, but a carnal man may reach to? For
the devotional part of it, <hi>Saying, or hearing of a
prayer, obſerving of dayes, rites and cuſtomes,</hi> &amp;c. What
great difficulty is there in that? <hi>May not a Publican
do the ſame?</hi> Yea, may not a Harlot, a Drunkard, an
Idiot do the ſame? Such devotions will neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
their luſts, nor yet will their luſts diſtate or
diſable ſuch devotions; and for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it, <hi>to love thoſe that love them, to be good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
to be no Extortioners, no Adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. there is
not ſo very much in that, <hi>do not even the Phariſees do
the ſame? What do you more than others?</hi> ſaid Chriſt to
his Diſciples. What ſingular or excellent thing
do you? God hath done ſingularly well by you; you
are fearfully and wonderfully made (as 'tis true
of the natural, ſo much more of your new birth)
and curiouſly wrought, not in the lower parts
of the earth, but in the higheſt heavens; you
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:153036:71"/>
are born from above, God hath done more for you
than for others; what do you more than others?
Some it may be would have anſwered, What do
you more than others? Why, there's no more to be
done, all that's done more than others do, is meer
fancy or conceit: But beloved, when you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ſapleſs, lifeleſs empty way of Religion,
which others are content with, methinks your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhould demand, What hath God new-made me,
made me partaker of the Divine Nature, of the life
of God, for no more but this? hath God given ſuch
a glorious Goſpel, raiſed up ſuch a mighty Saviour,
who hath ſhed ſuch precious blood, ſent forth ſuch
a glorious ſpirit, given commiſſion to ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of heavenly Ambaſſadors, to Preach, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
beſeech, exhort, to travel in birth with me,
till Chriſt hath been formed in me, and all this, to
bring me to no better a life than this? Surely there
is ſomething farther, that the Lord hath been at all
this coſt, and built this ſtructure for.</p>
            <p>Study this new birth, ſtudy the new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Creation
more throughly, and if you ſee not the moſt holy,
heavenly, ſpiritual converſation that is pleaded for
radically and ſeminally in the bowels of it, then
let godlineſs paſs for a fancy for ever. Let the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
but live according to their new nature,
and if that be not the very godly life we contend
with you about, then call us what you will.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Faith</hi> is no fancy, <hi>Hebr. 11. 1. Faith is the
ground, or the ſubſiſtence of things hoped for, and the
evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> It hath a ſure foundation

its Foundation, partly on the <hi>Word of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them,</hi> partly on the <hi>Work of God within them:</hi>
And <hi>this Faith,</hi> or rather this Act of Faith, if the
former hath been firſt put forth, is ſuch alſo, as will
never deceive. As thoſe that truſt in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have the Word and Oath of God, <hi>in
which two immutable things, it is impoſſible for God
to lye,</hi> ſhall not be confounded, but have ſtrong
conſolation: So thoſe that believe they ſhall be
ſaved, becauſe they find their <hi>hearts</hi> purified; who
believe that their <hi>names</hi> are written in Heaven,
becauſe they find the Law and Image of God
written. and engraven in their <hi>hearts,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that they ſhall not come into condemnation,
becauſe they are in Chriſt, and walk not after the
fleſh, but after the Spirit, who believe they ſhall
overcome death, becauſe they have overcome the
World; that they ſhall reap in mercy, becauſe
they have ſown in righteouſneſſe; that they ſhall
reap in joy, becauſe they have ſown in tears;
that they ſhall receive the inheritance of <hi>Sons,</hi>
becauſe they have received the Adoption of <hi>Sons;</hi>
who finding themſelves firmly knit and joyned
to the Lord, are <hi>perſwaded, that neither Death,
nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:153036:72"/>
nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor
depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate
them from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus their
Lord.</hi> Thoſe, that on ſuch grounds as theſe, believe
they ſhall be ſaved, it ſhall certainly be unto them,
according to their faith; if it be thus with them
indeed; if they be in Chriſt; if they walk not after
the fleſh, but after the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>it; if their hearts be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
&amp;c. The Word of the Lord ſtands good and
ſure to them, that they ſhall not come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
and they ſhall as infallibly be ſaved,
as if their particular names had been written in
the promiſes: The veracity of God ſtands as firmly
engaged to make good conditional promiſes, where
the condition is fulfilled, as if the promiſe had been
abſolute.</p>
            <p>There is a faith which is a meer fancy. The faith

The faith of the profane, who believe they ſhall be

            <p>6. The Doctrine concerning <hi>Good Works,</hi> is a
certain truth. In this I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What we are to underſtand by <hi>Good Works;</hi>
A good work in general, is an holy,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or gracious
action; to the making up whereof th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe <hi>four things</hi>
are neceſſary.</p>
            <p>1. The principle muſt be good from which it
proceeds, it muſt be from an honeſt and upright
heart, for a pure conſcience, from faith unfeigned,
<hi>&amp;c. Mat. 12. 35. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>2. The matter muſt be good; ſomething that is
commended, <hi>Micah 6. 8. He hath ſhewed thee, O
man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:153036:73"/>
of thee?</hi> Iſa. 29. 13. <hi>Their fear towards me, wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

taught by the precepts of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The form or manner of doing muſt be good,
it muſt be well done; this takes in the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ideration
of all its circumſtances, of time, place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The end muſt be good, it muſt be done to the
glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
            <p>As to the particular kinds of <hi>Good Works,</hi> they
are not eaſily to be reckon'd up: The <hi>Papiſts</hi> talk
little of any <hi>good works,</hi> but the exerciſes of
<hi>bounty and liberality,</hi> in giving Alms, feeding the
hungry, cloathing the naked, viſiting and relieving
the afflicted, building of Almeſ-houſes, Colledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the like; upon which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ufiſt ſo much, as if
there were ſcarce any other <hi>good works,</hi> but ſuch as
theſe; but we may not confine them within ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a compaſs. Good works do ſignifie the ſame
with a good life, or a godly life; the doing and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
all things which God hath commanded us:
Our living holily, honeſtly, circumſpectly, fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
imports the ſame with our doing good works;
the exerciſing of all the graces of Chriſt, faith, love,
hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſubduing and mortifying of luſt and
corruption, the governing our hearts, the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our tongues, the ordering of our carriages
towards God, and towards men; all acts of
Religion, Righteouſneſs, Mercy, Charity, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Faſting, Hearing, Sanctifying the Sabbath,
Lending, Giving, Forgiving, Peace-making,
Inſtructing, Exhorting, Reproving, Denying
our ſelves, taking up our Croſs, following Chriſt,
Fighting the good fight of Faith, laying up
treaſure in heaven, and the like: theſe are good
works; every thing is a <hi>good work,</hi> concerning
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:153036:74"/>
which God will ſay at laſt, <hi>Well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servant:</hi> In all theſe the Lord requires,</p>
            <p>1. That we act, <hi>Ad extremum virium,</hi> to our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
<hi>Eccleſ. 9. 10. What thine hand findeth to do,</hi> and
ſo what thy head, or thy heart findeth to do, <hi>do it
with thy might,</hi> Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Zealous of good works,</hi> Rom.
12. 14. <hi>Not ſloathful in buſineſs, but ſervent in ſpirit,
ſerving the Lord,</hi> Col. 1. 10. <hi>Fruitful in good works,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. ult. <hi>Abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That we act in theſe, <hi>Ad extremum vitae;</hi> to
the end of our dayes, <hi>Deut. 6. 2. Fear the Lord thy
God, and keep all his ſtatutes, and his Commandments
all the dayes of thy life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That we be doing, <hi>Per totum vitae curſum,</hi>
without intermiſſion; there muſt not only be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,
but a <hi>continuance in well-doing,</hi> Rom. 2. God
will not have any Chaſms or vacuities in our lives,
but every day muſt be filled up with the duties of
it; Chriſtians muſt not thin of getting to heaven,
<hi>perſaltum,</hi> they muſt not leap, but walk; they muſt
not leap over a duty, nor leap over a day, <hi>nulla
dies, fine linea.</hi> The Law of God doth not allow
a day to ſin, not abate us one dayes work. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a breathing time from the ſervice of God, is
to deſire ſo much time for the ſervice of ſin. We are
ever ſerving one Maſter, or the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ſerving ſin, when we are not in one way or
other, ſerving the Lord.</p>
            <p>

to ſalvation a ſo as though we are not like
to be ſaved by our works, yet we cannot be ſaved
without them. He that works not, ſhall not eat

7. 21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall

Will of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> Faith cannot
ſave us without works: The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.
26. <hi>Faith without works is dead;</hi> and a dead faith
cannot bring us to life. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>

               </gap>his is it, <hi>That they which

to men.</p>
            <p>Now let me demand of all the world, where lies
the <hi>Phanaticiſme</hi> in any of all this? Which of theſe
Doctrines is it that is but a conceit? Is it this, that
<hi>Chriſtians muſt not onely be believers, but must do good
wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

of their time on the Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all on God? Or is
this the conceit, <hi>That this well-doing is neceſſary to
our well-being?</hi> Let this be granted, that there is no
fancy in all this, and I have at once diſpatched my
whole undertaking, and if <hi>I</hi> had no more to ſay,
have ſufficiently made it good to you, that ſtrict
godlineſſe is no fancy. For this doctrine of good
works, which <hi>I</hi> have laid before you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>this is Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
godlineſſe in the greateſt ſeverity and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of it; grant a neceſſity of ſuch a life as this,
and you grant all that is deſired. And can any of
this be denied? Muſt we ſerve the Lord? To be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good is the ſame with ſerving God. Muſt we
ſerve the Lord only, and wholly, may not ſin claim
a ſhare, and now and then ſomething to be done for
the Devil? Muſt we ſerve the Lord with all our might,
or may leſs ſerve? Conſider that Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.
10. <hi>When you have done all that you can, ſay, we are
unprofitable ſervants, we have done no more than is our
duty to do.</hi> When we have given unto God all that we
owe him, then let the fleſh and the Devil take the
reſt.</p>
            <p>Beloved, conſider what I have ſaid, and obſerve
whether all that diligence, faithfulneſs, zeal, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and preciſeneſs, which the ſtricteſt Chriſtians
either do or profeſs, be not included in theſe three
things, to ſerve the Lord with all our might, to the
end of our dayes, and in a conſtant and continued
courſe of godlineſs.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now that you ſee that little weight or

We need not fear any exceſs where we feel ſo many

barrenneſs, and we will joyn with you in the charge:

before I proceed any farther, to turn aſide a little, and
make ſome ſtay upon the conſideration hereof, and
to ſhew you in what ſenſe the will may be accepted
where the work is not done.</p>
            <p>There is a queſtion put amongſt the School-men,
whether a will to ſin where the Act follows not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts
not as great a guilt in the ſight of God, as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:153036:76"/>
both the will and the Act: and <hi>Durandus</hi> determines
it thus, The reaſon why the will to ſin brings not
forth the Act, may be twofold, either <hi>Propter incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletam
&amp; imperſectam voluntatem,</hi> becauſe the will is
not ſo fully and peremptorily reſolved &amp; ſet upon it,
or elſe, <hi>Propter impedimentum aliquod,</hi> becauſe though
the will be fully reſolved upon it, yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that hinders the execution, as it may be, want
of power, or opportunity to commit it: now in the
firſt caſe ſays he, where the reaſon of the nor acting
the ſin, is the incompleatneſs of the Will: ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the
will without the act is not as great a ſin as the will
and act together: but if the will were ſo fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that it would have brought forth the act, if it had
not been hindred, there the guilt is as great, if the ſin
be not committed, as if it had been committed.</p>
            <p>There may be uſe of this to the determining the

will is ſo ſtrongly ſet upon a duty, as that it would
have brought forth the performance, had it not been
for ſome invincible hindrance, it ſhall not fail of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance;
the reaſon is, becauſe where the defect is
not in the will God hath the heart, and whereſoever
God hath the heart, there is certain acceptance
with God: where the heart is ingaged againſt any
particular luſt, and is reſolved upon it, this luſt I
muſt mortifie, and through the help of God will ſeek
its deſtruction, though it cannot yet compaſs it, yet
this reſolution evidences, that the heart is on Gods
ſide; it doth not ſide with luſt againſt God, but

The poor Widow, that caſt in her Mite into the
Treaſury, which was all ſhe had; 'twas a ſign ſhe had
a large heart, though ſhe gave ſo ſmall a gift, 1 <hi>King.</hi>

How may it be known that <hi>David</hi> would indeed (if he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:153036:78"/>
might) have built it? why, by this it appeared,
though he might not do it, yet he did what he might
towards it; though he might not build, yet he
prepared materials for the building. If thou art
but a babe in Chriſt, haſt had but a little time,
haſt yet but a little underſtanding, a little ſtrength;
though thou canſt not follow the Lord in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe,
not attain to ſuch a fruitful life, as thoſe
that are grown and experienced Chriſtians have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to, yet if whilſt thou art <hi>but a child,</hi> tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thou art <hi>weak</hi> as a child, but yet art <hi>tractable</hi> as a
child, willing to be led where thou canſt not go:
if it be thus with thee, thou netdſt not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged;
he that whilſt he is but a child, does
follow God as a child according to his meaſure,
,tis a ſign that if he were a man, he would follow
him as a man.</p>
            <p>If you labour under any luſt, or violent paſſion,
which it may be flows from your <hi>natural complexion,</hi>
or bodily conſtitution, which whenever its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and ſtirred, you are not able to ſtand before it:
and notwithſtanding, you know it is your duty to
mortifie and crucifie it, yet ſtill this is your caſe, that
though it be matter of great grief to you, and as a
continual thorn in your fleſh, and it be the longing
deſire of your ſoul to have it deſtroyed, yet you can
do little to it; in this caſe,</p>
            <p>1. If your will to be rid of it, bring forth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
watching and praying againſt it; if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
overcome it, yet you are fighting againſt it; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

2. Your ſtriving again it be not altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſucceſs, but brings forth ſome actual reſtraint
of it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as to thoſe outward acts by which it would

you reſtrain in ſome meaſure your tongue from ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

               </gap> in any angry words: or if you cannot
overcome your inward pride, yet you do forbear
thoſe ſelf-exalting words, and vain boaſtings,
&amp;c. by which that luſt is ſomented; if your heart
be ſo ſet againſt it, that it thus ſtrives againſt the
luſt within, and does ordinarily reſtrain ſome of
its outward actings, you may be ſure, that if you
could have your will, it ſhould not be ſuffered to
lodge one night more within you.</p>
            <p>If you have a ſloathful heart, and are naturally,
or by occaſion of any bodily diſtemper, dull, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and unactive, and are ſtill wiſhing for a more
active, lively ſpirit, but cannot attain it; yet
though your heart be heavy and ſleepy, you will
not let it ſleep in quiet, but are frequently jogging,
and awakening it, by the moſt ſtirring and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
conſiderations; if you endeavour to ſerve the
Lord with the beſt you have, if what you want in
quickneſs and ſprightfulneſs, you labour to make
up in ſeriouſneſs, though you make on by a ſlow
pace, yet you do go on, why, then know that
you have to do with a God, that knows and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
your frame, and in this caſe alſo wil accept you,
according to what you have, and not according to
what you have not.</p>
            <p>3. If there be ſome Duties that you are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to, yet if you be faithful in others, that you
can do; if you have not an almes, to give to one
that's poor, yet you can give counſel to him, and
therein ſhew kindneſs to his ſoul; if you can't
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:153036:79"/>
ſo well compoſe your thoughts to any fixed medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but are unavoidably perplexed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedneſs
and diſtractions, yet you can pray, or
you can ſpend the more time in reading; do you
do that? If you cannot ſo profitably, or to ſo much
ſpiritual advantage, improve Chriſtian ſociety,
do you do the more in private, in your more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
and immediate converſe with God. If you
want courage or boldneſs to appear for God, in
exhorting or reproving others, eſpecially ſuch as
are above you, yet you have families wherein you
can be bold; what do you do there? to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to your ſervants? Do you inſtruct them,
warn and reprove them, &amp;c. though (as before)
you can't extend mercy to others in their needs
(having not wherewithal) yet are you juſt, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and honeſt, and peaceable in your dealings
with, and carriage towards all? If you are juſt,
and would be merciful, if you had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal?
if you are profitable in your converſing
with your families, and would be ſo to others, if
you could get up to courage and boldneſs: if you
are ſerious, and ſpiritual, and affectionate in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and have a will to be ſo in ſociety that's an
Argument, that your will would bring forth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
there alſo, if it were not hindred.</p>
            <p>4. If at ſuch times, when there are not ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
we then do, what at another time we
cannot; that which we cannot do at ſome times, as
in ſickneſs, or in times of deſertion or temptation,
may be done at another time, when we are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch diſadvantages.</p>
            <p>Now gather up all theſe together, and then the
queſtion will eaſily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay have ground to conclude, that his ſpirit is
ſincerely willing, though his fleſh be weak, and
that this willing mind is accepted with God, as if it

Let theſe following Scriptures be examined, and

               </gap>uing in well doing, ſeek for glory,
honour and immortality, eternal life, but to them
that are contentious, and obey not the truth, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
unrighteouſneſſe, indignation, and wrath, tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:153036:81"/>
and anguiſh, upon every ſoul of man that doth evil;
of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile.</p>
            <p>The words refer to the laſt Judgment, as appears
by the former part of them, <hi>Who ſhall render,</hi> &amp;c.
In the following part, we have the dividing of
the Sheep from the Goats; which are both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
and have their diſtinct rewards appointed
to them.</p>
            <p>1. We have a deſcription of the Sheep, and what
their reward ſhall be; and by their deſcription, theſe
Sheep ſhould be the very ſame with <hi>Preciſians,</hi> or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect
Chriſtians:</p>
            <p>1. They are ſuch as ſeek for glory, and honour,
and immortality; that is, that ſeek for a portion of
glory and immortality in the world to come: They
leave the Kingdoms of this world to be ſhared among
the men of this world, and ſeek for that Kingdom
which cannot be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>2. They are well-doers, good men, and holy men,
men of a good and holy life.</p>
            <p>3. They continue in well-doing, they are not good
for a fit, but it is the way of their life.</p>
            <p>4. They patiently continue: Patience is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
            <p>1. Of Labour, they do not complain, nor are
weary of their work, but buckle to it. Or,</p>
            <p>2. Of Sufferings; they can bear as well as doe.
Or,</p>
            <p>3. Of Delay; they are content to ſtay for their
reward till hereafter; let others take their portions
and their rewards here, they are content to ſtay for
theirs till hereafter.</p>
            <p>This is the deſcription of the Sheep; and of all
the men in the world, who ſhould theſe Sheep be: Can
they be any other men then thoſe godly men, that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:153036:81"/>
have been laid open to you? Well, but what is the
Reward, which in the Judgement the Lord will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to theſe? Why, it is eternal Life, eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and bleſſedneſs: to them <hi>that by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in well-doing,</hi> &amp;c. he will render eternal Life.
This is true, Sinners, this is no conceit, it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
truth, and ſuch a truth as you yourſelves muſt
be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieve, before ever you can come to good <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.
<hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe that God is, and that
he is a rewarder of them that (diligently) ſeek him.</hi> Mark
it, of them that (<hi>diligently</hi>) ſeek him. They are
the ſame men you ſee, that are ſpoken of here,
and in the former Scripture: of theſe God is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder;
that is, with a ſpecial and glorious reward,
that is neceſſary to be underſtood. God hath rewards
for the ungodly: You that are proud, &amp; perſecutors,
and deſpiſers of God, and his wayes, God will
reward you all for all your doings, but he hath a
bleſſed reward for thoſe that ſeek him: And thus
ſaith the Text, <hi>Every one that cometh to God muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
Sinners you will not be perſwaded now but
theſe people are fooliſh, ſelf-deluding people, and
that the Heaven, the Joy, the Glory, and the Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
they feed themſelves with the hope of, is only in
their own fancies: but yet, if ever you come to any
thing, if ever you be brought home to God, this is
that which you (muſt) believe, That God is a Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and a glorious Rewarder of them that <hi>diligently</hi>
ſeek him. Thus we have the deſcription of the Sheep,

They are deſcribed,</p>
            <p>1. By their Contention.</p>
            <p>2. By their Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>1. By their Contention: There is a twofold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>

            <p>2. By this conqueſt or victory in this conteſt after
all the ſtrivings of God with them, they ſtill ſtand it

of <hi>Four Laws</hi> contending one againſt another,
whereof <hi>Two</hi> are on one ſide and <hi>Two</hi> on the other;
<hi>The Law of God, the Law of the Mind, the Law of

            <p>To enumerate and reckon up all theſe corrupt

ſome of the chief of them, in number <hi>Ten;</hi>
which, if you will, you may call, <hi>The Devils Ten
Commandements.</hi>

is the firſt and great Commandment, on which
all the reſt hang, and to which they ſerve, and is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:153036:83"/>
the ſame as, <hi>be thine own God,</hi> thine own Idol.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Let thy Will be thy Law.</hi> Thou art thine own, thy
Tongue is thine own, thy Time is thine own, thy

knows what ſhall be hereafter? <hi>Eat and drink, for
tomorrow thou dieſt;</hi> be merry while thou mayeſt,
ſpend whilſt thou haſt it; make Hay while the Sun
ſhines; Death comes, and there is an end of all thy
mirth.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Stand faſt in the liberties of thy Fleſh.</hi> Come not
into boudage; be not a voluntary ſlave to a ſtrict
and reſtrained life, when thou mayeſt, if thou wilt,
uſe thine own liberty.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Continue in ſin, becauſe Grace hath abounded.</hi>
Chriſt died for ſinners, God is merciful, why ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
thou then fear to take thy courſe?</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Do as others do.</hi> Go along with the multitude,
faſhion thy ſelf to the times, be not ſingular: Why
ſhouldeſt thou think thy ſelf wiſer than others?</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Do no more in Roligion than needs.</hi> Be not Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
over-much; be not over-forward; a little
Faith, a little Repentance will ſerve thy turn.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Do not trouble thy ſelf about ſmall offences.</hi>
Thoughts are free: Words are but things of courſe:
What man man is there that lives and ſins not?
What ſhouldeſt thou keap ſuch a do about thy ſins?
Are they not but little ones?</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Be not over-haſty.</hi> If thou muſt repent, it is
time enough yet: torment not thy ſelf before thy
time: repentance will be well enough at laſt: when
thou art old, thou wilt have little elſe to do: be
not old, whilſt thou art young.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:153036:83"/>
10. <hi>Truſt God with thy ſoul, rather then man with thy
body.</hi> That is, chooſe Iniquity rather then Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
venture no farther in matters of Religion,
then thou mayeſt with ſafety.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe corrupt principles which
make up the Law of Sin, to which all others may be
reduced; and living under the power of any of theſe
or any others of the like nature, this is <hi>obeying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</hi>
As the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>He that breaks one
of the Commandments of God, is guilty of all:</hi> So he that
lives under the power of any one of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Devil, is, if not under the power of
all, yet as ſure a ſlave to the Devil as if he were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all; he whoſe foot is entangled in one cord
of the Net, is as faſt, as he that hath the whole Net
ſpread over him: if a bird be held by a leg or a wing,
it is as ſure as if the whole body were in the Net.
Here now you may have alſo the deſcription of the
Goats; thoſe are contentious, reſiſting the Lord
and the word of his grace; and who, after all the
ſtrivings of the Lord with them, do overcome, and
hold their own, and perſiſt in their diſobeying the
truth, and obeying unrighteouſneſs, or living under
the dominion of thoſe corrupt Principles, which
make up the <hi>Law of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me here demand of you theſe three
things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Are not theſe Principles I have mentioned eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them evidently principles of unrighteouſneſs?
And may they not as well be called the Devils Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as the Devil be called a Devil?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Are not all thoſe that live under the
power of theſe Principles, the very men here meant in
the Text, by thoſe that obey <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, may they
not as well be called the Devils Servants, as thoſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:153036:84"/>
wicked Laws, the Devils Commandments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Are not all perſons that are not preciſely
godly, in the ſenſe I have before deſcribed it, evidently
held under ſome of theſe corrupt Principles? Is not
this it which you in reproach charge upon the
Saints, that they will not live under theſe, or ſome of
theſe Rules? That they will not take their liberty;
that they will nor do as others, but they must be ſingular,
forſooth, as if they were wiſer then their neighbours;
that they ſtand upon every trifle and ſmall matter,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of theſe <hi>Anti-Preciſians,</hi> if they be laid to
theſe black lines, do touch with them in every point
throughout; you may well ſoile them <hi>Hells tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
Conformiſts,</hi> or <hi>the Devils beſt Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sinners, the whole generation of you that are
of ſuch a Spirit, even every one of you that have
a word to ſpeak againſt the preciſeneſs of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and godly men, come and look into this glaſs
which is here ſet before you. Do you know your
own faces when you ſee them? Are not theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
the very Pictures and expreſs Images of you?
If you ſay they are not, it is becauſe you do not
know your own faces; if they are not, let me be
rejected for a <hi>Lyar</hi> and a <hi>Slanderer.</hi> But if you
be, even all of you, theſe very men, then look a
little further, and you may ſee your reward will
be in the Judgement: Why, what is it? Read on
and you have it; <hi>To them that obey not the Truth, but
obey <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
and anguiſh, upon every ſoul of man that doth
evil,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you ſay, This is but your opinion, but for
all that you may be miſtaken, we hope to fare as
well as you, the beſt of you, for all your great
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:153036:84"/>
words: but our opinion. Why, is it never your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
too? Do you never doubt? Are you never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
that this may be, that this will be your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Did your own conſciences never preach to you
the ſame things? but whether they did or no, this is
as true, that indignation and wrath will be the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of every ſoul of you thus living and thus dying;
this is as tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as that God is righteous. The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of God is engaged, to render to every man
according to his works; and ſo to them that obey
not the Truth, but obey Unrighteouſneſs, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by this time you may ſee that there is ſome
difference betwixt the rewards of the godly, and
the rewards of all others in the world; as much
difference as betwixt Life and Death, Mercy and
Wrath, everlaſting Joy and Peace, and everlaſting
Anguiſh and Tribulation. If Heaven and Hell dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
onely in conceit, and if there be not as great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the rewards of theſe and all others,
as betwixt Heaven and Hell, then once more I tell
you, we will be content to be the <hi>Phanaticks.</hi> And
have you not yet done with talking of our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and conceits? Is it but a conceit, that there
ſhall be a judgement? Or is this a conceit, that
it ſhall then fare better with the Sheep then with
the Goats? Or that thoſe are Chriſts Sheep that
hear his voice, and follow his ſteps, and keep by
the Shepherds Tents? Is this a conceeist, that it
ſhall fare better with the Friends of Chriſt, then
with his Enemies; or that thoſe are the friends of
Chriſt, who are the friends of Holineſs? Is this a
conceit, that it ſhall fare better with the ſervants
of Chriſt then with ſtrangers? Or, are thoſe
the beſt ſervants, who waſte their Talents, or
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:153036:85"/>
bind them up in a Napkin? Will Chriſt ſay in that
day, <hi>Away thou faithful Servant; away from me
ye workers of Righteouſneſs?</hi> You have loved me
too much, you have pleaſed me too well, you have
followed me too cloſe, you have given your ſelves
to too much praying, too much praiſing, too much
faſting; you have been too conſcientious, too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
too watchful, too holy; you would not be
merry, and idle, and vain; you would not go along
with your Neighbours, to their ſporting, to their
Revellings, to their Pleaſures, but muſt needs deny
your ſelves, and take up your Croſs and follow me;
you could not be content with an Earthly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but you muſt have Glory and Honour, and
Immortality; you could not be content to venture
on a groundleſs hope of Glory, but you muſt
needs make ſure of it, by patient continuance in
well-doing, <hi>Away from me you workers of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
you that have followed me in the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
get you gone, get you down to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſtruction; Will this be the voice of the Judge
at that day? Will he call to ſinners, <hi>Come ye wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
come ye Wine-bibbers, come ye Swearers, Lyars,
Scoffers, Whore-maſters, come ye bleſſed Crew, inherit
the Kingdome?</hi> All this muſt be ſo, if godlineſs be
but a fancy; and do you not yet ſee Sinners, what
men of Reaſon, what men of Judgement you are,
and how much truth or weight there is in your
charge againſt the Saints? Oh Chriſtians, you ſee
I hope, ſufficiently, how little ground you have to
take the leaſt notice of, or diſcouragement from
theſe confident Adverſaries, who in proclaiming
you Phanaticks, muſt proclaim themſelves either
<hi>Infidels</hi> or <hi>Ideot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

2. The Duties and Comforts of Godlineſſe are
no fancies; <hi>I</hi> ſhall inſtance in ſuch duties, and thoſe
parts of duties, which are moſt obnoxious to this
cenſure; the moſt ſpiritual duties; the moſt ſpiritual
parts of duties, which being moſt out of fight, and
above the reach of the carnal world, are moſt of all
thus cenſuted by them; <hi>I</hi> ſhall mention onely two,
which indeed are comprehenſive of all.</p>
            <p>1. Worſhiping God in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>2. Walking in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>1. Worſhiping God in the Spirit. If this be
a fancy, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> with the Chriſtians his
Contemporaries, were the great Phanaticks of their
time: who ſaies thus of himſelf and them, <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 3. <hi>We are the Circumiſion, who worſhip God in
the ſpirit. We are the Circumciſion;</hi> that is, We are
the People of God; we are they who are circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the Circumciſion which is without
hands, circumciſed in heart, which is all one, as
if he had ſaid, we are Chriſtians, <hi>who worſhip God
in the ſpirit.</hi> Worſhipping God in the ſpirit,
notes,</p>
            <p>1. The worſhip of the ſoul, or heart-worſhip.</p>
            <p>2. The worſhipping God through his Spirit, or
in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>1. The worſhip of the ſoul, or inward worſhip,
and that, 1. As it ſtands in oppoſition to meet
bodily worſhip; <hi>I</hi> ſay not as it is oppos'd to bodily
worſhip, but to meer bodily worſhip. 2. As it ſtands
in oppoſition to the Antiquated Jewiſh worſhip,
which was more external, pompous, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious.
<hi>We worſhip God in the ſpirit,</hi> that is, we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God in the heart, and in the ſimplicity and
plainneſs of Goſpel-worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:153036:86"/>
Heart-worſhip is the true worſhip; the worſhip
of the ſoul, is the ſoul of worſhip: The body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ſoul is dead, and bodily worſhip without
ſpiritual, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> dead worſhip, John 4. 24. <hi>God is a
Spirit, and they that worſhip him, must worſhip him
in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> The latter word (<hi>Truth</hi>) is
exegitical of the former (<hi>Spirit</hi>) ſignifying, that
worſhiping in Spirit, is worſhiping in Truth;
<hi>This is the true worſhip, worſhip indeed.</hi> The worſhip
of the body, the uncovering of the head, the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the knee, the lifting up of the hands, or voice,
theſe are but the outſide and carcaſe of worſhip,
and ſo far only capable of being accounted worſhip,
as they are helpful to, and expreſſive of the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſoul. As bowing of the knee ſignifies
the bowing of the heart; as the uncovering of the
head either expreſſes, or helps toward the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
reverence of the ſoul, ſo far as they worſhip,
and no farther, and even then but improperly ſo

               </gap>lled. But as they ſtand ſingle and ſeparated
from the inward worſhip, they are no worſhip, no
more then a carcaſe is a man, but are meer ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and fanſies. There is no ſuch Phanatick as
the Formaliſt, who whileſt with thoſe Heathens,

Sir, your ſervant, command me what you pleaſe,
I am ready to ſerve you.</hi> Here is a great ſhew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

wiſe man will regard it? And what more is there
in the Formaliſts devotions? What is it but meer
complementing with the Holy God? Very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:153036:86"/>
and lowly, as to all appearance, and a great
noiſe is there, that ſuch Devotion makes, but what
is there in it? What awe; and Soul-reverence of
God, what heart-ſtriving and wreſtling with God,
what heart-elevation, or lifting up the Soul to
God is there in all this? Is there no ſuch thing as
heart-ſtriving and Soul-reverence required in the
Worſhip of God; or are theſe but ſhadows of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and is the ſoul of it onely in the Lips or Knees?
Doth he whoſe Soul is poured out in prayer, whoſe
Spirit ſtrives with the Lord, doth he but pray in

Eyes and Tongues, and Hands onely pray, have
they gotten the ſubſtance, are theſe the true

            <p>2. Worſhipping God through the ſpirit, through
the help and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God; as to
inſtance in prayer, Jude 20. <hi>Praying in the Holy
Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</hi>
The Spirit of God affords a three-fold
help in prayer.</p>
            <p>1. He indites our requeſts; ſuggeſts matter of
Prayers to us, who as the Apoſtle there tells us,
<hi>Know not what we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>uld pray for as we ought.</hi> Carnal
mens luſts do often make their Prayers, and then
no wonder they ask amiſs; when they ſhould be
ſeeking the death of their luſt, they ask meat for
their luſts; we often, not knowing what we ought
to ask, do ask we know not what; we ask a ſtone,
a Serpent, a Scorpion; ſomtimes, when we think
we ask bread: If God ſhould alwaies give his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
their prayers, their prayers would undo them.
When we are poor, we ask riches, and it may be, if
God ſhould give us them, our riches might undo
us: Somtimes we ask eaſe, or credit, or liberty,
and if we had what we ask, it might be our ruine;
the Spirit of God knows what's fit for us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
guides our prayers; He helps us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
               <hi>our ſins,</hi> and ſo teaches us what <hi>confeſſion</hi>
to make, carnal men will confeſs ſins, but any ſins
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:153036:87"/>
rather then their own; He helps us to underſtand
<hi>our wants,</hi> and ſo teaches us <hi>what to ask;</hi> He helps
us to underſtand our mercies, and ſo teaches us
<hi>what to give thanks for;</hi> carnal men often come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord with <hi>mock praiſes,</hi> give thanks for
their election, juſtification, ſanctification, hope of
glory, when it may be, the power of ſin, and the
wrath of God abides upon them, and they remain
without Chriſt, and without hope, and without
God in the world; the Spirit of God, if they had
him, would make their devotions more reaſonable
and regular.</p>
            <p>2. He excites, and quickens, and enlarges their
hearts in prayer. The Spirit of God comes in and
influences upon the heart, and draws forth the ſoul;
and this is the import of the following words, <hi>The
Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
which cannot be uttered;</hi> that is, he ſets up a
groaning and ſighing after the Lord. <hi>Groaning</hi>
notes the ſtrentgh and ardency of deſire, which
through the ſervency of it, puts the Soul to paine,
and an holy impatience till it be heard; in which
ſence its uſed, verſe 21. <hi>For we our ſelves, who have
received the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, groan within our
ſelves, waiting for the adoption, even the redemption of
our body.</hi> It works ſuch <hi>groanings as cannot be uttered,</hi>
it ſometimes makes the hearts of Chriſtians too big
for their mouths, their deſires more larger then
their expreſſions; as much warmth, and life, and
ſtrength of affection as there does appear without,
there's more within<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Oh, how flat and dead are our
hearts oftentimes; how much are we ſtraitned in our
prayers, we ſtand as men ſtruck dumb when we come
before the Lord; or if there be words in our
mouths, there is ſcare any word in our hearts;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:153036:88"/>
ſometimes we cannot ſpeak, and if we can ſpeak,
we cannot groan; the Spirit doth either put words
in our mouths, or elſe ſupply the want of words, by
kindling and enlarging inward deſires; helping us
to groan out a prayer when we cannot ſpeak it out;
and ſilent groans will ſound in the ears of the Lord,
when the loudeſt cryes may not be heard.</p>
            <p>3. He encourages and emboldens the heart in
prayer, enables us to call God <hi>Father,</hi> to pray to
him, to cry to him, to be confident of audience and
acceptance with him upon this ground, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6.
<hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your
hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi> And hereby he furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
us with a mighty Argument to plead with God;
Father hear me, Father forgive me, Father pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
me, Father help me: Am not I thy childe, thy
Son, or thy Daughter? To whom may a childe be
bold to go? With whom may a child have hope to
ſpeed, if not with his Father? Father hear me: The
Fathers of our Fleſh are full of bowels and full of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to their Children, and know how to give good
things to them when we ask them; when they ask
Bread, will they deny them? when they ask cloaths,
or any thing they want, will they deny them? And
is not the Father of Spirits more full of bowels, more
full of bounty, than the Fathers of our Fleſh, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hear me</p>
            <p>This is praying in the Spirit, and if this be a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with you, I muſt tell you ſinners, that it is ſuch
a fancy, as experienced Chriſtians that have moſt
proved it, would not loſe for all your ſubſtance.
But will you ſtand to it? Is this Fanatical praying
indeed? then bring your <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> and
expunge theſe Text<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if you let them ſtand, and look over them again,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:153036:88"/>
you will next ſay, <hi>Their Bible is as Fanatical as

            </p>
            <p>But let me add one word to convince you from
your own judgement (if you underſtand what
you doe) that praying in the Spirit is no fancy;
and this, by putting this one Queſtion to you;
Dare any of you all, when you goe to God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
deliberately refuſe to begge the aſſiſtance of his
Spirit? Whether you uſe a Form, or Pray without
a Form, that is not ſo material: The aſſiſtance of
the Spirit is needed as well of thoſe that uſe a Form,
as of thoſe that pray without it: Nor dare you, I
ſay, when you goe to pray deliberately, refuſe to beg
the aſſiſtance of the Spirit? Dare you ſay, <hi>Lord, I
need not, nor deſire any ſuch aſſiſtance; I will not ask
it of thee, that thy Spirit may be given into me, to help
mine infirmities?</hi> If you beg the aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
you hope to have it, and if you have it, there is
that praying in the Spirit, which you cry down for
a fancy: Judge now, whether you do not condemn
the things which your ſelves allow, and in your
Judgement and Practice juſtifie the reallity of that
Duty, which with your mouths you decree for Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical;
<hi>Will you alſo be his Diſciples? Will you alſo be
Fanaticks?</hi>

Let us conſider further, What is meant by that
expreſſion, of being <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 14. Why,
poſſibly the ſame men will tell us, there is no more
in this then in the former; it implores no more
than the Spirits <hi>leading us into all Truth,</hi> the truth of
the Goſpel, as the Star led the Wiſe men of the Eaſt
to the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> If this be granted to be all, yet here
we have gotten ſomthing, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Spirit of
God is acknowledged to be our leader: but let us
conſider one Scripture more, <hi>Ezek. 36. 27. I will
put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my
Statutes.</hi> What are thoſe Statutes of God, but the
whole Will and Word of God? One or two of
them I ſhall mention, <hi>If any man will come after me, let
him deny himſelf, take up his Croſs, and Follow me: Work
out your ſalvation with fear and trembling: Quench not
the Spirit: Abſtain from all appearance of evil: See that

more ſuch, found and unrepeal'd in this great Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

                  <item>2. To live in the power of the Spirit.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. To live under the <hi>conduct</hi> and guidance of
the Spirit, <hi>Rom. 8. 14. As many as are (led) by
the Spirit, are the Sons of God:</hi> There is a double
Guide, whereby the Lord leads his people; The
Guide of his <hi>Word,</hi> Pſalm 73. 24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide
me by thy counſel:</hi> And the guide of his <hi>Spirit,</hi>
John 16. 13. <hi>He ſhall lead you into all truth.</hi> There
are <hi>two things</hi> which the Spirit doth in leading on his
People.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He enlightens their Eyes, opens their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
that they may underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which point out to us our way, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 45.
<hi>Then opeued he their underſtandings, that they might
understand the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, He takes them by the hand, as it were,
and leads them,</hi> Iſa. 40. 11. He ſhall gather the Lambs
with his arm, and carry them in his Boſome, and ſhall
gently lead thoſe that are with young.</p>
            <p>2. To live in the <hi>power</hi> of the Spirit, or of that
inherent and aſſiſting Grace which we receive
from him, to be carried on in an holy courſe, and
all the Duties of it, both from the <hi>intrinſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
of the Life of God begotten in us, and by the
<hi>concurrent Influences</hi> and aſſiſtance of the Holy
Ghoſt, whom God hath given us, to help our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.
As in the Duty of Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.
So in all other Chriſtian Duties, <hi>John 15. 5. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
me</hi> (ſayes Chriſt, that is, without the aſſiſtance
of my Spirit) <hi>ye can do nothing.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi>
reſolves, <hi>Pſalm 71. 16. I will goe in the ſtrength
of the Lord, and by thee I will make mention of thy
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153036:90"/>
Name.</hi> And this living in the power of the
Spirit, is no other then is ſignified (if we did
underſtand what we ſay) in thoſe common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
which we ordinarily have in our mouths,
<hi>By the grace of God,</hi> or, <hi>by the help of God,</hi> I will
do this, or that: What the Apoſtle ſpeaks of
himſelf, as Miniſter, is applicable to Chriſtians,
1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>I laboured more abundantly then
they all, yee not I, but the Grace of God which was with
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus to walk in the Spirit, is to follow thoſe
directions, and intimations of the Will of God,
which he gives us out of the Word; and thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes
of the Spirit upon our hearts, whereby, as
by a gale of Wind filling onr Sails, he moves and
helps us on. When you find any clear light, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in from the Word upon your Conſciences, and
thereupon ſome ſtirrings upon your hearts, either
by the way of check, reſtraining, and calling you
back from any irregular or diſorderly walking, or
quickening and encouraging you on in a way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
this you may ſafely take to be from the Spirit;
and when you entertain this light, obey theſe
checks, and follow theſe holy impulſes; this is
your walking in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>3 To live a ſpiritual Life. In whom the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath begotten another heart, thoſe he leads on
in another life. He that is born of the Spirit is a
ſpiritual man, and thoſe that are led by the Spirit,
<hi>walk</hi> on in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> courſe, that is, they live a more
noble and raiſed life then the reſt of the world:
Carnal men, who are governed and ruled by that
evil ſpirit that is in the world, live an evil and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life; worldly ſpiritual men a worldly life; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
men a ſenſual life: <hi>Epheſ. 2. 2, 3. Wherein
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:153036:91"/>

according to the Prince of the power of the Air, the
ſpirit that now worketh in the children of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

               </gap>
bellies, to ſerve our appetites, to ſerve our pride,
and covetouſneſs, and other luſts, this was our life.
And this life was ſutable to that Spirit which was
within them, and that evil Spirit, the Prince of this
world without them, that govern'd and ſteer'd their
courſe. Accordingly, the Saints having a new heart
within, and a new leader without, do lead a new
life; as the fleſh and the Devil carry evil men on in
a courſe ſutable to their leaders, ſo the Spirit and
Grace of God carry on the Saints in a courſe ſutable

taſted of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt; taſted that the
Lord is gracious, and therefore can take great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in him. The delight they take in Chriſt,
is that which puts ſuch a delight into every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
into every Duty; therefore Praying,
and Reading is ſo pleaſant to them, becauſe there
they meet with their Beloved. Chriſt appears to
them in his Word, Chriſt meets his Saints in their
Prayings and Faſtings, and this makes all ſweet to
their ſouls. Carnal men think the life of Saints
to be an heavy, a ſad, and moſt troubleſome life;
they count, that themſelves have the onely
merry and pleaſant lives: that their Hawks,
and Hounds, their Carding and Dicing, and
Drinking and Dancing, their Seews and Plays,
that theſe are the onely Heaven: This is all one as
to ſay, that God hath put more ſweetneſs into crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
then is in himſelf; that the baſeſt and vileſt
uſe of the creatures, doth yield more true content,
then the ſouls exerciſing it ſelf on God; as if the

underſtandings of theſe men? I tell you Sinners,
when you have gone from flower to flower, from
creature to creature, from pleaſure to pleaſure, and
ſucked out all the fatneſs and ſweetneſs that theſe
will yield; a poor Chriſtian will get more real plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
out of one Chapter of his Bible, out of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Sermon, out of one hours converſe with God
in Prayer, then yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Goſpel, with its breſts of conſolation, at which

               </gap>n, as they deſpiſe the glory of your
ſparks.</p>
            <p>3 By theſe ſpiritual exerciſes and delights, they
become more and more ſpiritual themſelves. By
their beholding the face of God, they are changed
from glory to glory, into his image and likeneſs;
by living ſo much in Heaven, the temper and frame
of their hearts becomes heavenly; mens ordinary
company and exerciſes have ſuch an influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that 'tis not unuſual that they change
their diſpoſition. Frothy company, and vain exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
will leave a frothineſs and vanity upon mens
ſpirits, and ſerious, and ſavoury company, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
do leave a good ſavour behind them. He
whoſe work is in the Coal-mines, his hiew is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
the flies that feed on the dung, look like
the dung they feed on. Carnal men, by being
continually converſant about their earthly affairs,
have nothing but earthineſs left upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
their Thoughts, Affections, their Souls are
become earth, earthly; their duties are earthly,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:153036:93"/>
their prayers, their praiſes, their hearings, all are
earthly: When they go to Church, when they
go to their Cloſſets, they muſt carry their earth
along with them, or leave their hearts behind
them. On the other ſide, Chriſtians, by having
their dwellings with God, their Delights, their
Recreations, their daily buſineſs with God; the
Spirit of Glory and of God reſteth upon them;
by their <hi>Divine Exerciſes,</hi> they are made more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> and as Worldlings
buſineſſes and delights, do leave an earthlineſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their very Religion, ſo a Chriſtians Religion
doth Spiritualize his Civil Affairs: Carnal mens
prayers do ſavour of their Fields, Oxen, and ſports;
Carnal mens Sabbaths do ſmell of their Working-days,
and a Chriſtians works do ſavour of his
prayers; a Chriſtians Week-days have a tincture
of his Sabbaths; he eats and drinks, he buys and
ſells, he ploughs and threſhes, not as a man,
but as a Saint; he doth not onely pray as a Saint,
and hear as a Saint, but he ploughs as a Saint, he
trades as a Saint; his heart is in Heaven while his
hand is at the Plough, he is ſerving his God while
he is ſerving his own neceſſities; he ſeeks, he ſerves,
he eyes, he enjoys his God, in all he hath or doth;
he proves by his ſenſe that <hi>God is every where;</hi> with
him he dwells, feeds, labours, lodges, with him he
lives, he dies.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee what it is to walk in the
Spirit. Look how far forth ſuch a Chriſtian lives
in the Spirit, ſo far forth doth he live ſuch a life as
this.</p>
            <p>3 This is no fanſie, and if I fail not here, if I
prove this, I hope Sinners, you will then ſee reaſon
enough to take the Phanatick upon your ſelves, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:153036:94"/>
from henceforth ſtile theſe deſpiſed Saints in your
<hi>Stilo novo, Iſraelites indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtians (you that hear me this day) will you
help me in this proof, this once help me, and the
cauſe will go cleary on the Lords ſide; you may
if you will, come in, and be willing inſtances of
this Truth. Will you live according to your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that Life of God which is within you? Will
you live according to your Rules, that Word of
Life which is before you? Will you follow your
Leader, that Holy Spirit which is given to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

that Godlineſs which you profeſs? will you live in
the obedience of that Spirit which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
will you ſhew your ſelves a pattern of Faith,
of Patience, of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs? Will
you be dealing leſs about theſe earthly vanities, and
be leſs earthly in your earthly dealings; ſhall your
dealings be wholly about Heaven and Heavenly
things, and will you make theſe your dealings your
delights? Will you labour by being more conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
about ſpirituall things, and in ſpiritual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
to become more ſpiritual, more ſpiritually
minded, more ſpiritually tempred? Will you get
more clear off the love, and luſts, and faſhions, and
ways, and joys of this world? Will you ſuffer the
Eternal Spirit to fill you with his love, and faſhion
you into his likeneſs? Will you forbear any
more reſiſting, grieving, ſlighting, quenching
his holy motions; will you hearken to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
anſwer his impulſes? Will you grow on to be
more Chriſtians daily, more Saints daily, Saints in
heart, Saints in tongue, Saints in the general frame

            <p>Brethren, We may much thank our ſelves for all
our Adverſaries ſlanders; we have helped them
to reproaches, we have furniſhed them with accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
by our walking ſo much in the Fleſh, and
ſo little in the Spirit, we have taught them to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
whether there be any ſuch thing a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> walking
in the Spirit. The Lord pardon us, the Lord make
us ſenſible of it; we have brought up an <hi>evil report</hi>
upon our <hi>God,</hi> upon his <hi>Spirit, Goſpel</hi> and wayes, and
for ought we know have undone <hi>many poor</hi> wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
by our hardning them in their miſconceits of
Godlineſs and Religion: There have been ſo
much Droſs in our Gold, ſo much Aſhes upon our
Fire, ſo much Earth upon our Spirits, ſuch ſad mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Water with our Wine, ſo much Liberty ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for our Carnal joyes and Carnal pleaſures; our
Light hath been ſo dim, our Grace hath been ſo
low, our good works have been ſo ſpare, and ſo
thin, that we have made them bold to ſay, We are
not what we are, but a meer lie and deceit; And
we have now no ſuch way to vindicate our ſelves,
our Religion, our Holy profeſſion, to juſtifie our
God and his Goſpel, as by blowing up the Coals,
ſhaking off our Aſhes, ſtirring up the Graces of
God within us, and letting them have their
perfect work in us. Will you Chriſtians, will you
hearken to me in this? Then I ſhould be bold to
bring you forth as Witneſſes for God and his
Truth. However, though upon your account it
would be the more comfortable, though, <hi>ex abundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
I would bring in as many evidences as poſſible,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:153036:95"/>
yet if you ſhould fail me, or any other particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of profeſſors, yet let the World know I
have ſufficient proof ready at hand. For,</p>
            <p>If this walking in the Spirit be a fancy, then
theſe Damnable Abſurdities will unavoidably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Spirit of the Lord is unfaithful in
his Office.</item>
                  <item>2. That God himſelf is falſe in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Devil doth more to the Damning
of Souls, than the Spirit of God to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them.</item>
                  <item>4. That God hath no People, no peculiar
People in the world.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. If walking in the Spirit be a fancy, <hi>the Spirit
is unfaithful in his Office.</hi> That the Spirit of God
is given to the People of God, to every one of
them, is ſo plainly aſſerted, that he muſt deny
the Scriptures that doth not grant it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9.
<hi>Ye are not in the Fleſh, but in the Spirit, if ſo be that
the ſpirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man
have not the ſpirit of Christ, he is none of his.</hi> That
there are certain operations of the Spirit, which
he is by Office to perform, is as certain, as, 1. <hi>To
Enlighten;</hi> therefore he is called the <hi>Spirit of
Wiſdome and Revelation, Epheſ. 1. 17, 18. 2. To
ſanctifie;</hi> therefore Sanctification is called, <hi>The
ſanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 13. 3. <hi>To
Lead,</hi> John 16. 13. <hi>He ſhall lead you into all Truth.</hi>
4. <hi>To Aſſiſt,</hi> and help, <hi>Rom. 8. 26. Exek.</hi> 36. 27.
5. <hi>To Comfort;</hi> therefore is he called, <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</hi>
If the Spirit of the Lord doth his Office,
then there are perſons that are <hi>Enlightned, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
Led, Aſſiſted, Comforted</hi> by him; If there be
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:153036:95"/>
none ſuch; if the comfort of the Saints be but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
if their light, their help, their quicknings,
their encouragements, be all fancies; if they be but
led in conceit, quickned in conceit, comforted in
conceit, then where is the Spirits faithfulneſs? See
what Blaſphemies men run themſelves upon before
they are aware. Sinners, take heed what you do;
you are bold to reproach the Saints with <hi>the Spirit,
the Spirit;</hi> but take heed mean while of reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Spirit with <hi>unfaithfulneſs:</hi> Blaſphemy
againſt the Spirit is no ſmall ſin, though every
blaſpheming of the Spirit, be not that <hi>unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſin,</hi> yet it is a fair ſtep towards it; look to
your ſelves.</p>
            <p>2. If walking in the Spirit be a fancy, then God
himſelf is falſe in his promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
<hi>I will put my Spirit within them, and
cauſe them to walk in my Statutes.</hi> If there be no
ſuch thing done, then where is the promiſe of God?
He that makes walking in the Spirit, to be nothing
but talks, makes the promiſe of God to be nothing
but words.</p>
            <p>3. If walking in the Spirit be but fancy, Then
<hi>the Devil doth more to the deſtroying of Souls, than the
Spirit of the Lord doth to the ſalvation of Souls.</hi> Let
us conſider again that Scripture, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
in time paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this
World, according to the Prince of the power of the
Air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of
Diſobedience.</hi> There are two things there obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our purpoſe; 1. Sinners are led by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
2. They are aſſiſted and excited by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
1. They are led by the Devil; that's noted
in that expreſſion, They walk on <hi>according to the
Prince of the Power of the Air;</hi> according to his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:153036:96"/>
guidance, according to his minde and will, he hath
them at his beck. When he ſayes, Go, they go, and
when he ſayes, Come, they come; and when he ſayes
do this, they do it. But how comes this to paſs,
that the Devil can hold ſuch an hand over them,
can lead them thus at pleaſure? VVhy; 2. They are
aſſiſted and excited by the Devil; that evil Spirit
<hi>works in</hi> them, ſuggeſts evil thoughts into them,
and thereby excites and provokes, and ſets them
a work. The Devil is ſaid, <hi>Acts 5. to fill the hearts</hi>
of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, to lye againſt the Holy
Ghoſt;</hi> And when he had once put a lye into their
Hearts, their Hearts preſently put a lye into their
Mouths. VVhen the Devil hath wrought wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
into the hearts of ſinners, then they preſently
fall to working it out. When wicked men lye, it
is the Devil lies in them; when they curſe and
rage, and ſwell with madneſs, the Devil rages in
them; VVhen the luſts of men bring forth Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
Drunkenneſs, Riot Revellings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Devil
lies within blowing up the coals. Is this but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that wicked men <hi>walk in the Spirit?</hi> That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Spirit. That the Devil drawes them on, and
drives them on, and helps them on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hardens
them on in their wickedneſs? Could men be ſo
wicked as they are, could there be ſuch quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
and contentions, ſuch debaucheries and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,
ſuch curſings and blaſphemings, ſuch rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs
and ribaldries coming out of mens mouths,
and abounding in their lives? Could there be ſo
much conſtancy, fruitfulneſs, boldneſs, hardneſs
in ſinning, againſt all fears, warnings, reproofs,
counſels, againſt Conſcience, and the Dictates of
their Reaſon and common ſenſe, were it not for
that evil Spirit that works in theſe Children of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:153036:96"/>
diſobedience? Now if it be no fancy, that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men <hi>walk in the ſpirit</hi> (this you muſt grant, or
elſe you muſt <hi>conclude</hi> that they are all Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
and if you grant it, can you conceive it to be
but a fancy, that the Saints <hi>walk in the ſpirit?</hi> If
the Devil works lies and oaths, and curſes into the
Hearts of ſinners, ſure you may well allow that the
Spirit of God works duties, works a prayer or prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the hearts of the Srints. Could a poor
Chriſtian, that hath ſo many corruptions within,
ſo many Temptations without, ſo many weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
hindrances, diſcouragements, ever follow the
Lord in his holy wayes againſt them all, if he had
no other Spirit than his own to carry him on? The
Saints ſure have as much need of that help which is
from above, to carry them on in holineſs unto life,
as Sinners have of that which is from beneath, to
carry them on in iniquity to deſtruction; and
me thinks you ſhould not queſtion, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God will be as active to ſtay, as the Devil is
buſie to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>4. If walking in the Spirit be but a fancy, then
<hi>God hath no People in the World,</hi> Rom. 8. 14. <hi>As
many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
Sons of God. As many,</hi> that is, juſt ſo many, and
no more: God hath no more Children in the
VVorld, than there are perſons that are led by the
Spirit; to be led by the Spirit, and to walk in the
Spirit, ſignifie one and the ſame thing: If then
there be no ſuch thing, nor no ſuch perſons in the
World to be found, where then are Gods Children?
God hath no Child, if this be ſo: You muſt <hi>write
the God of all the Earth childleſs,</hi> a Father without a
Childe, a King without a People; if theſe <hi>wiſe men</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:153036:97"/>
be <hi>true men;</hi> and <hi>true men</hi> you can very hardly call
them, who having robbed the King of Saints of all
his Subjects, and the Father of Lights of all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>You ſee now to what a plain iſſue this matter is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
brought: If you be in the right in this thing,
then the Spirit of God muſt be unfaithful in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
God muſt be falſe in his promiſe; the Devil doth
more to the damning, than the ſpirit of God doth
to the ſaving of ſouls; and one of theſe two things
will follow hence, either that the Devil is of more
might than the Almighty Spirit, or that the God of
love hath not ſo much love as the Devil hath malice;
and laſtly, that God hath no People in the
world.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſinners, you will yet reply, Well,
We will grant that this is true, that there are thoſe
that are led by the ſpirit, and walk in the ſpirit,
but when you talk of ſo much Spirituality in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
men, of ſuch high notions as living in the
fellowſhip of the ſpirit, living in Heaven when
you tell us of ſuch Glorious light, ſuch Raptures
of Joy, ſuch Extaſies of Spiritual delights, here
are the Fancies; Theſe are the things which we
cannot but account the fooliſh Dreames of deluded
hearts.</p>
            <p>And now you think you have hit at laſt. But
is not this it which you ſay, The Spirit enlightens,
but gives no light: The enlightned ſee no more
than the blinde: The Spirit renews men, and yet
they are not changed: The Spirit leades the
Saints, and yet they follow him juſt as faſt as thoſe
that have no legs: The Spirit dwells in them, and
yet they have no more fellowſhip or acquaintance
with him, than thoſe that never ſaw him: The
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:153036:97"/>
Spirit aſſiſts, and yet gives no help: The Spirit
comforts, and yet gives no joy; but after all he
hath done, leaves them juſt as other men, and
whatſoever they pretend to have more, is a meer
cheat and deluſion. The ſum of all comes to this,
The Spirit doth, and yet doth not; doth ſomething,
ſome great thing, and yet that ſomething is juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>But is there no ſuch life of God, wherein the
Lord having gotten the chief intereſt in the heart,
hath alſo the Dominion of the life? Is there no
ſuch life, the main dealings and buſineſs whereof, is
the pleaſing and honouring of God, and the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that glory and honour which is from him? Muſt
God be an underling to the World, and be put off
with our ſpare hours which the World will allow
him? We were even as good down-right to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
we own no God at all? or if we muſt have
one, a <hi>Baal,</hi> or an <hi>Aſhtaroth,</hi> a <hi>Niſroch,</hi> or a <hi>Molech,</hi>
an Oxe, or a Calf, may ſerve us well enough for a
God; a God to be ſo trampled on or to be ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<hi>ſtand aſide,</hi> when ever the World hath any thing
for us to do.</p>
            <p>Is there no ſuch Spiritual life, the comforts
whereof are Spiritual comforts, the pleaſures and
delights, Spiritual pleaſures and delights? Are there
no delights in God, who is a <hi>Well of Life,</hi> and the
Fountain of all Bleſſedneſs? Have the Creatures
their ſeveral ſweetneſſes iſſuing from them, the
Sun its light, the Fire its warmth, the Fig-tree its
ſweetneſs, the Olive-tree its fatneſs, the Fruits of
the Earth their pleaſant taſtes and ſmell, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of Muſick their melodious Ayres and
ſounds to gratifie and pleaſe our ſenſes, and is the
Fountain onely a dry and unſavory thing, when

the Ciſterns are ſo freſh and full? Have fleſhly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes

ſo ſtrangely ſweetned by the gain and in-come of
them? Are May-Games and Morrice-Dances,
Sports and Playes, ſo delightſome to men, that they
will ſell their Souls for ſuch Pleaſures; and are they
the Exerciſes of Religion onely, that have no juyce

are the delights and comforts hereof ſuch flaſhy

them, whether we be awake, or in a dream? Once
more conſider the Scriptures; <hi>How excellent is thy
loving kindeneſs, O God, therefore the Children of Men
put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy Wings: They
ſhall be aboundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy

that readeth underſtand; do all theſe ſpeak the life
of Saints to be ſuch a dry and dark, and impleaſant
life?</p>
            <p>Let me farther ask you theſe two Queſtions.</p>
            <p>1. Are there any delights in Heaven? Is there
any joy before the Throne, and in the face of God?
Are there any pleaſures at his right hand? Doth
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:153036:98"/>
the Tree of Life, that ſtands in the midſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe
of God, yield any pleaſant fruit? Doth the
Chryſtal River that runs through the City of God,
yield any pleaſant ſtreams? Are the exerciſes of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
bleſſing, praiſes, and ſinging <hi>Hallelujah, Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi>
are there any pleaſure in theſe? Speak Sinners,
what do you think, are there any delights in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
            <p>2. Is there not ſomething of that heavenly joy
and delight let down to the Saints here? Whileſt
they bear a part in the ſame exerciſes, have they not
a little ſhare in the ſame pleaſure? What means then
the <hi>earneſt of their inheritance,</hi> which is given here?
The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14. that the Saints,
<hi>after they had believed, were ſealed with the holy Spirit of
Promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance.</hi> An
<hi>earneſt</hi> is a part of that, whereof it is an earneſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in hand; <hi>The earnest of our inheritance</hi> is a part
of the inheritance.</p>
            <p>Believe it Sinners, Gods <hi>Earneſt</hi> is no <hi>Jeſt,</hi> God
will not mock his Saints, though, you do. As ſinners
to their coſt, ſo Saints to their comforts, feel that
Gods <hi>Earneſt is in earneſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Lord ſometimes (though more ſeldome)
cauſes ſome flaſhings of his wrath to flie out in the
faces, to kindle in the ſouls, and burn in the bowels
of ſome incorrigible ſinners, as an earneſt of thoſe
everlaſting flames prepared for them, beginning
their hell upon earth, ſo doth he let fall ſome hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
of that Harveſt, ſome drops of that new
Wine, the fuller draughts whereof are reſerved to
that time, when they ſhall ſit down with him in his
Kingdome; and this is <hi>the earneſt of their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi>

and hereby aſſured to them. And is there not yet

            <p>If you will ſtill hold your own, and go about to

Light; you would believe your own eyes before the
blind mans blind confidence, you would pity rather
then credit him, and ſo muſt we you.</p>

The calumnies that light upon them, and the

dream they are eating and drinking, or that they
are rich, or making merry, will you therefore that

conclude that you alſo are but in a dream? becauſe

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:153036:101"/>
the loſſes and wants, the ſorrow and
ſhame, and ſcorn and torments, that men fall
under, or lye under in this life; the evill things to
come, are in one word, the Vengeance of Eternal
Fire.</p>
               <p>The good things and the evil things of this life,
are more perceptible, having the advantage of their
preſence, and obviouſneſs to our ſenſes; the good
things and the evil things to come, are leſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
having the diſadvantage of their diſtance, and
thoſe clouds that do yet keep them out of fight; and
hereupon thoſe are ſlighted, and deſpiſed, and theſe
are looked upon as the onely conſiderable things;
till men be ſet right in their apprehenſions of theſe
things, it will be a vain and fruitleſs attempt, to
perſwade them to Chriſt; miſtakes and miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
here, are the grounds of mens miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>The difficulty of perſwading ſinners to Chriſt, lies
mainly here; There is ſo much to be loſt, and left for
Chriſt, there is ſo much to be ſuffered &amp; undergone;
ſo much labour, ſo much hardſhip and trouble, that
they cannot ſee how Chriſtianity and Godlineſs can
ever make them amends for what they are like to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they will not be made ſenſible, that the things E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
will ballance the things that are before them;
they will not eaſily be perſwaded, but that they ſhall
be great loſers by hearkning to Chriſt. Now, whence
is it that men are thus fooliſh? If they did but clearly
underſtand, and were deeply affected with the vaſt
difference that is betwixt the vain glory of the
world, and the weight of that glory that is to come;
betwixt the light afflictions of this life, and the
aſtoniſhing torments of the other world, they
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:153036:102"/>
would ſure be of another mind; the great objections
againſt godlineſs, would then be all anſwered, and
removed.</p>
               <p>Thou ſayeſt Sinner, it is hard to part with thine
eaſe, and thy pleaſure, and thy liberty, and thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
contentments and delights, which if thou wilt
follow Chriſt, thou ſeeſt muſt all go. But how wilt
thou bear it, to be ſhut out of the everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to be ſhut out from the preſence of God?
Art thou indeed in the mind of that Atheiſt, that
ſaid, <hi>He would not leave his part in</hi> Paris, <hi>for his part in</hi>
Paradiſe? Thou canſt not indure the trouble and
perſecution of this world, but how wilt thou endure
the torments and plagues of the other world? Oh,
if thou were but ſenſible, what that exceeding eternal
weight of glory is, what thou wilt find everlaſting
death and darkneſs to be; then what ſignificant
things would all things that are now before thee
appear to be! Satan would then want arguments
to diſſwade ſinners from Chriſt, his tempting trade
would quickly grow to be a poor trade, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of Eternity were clearly underſtood, and
duly regarded.</p>
               <p>When the Lord hath once ſhewed you the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things of Eternity, <hi>the true riches, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during

the fire that never ſhall be quenched:</hi> When the Lord
hath ſhewed you what a heaven he hath prepared
for the Saints what an Oven he hath prepared
for ſinners, then neglect Chriſt if you can, then

miſery, and an Eternity of both; if men were
as ſure of this, and did as verily believe it, as they
are ſure of what their Eyes have ſeen and their Ears

flying would there be out of the way of Death and
Hell, and what a flocking would there be into the

               <p>Oh Brethren, if you were once brought to this
paſs, if your unbelief were removed, your dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
taken away, your Souls awakened, your Eyes
opened to ſee theſe marvellous things as unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Truths; would you then ſcoffe at pureneſs?
would you then mock at godlineſs? would you then
ſlight reproofs, or need any further conviction of
your folly? You would have an Admoniſher with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you, a Remembance within you, a Reprover
within you; your own Conſciences would plead
with you for your entertaining of Chriſt, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
his Word, and would continually cry in
your Ears, What meaneſt thou, O fool? Doeſt thou
not ſee a Kingdome before thee, which may be
thine, and art thou willing to loſe it? Doſt thou ſee
that Gulf of Miſery and Perdition with open mouth
gaping for thee to devour thee? Ariſe ſluggard, look
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:153036:104"/>
to thy ſelf, leaſt thou be undone before thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</p>
               <p>3. That according to your (choiſe) in this World your
(lot) muſt be for ever in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Your chuſing or refuſing Chriſt and his holy ways
is that which doth determine your Eternal ſtate;
chuſe Chriſt, and you make Heaven ſure to you;
refuſe Chriſt here, and you will be rejected of him
for ever.</p>
               <p>God doth offer you this choice, either the <hi>ſtrait
and the narrow way,</hi> with that life of bleſſedneſs,
which is at the further end of this way: Or <hi>the broad
way,</hi> with that Death and Deſtruction to which it
leads: <hi>Chriſt with his Yoak, his Croſs, and his Eternal
Crown, or the Devil with his golden mines, his Paradiſe
and eternal Priſon:</hi> and all the parts of each of theſe
offers are linked together: Chuſe the Devils golden
Mines and fleſhly Paradiſe, and you muſt have his
Priſon too: Take Chriſts Yoak and his Croſs, and
you ſhall have his Crown, you cannot take the Devils
Paradiſe and Chriſts Crown; if you will have his
Pleaſures, you muſt have his Priſon. You cannot
obtain life, but you muſt chuſe the narrow way that
leads to it.</p>
               <p>Here is the choiſe, ſinners, that God puts you to,
this is the buſineſs of this World to chooſe for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
And that which is the buſineſs of this life, is,
the buſineſs of this hour. This very little piece of
your time, and the choice you make now, may be
it that will give a final determination what your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſtate ſhall be: If you make an evil choice now,
you may never have a minutes time to chooſe again
for ever. Oh, if your hearts were ſenſible of this, that
there is ſo much depending upon every houre of
your lives, as <hi>Life or Death, Heaven or Hell, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:153036:104"/>
ſure you could not but reaſon thus with your
ſelves, Is it a time for me to ſtand all the day idle?
To be laughing or ſporting, or to be drudging and
ſcraping for the muck of this Earth? Is this a time for
me to ſtand trifling with Chriſt and the Goſpel, to
make ſo many delayes, to make ſo many excuſes; <hi>The
tearms are too high, the way is too ſtrait, the yoak is too
heavy, this I cannot part with, that I cannot bring my
heart to ſubſcribe to?</hi> Is this the buſineſs that is now
under debate, what my everlaſting ſtate muſt be? In
which of the two Regions of Eternity my Lot ſhall
fall; whether I ſhall be a Saint or a Devil, a veſſel of
honour, or a veſſel of wrath? whether my dwelling
ſhall be in everlaſting bleſſedneſs, or in everlaſting
burnings? which way the ſcales do turn now, either
for Chriſt or the world; Do they turn for everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Sure if matters ſtand thus, I had need be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and conſider what I do. This is the firſt directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
get theſe three principles fixed in your hearts,
that things Eternal are much more confiderable then
things Temporal, that things not ſeen are as infallibly
certain, as the things that are ſeen, that upon your
preſent choice depends your Eternal lot. Chuſe
Chriſt and his wayes, and you are bleſſed for ever;
refuſe and you are undone for ever. And then,</p>

               <p>If your hearts flie off, and would fain wave the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,

               <p>There be <hi>two things</hi> which muſt neceſſarily be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to a ſinner coming to Chriſt:</p>
               <p>1. A deep ſenſe of his ſin and miſery.</p>
               <p>2. An utter deſpair of himſelf, and all things elſe
beſides Chriſt.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>A deep ſenſe of his ſin and miſery:</hi> No man
will regard a Saviour, that doth not ſee himſelf a
Sinner: The whole regard not the Phyſitian,
Therefore it is ſaid, That the Spirit of God, when
he ſhould come to Chrſtianize the World, ſhould
in the firſt place convince the World of ſin; <hi>John</hi>
16. 8. He ſhall convince the World of ſin, he ſhall
demonſtrate them Sinners, bring up their ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Eyes, bring home their ſins upon their
Conſciences, and make them ſee themſelves, and
feel themſelves the moſt vile and abominable of
creatures: Sin hides it ſelf from the ſinners eyes,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:153036:106"/>
and all its vileneſs and deformity; or if it come in
ſight, it preſents it ſelf to the ſinner, as the Witch
of <hi>Endor</hi> brought up the Devil before <hi>Saul</hi> in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi>
Mantle: It ſhews it ſelf as the ſinners god:
Look how many ſins evil men have, ſo many gods
they have riſing up to them. Their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ins are their
gods; the gods that feed them, they make a living
of their ſins; the gods that comfort and refreſh
them, they take pleaſure in iniquity; the gods that
ſhelter them and hide them, they ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their wickedneſs. But now the Spirit of
God plucks off the mantle, and makes ſin appear to
be ſin; makes all the ſinners Gods appear to be ſo
many Devils: brings forth the blackneſs and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
of ſin into ſight, makes the ſinner to ſee
himſelf an unclean and abominable thing: And
withal, he brings forth the guilt of ſin, ſets all theſe
Devils a tormenting the ſinner, filling him with fear
and terrour, and amazement. In this reſpect he is
called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the Spirit of Bondage, that works
fear and trouble in the heart: The Spirit awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſleepy ſinner, is a kind of awakening in Hell.
Lord where am I! What mean theſe Legions round
about me? Theſe Chains and Fetters that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me? What means the black Roll before mine
eyes, of curſes, and wrath, and woes! Lord where
am I! Have I been playing, and ſporting, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

is there no hope of eſcaping out of this wretched
ſtate? I ſee there is no abiding thus, I am but a dead
man if I continue as <hi>I</hi> am. What may I do to be
ſaved?</p>
               <p>And when he is brought to this, there is ſome
way made for his entertainment of Chriſt: Yea
this is not all that is needful, but he muſt further
be brought to,</p>

2 <hi>An utter deſpair of himſelf, and all things elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Chriſt.</hi> Being made ſenſible of his ſin and his
danger, a ſinner will look out for help and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
but he will look every where elſe, before he
will look unto Chriſt: Nothing will bring in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to Chriſt, but an abſolute neceſſity. He will try
to forſake his ſins, will think of leaving his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs
and becoming ſober; of leaving his adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and becoming chaſte, and ſo ſee if by this means
be may not eſcape. He will go to Prayers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and Sacrament, and ſearch out if there be not
ſalvation in them: but all theſe though they be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in their places, yet looking no further, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſees there is no help in them: His righteouſneſs
cannot help him, this is but rags; his duties cannot
help him, theſe may be reckoned among his ſins:
Ordinances cannot help, theſe are but empty Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and all tell him you knock at a wrong door,
ſalvation is not in us. Well, the Lord be merciful
to me, faith the Sinner, What ſhall I do? Abide as I
am, I dare not, and how to help my ſelf, I know not;
my praying will not help me, my hearing will not
help me; if I give all my goods to the Poor, if I
ſhould give my body to be burned, all this would
not ſave my ſoul: Wo is me, what ſhall I do, and
whether ſhall <hi>I</hi> go! And now, being brought to
this diſtreſs, to this utter loſs, his deſpair drives him
to the onely door of hope that is left open. Then
Chriſt will be accepted, when he ſees none but
Chriſt can ſtead him: The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
23. <hi>We were kept under the Law (ſhut up unto the
Faith) that ſhould afterwards be revealed:</hi> All other
doors were ſhut up againſt, there was no hope
of eſcaping, but by that one door that was left,
open, <hi>The Faith that was afterwards to be revealed.</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:153036:107"/>

are ſhut up unto that door, to which (if there had
been any other way open) they would never have

1 That he appoint you your work, that he put
you to whatſoever he pleaſeth; ſervants, as they
muſt do their Maſters work, ſo they muſt do that
work which their Maſter appoints them, they muſt
be for any work their Maſter hath for them to do;
they muſt not pick and chuſe, this <hi>I</hi> will do, and that
<hi>I</hi> will not dot; they muſt not ſay, this is too hard,
or this is too mean, or this may be well enough let
alone. Good ſervants when they have choſen their
Maſter, will let their Maſter chuſe their work, and
will not diſpute his Will, but do it.</p>
               <p>Chriſt hath many ſervices to be done, ſome are
more eaſie and honourable, others more difficult
and diſgraceful; ſome are ſutable to our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and intereſts, others are contrary to both: In
ſome we may pleaſe Chriſt, and pleaſe our ſelves, as
when he requires us to feed and cloath our ſelves, to
provide things honeſt for our own maintenance;
yea, and ther are ſome ſpiritual duties that are
more pleaſing then others; as to rejoyce in the
Lord, to be bleſſing and praiſing of God, to be feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our ſelves with the delights and comforts of
Religion; theſe are the ſweet works of a Chriſtian,
But then, there are other works wherein we cannot
pleaſe Chriſt, but by denying our ſelves; as giving
and lending, bearing and forbearing, reproving men
for their ſins, withdrawing from their ſocieties,
witneſſing againſt their wickedneſs, owning and
confeſſing Chriſt and his Name, when 'twill coſt us
ſhame and reproach; ſailing againſt the wind, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
againſt the tide, ſteering contrary to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and diſpoſition of the times; pinching upon
the fleſh, parting with our eaſe, our liberties, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and accommodations for the Name of our
Lord Jeſus, with much work of this kind.</p>

what your ſins a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You that are ſincerely come within the bonds of
this Covenant of the Lord; the Lord is henceforth
become your God, Chriſt is henceforth become
your Saviour, you have ſhot the Gulf; that good
work is begun, which the Lord will perform to the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:153036:116"/>
day of Chriſt; you are gotten within the gate, you
are entred into the Path of Life.</p>
               <p>2 In the next place therefore, <hi>I</hi> ſhall give ſome
advice to the godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or thoſe that are already in
Chriſt, whom <hi>I</hi> ſhall direct:</p>
               <p>1 To a right performance of holy duties; theſe
four duties eſpecially, Prayer, holy Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Self-examination, and renewing their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>2 To a right improvement of holy Duties.</p>
               <p>3 To the carrying on an holy courſe.</p>
               <p>In all which, though <hi>I</hi> ſhall apply my ſelf eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to thoſe that are in Chriſt, yet <hi>I</hi> ſhall alſo
give ſome farther helps to thoſe that are yet out of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>I</hi> ſhall enter upon the Directions for the
right performance of holy Duties, it will not, <hi>I</hi>
hope, be loſt labour, if <hi>I</hi> prefix a word of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to duty, by laying before you the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which holy duties will have upon the carrying
on a holy life, which <hi>I</hi> ſhall diſpatch in theſe four
particulars.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Duties are the exerciſe of Grace.</hi> Grace out of
exerciſe grows quickly out of caſe; Idleneſs breed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
ill humours and diſeaſes in the body, and no leſs
in the ſoul; ſtirring keeps us warm and healthful.
Now Duties are the ſtirrings and exerciſes of the
ſoul. Reading of the word is not the exerciſe of the
eye onely, but of the underſtanding; Prayer is not
an exerciſe of the tongue onely, but of the heart;
it ſets all the faculties of the ſoul on work, it ſets
the ſeveral graces on work, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſets faith on work,
it ſets hope and holy deſires on work; and grace
kept in action, will be by ſo much the more
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:153036:116"/>
active and powerful in the whole courſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>2 <hi>In Duties we have an intimate converſe with
God:</hi> Therefore they are ſometimes called, <hi>Our
drawing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in them them that come nigh me.</hi> Sometimes, <hi>Our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God,</hi> Amos 4. 12 <hi>Prepare to meet thy God,
O Iſrael;</hi> to meet with a <hi>Preſent,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> met his
angry Brother; to meet him with a <hi>Prayer,</hi> and
ſupplication, <hi>Exod. 25. 32. There will I meet thee;</hi>
when the Saints go up to meet the Lord, the Lord
comes down to give them a meeting: Sometimes,
<hi>Our viſiting of God, Iſay 26. 16. In their trouble they
have viſited thee.</hi> When God viſiteth his people with
a <hi>Rod,</hi> they viſit him with a <hi>Prayer;</hi> when we come
to Duty as we ought, we put our ſelves under Gods
eye, we ſet the Lord before our face, it's neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the right performance of Duties, that we
have right and clear apprehenſions of God, deep
impreſſions of the Majeſty of God, of his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
Omnipreſence, Holineſs, Goodneſs and
Faithfulneſs upon our hearts; This is required in
that forementioned expreſſion, <hi>I will be ſanctified in
them that come nigh me.</hi> Now what an influence will
this have upon the upholding and carrying on the
life of God in us, to have daily ſuch a ſight of God
before our eyes, and ſuch a ſenſe of God upon our
hearts.</p>
               <p>3 In Duties we obtain new ſupplies, and freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
from God. <hi>The flouriſhing ſtate of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
is ſet forth,</hi> Iſay 58. 11. <hi>by a</hi> well-watered Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
<hi>and</hi> Jer. 31. 12. <hi>it is promiſed,</hi> They ſhall
come and flow together to the goodneſs of the Lord for
Wheat, and for Corn, and for Wine, and for Oyl.
And their ſoul ſhall be as a well-watered Garden:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:153036:117"/>
Where obſerve theſe three things:</p>
               <p>1 That the watering of the ſoul is from the
goodneſs of the Lord; all the dews and ſhowers of
Grace are from above, our Springs do not riſe in our
own Gardrns: <hi>All my Springs are in thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 All the influences of the grace and goodneſs of
the Lord, are gotten down by your applying
your ſelves to him in duty: That is the meaning of
that expreſſion, <hi>They ſhall flow together to the goodneſs
of the Lord,</hi> they ſhall aſſemble and come together to
ſeek the Lord.</p>
               <p>3 The People of God in their addreſſes to him
in Duty, though it be but for a ſupply of things
temporal, do get ſomething for their ſouls; <hi>They
ſhall come for Wheat, and for Wine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And their (ſouls)
ſhall be as a well-watered Garden.</hi> We never come to
pray for any temporal mercy, and pray as we ſhould,
but our ſouls are gainers thereby. A Chriſtian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come near the Throne of Grace for any thing,
bot his heart hath a ſhare in the Bleſſing. And there
are three Reaſons for it.</p>
               <p>1 A Chriſtian never prays for temporal mercies,
but he hath ſome words or other to ſpeak for his
ſoul.</p>
               <p>2 Prayer, whatever it be for, is the ſouls draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nigh to God, and exerciſing it ſelf on God:
And the ſoul never goes to God, but it brings back
ſomething of God upon it, even then when it may
be denied the temporal mercy it ſeeks: As when a
Saint is praying for a Sinner, and God will not
hear him for that Sinner, yet he loſes not that
Prayer, but hath it returned into his own boſome.
So when the ſoul is praying for the concernments
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:153036:117"/>
of the outward man, though it be denied in its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
requeſt, yet its prayer ſhall not be loſt to it
ſelf.</p>
               <p>3 Temporal mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies obtained as a return of
prayer, are <hi>ſoul-bleſſings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now when the matter of our requeſts is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
for our ſouls: When Grace is that we come
for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when love, and life, and zeal, and ſpiritual
ſtrength, is that we come for: when the watering
of a dry and barren, and the refreſhing of a weary
heart, is that we ſeek for, ſhall our ſouls then be ſent
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Our hearts are as <hi>Ciſterns,</hi> which however ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

Chriſt, ſtudying the Goſpel, ſearching and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Promiſes, would quickly get thee into a
better plight. He that is much with God, is rich
in grace. Thou art not ſo much ſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

there is a Well, that hath not onely water enough,
healing water, but Wine, and Milk, and Honey e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
but thou muſt go oftner for it. if thou wilt
have the benefit of it; Go therefore, and let down
thy Pitcher, and thou needeſt not fear its coming up
empty. Onely in exerciſing thy ſelf in duty, take
heed thou miſtake not the Pitcher for the Well;
take heed thou fix not thine eye on duty, as if this
were thy Chriſt, thy Fountain out of which thou
mayeſt be ſupplyed. Duties are but the pipes, it is
the Lord that is the Fountain from whence all the
water comes.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>Duties are our conflicting with corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
ſtriving againſt ſin.</hi> When ever we are ſtriving with
God, we are thereby ſtriving againſt ſin. Duty
and ſin contend for the Victory; whileſt Duty holds
up, ſin goes down: when Duty flags, ſin gets up.
Holy Prayer will make us weary of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Generation of carnal men, a little of it muſt ſerve

               <p>There is no ſuch way for Chriſtians to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
on ſin, and to ſee their deſires on this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,

his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under their oppreſſing <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he will
ariſe and relieve them. Chriſtians tell one another,
how ſad it is with them, what woful work they have

the right performance of the Duty of Prayer; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I ſhall give you touching this, take in theſe four
particulars.</p>
               <p>1. Bring your ſelves, and hold your ſelves to a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

<hi>a right performance:</hi> Thoſe that pray not, or but
ſeldome, is a ſhrewd ſigne that the root of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is not in them; they that can live without
prayer are <hi>dead while they are alive:</hi> Prayer is the
firſt fruits of Chriſtianity: It was ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:153036:119"/>
and as it is a token of life, ſo it is a meanes by which
this New Life is nouriſhed. Prayer is a Chriſtians
Key to unlock the Store-houſes and the Treaſuries
of Souls, he that can pray, God hath given
him a Key to all his Treaſuries. Prayer will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unlock the Clouds as <hi>Elijahs</hi> prayer did, and
bring down Rain to refreſh the dry and parched
Earth, but it will unlock Heaven too. It will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
the Ark and the Mercy-ſeat, and get downe
Spiritual bleſſinge on the Soul: Praying is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
knocking at the Gate of Heaven, that knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which the promiſe is made, <hi>Matthew</hi> 7. 7.
<hi>Knock and it ſhall be opened.</hi> The word which the
Lord ſpeakes to us is Gods knocking at our doores;
<hi>Rev. 3. 20. Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock.</hi>
And praying is our knocking at the Lords door, at
the Gate of Heaven, that this may be opened. By
the way learn, that if you will not hear God knock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it is juſt to hear not yours. If Gods voice may not
be heard on Earth, your voice will not be heard in
Heaven; fear not, you ſhall be heard, if you will hear;
hear him that ſpeaks to you from Heaven, and your
cry ſhall enter into Heaven.</p>
               <p>Our Soules will never thrive or flouriſh, unleſs
the Rain and the Showers of Heavenly Grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
and fall upon them, and we cannot look that
thoſe Showers ſhould come down, unleſs we look
up.</p>
               <p>Perſons that pray not, may be written among the
Heathens, <hi>Jer. 10. 25. Pour out thy fury upon the
Heathen, and the Families that call not on thy Name.</hi>
Among the Prophane ones of the Earth, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed

               </p>
               <p>Where Prayer is not, there is uſually curſing and
ſwearing, and every abomination; look upon the
non-praying perſons, look upon the non-praying fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
among you, and ſee how little good there is to
be found; ſee if they be not as ſo many dead and
dry Trees, on which no Spiritual fruit appears, as
ſo many dark holes, into which no Spiritual light doth
ever ſhine, as ſo many filthy ſinks, in which every vile
thing lodges.</p>
               <p>Beloved, I have often preſſed this Duty on you,
both <hi>perſonal ſecret Prayer,</hi> that there be not one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
found among you that prayes not; and <hi>Family
joynt Prayer,</hi> that there be not one Family found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, among whom God is not thus worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
I have often preſſed this upon you, and given
you particular helps and Directions about it, and
have not been negligent to put you in remembrance
of it, ſo that if there be prayerleſs perſons or fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
found among you, the guilt of it muſt lie at your
own doors.</p>
               <p>But will you yet hearken to me in this thing?
Will you give your ſelves to prayer? No word that
is ſpoken to you for the good of your Soules, will
ever proſper with you, if this Word proſper not,
it is in vain for me to perſwade you to live a Godly
life, if you will not be perſwaded to live a praying
life. Would you ever come to any thing, ſee then

and ſet your time; ſet your times, and keep your

pray alwayes, every day, and every hour; as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

               <p>Brethren, <hi>I</hi> ſay again, if you will not ſuffer me to

labour of ſpeaking any other things to you, wherein
I ſhall have no hope of ſucceſs, if I ſpeed not here:
Some among you in ſome private Conferences I have
had with you, have given me ſome good hopes of the
work of grace begun upon your hearts: I have found
that there hath been ſtil a neglect of daily prayer, this
hath ſtruck ſuch a damp upon my ſpirit, as hath
brought down thoſe hopes to be even almoſt as low
as nothing, and by experience I have found, that
ſuch perſons, as upon advice and warning would not
afterwards be brought to the conſtant exerciſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
this duty, if they have retained any favour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
at all, have yet from year to year been at a ſtand,
and not the leaſt ſign of any improvement hath been
to be ſeen. If ever therefore you will hearken to me
in any thing that I tender for your ſouls good, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me not in this, ſet upon the daily exerciſe of
ſecret prayer; and if you be reſolved on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
I ſhall then be encouraged in the next
place to help you on in the right performance.
Therefore.</p>

               <p>Do not barely impoſe this duty upon you, as your
task, but excite and encourage your ſelves to it, by
looking for a return: think what it is that you would
have, and look to receive it: The reaſon why we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
no more in prayer, is, becauſe we expect no
more: God uſually anſwers us according to our own
hearts: Narrow hearts and low expectations have
uſually as little as they look for or deſire: large expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
are ordinarily anſwered with large returns:
Expectation will put life into action; you will then
pray with moſt enlarged hearts, when you are moſt
full of hopes, the reward that is looked for in the
Evening will much encourage and quicken the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of the day, fear not to expect too much from
Heaven: Be not ſtraitned in in your own Bowels;
and you ſhall not be ſtraitned in the God of bowels:
open thy Mouth wide and he will fill it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
upbraid his Beggars for looking for too great an
Almes; he hath enough to ſupply them, and he hath
a heart to beſtow it: God will never ſay to you, <hi>you
are too bold, you ask too much; too much Grace, too
much holineſs, why cannot leſs content you?</hi> God hath
given you commiſſion to ask what you will, not to
the one half, but the whole of his Kingdome; the
Kingdome you ſhall have, if no leſs will ſerve your
turn.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians be thankfull for every little you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
but look for much: be thankful for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
little, every little received from God is
much: A drop from that Fountain is worth
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:153036:121"/>
the World, yet content not your ſelves with ſome
drops, when, if you will, the Fountain may be yours.
The King of Glory loves to give like a King, and will
never ſay, <hi>This is too much, either for a King to give,
or a Beggar to receive;</hi> Since he hath given you leave,
ſpare not to ſpeak in large your deſires, and let your
Eye be as big as your Belly. God hath promiſed you,
and therefore you may promiſe your ſelves; whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you ask (that is good for you) you ſhall not ask
in vain. Oh, if we had ſo much in our Eye when we
come before the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> we ſhould be oftner
there, and yet ſtill return with our load. Well Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
remember this when ever you come to begg,
look to receive, come not to prayer as to dry breaſt

               <p>Though the Breaſts be full, yet they muſt be drawn

he hath furniſhed us with, to preſs him withal, but he

weapons. The counſel I give you in this is, Plead
hard with God, but plead with him upon his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments;
there are amongſt many others, theſe four
grounds on which to bottom your plea:
<list>
                     <item>1. On God himſelf.</item>
                     <item>2. On Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>3. On the Promiſes.</item>

               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:153036:121"/>
1. On God himſelf. And there are two ſpecial
things, from which you may plead here.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>His gracious Nature.</hi> Fetch your Arguments
by which you plead with God for Mercy thence,
whence he originally fetched his Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
himſelf to ſhew mercy; from his own bowels,
from his gracious nature, from his natural goodneſs
and gracious inclination to mercy, <hi>John 3. 16. God ſo
loved the world, that he grve his onely Son &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 1.
5. to <hi>verſ. 10. Having predeſtinated us to the adoption
of Children by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, (according
to the good pleaſure of his Will) to the praiſe of the
glory of his Grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in
the beloved; in whom we have redemption through his
blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins, (according to the
riches of his Grace) wherein he hath (abounded) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us in all wiſdome and prudence, having made
known unto us the myſtery of his Will, according to
his good pleaſure which he hath purpoſed of himſelf:</hi>
Here we have heaped up in a few <hi>words</hi> the Riches of
Mercy which God hath beſtowed on his People.
Chriſt his beloved, Redemption through Chriſt, and
the forgiveneſs of our ſins, the adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
acceptance in his fight, the Revelation of the
Myſtery of his Will, or the diſcovering or making
known theſe glorious mercies to us. But whence
is all this, who is it, or what was it, that perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Lord to this aboundant kindneſs? Why,
all this aroſe from himſelf, <hi>He purpoſed it in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
He conſulted no other Argument, but what
he found in his own heart: it was from his <hi>love,
the-good pleaſure of his Will, his Grace, the Riches
of his Grace, wherein he hath abounded towards us,</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:153036:122"/>
Hoſea 11. 8, 9. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up Ephraim?
How ſhall I deliver thee up Iſrael?</hi> I cannot do it:
I will not do it. <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſs
of mine anger, I will not destroy Ephraim.</hi> But why
wilt thou be angry, Lord, why wilt thou not
deſtroy <hi>Ephraim?</hi> Oh, ſayes the Lord, Mine heart
is turned within me; my heart ſayes, Spare him,
my Bowels ſay, Deſtroy him not. <hi>I am God, and not
Man.</hi> I love him, and my love is the love of a
God. I have compaſſion on him, and my compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is the pity of a God: I will bear with him, I
am a God of Patience: Love is my nature, Pity,
and Mercy, and Compaſſion are my nature: <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deſtroy <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> muſt deny mine own
Nature, Love, and Pity, and Mercy, and Goodneſs are
eſſential to God: He can as ſoon ceaſe to be
God as to be Gracious, and this is the Fountain
of all our Mercy; Hence Chriſt ſprung, hence the
Goſpel came, and all the Unſearchable Riches of
Mercy, prepared for poor, loſt, and undone crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>When you come to pray, fetch your Arguments
hence: Plead with the Lord upon his own nature,
his Natural Love, Grace and Goodneſs. Thus we
finde the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> praying for the Chriſtians to
whom he wrote, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. [<hi>The God of all
Grace] make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle
you.</hi> Plead with the Lord in your Prayers, as the
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> pleades with himſelf in his Affliction,
<hi>Pſalm 77. 7, &amp;c. Will the Lord caſt off for ever,
and will he be favourable no more? Is his Mercy
clean gone for ever, hath God forgotten to be Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
hath he in anger ſhut up his tender Mercies?
Is (his) Mercy clean gone? Hath (God) forgotton
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:153036:122"/>
to be gracious?</hi> That men ſhould be mercileſs;
that men ſhould forget themſelves, and their
Friends in their low eſtate, is no ſuch wonder
But hath God, who is all Grace, all Mercy, all
Pity, hath God forgotten? Doth Mercy ceaſe to
be merciful, Grace ceaſe to be gracious; do
Compaſſions ceaſe to be pitiful? Hath God not
onely forgotten his ſervant, but forgotten himſelf?
Remember thy ſelf, Lord, thine own Heart, thine
own Soul, and according to it, remember
me.</p>
               <p>2. His glorious Name. <hi>The Lords Nature is
to be gracious, and according to his Nature
ſuch is his Name, Exod.</hi> 34. 6. The Lord, the Lord
God merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
in goodneſs and truth. <hi>This is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which the Lord puts into the mouths of
his People, telling them, Ezek.</hi> 36. 21, 22. I had
pity for my Holy Name; this I do, not for your ſakes,
but for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y Holy Names ſake. <hi>And upon this we
find them frequently pleading with him,</hi> Pſal.
31. 3. For thy Names ſake lead me, and guide me.
<hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 21. Do not abhor us, for thy Names ſake;
do not diſgrace the Throne of thy Glory, remember, break
not thy Covenant with us. <hi>Go you and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 <hi>On Chriſt.</hi> And there are <hi>four things</hi> from
which you may plead with God upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>The Lords giving of Chriſt to you as your Lord, and
your Saviour.</hi> Upon which gift you may call him
your own.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>The Purchaſe of Chriſt:</hi> who hath bought
from the hands of the Father, all that you ſtand

in need of: He hath bought your <hi>Lives,</hi> 1 Cor. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>The Intereſt that Chriſt hath in the Father;</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.
1, <hi>Behold my Servant whom I have choſen, mine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
in whom my ſoul delighteth;</hi> whoſe Name is ſo
precious, and powerful with the Father, that it will
carry any ſuit, obtain any requeſt, <hi>Job. 16. 23. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you ask the Father in my Name, he will give it
you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 <hi>The Intereſt that you have in Chriſt.</hi> As he is
precious to his Father, ſo you are precious to
him; as the Father can deny him nothing, ſo he
can deny his nothing, John 14. 13, <hi>Whatſoever
you ſhall ask the Father in my Name, I will do it.</hi>
He gives you Commiſſion to put his Name upon
all your requeſts, and whatſoever prayer comes up
with his Name upon it, he will procure it an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>Now when you are praying for any mercy,
eſpecially for any Soul-mercie, make uſe of all
theſe arguments: Lord, Haſt thou given Chriſt
unto me, and wilt thou not with him give me
all things I ſtand in need of? Haſt thou given
me the Fountain, and wilt thou deny me the
Stream? When I beg pardon of ſin, when I beg
power againſt ſin, when I beg Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is
not all this granted me, in thy gift of Chriſt to
me? Is Chriſt mine, and is not his bloud mine,
to procure my pardon? his Spirit mine, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
mine iniquities? Are theſe mine, and wilt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:153036:123"/>
thou with-hold them from me? Oh, ſhall this
guilt lie upon me, theſe ſins live in me, theſe loſts
rule over me, when by giving me in hand that
whereof thou haſt already given me a grant, all
this would be removed from me? Look, upon
Chriſt, Lord; Thou haſt ſaid to me, <hi>Look unto
Jeſue</hi> and give thy ſervant leave to ſay the ſame
to thee, <hi>Look thou upon Jeſus,</hi> and give out to
me, what thou haſt given me, in giving of him
to me. Look upon the purchaſe of Chriſt; Do I
want any thing, or deſire any thing, but what my
Lord hath bought and paid for, and thou haſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of the price? Look upon the Name of
Chriſt, which thou mayeſt behold written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every prayer I make; Though thou mayeſt
ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, <hi>for thy own ſake</hi> thou ſhalt have nothing, not
a drop, not a crumb, yet wilt thou ſay, <hi>nor for
his Name ſake neither?</hi> Is not that Name ſtill
a mighty Name, a precious Name before the
Lord? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By theſe hints you may learn, how
to plead with God from any other arguments,
drawn from his promiſes, your experience,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But of what uſe is this our pleading with

of God, to prevail with him to do that for us,
which before he reſolved not to do; but to
bring forth his purpoſes into performance. We

praying fetches out thoſe mercies which were in the

               <p>2. By pleading with God for audience, we plead
our ſelves into credence, or the more firm belief the
Lord acceps and will anſwer. And if by all theſe
Arguments, we can plead our ſelves into<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Theſe Arguments the Saints may uſe
In Prayer: but is there no plea for poor <hi>natural men,</hi>
that are yet in their ſins, to make uſe of? What may
they ſay themſelves, when they come before the
Lord? Have you never a word to put in their mouths?
They have more need of Arguments then any; What
ſhall they ſay?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. 1. I</hi> ſhall premiſe, That its the duty of
meer natural men to pray; For, 1. Prayer is a
part of Gods Natural Worſhip. If there were no
poſitive Law requiring it, yet the Law of Nature
enjoynes it, and no man is exempted from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of the Law of Nature. 2. Otherwiſe it
were none of their ſin to neglect and reſtrain Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion. Now
we finde in Scripture, that neglect of Prayer is reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
up amongſt wicked mens ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 3. 4.
<hi>They are altogether become filthy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they call not upon
God.</hi> Sin, though it doth diſable, yet it doth not
diſoblige to Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> That which is uſually objected againſt this
is, <hi>God heareth not ſinners; The ſacrifice of the wicked is
an abomination to the Lord:</hi> Now, no man is bound
to offer up to God an abominable thing; better
offer up nothing, than an abomination.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> In anſwer to this, conſider, There are
two ſorts of ſinners, <hi>Reſolved Sinners,</hi> and <hi>Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sinners;</hi> and accordingly there are two ſorts
of Prayers made by Sinners, 1. <hi>Diſſembling pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
mocking and lying Prayers, <hi>Hoſ. 11. 12. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim
compaſſeth me about with lyes;</hi> lying Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,

and to make them appear to men to be
righteous, or elſe as an <hi>Engine or Device,</hi> to quiet
and pacifie their conſciences in a courſe of ſin.
They make confeſſing of ſin, to ſerve inſtead of
forſaking of ſin; praying, to ſerve inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting;
their prayers help them to ſin the more
freely; They think they may go out with any

                  </gap>g, if when they have done iniquity, they do
but pray for forgiveneſs; Such prayers are an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination
to God, and a deſolation to ſinners.
<hi>Bring me no more vain Oblations, Incenſe is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to me.</hi> Sinners, not onely your wickedneſs,
but your very prayers will undo you. If you make
them a ſhelter for ſin, your very prayers will be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into ſin.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Returning Prayers.</hi> When a Sinner, being
ſtruck with a ſenſe of his ſin, and of his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of changing his way, and of his utter inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to turne of himſelf, under the fears and
troubles of his heart, goes to God, and cryes out,
Lord, what ſhall <hi>I</hi> do? <hi>I</hi> ſee <hi>I</hi> am in an evil caſe
my ſoul is running on in ſin, and they curſe and
wrath <hi>I</hi> behold running on upon me; Lord, ſave
me; Lord, help me; Lord, pardon, Lord convert

me, break me off from my ſins, break me off from
my ſinful companions; I cannot get looſe, my
heart is too hard, my luſts are too ſtrong, my
Temptations are too many for me to overcome of
my ſelf; Lord help me, turn me and I ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
pluck my foot out of the ſnare that I be not
utterly deſtroyed: forgive mine iniquity, make
me a clean heart, make me thy childe, make me
thy ſervant, that I may never again yield up my
ſelf a ſervant to ſin; Such a prayer as this, if it be
hearty and and in earneſt; if there be no
promiſe of audience, yet at leaſt there is an <hi>half
promiſe; Who can tell?</hi> Or, it may be the Lord may
hear. Though it cannot be properly ſaid, the
Lord doth accept, neither can any man ſay, he
will reject it as an abominable thing: This being

               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And there are two things in Chriſt,
upon which ſinners may plead with God.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>His Sufficiency.</hi> There is enough in Chriſt,
in his obedience and death, to ſave the worſt of
ſinners, to ſave the whole World of Sinners,
There is a fulneſſe in Chriſt, Col. 1. 19. <hi>It pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell.</hi>
There is a fulneſſe of <hi>Merit</hi> to obtain pardon,
to make reconciliation for whoever comes; a
fulneſſe of the Spirit to Sanctifie, and cleanſe
them from their ſins; <hi>He's able to ſave unto the
uttermoſt, all thoſe that come unto God by him.</hi>
From this, Sinners may reaſon thus with the
Lord. O Lord, <hi>I</hi> do not come to beg that of
thee, that cannot be had; Thou haſt enough by
thee; Look upon Jeſus that ſits at thy right hand,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> there not Righteouſneſſe enough in him, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

riches enough in him, to ſupply my povertie?
Oh, ſhall <hi>I</hi> die for want of a pardon, when there
is ſuch blood continually before thee, pleading for
pardon! Oh, ſhall I lie down in my own vomit,
and wallow in the mire of my filthie luſts, when
there is ſuch a Fountain by thee, that's ſtill open
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:153036:126"/>
for ſin and for uncleanneſſe! Oh ſprinkle me with
this blood. O waſh me in this Fountain. Hear
Lord, ſend me not away without an Almes, when
haſt it by thee.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>His Office:</hi> which is <hi>to bring ſinners to God, to
make reconciliation for ſinners, to make interceſſion
for Tranſgreſſors,</hi> Iſa. 53. Pſal. 68. 18. <hi>Thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
gifts for men, yea even for the rebellious alſo.</hi>
What a ſtrange and mighty Plea is here for poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners!
Oh, it is true Lord, I am a Tranſgreſſor, and
have been from the Womb: I have played the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and been a Rebel againſt thee all my dayes: But
is there none in Heaven that will i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tercede for a
Tranſgreſſor? Hath the Lord Jeſus received no gift
for this poor Rebel, that falls down before thee?
Though I am a Rebel, Lord, yet I am a returning
Rebel: Though <hi>I</hi> am a Rebel, yet let me recieve a
Rebels gift, not a Rebels reward, Lord, that would
be dreadful, but ſome of thoſe gifts which Chriſt
received for the Rebellious. Doth Chriſt make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
for Tranſgreſſors, and ſhall not he be
heard? If thou wilt not hear me who am a ſinner,
yet wilt thou not hear him that ſpeaks for ſinners,
whoſe blood ſpeaks, whoſe bowels ſpeak, whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſpeaks? Doth he ſpeak for ſinners, and yet not for
me?</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Their own neceſſity;</hi> Sinners are neceſſitous
Creatures, they have nothing of value left them,
<hi>In the fulneſſe of their ſufficiency they are in ſtraits;</hi>
As a ſinner of an hundred years is but a child, ſo
a ſinner of thouſands by the year is but a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;

want nothing, and yet doth want every thing

bruiſes, and putrifying ſores: Is this thy caſe, ſinner,
and haſt thou nothing to ſay? Spread thy wants
and neceſſities before the Lord, and let theſe ſpeak
for thee: Learn of Beggars that come to thy door,
who if they have ever a ſore or malady about them,
a blinde eye, a lame leg, a burnt hand, a broken arm,
that they will be ſure to open, to move pity and
procure an Alms. Their pinching hunger, their

               <p>Sinner, ſpread thy neceſſities before the Lord,
ſpread thy wants, open thy wounds and thy ſores,
tell him how deſperately ſad thy caſe is, tell him
of the guilt that is upon thy head, the curſe that
is on thy back, the plague that is in thy heart: God
of Bowels look hither, behold what a poor, blind,
dead, hardned, unclean, guilty creature, what a
naked, empty, helpleſſe creature <hi>I</hi> am: Look upon
my ſin and my miſery, and let thine eye affect
thine heart: <hi>One deep calls to another,</hi> a deep of
Miſery cries out to a deep of Mercy. Oh my
very ſins, which cry ſo loud againſt me, ſpeak alſo
for me. My miſery ſpeaks, my curſes, the woe
and the wrath that lies upon me; my bones ſpeak,
my periſhing Soul ſpeaks, and all cry in thine ears,
Help Lord, God of pity help, help and heal me,
help and ſave me: <hi>Come unto me, for I am a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

man, O Lord:</hi> I dare not ſay as once it was ſaid,
<hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man.</hi> Come Lord,
for I am a ſinful man. Thou couldſt never come
where is more need; Who have need of the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
but the ſick? Come Lord; I have too often ſaid
<hi>Depart from me,</hi> but if thou wilt not ſay, <hi>Depart,</hi>
to me, I hope <hi>I</hi> ſhall never again ſay, <hi>Depart,</hi> to thee;
My miſery ſaith come, my wants ſay come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my guilt
and my ſins ſay come, and my ſoul ſaith come; Come
and pardon, come and convert, come and teach, come
and ſanctifie, come and ſave me; Even ſo come Lord
Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the ſinners plea. Poor Sinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Art thou willing to return from thy ſins, fear not to
go to thy God. Take thee ſome ſuch words as theſe,
and go and tell the Lord, that one of his poor Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
told thee from him, that he expects thee
before the Throne of Grace, and is ready if it be
not thine own fault, to grant thee mercy. Go, and
the Lord help thee, give thee thy hearts deſire, and
fulfil all thy mind, and for thy encouragement take
along with thee this Scripture, <hi>Iſa. 55. 6. Seek ye
the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he
is near; Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and
he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for be will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandantly
pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>Pray in Faith,</hi> James 1. 6. <hi>But let him ask
in Faith.</hi> You will here enquire; What Faith is
it that is neceſſary to our prevailing in prayer?
<hi>I</hi> anſwer; Not onely the Faith mentioned by the
Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 11. 6. He that cemeth to God must
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:153036:128"/>
believe that God is;</hi> Nor onely a perſwaſion that he
is able to performe our petitions, or that he is ready
to anſwer thoſe that ſeek him aright, nor onely a
perſwaſion concerning prayer, that this is Gods
Ordinance, appointed by him as a means whereby
we may obtain mercy from him: Though all this
be included in it, yet this is not all. The ſame faith
is neceſſary to the acceptance of our prayers,
which is required to the acceptance of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
That faith which gives a perſon intereſt in
Chriſt, will alone procure the acceptance of his
prayers.</p>
               <p>Now this faith puts forth in prayer a three-fold
Act.</p>
               <p>1. It preſents and offers up the prayer in the
Name of Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 11. 4. By faith</hi> Abel <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Sacrifice.</hi> Faith carries our Prayers to our
Mediator, the great <hi>Maſter of Requeſts,</hi> for
his hand to be put to them, without which they
will not be regarded; yea, it puts them into his
hand, it ſaies unto Chriſt, Lord Jeſus, take thou
this prayer, what infirmities there are in it, do
thou cover; what ſinnes thou findeſt in them, do
thou hide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Mingle thy blood with my Sacrifice,</hi>
let thine incenſe aſcend with my offering, and thus
let it be carried before the Throne of Grace, where
that it may ſpeak for me, let thy blood ſpeak
for it.</p>
               <p>2. It depends and relies upon God through
Chriſt for acceptance and performance. It eyes
and leans upon the Promiſe of God, which in
Chriſt is <hi>Yea and Amen;</hi> and ſetting to its ſeal, that
God is true, upon this it ſtayes it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:153036:128"/>
3. It works the heart to a confidence, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
perſwaſion, that God for Chriſts ſake will
hear and anſwer, 1 <hi>John 5. 14. This is the confidence
that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according
to his will, he heareth us:</hi> But here conſider
that this confident perſwaſion, that God doth hear
and accept us, however it ar gues an higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Faith, and brings in much Peace and
Comfort to the heart; and if it be well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is a good Argument that the Lord intends
to fulfil our deſires; yet is it not ſo neceſſary to
the acceptance of our Prayers, but that they
may be heard where this is wanting. If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Acts have been put forth; if there hath been
a preſenting them in the hands of our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour,
joyned with ſome little ſtaying of our
hearts upon the Promiſe; though there be a great
fear upon the ſpirit, that God doth not regard
them, yet for all this they may not be rejected. I
fear, ſaith a doubting Saint, <hi>I</hi> fear the Lord will
not hear me, nor regard my prayers; there is ſo
much ſin in them, ſo many weakneſſes, wandrings,
diſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſts, diſtractions, that I much doubt whether
the Holy God will ever have reſpect to them; but
ſuch as they are, there I leave them, in the hands
of my Advocate; I leave mine Offering on the
Altar; as poor as it is, it is the beſt <hi>I</hi> have; and
though I much queſtion, whether it will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
yet there I leave it, waiting what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Lord will give. I doubt not but ſuch
a Prayer will be heard, and my ground is this,
as it is the juſtification or acceptance of our
perſons, ſo it is in the acceptance of our duties;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:153036:129"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> our perſon, will doubt
leſs juſtifie our prayers, and that weakneſs or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
which will not hinder the one, will neither
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nder the other. Now it is univerſally granted,
that our perſons may be juſtified, even when we are
ſtrongly perſwaded of the contrary; and: know no
reaſon why the like muſt not be granted concerning
our prayers.</p>
               <p>I note this the rather, for the ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of many of the poor weakling ſervants of
Chriſt, or ſuch as are in a troubled or deſerted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate;
who, after they have ſign'd out their broken
prayers, becauſe their own miſgiving hearts return
them a <hi>negative anſwer,</hi> conclude that God doth
ſo too: my prayers are loſt, the Lord doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
them: Why, how can you tell God doth not

be perſwaded that God hears you, therefore
you do not believe? Why, you may even then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
when you want this perſwaſion: Have you
offered up your Prayers in the Name of Chriſt?
Have you committed them to his hand, to preſent
them to his Father, and leaving them with him,
and adventuring them upon his Intereſt, can you
now but wait what anſwer the Lord will give? This
is that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith which will ſecure your Prayers from

               <p>Having thus in brief ſhewed you what it is to
pray in Faith, what remains, but that you practice
accordingly, ſtudy the Attributes of God, his
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:153036:129"/>
Power, Goodneſs, Mercy and Truth: Study Chriſt,
his Office, Intereſt, Sufficiency, and Faithfulneſs,
ſtudy the Promiſes and the ſtability of them; let
your faith ſet its ſeal to all this, that God is good,
merciful, mighty, and true: that Chriſt will be
faithful in his Office, that his Name is mighty with
the Father, that the Promiſes of God are in him,
Yea and Amen. Strengthen your ſelves here, and
ſo go before the Lord: let God be in your heart,
Chriſt be in your hand, the Promiſe in your eye,
when ever there is a Prayer in your mouth. Let
your Prayer be ſo preſented, your dependance be
ſo ſettled, and your confidence, as much as may be,
ſo raiſed; as before you have been directed; or
whether you can attain to this confience or no,
yet do not fail of ſuch dependance, and then ſee,
what a rich return your prayers will ſooner or later
bring down upon you:</p>
               <p>But he that will pray without thus believing,
let not that man think to receive any thing of
the Lord; and if he doth get nothing, let him
not lay the blame on Prayer, as if this were an
empty uſeleſs thing, but on his unbelief. The
anſwer, which God gives to Prayer is alwayes this,
<hi>Be it unto thee according to thy Faith:</hi> And in this
is included, <hi>Be it unto thee according to thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>

by taking fleſh; that God manifeſted in the fleſh
could not purge away ſin but by ſuffering; that no
ſuffering would ſerve but Death; that no death

Chriſt?</p>
               <p>1. Strange in regard of the fruit and benefit of
it: All that Holineſſe and Beauty that my Spirit is
cloathed with, all that peace and joy that poſſeſſes
my heart, all my glorious hopes and expectations
for hereafter, all that difference that is betwixt my
ſtate and the ſtate of <hi>Cain, Judas,</hi> and the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
World; this is the Love of Chriſt. Where
had <hi>I</hi> now been, had it not been for the Love of
Chriſt?</p>
               <p>2. Strange Love in regard of the fervency and
ardency of it; and that not onely to the whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of the Elect, but to my Soul in particular.
To expreſſe this, ask this one Queſtion farther,
What if Chriſt had done and ſuffered all this for
me alone? What if there had been but one Sinner
in the World, and I had been that Sinner, and Chriſt
ſhould have come down from Heaven, cloathed
himſelf with fleſh, giving himſelf to death, given
ſuch a glorious Goſpel, ſent forth ſuch a multitude
of Ambaſſadours, to preach to, to convert, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:153036:135"/>
ſave this one Soul, this my Soul, this had been
ſtrange love. Such is the love of Chriſt to every
Elect perſon, that if there had been but one Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
Chriſt would have done and ſuffered all this
for one ſinner, rather then he ſhould have peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>

               <p>Have I a ſhare in the Goſpel? is my name
written in the Lambs Book? <hi>All are not Iſrael;</hi>
though Chriſt died for all, yet all are not made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
by him. There are many from whom the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is hid, there are many that have rejected the
Goſpel, that have put from them the Word of
Life. Whileſt there are ſuch multitudes that are
loſt and periſh for ever, is my Soul found, found in
Chriſt? Hath he that hath died for me drawn me
to himſelf? Hath he that hath given me a liberty
to lay hold on him, given me a heart to lay hold
on him: Hath he given me his Spirit in my heart,
to ſanctifie and cleanſe me from my ſins? If I have

A guilty Conſcience often ſtings a ſinner, in

ſtrike in together, then it ſtings with a witneſs.</p>

Sin, then think on thy carnal pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and conſider how they will reliſh with
thee, when thus ſalted with everlaſting fire. Are
theſe the things, for which I dye? Are theſe the
price for which <hi>I</hi> ſell my ſoul to Hell? Away, away
from me all my luſts and pleaſures, away from
me my companions in ſin, I confeſs I love you too
well, but I muſt not burn for you, <hi>I</hi> muſt not damn
my ſoul to pleaſe my fleſh.</p>
               <p>Touching the practice of this Duty, take theſe
two further Directions.</p>
               <p>1. Every day, morning and evening; ſet apart
ſometime for ſecret prayer; and when you go to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:153036:145"/>
pray, do not ruſh inconſiderately upon it, but
firſt ſit down and take one of thoſe Heads, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
on what the Scriptures ſpeak upon them, and
then propoſe the ſeveral queſtions to your hearts,
and when you find your hearts affected and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by theſe Meditations, then fall to prayer.</p>
               <p>2. Let each mornings Meditation be ordinarily
matter for your thoughts, to work on, and for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
that day, unleſs providence caſt in, and calls
you to ſome other profitable ſubjects.</p>
               <p>The matter of Meditation is purpoſely divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into ſeven Heads, to the end you may take
one of the Heads for each dayes Meditation, and
ſo in every week you may go over the whole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chief things of Religion: And thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
from day to day, from week to week, you
will be both more thorowly acquainted; and more
deeply affected with the things of God, and will
find, through his bleſſing, more livelineſs and
enlargement in Prayer, and more comfortable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
               <p>Only take heed of formalitie, of reſting in the
work done, of going on in a round of Duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a due regard to the end of Duty: Let this be
your aim in all, to get your hearts more fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and affected with the things of the world to
come, more enlarged and quickned, and more
effectually carried on in that courſe of holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
walking, the end whereof is everlaſting
life.</p>
               <p>But now, leaſt any ſhould complain that this
courſe is too tedious, and that which they cannot
have time daily for; or that by reaſon of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or want of helps, they cannot perform it:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:153036:145"/>
                  <hi>I</hi> ſhall adde this, that ſuch perſons who are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in their underſtandings, and thence unable to
go through with this courſe, and all others at ſuch
ſeaſons as they are unavoidably ſtraitned for
time, nay, inſtead of the larger, take this ſhorter
courſe.</p>
               <p>When ever thou ſetteſt upon the Duty of
prayer, ſit down, and ask thy heart theſe <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What am I? am I a Believer or an
unbeliever, converted or unconverted? do I think
in my Conſcience I belong to God, or do I not fear I am
yet the child of the Devil?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What do I? what are my wayes, are
they ſuch as pleaſe the Lord, and tend to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my Soul, or are they the wayes of death and
damnation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Before whoſe preſence do I now
ſtand?</p>
               <p>Is it not before the Lord, the Almighty God,
who is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek
him, and the avenger of thoſe that ſlight or rebel
againſt him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. What am I come before the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
               <p>Is it not to plead with him for my ſoul, to beg
my life at his hands, to beg my pardon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
from everlaſting death, and to obtain
grace for the ſalvation of my Soul?</p>

THe third ſpecial Duty I ſhall direct you in is,
Self-examination:</p>
               <p>It is of great uſe to the carrying us on in an holy
courſe, to know our ſtate. For,</p>
               <p>By the knowledge of our ſtate we ſhall the
better know our work, when we know what we
are, we ſhall the better know what we have to do.
If the queſtion be, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
The anſwer of that will depend upon another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<hi>How far forth am I come already?</hi> Am I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
or unconverted, in a ſtate of ſin, or in
a ſtate of grace? Let that queſtion be firſt
anſwered, and the anſwer of the other will be
eaſie.</p>
               <p>2 By the knowledge of this, that we are in a
good eſtate, we ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l have much encouragement
to haſten on. Aſſurance will quicken and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us on in the way of holyneſs: Thoſe that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that the <hi>Doctrine of aſſurance</hi> is a licentious
Doctrine, and ſerves for nothing, but to maintain
men in a looſe, lazy, and idle life, underſtand not
what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm. 'Tis all
one as if they affirmed. That the more aſſurance
any perſon hath of the love of God, the leſs he
will love God, or that the more he loves God, the
leſs care he will take to ſerve or pleaſe him. Thoſe
that know no other motive to Duty, but fear, may
preach ſuch Doctrine; but thoſe that have found
the quickning and conſtraining power of love, muſt
lay down both their reaſon and ſenſe too, before
they can believe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:153036:146"/>
The way to know our ſelves, is, to ſearch, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
our ſelves, 1 Cor. 13. 4. <hi>Examine your ſelves,
prove your ſelves, know ye not your own ſelves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to help you in this duty of Self-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I ſhall give you theſe two Directions:</p>
               <p>1. When you ſet to examine your ſelves by
any marks or ſigns: In the firſt place, examine
your Marks that you would try your ſelves by.
If you would prove your ſelves, whether you
have true grace or no, by any mark that's given,
examine that Mark by the Scriptures, whether it
be a certain and infallible ſign of grace, ſo that
you may be bold to conclude, that if you can
find this Mark in you, you are undoubtedly in
the ſtate of grace. That's a proper mark of true
grace, which, whoſoever hath it, hath grace, and
whoſoever hath it not, hath not grace. If you
take that for a mark of true grace, which is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to Saints and Sinners,</hi> you may take your ſelves
to have grace, when you have none. And if you
take a mark to try your ſelves by, which is <hi>proper
to Saints, but is not common to all Saints,</hi> you may
take your ſelves to have no grace, when you have.
The former miſtake may loſe you your peace; this
may loſe you your ſouls; therefore Chriſtians, be
wary here; try your marks, before you try your
ſelves by them.</p>
               <p>2. For the matter of your enquiry, let it be,</p>
               <p>1. Whether you are gotten into the way of life, or
not; or, whether you are tranſlated out of a ſtate of ſin
and death, into a state of grace and ſalvation? <hi>And
if ſo, then,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Whether you be in a thriving or flouriſhing ſtate;
or in a languiſhing or decayed ſtate?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:153036:147"/>
To help you in the former tryal, I might only
ſend you back to thoſe directions formerly given,
concerning your cloſure with Chriſt, whence it will
not be difficult to gather ſome certain marks to try
your ſelves by; but I ſhall add two or three more,
wherein, let it not be offenſive to any, that I follow
that light which I have received from the worthy
labours of that faithful Servant of Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
whence I confeſs my ſelf to have, through mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
grown into the fuller acquaintance with mine
own heart, and which I ſhall therefore the rather
make uſe of, for the help and benefit of others.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="mark">
               <head>1. Mark.</head>
               <p>1. Whereſoever there is true Grace, there is an
hearty willingneſs to part with every ſin.</p>
               <p>The firſt work of the ſanctifying Spirit upon
the ſoul, is, the diſcovering of ſin, making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be an enemy; and the firſt ſaving work
is, the dividing betwixt ſin and the ſoul, making
an utter breach betwixt them. The Spirit of
God makes us firſt to look on ſin as an enemy,
and then to deal with it as an enemy; to hate
it, to fear it, to be impatient at the preſence of
it. <hi>Rom. 7. 24. Wretched man that I am, who
ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> When
the good Spirit enters into the heart, from that
day forward, the Soul looks on ſin, as <hi>Saul</hi>
look'd on <hi>David,</hi> when the evil ſpirit fell upon
him; It's ſaid, he eyed <hi>David</hi> from that time
forward, he looked on him with an evil eye, with
an envious eye: Oh! that I were once well rid
of this <hi>David;</hi> Oh! (ſaith a Convert) that I were
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:153036:147"/>
once well rid of this Luſt. It's now become to the
Soul, as the Daughters of <hi>Heth</hi> were to <hi>Rebeccah,
Gen. 26. 35. A grief of mind to it,</hi> a wearineſs to
it. I am weary of my life, becauſe of theſe daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Heth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When there is this breach made betwixt ſin
and the Soul, it's grace that hath made it; when
ſin hath loſt the will, it hath loſt the man; when
Chriſt hath gotten the will, he hath gained the
man. The will, is the heart; give me thy heart,
is the ſame, as be willing to be mine; the will is
the ſtrong hold of the ſoul; this is it that holds
out laſt againſt God; when this is won, all is won.
Sin may have loſt the underſtanding, and loſt the
conſcience; theſe may plead for God, and for
holineſs, and may cry out againſt ſin, <hi>Away
with it, away with it; Crucifie it, crucifie it;</hi> there
is Death and Hell in the bowels of it, away with
it. But as long as ſin hath the will for it, it ſtill
hath the man. Reaſon ſaith, <hi>I ought to tura;</hi>
Conſcience ſaith, <hi>I muſt turn,</hi> but yet nothing
follows; but when the heart ſayes, <hi>I will turn,</hi>
then the work is done: Reaſon ſaith, theſe
Idols ought not to ſtand; Conſeience ſaith, theſe
Iuſts muſt be ſubdued; theſe my ſinful pleaſures,
theſe my ſinful wayes, theſe my ſinful compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
muſt be left; but when the will ſayes to
them, <hi>Get you hence,</hi> there's a work of Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
               <p>But now this willingneſs to part with, or turn
from ſin, that it may infallibly prove grace to be
in us, muſt be,</p>
               <p>1. Univerſal. A willingneſs to be rid of all ſin.
The enmity againſt ſin, that's wrought by grace,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:153036:148"/>
is againſt the whole kind, againſt all ſin, Root
and Branch, Body and Members. A true <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi>
would not have one <hi>Canaanite</hi> left in the
Land, would have the whole generation rooted
out, Pſal. 119. <hi>I hate every falſe way.</hi> Pſal. 139.
<hi>Search me, O Lord and ſee if there be (any) wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Habitual. It muſt not be onely for the
time that the heart is ſet againſt ſin, when it
is under ſome terrour or trouble, but there muſt
be an abiding willingneſs. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when the
Thunder, and the Hail, and the Fire, and the
Frogs, and the Flies, were upon him, for the
time was willing to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, but preſenrly
after he meant no ſuch thing: 'Tis not what
thou art in a fit, in a fright, or ſudden paſſion,
in ſickneſs, or under the apprehenſions of death,
that will give thee any certain light, by which
thou mayeſt judge of thy ſtate, but what thou
art in the ſtanding and abiding diſpoſition and
bent of thy ſoul: A Godly man is never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
(when he is himſelf) to be rid of every
ſin.</p>
               <p>3. Prevalent. The willingneſs muſt be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the unwillingneſs. A gracious heart is
more willing to be rid of ſin, than to continue
in ſin. He had much rather, if it were put to
his choice, live without all ſin, than to be allowed
to live in any ſin. Whatever the pleadings and
reaſonings of his fleſh are, for an indulgence to
any particular ſins, whatever the advantages of
yielding to the fleſh herein mîght be, whatever
dammages or prejudices might follow upon his
parting with them, yet he had much rather,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:153036:148"/>
whatever comes of it, be freed from them all. If
the Lord ſhould come to ſuch a ſoul, and give him
as large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>grant as he did to <hi>Solomon, Ask what I
ſhall give thee,</hi> ask what I ſhall do for thee, write
down what thou wilt, and thou ſhalt have it; this
is that which he would have, <hi>Lord take away mine
iniquittes.</hi> 'Tis not the lives of mine enemies, or
a revenge upon them, that I deſire; 'tis not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from trouble, or affliction, that I deſire; make
me a clean heart, O Lord, purge me from my ſins,
let my luſts die, my corruptions die, and then
though mine enemies live, and their malice lives,
and my troubles live, yet if my ſins be once dead,
I have my deſire.</p>
               <p>And this willingneſs will diſcover it ſelf to be
prevailing by bringing forth,
<list>
                     <item>1. Reſolution.</item>
                     <item>2. Reſiſtance againſt ſin.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. Where a man is truly willing to be rid of ſin,
there will be reſolution againſt it; he will not <hi>only</hi>
be <hi>patient</hi> and content to <hi>give God leave to</hi> crucifie
all his beloved luſts, and darling corruptions, and
give the world leave to hew and ſtrike home
at the root of them, without hiding them, or
warding off the blow, or wiſhing they might be
ſpared to him, but ſtands ſtedfaſtly on Gods ſide,
and taking part with him againſt ſin, reſolves to uſe
all his means for the conquering and overcoming
of them.</p>
               <p>2. This reſolution will bring forth reſiſtance.
An heart that's weary of ſin, will fall to ſtriving
againſt ſin, Gal. 5. 17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the
spirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, for theſe two
are contrary the one to the other.</hi> Contraries are
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:153036:149"/>
naturally expulſive each of other. Such <hi>a pair</hi>
as a <hi>Jacob</hi> and an <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſuch <hi>Twins,</hi> as an <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
and an <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> cannot lie quietly togeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in the
ſame womb; no, nor live quietly together in
the ſame houſe, but there will be a mutual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
and perſecuting each of other; fire and
water may as well agree in the ſame veſſel, as
grace and ſin in the ſame heart. A gracious heart
will be reſtraining, curbing, and withſtanding it,
in all its workings. It's a mere vanity, for men
to talk of being willing to be rid of ſin, when they
let it live, and work, and rule, and run in its
courſe, without ever laying the hand to the bridle
to reſtrain it.</p>
               <p>Let me add one word more; if you ſtrive
againſt ſin, and your ſtriving be attended with
ſucceſs; if you have gotten any degree of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
the evidence will be much more full and
clear.</p>
               <p>This now is the firſt Mark, by which you may
try your ſelves, whether there be the truth of
grace in you, or not.</p>
               <p>He that is willing to be freed from all ſin, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually
willing, prevailingly willing; he that's
more willing to be freed from ſin, than to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to live in ſin, and hereupon is reſolved
to uſe all God's means for the conquering of it;
and accordingly ſtrives, prayes, watches, and
wreſtles againſt it, eſpecially if he finds his luſts
begin to fall before him, undoubtedly there is
grace in that mans heart. As <hi>Haman</hi>'s Wife
ſaid to her Husband, <hi>If this</hi> Mordecai <hi>be of the
ſeed of the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to fall, thou ſhalt not prevail againſt him; I ſhall
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:153036:149"/>
be bold to ſay to ſuch a perſon, without any <hi>ifs</hi> or
<hi>ands,</hi> this <hi>Mordecai</hi> is of the ſeed of the Jews, this
grace, before which thy luſts have begun to fall, is
the <hi>Seed of God,</hi> and therefore thy ſins ſhall never
totally preval againſt it; but ſhall finally fall and
be deſtroyed by it.</p>

               <p>2. Whereſoever there is true grace, there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
in the eſteem and choice of a ſtrict and ſincere
godly life, above any other life in the world.</p>
               <p>A godly man loves all godlineſs, and he loves
it above all. Pſal. 19. 9, 10. <hi>The fear of the Lord
is clean, and endureth for ever, the Judgments of
the Lord are true and righteous altogether; more to
be deſired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
gold, ſweeter alſo than the honey and the honey-comb;</hi>
that is, than all the world: <hi>more to be deſired

honours, and friends, and all things that a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
heart can deſire, are hidden in the golden
Mines. Honey notes all the ſweetneſs, pleaſures,
and delights of a worldly life. Now, ſaith the

                  <hi>Pſalmiſt:</hi> put all this together, all the revenues,

great poſſeſſions, great proſperity; their
bellies full of pleaſure, enough to ſpend upon
themſelves, and to leave to their Children after
them; this they have, and much good may it
do them: Let me but behold the face of God in
Righteouſneſs, walk before the Lord in my inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
keep a good conſcience, live in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his Will, and in the light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and then let them take the corn, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:153036:150"/>
wine, and what elſe they can get: let the Lord
be mine, and I ſhall never envy them their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Pſal. 84. 10. <hi>I had rather be a door-keeper
in the Houſe of the Lord, than to dwell in the Tents
of Wickedneſs.</hi> The meaneſt condition of thoſe
that live in the preſence and favour of God,
I more deſire, and would rather have, than the
higheſt condition of others. Let me be a door-keeper
among the Saints, rather than a dweller
with the wicked. So <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 11. 25. <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of
God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon;
eſteeming the Reproaches of Chriſt greater Riches
than the Treaſures of</hi> Egypt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 30. 111.
<hi>I have choſen the way of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thy testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
have I taken as mine heritage for ever.</hi> Where
obſerve,</p>
               <p>1. How he came into the way of Truth:
that is, not by chance, but by choice; I have
choſen the way of truth. There are ſome that
ſtumble in upon Religion, who being caſt into
ſuch places or ſocieties, where Godlineſs is in
faſhion and credit, joyn in to do as others do, and
yet their hearts have never choſen Religion: but
I have choſen the way of truth, ſaith the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. What it is he choſe of Religion; <hi>The way
of Truth,</hi> the Teſtimonies or Precepts of the
<hi>Lord.</hi> Some there are that have choſen the wages
of Righteouſneſs, but not the way of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> but not the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the
Lord; as much as you will of the <hi>ſweet,</hi> but none
of the <hi>ſweat</hi> of Religion: But I (ſaith he) have
choſen the way of Truth.</p>

3. What account he hath of what he hath
choſen; He accounts it as his heritage. There
be ſome that chooſe Religion, but it is only for
a covering, or a cloak to hid their wickedneſs,
making the ſame uſe of it, which a Whore doth
of her paint, to hide the deformity that is under.
Others take up Religion for their laſt Refuge;
ſomething they muſt have, to which they may
have recourſe at laſt; but they will not have
much to do with it, nor take much pleaſure in it
at preſent: But he chooſes it, not only as his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi>
bur as his <hi>Riches,</hi> not only to be the ground
of his <hi>future hopes,</hi> but to be the matter of his
<hi>preſent joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all theſe Scriptures, obſerve,</p>
               <p>1. That a godly mans ſettled Judgment is, That
a godly life is the beſt and happieſt life.</p>
               <p>2. That a godly mans choice is according to
his Judgment. He eſteems the fear of the Lord
above Gold, and he chooſes it before gold; He
is better pleaſed, and doth rather take up with
the meaneſt, and moſt afflicted condition, in a
way of holineſs, than with the moſt plentiful, and
proſperous eſtate, in a way of ſin; he prefers
the poverty of Chriſt, before the riches of the
World.</p>
               <p>3. Godly men and worldly men are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
and may be known the one from the
other, by their choice they make for themſelves.
He that makes a worldly choice, is a worldly
man; and he is a godly man that makes a godly
choice. Take Godlineſs with all its inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
with all its difficulties and diſtreſſes,
when it is moſt under a cloud of reproach and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:153036:151"/>
contempt, and take a worldly life with all its
advantages, preferments, pleaſures, in its greateſt
Sun-ſhine of outward proſperity and glory: And
he is not a godly man, he is not of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s
Spirit, that is not able to ſay, <hi>Give me this poor
deſpiſed, godly life, before the moſt flouriſhing life
of worldlings.</hi>

1 <hi>John 3. 7, 10. He that doth righteouſneſs is
righteous; he that doth not righteouſneſe is not of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a two-fold Righteouſneſs, and there is

Righteouſneſs is taken,</p>
               <p>1. In a ſtrict ſenſe for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> properly ſo

               <p>2. In a larger ſenſe for <hi>Holineſs,</hi> or an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
rectitude of all our actions. To live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our Rule, the whole Word of God, is,
to live righteouſly. In this Scripture it is taken in
this latter and larger ſenſe; He who carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
holily and unblameably, both in the things
pertaining to God, and alſo in the things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to men, he doth righteoſneſs.</p>

               <p>1. In a Legal ſenſe, which ſtands in <hi>an exact o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
and fulfilling the Law.</hi> And thus there is
none righteous, no not one; becauſe thus, there is
none that doth righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>2. In an Evangelical ſenſe: <hi>A walking upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
according to the Truth of the Goſpel:</hi> A ſincere
endeavour to obſerve all things which the Lord
hath commanded us.</p>
               <p>For the further clearing whereof, I muſt make
uſe of a two-fold diſtinction.</p>
               <p>1. I muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt a <hi>ſingle good
action,</hi> and a <hi>ſeries of good actions.</hi> It is not one,
or a few ſingle good actions, but a continued
courſe of holy actions, that denominates us ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
As there is no man ſo holy, who doth not
ſometimes fall into ſin; ſo there are few men
ſo wicked, who do not ſometimes fall in with
that which is good, and as every ſin which a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, through infirmity, falls into, doth
not preſently denominate him <hi>ungodly;</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will a few good actions done by another
man prove him <hi>godly.</hi> 'Tis what the <hi>courſe and
tenour</hi> of the life, that muſt be diligently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
A godly man makes godlineſs the <hi>buſineſs</hi>
of his Life. Religion is a Chriſtians trade, and
you may well call it his trade upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>1. It is his <hi>living and livelihood;</hi> men live
upon their trades, a mans trade is his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
his bread, and his cloaths, and his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all comes in from his trade: Godlineſs is
a Chriſtians whole living, he prayes, and he
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:153036:152"/>
lives by praying; he believes, and he lives by
faith; he loves, and he lives by love; all the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
ſuccours, comforts of this life, come in this
way. A Chriſtians livelyhood is all laid up in
Chriſt, and in the exerciſes of godlineſs, he gets it
down into his Soul: Take away from a Chriſtian
his Religion, take away Faith and Prayer, and
Hope and Love, and the Labours and Exerciſes
of them, and you leave him a poor man indeed;
take away his houſe, and his means, and yet he
lives; take away his bread, and yet he lives; but
take Faith, and Hope, and Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from him,
and he dies.</p>
               <p>2. Godlineſs is <hi>the buſineſs of his life:</hi> A mans
trade is his <hi>conſtant work;</hi> not the exerciſe of
now and then a day, or an hour, upon occaſion,
but it is his <hi>every dayes work.</hi> Godlineſs, as it is
a Chriſtians daily bread, ſo it is his daily work.
Judge not thy ſelf by what thou art in ſome
few Holy dayes of thy life, when perhaps by
falling into affliction, or into ſome good ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
or being preſent at ſome good Duty, or
Ordinance, thou ſeemeſt for a fit, to be another
man than thou art at other times. Judge not
thy ſelf to be what thou art, <hi>when thou art not thy
ſelf,</hi> when thou art but in a fit: but ſee what
the trade and ordinary way of thy life is; he that
in his ordinary courſe does righteouſneſs, he is
righteous.</p>
               <p>2. I muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt a Chriſtians
actions, and his care about his actions: the
Holy actions of ſome that are really Godly,
eſpecially of young beginners, may be but few,
in compariſon, but their care is more continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:153036:153"/>
what the Apoſtle ſaith of unmarried perſons,
is true of all Chriſtians; every ſoul that is married
to the Lord, careth how to pleaſe his Husband:
though I do nor ſay, that all careleſneſs doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
we have no grace; yet this I ſay, it is more
than careleſs Chriſtians can tell, whether they
have any grace or no, though ſuch may have grace,
yet they can have no aſſurance. He that finds that
the great care of his life is how to pleaſe the Lord,
is of God.</p>
               <p>Try your ſelves by this Mark alſo: do not
enquire only about your affections, what your
deſires are, or what your joyes are, what your
comforts are, or what your peace is, but what
your paths are: when all comes to all, this is
the ſureſt mark, <hi>He that doth Righteouſneſs is
Righteous, he that doth not Righteouſneſs, is not of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put all theſe together, and whoſoever there is
of you that is thus willing to part with ſin, doth
thus eſteem, and hath thus choſen a godly life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other lives; and hath this atteſted by his
actual care in his ordinary courſe to pleaſe God,
Oh! be thankful, and bleſs God for ever: there
is that work of Grace begun in thy ſoul, that doth
undoubtedly prove thee to be of God, and in the
State of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Having faithfully tryed your ſelves by theſe
certain and infallible marks, and proved your
ſelves to be in the ſtate of Grace, (for I would
adviſe you, to bring your trial to a clear judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
then proceed in the next place to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;</p>
               <p>2. Whether you be in a thriving and flouriſhing
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:153036:153"/>
eſtate or no? whether you have made a comfortable
progreſs in holineſs? or whether you be at a ſtand,
or behind hand?</p>
               <p>To help you in this, I ſhall only give you theſe
two or three ſhort directions:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Compare your ſelves with your ſelves;</hi> your
preſent ſtate with your former ſtate: Look back
and conſider what you were, or have been at any
time ſince you firſt believed, and then ſee what
ground you have gotten or loſt.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Compare your ſtate with your time that you
have had, and your means, and opportunities, and the
ſeveral talents that you have received.</hi> See if your
ſtature in grace be anſwerable to your ſtanding,
if you are of ſeven, or ten, or twenty yeares
ſtanding in the Vineyard of the Lord, conſider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if you alſo be of ſo many years growth; See if
your reckonings you have to bring in be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to your receipts; If you have been of
long ſtanding, and yet are but little of ſtature;
if your knowledge be as little, your faith as weak,
your love as cold, your peace, your comforts as
uncertain, your corruptions as many and mighty
as they have been many years ſince, much more
if the waters of grace and peace run lower now
than they did heretofore, you may conclude your
ſelves to be but in a poor caſe, and indeed to be
out of caſe.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Compare your ſelves with the beſt of other
Chriſtians, to whom you have been equal in time, and
other circumſtances.</hi> See if you have kept pace
with the beſt of your time. If you ſee your
ſelves behind your company, much more if you
ſee divers that have ſet forth after you, to have
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:153036:154"/>
out-run you, and gotten much before you: If
you ſee Chriſtians of leſs time, of leſs parts,
that have had fewer helps, greater hinderances,
to have gotten the ſtart of you: if thoſe that
have been but a few hours in the field are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home laden with the ſheaves they have
gotten, and you that have been there all the
day, have gotten only a few poor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>handfuls,
you will have no reaſon to think it over-well with
you.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, you, whoſe caſe this is, <hi>a barren
and unthriving caſe:</hi> Oh! labour to ſee it, and
to lament it, and to acknowledge it; <hi>I confeſs it
is even thus with me,</hi> I confeſs this is my caſe; if
it be, bewail it, mourn over your neglects, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan
your poverty: If you had had a great trade
in the world, and a good ſtock, and good mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
and ſhouldſt trade and trade from time to
time and never proſper, but be poor and low,
when you ſee others of the ſame trade to flouriſh
and grow rich, how near would it go to your
hearts? Chriſtianity is a good trade, Grace is
a good ſtock, the Ordinances of God, under
which you have lived, have been good Markets,
many that have ſet up long ſince you did, are
grown rich, rich in grace, rich in comfort, rich
in good Fruits, and yet that you ſhould ſtill
be ſo poor, and behind hand, this is lamentable:
And oh! lament over it, and conſider, that it is
time for you now at length to look better to your
ſelves.</p>
               <p>That you may get into a better caſe, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
a little farther, what it is that hath hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
your thriving, and kept you back: Some
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:153036:154"/>
of theſe following hindrances, which I ſhall
name in a word to you; ſome one, or more of
them, it's very likely, have kept you thus back.
Either,</p>
               <p>1. A ſlight and overly performance of Holy
<hi>Duties:</hi> Duties have a great influence upon the
ſtate of our Hearts and Lives. Look what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
are in their ſecret duties, you ſhall find them
much after the ſame rate in their ordinary courſe;
if you ſee a Profeſſor that's dead and barren, and
careleſs, and unſavoury in his life, follow him into
his Cloſet, and you ſhall (ten to one) find him
as ſlight, and dead, and heedleſs in his Prayers;
and thoſe that ſhift over their duties, will but
ſhuffle in their converſations. Try if this be not
your caſe. Or,</p>
               <p>2. Unprofitable Converſe with <hi>Chriſtian
Friends.</hi> The Communion of Saints ſhould
be improved to the edification of <hi>Saints.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ſhould find other matters to talk of, than
of their Corn and Cattel, the Weather, or News;
What? have you not a God, nor a Chriſt, nor
a Soul to be minding each other of? Never a
word of your Country whither you are Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling?
We ſhould come together, to get light
from each others Candle, to get warmth from
each others fire: If you ſquander away ſuch
opportunities, no wonder if you remain dark
and cold: Examine if you be not faulty here.
Or,</p>
               <p>3. Unneceſſary Converſe with <hi>Carnal Friends.</hi>
Frothy and Unſavoury Company leaves a chill,
and a damp, and a vanity upon our Spirits. It
is not for nothing that Chriſt requires his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:153036:155"/>
                  <hi>to forſake all the world,</hi> Father and Mother,
Son and Daughter, much more ſuch carnal friends
as are at a greater diſtance; if we cannot forget
theſe, they will quickly help us to forget our God,
and our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Yet Religion doth not teach us to be unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or uncivil, it requires that we give to all
their dues, friendſhip to whom friendſhip, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
to whom courteſie; and duty to whom duty
belongs; but this it teacheth, that we do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily
converſe with thoſe, whoſe ſociety we
may avoid, nor unwaily with thoſe whom we
may not avoid. With whom ſoever your dwelling
be, let your delight be in the Saints: if God caſt
you among others, let them he your fear, rather
than your familiars; and keep ſuce a due diſtance,
as may neither hinder you in your duties to them,
nor prejudice you in your duty to God; examine
how it hath been with you upon this account.
Or,</p>
               <p>4. Over-buſying your ſelves about the affairs
of this life. It may be, you find ſo much work
to do abroad, that you let all lye at randome
within. It may be, the reaſon why your hearts
are ſo cold, is, becauſe you have ſo many Irons
in the fire, you have ſo many fields to look to,
that your garden is all over-run with weeds:
Or,</p>
               <p>5. The remaining guilt of ſome unrepented
ſin, <hi>Iſrael</hi> cannot proſper whil'ſt there is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
thing in the Camp. Or elſe,</p>
               <p>6. Some unmortified luſt that you live under
the power of, and yet, it may be, take no notice
of. You have, it may be, a proud heart, or an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:153036:155"/>
fretful heart, or an envious, revengeful heart,
and this may be it that makes you pine away. An
unmortified luſt in the heart, is like a moth in the
Garment, that eats out the ſtrength, and marrs
the beauty of it. Pride in the heart, is as proud
fleſh in a wound, whatever medicines be uſed,
the wound remains uncured, till the proud fleſh
be taken off. An angry, fretful heart, is like a
Wolf in the breaſt, whatever be applyed, it will
prey upon and devour it, and the body pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
till the fretting humour be cured. And ſo
any other prevailing luſt will have the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
As a man in a Conſumption, that's waſted
to skin and bone, whatever cordials, or reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
he takes, his fleſh will never be gotten up,
his ſtrength will never return, till the corroding
Rheum be ſtaid. If there be any prevailing luſt
in thy ſoul, eſpecially if thou indulgeſt to it, in
vain ſhalt thou uſe many Medicines, for thou
ſhalt not be cured, till that luſt be ſubdued.
Thou may'ſt pray, and faſt, and complain all thy
life long, of thy deadneſs, and barrenneſs, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
ſtate, and yet ſtill be pining away, whil'ſt
there is any iniquity that thy heart gives indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to. Search diligently, and ſee if this be not
thy caſe.</p>
               <p>7. Slothfulneſs. The field of the ſluggard is a
barren field. He that will not plough, nor ſow, nor
weed, nor watch, nor work in his field, is like to
have but a poor crop, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 30.</p>
               <p>8. Contentedneſs with thy poor, and low, and
barren ſtate. Some that are born poor, live all
their dayes, and take up with their poor ſtate,
and never look after riches. For ought thou
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:153036:156"/>
knoweſt, thy heart might have been in much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
caſe, if thou hadſt intended riches. 'Tis the
covetous Chriſtian, that is the rich Chriſtian.
As 'tis with worldly men, <hi>the Covetous of the
earth,</hi> theſe are the rich men of the earth, theſe
are the monied men, the landed men, that have
laid houſe to houſe, field to field: and it may
be, if thou hadſt been <hi>ſpiritually covetous,</hi> thou
mighteſt have laid grace to grace, comfort to
comfort, and have been a man of great poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before this day: but thou haſt been a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-hearted,
poor-ſpirited creature, that never
hadſt any ambition, not tookeſt up any deſign
to grow great and rich towards God; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
'tis that thou art as thou art.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian, though there be none of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
cauſes mentioned, but may have an hand
in bringing poverty upon thee, or holding thee
under it; yet, it may be, this laſt, a <hi>contentedneſs
with a little grace,</hi> is that to which thow oweſt
moſt of thy pining diſeaſe. This is too common
a caſe with Chriſtians. We have not large hearts
towards God, we are not covetous after holineſs,
we are too well contented to be Babes in Chriſt,
to be children in the grace and knowledge of
God; where ſhall we find a Chriſtian almoſt, that
is <hi>reſolved to be rich;</hi> to ſeek great things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the great things of Eternity I mean, to bring
forth much fruit. It is no wonder there are ſo
many <hi>barren ſheep</hi> in Chriſts <hi>Fold,</hi> ſo many <hi>barren
fig-trees</hi> in Chriſts <hi>Vineyard,</hi> ſo many ſtarveling
ſouls among the Profeſſors of Religion; when
there are ſo few that do ſeriouſly deſign fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.
We might have been as thoſe ſheep
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:153036:156"/>
which <hi>Solomon</hi> mentions, to reſemble the Church
by, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 6. Whereof <hi>every one beareth Twins;</hi>
we might have <hi>gotten double</hi> to what we have done,
if we had had a mind in earneſt to it.</p>
               <p>Brethren, Conſider how it is with you, and if
you find this to be your caſe, that your ſouls are
in an unthtiving ſtate, ſearch narrowly if ſome
of the fore-mentioned particulars be not thoſe
that have kept you back; and when you have
found out the cauſe of your diſeaſe, reſt not till
it be removed; for be ye well aſſured, That <hi>that
which hath hindered, will hinder, till it be taken out
of the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe fourth and laſt Special Duty I ſhall direct
you in, is, the <hi>Renewing of your Covenant:</hi>
Wherein, before I give you the Directions, I ſhall
premiſe,</p>
               <p>1. That every ſincere Chriſtian is (as hath
been before ſhewed) entred into Covenant with
God.</p>
               <p>2. That Chriſtians are guilty of much <hi>treachery</hi>
and falſe-dealing with God. They break Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
daily. The Lord may take up that complaint
againſt many of us, which he took up againſt <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
Pſal. 78. 36, 37. <hi>Nevertheleſs they did flatter
him with their mouth, and lyed unto him in their
tongue; their heart was not right with him, neither
were they ſtedfaſt in the Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a double falſhood in the Covenant,
which we may be guilty of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:153036:157"/>
1. There is a falſhood in our <hi>entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi>
when we do it not heartily, but feignedly,
when our promiſes to God are nothing but
words; when we mean not, nor intend any ſuch
thing as our mouth ſpeaks; this is lying unto
God. <hi>They lyed to him in their Tongues.</hi> Oh! how
many ſuch lyars are there to be found amongſt
thoſe that are called Chriſtians! We have all
covenanted to renounce the world, and the love
of it, to renounce the fleſh, and the luſts of it, to
renounce the Devil and his works. We have all
Covenanted, to take the Lord to be our God, to
cleave to him, obey and ſerve him only, and all
our dayes. All this we have done in our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and in our profeſſion that we have ſince
made, to ſtand to our Baptiſmal Covenant. But
have we not, many of us, lyed unto the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Hath there ever been any ſuch thing in our
hearts? Thoſe that are <hi>falſe in this Foundation of
their Chriſtianity,</hi> are but <hi>falſe Chriſtians;</hi> thoſe
that have <hi>lyed</hi> unto God in their <hi>Covenants,</hi> are
but <hi>lying Converts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There is a falſhood in our <hi>keeping Covenant;</hi>
when, whatever reality there hath been in our
<hi>intention,</hi> yet we fail in <hi>execution;</hi> when we do
not ſtand to our word, nor are ſtedfaſt in our
Covenant, and every part thereof. And thus
every Chriſtian is more or leſs guilty. Every ſin
we commit, is, in a degree, a breaking Covenant,
a departing and going back from the Lord, and
a dealing treacherouſly with the moſt high. Oh!
how much falſhood of this kind is there to be
found in every one of us, when ſome of our
hearts are ſo ſet upon the world, and take ſo
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:153036:157"/>
much liberty in purſuing, and ſo much pleaſure
in the enjoying of theſe earthly things, that the
Lord is the leſs regarded and looked after. Is
this according to our Covenant? When there
is ſuch fleſhlineſs and ſenſuality to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
others, when we live ſuch idle, eaſie, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
lives; when our appetires, our paſſions, our
tongues are left ſo much at their liberty; when
there is ſo much proviſion made for the fleſh,
and ſo little for the ſoul; Is this according to
our Covenant? Is this all we meant, in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to be Chriſtians? Is this our living to God,
our living to Chriſt? Oh! what falſhood have we
been guilty of!</p>
               <p>3. That all our breaches of Covenant, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
weaken the bond and obligation of the
Covenant. The obligation of the Covenant may
be ſaid to be weakened in a double ſenſe.</p>
               <p>1. Really, when the tye of it is relaxed and
looſened, and we ceaſe to be ſo ſtrongly bound
as before; and thus no ſin can weaken our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-obligation;
it doth not become ever the
leſs our duty, to cleave unto God, for that we
have ſo often departed from him, or ever the leſs
our ſin, to follow the world, for that we have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it ſo long. Our ſins, in this ſenſe do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
add to the obligation, by how much the leſs
we have paid off our debt, by ſo much the more
there is behind; Our former neglects do oblige
us to the more care for the future.</p>
               <p>2. Senſibly. When the bond of the Covenant
being ſo often broken, is not now accounted ſo
<hi>ſolemn or ſo ſacred</hi> as before; by how much the
more it hath been broken, by ſo much the leſs
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:153036:158"/>
                  <hi>ſenſible</hi> hold hath it upon us. It ſeemeth but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
light thing to perſons that have ſo often and
ordinarily broken their Faith with God, to break
it over and over again; It doth not much affect
or trouble ſuch hearts which have been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to tranſgreſs, ro revolt more and more. When
ſin can plead preſcription, it grows bold. <hi>If I were
to begin again (ſaith the ſinner) I would take more
eare, and look better to my wayes; but over ſhoes over
boots, now I have gone on ſo long, it will not be much
worſe if I go on a little longer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Renewing</hi> of our Covenant, will <hi>revive</hi>
the Obligation of it. Though there be not a
ſtricter, yet there is another Tye; There is a <hi>new
link</hi> added to the <hi>old cord.</hi> Men are more afraid
and aſhamed to break their word as ſoon as it is
gone forth out of their mouths. The ſeriouſneſs
wherewith ſuch a ſacred duty ſhould be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
will leave ſome impreſſions upon the heart.
The very conſidering over our Covenant-breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
which is neceſſary to our renewing of it,
will awaken our hearts to more care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I ſhall give you
this double Direction for the performance of this
Duty.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For the time when.</item>
                  <item>2. For the manner how.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Touching the former, there are ſome ſpecial
times when this Duty is eſpecially ſeaſonable.
As,</p>
               <p>1. Upon your falls into any greater ſins. <hi>Great
ſins</hi> make <hi>great breaches,</hi> and 'tis not ſafe to let
them lie unmade up. Breaking of Covenant
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:153036:158"/>
makes a breach upon Conſcience, and this will
prove as the breaking down the banks of the Sea,
which, if they be not preſently made up, there may
be no ſtopping them.</p>
               <p>2. In great ſtraights and Afflictions. We have
then our hearts at the advantage, to bring them
back, or to bind them the faſter to the Lord, when
we ſtand in any ſpecial need of comfort, or help
from God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 20, 21. when <hi>Jacob</hi> fled from
his Fathers houſe, for fear of his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> he
vowed, <hi>If God will be with me, and will keep me in
this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat,
and rayment to put on, ſo that I come again to my
Fathers houſe in peace, then ſhall the Lord be my
God.</hi> Times of <hi>ſtraights</hi> and <hi>difficulties</hi> are a ſpecial
ſeaſon for this Duty; though it be too ordinary
that thoſe vows which we make in the dayes of
our diſtreſs, are quickly forgotten in the dayes of
our proſperity: Sickneſs-promiſes are in our
health like <hi>Sampſons Withs,</hi> broken, as Tow when
it toucheth the fire.</p>
               <p>3. In caſe of any declinings to a careleſs remiſs,
and ſenſleſs frame of heart or life.</p>
               <p>4. At our approaches to the Table of the Lord.
Theſe are ſome of the ſpecial times for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this Duty.</p>
               <p>2. For the manner how.</p>
               <p>1. Remember your Covenant, read over, and
conſider diſtinctly the terms of it, and weigh dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
the ſtrictneſs, and great ſolemnity of your
engaging to God therein, that your hearts may be
the more deeply affected herewith.</p>
               <p>2. Remember your faults: Read over, and
conſider diſtinctly the ſins you have fallen into
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:153036:159"/>
ſince your engaging to the Lord; together with
the ſeveral aggravations of them, and repent and
be humbled under them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>3. Eſpecially, conſider how your hearts have ſtood
towards the Lord in the main; whether your falls
have not been ſuch as give you occaſion to ſuſpect
that you were not upright in your firſt engaging.
Conſider whether ſuch a life as you have led ſince,
ſuch ſins as you have been overcome by ſince, are
conſiſtent with ſincerity.</p>
               <p>4. Reſolve upon more care, watchfulneſs, and
faithfulneſs for the future. Verbal promiſes,
though there appear ſome affection at the time, if
they be not joyned with a reſolution to take more
care, are like to come to nothing.</p>
               <p>5. Have a ſpecial eye in your engaging to the
Lord at your ſpecial ſins, failings and neglects,
that you have found your ſelves more enclined
to, and more ordinarily overtaken by. I will,
through the help of God, watch againſt every
ſin, but eſpecially againſt covetouſneſs, paſſion,
or lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is my ſin, herein I am apt to
be faulty, here my hardeſt work lies. I will watch
to every Duty, but eſpecially to temperance, or
patience, or ſelf-denial, herein I have been moſt
wanting.</p>
               <p>6. Lay hold on the Covenant or Promiſe of
God, for the renewing of his Grace towards you,
for the renewing of your ſtrength, whereby you
may be more enabled to perform your promiſes,
and pay your vowes. It may be your former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
of your unfaithful hearts, have quite
diſcouraged you. I have found this heart of mine
ſo fickle, and ſo falſe, and ſo feeble, that I dare not
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:153036:159"/>
truſt it ſo far, as to engage any further for it. I
have found my work ſo hard, my luſts ſo ſtrong,
my temptations ſo many, my ſtrength ſo ſmall,
my attempts to follow God, ſo ſucceſseſs, that I
am afraid I ſhall never come to any thing; I doubt
I ſhall but mock God, and bring more guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my ſelf, by adventuring to promiſe <hi>any</hi> thing
farther for this ſinful, infirm, and unfaithful
heart. Why? though thou dareſt not truſt thy
heart, yet truſt thy God, who hath ſaid, <hi>That he
will put his fear into thee, that thou ſhalt not depart
from him, that he will renew thy strength, and that
his grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> Depend upon God
for the renewing of thy ſtrength, and then fear not
to renew thy Vows.</p>
               <p>7. In this ſtrength of the Lord, go into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and with ſorrow in thine heart, and ſhame
in thy face, falling down before him, humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
and acknowledge thy falls and failings; and
then, in the like ſolemn manner, as thou haſt been
before directed, engage thy ſelf again to the Lord
in the ſame Covenant.</p>
               <p>2. I ſhall next direct you to make right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Duties.</p>
               <p>Godlineſs doth not ſtand barely in Praying,
Meditating, or Examining; there is ſomething far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that theſe Duties have a reſpect, and muſt be
uſeful to; 'Tis an <hi>holy life,</hi> that is the end to which
our <hi>holy Duties</hi> are to lead, and help us on. That
they may do ſo, take theſe two following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p>1. Whenever you ſet upon Duties, reſolve to
put hard for it, to enjoy ſuch ſenſible Communion
with God in them, that you may come off in a better
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:153036:160"/>
and more ſpiritual frame of heart than you came
on.</p>
               <p>2. Having gotten up your hearts to any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
frame in Duty, be careful to keep it up after
Duty.</p>
               <p>Whenever you ſet upon Duties, reſolve to put
hard for it, to enjoy ſuch ſenſible Communion with
God, that you may return from them with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
upon your ſpirits. <hi>Reſolve with him,</hi>
Nunquam à te abſque te recedam, <hi>whenever I
come before the Lord, I will never go away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon why we thrive no more by Duties,
is, becauſe we do not <hi>meet our God</hi> in them: God
never meets with his Saints, but he ſends them
away with ſome marks of his Goodneſs upon
them.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why we do ſeldome meet with
God in our Duties, is, becauſe we do not ſo
<hi>wiſhly look for his appearance.</hi> God waits for thy
coming, Soul, and, if it be not thy fault, thou
mayeſt ſee his face before thou departeſt; and, if
thou ſee God in a Duty, thou wilt not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
without ſome impreſſions of God upon thy
heart.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> came down from the Mount,
where he had ſeen the Lord; <hi>his face did ſhine,</hi>
there was ſomething of the <hi>glory</hi> of God upon his
countenance. <hi>Iſrael</hi> might plainly ſee that <hi>Moſes</hi>
had met with God, they might ſee the beams of
divine Glory in his face. Oh! how ſad is it, that
Chriſtians ſhould return from duty with no more
of God in their faces, or upon their ſpirit, than
for the moſt part they do. We come many times
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:153036:160"/>
with no other ſpirits from our <hi>Bibles,</hi> or our <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi>
than we come out of our <hi>Shops,</hi> or out of our
<hi>Barns,</hi> no body would ever think we had been
praying, or converſing with God, there is ſo little
<hi>ſavour of God upon our hearts,</hi> that we bring back
with us.</p>
               <p>Brethren, whenever you let down your Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
into the Wells of Salvation, be not content to
bring them up empty: be ſo converſant with God
in your Duties, that you come off laden, as the
Bee from the Flower, with the honey and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of your duties.</p>
               <p>And this I adviſe you to endeavour after, not
only in your ſecret duties, not only in your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
publick duties, on Sabbaths, Humiliation-dayes,
or Thanksgivings, but in your daily family-duties,
your Reading, Singing, Praying, yea, even
in thoſe ſhorter Prayers and Praiſes which you
uſe before and after Meals. Whenever you draw
nigh to God, look to ſee God, to taſte of God,
and to get down ſomething of God upon your
hearts. And then,</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Whatever you have gotten from God in Duty,
what life, what warmth, what refreſhing, what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of heart, be careful to maintain and keep
it alive afterwards.</hi> See that your Spirits do not
preſently ſink and cool again, after they have
been thus raiſed and warmed. Do not ſatisfie your
ſelves with this, that you have ſome comfortable
entertainment with God, and feel ſome warm
and lively works of your heart towards God, and
ſome refreſhings from him in Duty; but look
to it, that you keep that holy fire that is <hi>there</hi>
kindled, from being preſently quenched again.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:153036:161"/>
You do not eat and drink for an hour only, that
you may have the comfort of your food while
your meal laſts, but you eat for afterwards, that
the ſpirits and ſtrength which you get by one
meal may hold you out to the next meal. Duties
are the ſet-meals of the ſoul, wherein it ſo feeds it
ſelf upon God, that in the ſtrength of what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
it may afterwards walk with God more
comfortably and chearfully.</p>
               <p>The Lord promiſeth to his people, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 5.
<hi>The Threſhing ſhall reach to the Vintage, and the
Vintage to the Seed-time.</hi> And <hi>Amos 9. 13. The
Plough-man ſhall overtake the Reaper, and the
treader of Grapes him that ſoweth Seed.</hi> The
meaning is, Your old ſtore ſhall be ſo much, and
laſt you ſo long as till new com again: you ſhall
not only reap enough for the time of <hi>Harvest;</hi>
you ſhall not only gather enough to ſerve you du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of the <hi>Vintage,</hi> but your corn ſhall
laſt from <hi>Harveſt to Harveſt;</hi> your Wine ſhall
ſerve you from <hi>Vintage to Vintage:</hi> your Old
ſtore ſhall not be ſpent till New come to ſupply
you. Duties are the <hi>Harveſts and Vintages</hi> of
our ſouls. Oh! what bleſſed lives ſhould we live,
did we ſo improve and husband what we get in
one Duty, that it might laſt us out to another;
that the <hi>Vintage</hi> might reach to the <hi>Vintage,</hi> the
<hi>Harveſt</hi> to the <hi>Harveſt;</hi> that the life, and warmth,
and refreſhing we get in one Duty, might hold by
us till the next, and ſo we might be carried on
in an holy, lively, heavenly Frame <hi>from Duty to
Duty,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> walked on from <hi>ſtrength <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o
ſtrength,</hi> till they came and appeared before God
in <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:153036:161"/>
That which holds us ſo low and barren in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is, that whatever we have obtained from
the Lord in Duties and Ordinances, we preſently
loſe it: when we have been weeping ſometimes
before the Lord, and wreſtling with him, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hard for ſome quickning or comforting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of his Spirit upon our hearts, and the
Lord hath heard us, and given us our deſires; yet
then as ſoon as duty is over, we go away, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all, and bury all that we have thus obtained,
in a confuſed heap of worldly thoughts and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
we unbend, and let down our ſpirits, and
lay aſide all thoughts of God, till we come to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
again; we conrent our ſelves to live in ſuch an
eſtrangement from God all the reſt of our time,
that ſin and the world have <hi>a whole dayes time to
pull down what an hours duty hath been building; a
whole weeks time to deſtroy and ſteal away what a
Sabbath hath gotten in;</hi> and ſo at the returns of
duty, we find our hearts at the ſame loſs, in the
ſame deadneſs and hardneſs that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>In the Old Teſtament, though the Sacrifices
were offered but <hi>morning and evening,</hi> yet the fire
that <hi>kindled</hi> them was not to go <hi>out night</hi> nor <hi>day;</hi>
there muſt be fire kept alive from the Morning-Sacrifice,
to kindle the Evening-Sacrifice, and fire
left from the Evening to kindle the Morning-Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
Oh! Behold, how often is it, that <hi>though</hi> at
our Morning-Sacrifice a fire is kindled, yet we let
this fire lie all day under the aſhes, and take ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
care to keep <hi>blowing</hi> at it, that it <hi>goes</hi> quite out
before the Evening; and when we come to <hi>offer</hi>
our Evening-Sacrifice, we have no fire to kindle it</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:153036:162"/>
Brethren, hath the Lord viſited you, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and comforted you in duty; Oh! think with
your ſelves, what a ſweet life ſhould I live, might
it be thus with me alwayes? What pity is it, that
ſuch light ſhould ever go out? that ſuch grace
ſhould be ſo ſhort liv'd? Why? if I do not look to
my ſelf the better, this Sun-ſhine will laſt but a
little while; and how will the Lord take it, if I
ſuffer ſuch ſparks that he hath kindled, ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be quenched? How is my Soul ever like to
proſper, if ſuch precious food paſs away from it as
ſoon as it is received? <hi>Is this a faſt that I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
for a man to afflict his Soul for a day?</hi> Is this a
prayer that God regards, for a man to afflict his
heart for an hour? to be in the Mount with God,
to be raiſed up to Heaven for the time, and within
a few minutes after to be ſunk into the dirt of the
earth? What a ſad change is this! How can you
bear ſuch a loſs as this? When will your ſouls
come to any thing, if you have only ſome few
ſuch <hi>lucida intervalla,</hi> and all the reſt of your time
are covered over with clouds and darkneſs?</p>
               <p>Beloved, as ever you expect to proſper in grace,
or be ſettled in peace, be chary of maintaining
your <hi>duty in-comes;</hi> do not think to make uſe of
your prayer-comforts, to ſave you the labour of an
after care, but to help you to be more careful and
fruitful.</p>
               <p>But how may we do to keep this Holy and lively
frame?</p>
               <p>1. Be watchful. <hi>Nehem. 4. 9. Nevertheleſs
we prayed, and ſet a watch againſt them night and
day.</hi> Beloved, it is with you as it was with thoſe
Jews, whatever you have gained, you have Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:153036:162"/>
lying in wait to ſteal it away; whatever
you have built, you have adverſaries lying in wait
to pull down again. I have heard of ſome inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
places, where what men built in the day, the
Devil pull'd down at night, and this danger you
are continually in; what's built at one prayer, the
Devil labours to pull down before the next. Let
your eye be much upon your hearts, obſerve dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
how they hold up or ſink, that if there be
the leaſt damp or decay, growing upon you, you
may eſpie it <hi>before it be gone too far:</hi> 'Tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
we loſe all upon ſuch a ſudden, when ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
as ſoon as ever our duties are done, away we
goe, and think no more where we have been, or
what we have been about; as if we were well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to <hi>take our leave of our duties, and our God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
When you depart out of your Cloſets,
leave <hi>your hearts behind you;</hi> Worldlings ſeldom
bring theit hearts thither; when they come to
pray, they <hi>leave their hearts behind them:</hi> Let Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
never carry them thence: when you have
done praying, and muſt abroad to your earthly
affairs, <hi>let your hearts ſtay behind with your God:</hi>
Let your thoughts be much upon the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you have had; ſee to it, that the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
you meet with, do not ſo eaſily divert you
from minding what you have been begging, or
wreſtling for.</p>
               <p>2. Make preſent uſe of what you have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
God gives Grace, and Strength, and Life,
for uſe, and uſe will preſerve it. Hath the
Lord warm'd thy heart? goe warm thy Brothers
heart, and that will keep thine from cooling:
Hath God ſpoken comfortably to thy ſoul? goe
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:153036:163"/>
and ſpeak of thy God, and what he hath done for
thee to others. Hath God inclined, and thereby
fitted thee for action, take the ſeaſon; thou may'ſt
do more for God, and for thy ſoul, in ſuch an hour,
than in many dayes beſide; be doing with what
thou haſt received, and thou need'ſt not fear lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it: when we are idle, then we fall aſleep and
grow cold; Inſtruments do not ruſt while they
are in uſe. We never more ſpend our ſtrength,
than when we ſpare our labour.</p>
               <p>3. Life up your hearts to the Lord often every
hour, in ſome ſhort Ejaculations. No buſineſs,
no company can hinder this duty, and this will be
of ſpecial advantage to you, therefore neglect it
not; every ſigh, or breathing of your ſouls Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-wards,
will fetch down freſh influences from
Heaven upon you.</p>
               <p>4. Charge this whole courſe actually upon
your ſelves every morning, and examine every
evening how you have kept to it.</p>
               <p>5. If you cannot otherwiſe bring, or hold your
ſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

ſome time, by <hi>ſpecial vow;</hi> till being a while inured
to it, it may become at length more eaſie.</p>
               <p>Being thus entred upon, and prepared for a
godly life, I ſhall give you ſome directions.</p>
               <p>3. How to carry it on; and for your help here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
take theſe following counſels.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>In your whole courſe, purſue, and as much as
poſſible, eye your end, God, and your own ſalvation.</hi>
Conſider often wherefore you live, and what it
is you would have; and if this be it, that God
may be honoured, and your ſouls ſaved, let this
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:153036:163"/>
be purſued and proſecuted in all the parts of your
life. Take not that courſe, do not that action, that
hath not ſome tendency that way, and that which
hath a <hi>tendency,</hi> let it be <hi>directed</hi> to that glorious
end. Let every arrow be levell'd at your mark.
The reaſon why the end is no more <hi>attained,</hi> is,
becauſe it is more <hi>intended;</hi> 'tis no wonder we
ſhoot ſhort, or beſide our mark, when our eye is
not upon it.</p>
               <p>The eying our end, will both direct our <hi>courſe,</hi>
and quicken and encourage us on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Set the Lord much before your eyes,</hi> dwell upon
the contemplation of his Glory, and glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies;
conſider, how worthy the Lord is to
be exalted, and what an honour it is to poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to be any way ſerviceable to his Honour; &amp;
what pity it is, that any of your time, any of your
ſtrength ſhould be ſpent upon vanity, which
might be ſo improved, to ſo <hi>worthy aud high an
end?</hi> Begrutch every minute of your time that is
not beſtowed on God.</p>
               <p>Conſider the bleſſedneſs of living for ever in the
preſence and enjoyment of God. <hi>Look towards</hi> the
holy City, <hi>enter by faith into</hi> the Holy of Holies,
<hi>ſet your ſelves before</hi> the Throne of God; <hi>view (as
much as at this diſtance you are capable) that</hi>
everlaſting light, <hi>thoſe</hi> bleſſed and glorious joyes,
<hi>thoſe</hi> rivers of pleaſure, <hi>that</hi> exceeding eternal weight
of glory, which is there poſſeſſed by the Saints; <hi>And
then ſay to your hearts,</hi> Come on ſoul, come on,
here's that thou art praying for, here's that thou art
labouring for, here's the Country, the Kingdom, the
Crown that thou art fighting for, and wreſtling for,
and running, and ſuffering for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:153036:164"/>
The ſetting this glory before your eyes, will

upon all the hinderances of its attainment.</hi> A ſight of
Heaven will make a holy life a beautiful life.</p>
               <p>There are two things that make an holy life
beautiful,
<list>
                     <item>1. That it's the Image of an Heavenly life.</item>
                     <item>2. That it's the way to it.</item>

               </p>
               <p>All the labours, difficulties ſufferings of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life, are therefore pleaſant and beautiful, becauſe
they are the way of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And, on the other ſide, a ſight of Heaven, will
make the wayes of ſin to be unpleaſant, to be dark
and black wayes.</p>
               <p>There are two grounds upon which ſin is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Saints.</p>
               <p>1. It's <hi>Oppoſition</hi> and unlikeneſs to God; it bears
the Image of Hell upon it, not of Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. It's <hi>Interpoſition</hi> betwixt them and their
end.</p>
               <p>Nothing elſe can ever keep them from God;
There's no danger of their falling ſhort of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
bleſſedneſs, but by ſin. This is the only
<hi>Gulf that's fixed</hi> between them and Glory. And
hence 'tis that the way of ſin, with all its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
eaſe and delights, is to the Saints, <hi>a dark
and diſmal way.</hi> The pleaſures of ſin are <hi>black
pleaſures,</hi> the gains of ſin are <hi>black gains,</hi> the jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

<hi>dark and black</hi> in their eye. Theſe clouds, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

Oh! what progreſs might you make in the way
of Life, where Holineſs with all its difficulties
become beautiful, and Sin with all its delights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
odious! What would there then be wanting,
that might encourage you on, what would there
be then left to hinder you? Why, let God and
Glory be more in your eye, and then Sin will be

2. 11, 12, 13. <hi>The Grace of God (which bringeth
Salvation) teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs and

               <p>1. Take Direction from Heaven; when you
are travelling, and ſee the place before you whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

then look up, and conſider, Is this my way to
God? When you are eagerly and greedily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:153036:165"/>
the world, ask your hearts; Is this my
way to Heaven? Am I now working out my
ſalvation? When you are walking in the way of
carnal pleaſure or liberty, then look up to the
Lord, and look in upon your heart, and ſay, if
you can, <hi>Now, Lord, I am haſtening to thee, now
Soul, I am taking care for thee, my ſports and my
pleaſures, and my luſts, are the way to mak God
ſure, and Heaven ſure to me.</hi> Can you ſay ſo?
Will not your own heart tell you, that is not
the way? If Heaven be it that I intend, if Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
be it I mind, ſure then I am not out of my
way?</p>
               <p>2. Look Heaven-ward, and take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thence to go on, View the glory that is
above, and conſider what happy men you would
be, if you were once ſafely there: and let ſuch
thoughts preſs you to haſten on, and encourage
you againſt all the labours and difficulties you
muſt firſt paſs through. Think with your ſelves,
when you are ſetting upon any duty, If I can
get well through this duty, I ſhall be one ſtep

               <p>Oh! if ſuch thoughts and conſiderations were

rejoyce to ſee,</hi> how by every duty and difficulty
<hi>your redemption draweth nigh.</hi> A traveller in his
journey, that's almoſt ſpent and tired, if he

in your way.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Walk on your way in the name of Chriſt.</hi> Or,
<hi>live by faith,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>The life which I now live
in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi>
The ſtrength of a Chriſtian is his Faith; the
ſtrength of Faith is Chriſt; the ſtrength of Chriſt
is put into the Promiſes. If you would live to
God, live by Faith, if you would live by Faith, go
often to the Promiſes.</p>
               <p>1. Study the Promiſes, the freeneſs of them;
there's <hi>Grace</hi> in the Promiſe. The fulneſs of
them, there's <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Promiſe, and with
him all things; there's wiſdom, righteouſneſs,
ſtrength; there's bread, and cloaths, and lands,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:153036:166"/>
and friends and ſafety; ſtudy the <hi>ſureneſs</hi> of the
Promiſes, there's an <hi>Yea and Amen</hi> ſet to them;
<hi>All the Promiſes of God are Yea and Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Set thy</hi> Seal <hi>to them.</hi> Believe that God is
true.</p>
               <p>3. Clear up thine intereſt in them, and thereby
make it out that they are <hi>ſure to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Treaſure up in thy memory, a ſtock and ſtore
of particular promiſes, which may anſwer every
caſe of thy life, that ſo thou may'ſt have a word al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
at hand to rely upon. And then,</p>
               <p>5. Upon the credit of that word, venture on
after thy Lord in any duty, through any ſufferings
he calls thee to; whatſoever difficulty thou ſeeſt
in thy work, whatſoever danger thou ſeeſt in
thy way, whatſoever want, or weakneſs thou ſeeſt
growing upon thee, go on, reſting <hi>upon Chriſt</hi> for
ſucceſs in thy duties, and ſupport under thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and ſupply of thy wants, according to his
Word.</p>
               <p>It may be when thou lookeſt before thee upon
an holy life, thou wilt ſay, This is indeed a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and bleſſed life, if I could attain to it: but
oh! I ſee there is ſo much to be done, and ſo
much to be born, that I am in great doubt how I
ſhall ever be able to go through it.</p>
               <p>The Lord requires me, if I will come after
him, <hi>to deny my ſelf;</hi> This firſt ſtep puts me to a
ſtand; I doubt I ſhall ſtumble and fall at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Threſhold of Chriſtianity. Deny my ſelf!
Alas! I cannot deny my friend or companion,
I cannot deny mine Enemy that entices me to
ſin. If Satan do but ſpeak a word to me, to
draw me aſide to iniquity, he preſently prevails;
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:153036:166"/>
and muſt I yet deny my ſelf, when I ſee how <hi>unable</hi>
I am to deny mine enemies? I cannot, I c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lit with
it, will furniſh thee with this encouragement,
Though thou art able to do nothing of thy ſelf, yet
though may'ſt be able to do all things <hi>through
Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth thee,</hi> Phil. 4. 13.</p>
               <p>Again, thou ſayeſt, The Lord requires me to
make me a clean heart, to purge my conſcience, to
crucifie my luſts: But who am I, that <hi>ever</hi> I ſhould
think of doing ſuch great works? I could as eaſily
make a <hi>new world,</hi> as a <hi>new heart;</hi> I can as well
ſtop the Sun in its courſe, as ſtop my luſts in theirs;
I can as eaſily dry up the fountains of the great
Deep, as cleanſe the fountain of my corrupt heart,
and purge my ſelf from an evil conſcience. I, but
now thy faith will tell thee, He that bids thee
cleanſe thy heart, hath ſaid to thee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25.
That he will <hi>ſprinkle clean water upon thee, and
thou ſhalt be clean from all thy filthineſs.</hi> Thy faith
will carry thy fountain (<hi>of</hi>) ſin to that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that is opened <hi>for</hi> ſin and for uncleanneſs,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. Wherein thou may'ſt waſh and be
clean: thy faith will tell thee, <hi>Thy old man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
crucified with Christ,</hi> Rom. 6. 6. <hi>By whom the
body of ſin is deſtroyed;</hi> that is, <hi>hath received its

that the ſame mouth that commands thee, <hi>Let not

promiſed thee, <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over
thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet thou addeſt, The Lord commands me
to keep my <hi>heart,</hi> to keep my <hi>tongue,</hi> mine <hi>eyes,</hi> to
make ſtrait <hi>ſteps</hi> to my <hi>feet,</hi> that I turn aſide to no

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the like words hath he given me in
charge, requiring me to walk in all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to keep all his Statutes and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to do them; theſe are hard ſayings, who
can hear them? I, but he that ſaid this, (ſaith Faith)
ſaid one word more that will make all this eaſie.
<hi>Ezek. 36. 37. I will put my Spirit within you, and
cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my
Judgments, and do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once more thou replieſt, but Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
me <hi>to take up my Croſs,</hi> to ſuffer with
him, to part with all I have, to lay down my
life for his Name. Can I do ſo little for his
Name, and am I ever like to be able to ſuffer for
his Name? Am I put ſo hard to it in every light
affliction that befalls me, and is it poſſible I
ſhould be able to reſiſt unto blood? The Lord
pardon me, I have found that a little ſhame or
reproach is more than I can well bear; a ſcoff
or a ſcorn for Chriſt, to what impatience hath
it often put me? Have I run with the foot-men,
and have theſe wearied me? how then ſhall I
contend with horſes? <hi>But God is faithful,</hi> 1 Cor.
10. 13. <hi>who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above
that you are able.</hi> The Lord will lay on thee
(ſaith Faith) no more than thy load; either he
will encreaſe thy ſtrength, or not encreaſe thy
burthens. He that hath given thee a little
ſtrength to go through ſmall trials, hath ſaid,
he will, and thou mayeſt truſt him, if he lay
more load on thee, give thee more ſtrength to
bear it. The Lord will either enable thee to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:153036:167"/>
die for his Name, or he will not call thee to
it.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, believe God, to him that believes,
all things are poſſible, and, if you believe, they
ſhall be ſo to you: He hath ſaid he will be, and
therefore you may boldly ſay, <hi>The Lord is my
helper.</hi> Truſt in the Lord, and keep his way;
truſt in the Lord, and be doing good, and verily
you ſhall be fed, verily you ſhall be aſſiſted, verily
you ſhall be ſupported; commit your way to
him, and whatever difficulty there be in your
work, he ſhall bring it to paſs: commit the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your ſelves to him, and you ſhall be kept
by his power, through faith unto ſalvation. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is he that hath called you, and will do it.
Diſtruſt your ſelves as much as you will, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
not your Rock: you are weak creatures, but
you have a ſtrong God: you have empty hearts,
but a full Saviour: you have but a poor ſtock in
your ſelves, but a rich ſtock in the Promiſe,
whence you ſhall have ſuch a continual ſupply,
that your barrel of meal ſhall not waſte, nor your
cruſe of oyl ſpend, till you have finiſhed your
work and your courſe. Hang on your crucified
Lord, take hold on his Covenant, take hold on
his Strength, go forth in his Strength and Name,
and then fear not; your difficulties ſhall vaniſh,
your way ſhall proſper, your Souls ſhall flouriſh,
you ſhall have your fruit unto Holineſs, and your
end everlaſting Life.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Deny your ſelves.</hi> Matth. 16. 24. <hi>If any
man will come after me, let him deny himſelf.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your Covenant, you have given your
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:153036:168"/>
ſelves to the Lord, and are now no longer your
own; you are not debtors to the fleſh, to live after
the fleſh; you owe your fleſh no obſervance, you
have already paid it more than its due; let him
that liveth, live to the Lord; let them, for whom
Chriſt died, live no longer to themſelves, but to
him that died for them, and roſe again.</p>
               <p>Chriſt and Self are contrary; you cannot ſerve
theſe two Maſters: If you will not deny your
ſelves, you cannot but deny your Lord; and if you
can deny your ſelves in any thing, you will deny
Chriſt in nothing: If you can heartily ſay, <hi>Not my
will,</hi> you will eaſily add, <hi>but thine be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is this Self we muſt deny? I anſwer,
as Chriſt ſaid to the Woman of <hi>Samaria, He
whom thou hast for thy Husband, is not thy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:</hi>
That which thou holdeſt for thy ſelf, is not
thy ſelf; thou calleſt it, and counteſt it thy ſelf, and
loveſt, and cheriſheſt it as thy ſelf, but it is not thy
ſelf. That which is here called thy ſelf, is elſwhere
in Scripture called thy fleſh, thy corrupt, or carnal
part; that corruption that is <hi>gotten into thy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi>
and ſits there, <hi>giving thee evil counſel;</hi>
That corruption which is <hi>gotten into thy will,</hi> and
ſits there, ſwaying thee in all things to <hi>chooſe thy
hurt;</hi> that is <hi>gotten into thy appetite,</hi> and makes
thee to fall a luſting after all things that are perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to thee, and a reſiſting all that would do thee
good. This is thy ſelf to he denied, the corruption
of thy nature, that hath inſinuated it ſelf into all
thy parts and powers, and governs thee in all thy
actions. This is it which carries thee from God,
keeps thee from Chriſt, reſiſts the Word of Life,
leads thee out of the way of Life, leads thee about
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:153036:168"/>
after thy pleaſures and ſports, and companions,
holds thee down to this earth, and is dragging
thee to Hell.</p>
               <p>This is it which makes ſinners ſay concerning
the Word of Life, <hi>The Word that is ſpoken to us in
the Name of the Lord, we will not do, but will do
whatſoever proceeds out of our own mouths:</hi> That
makes them ſay concerning Chriſt, <hi>We will not
have this man to Reign over us:</hi> Let the World
reign if it will, let the Devil reign if he will, let
Pride, and Envie, and Malice reign if they will;
but whoſoever reigns, this man ſhall not reign
over me. 'Tis this that layes ſo many blocks,
creates ſo many difficulties in the way of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
makes this way ſeem too ſtrait and narrow;
the duties of it impoſſible, the troubles of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.
Were it not for this, the way of Chriſt
would be eaſie, and his burthen light: This is
that Self which muſt be denied, if you will follow
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If you ask what it is to <hi>deny ſelf?</hi> In ſhort, it is to
ſhake off its government, to reſiſt its reaſonings,
to diſobey its commands, to refuſe to follow its
inclinations, or ſatisfie its luſtings.</p>
               <p>Brethren, whatever Chriſt counſels you to, or
commands (as I told you) this <hi>Self</hi> will be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt it, and counter-manding it. When
Chriſt ſayes, Be humble, be watchful, be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
be perfect, labour, run, ſtrive, ſuffer; Your
fleſh will contradict, this is an hard Maſter, theſe
are hard ſayings; all this is both needleſs and
intolerable: Shake off thy heavy yoke, and take thy
liberty, turn out of this ſtraight way, and take thy
courſe; <hi>pity thy ſelf,</hi> ſpare thy ſelf, and put not thy
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:153036:169"/>
ſelf to ſuch hard ſervice when thou mayeſt be
free; at leaſt, thou mayeſt abate ſomething of
this ſtrictneſs: If thou wilt be holy, what need
ſo much care and labour about it? Allow thy
ſelf ſome liberty, ſome eaſe, ſome pleaſure. And
if you yield in a little, then it will counſel you
to take a little more, and a little more, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
give over till it hath reaſoned you out of all
Chriſtianity, and commanded you into very Brutes
or Devils.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we do, or how ſhall we deal with
this <hi>Self</hi> when it is thus ſet upon us?</p>
               <p>Why, return the ſame Anſwer to it as Chriſt
did to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he gave him the like counſel,
<hi>Maſter, pity thy ſelf. Get thee behind me Satan,</hi>
(ſaies he) Hold thy peace, Devil, Speak no
more thus to me; Say to this Fleſh, as the men
of <hi>Sodom</hi> ſaid to <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 19. <hi>Stand back: This
fellow came in to ſojourn, and he will needs be a
Judge, or a Ruler.</hi> Thou art ſtollen in, I know
not how, ſtollen into my head, ſtollen into my
heart, and now thou thinkeſt to be a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
to be a Ruler. Stand back (<hi>Fleſh</hi>) hold thy
peace, for I may not hearken to thee. Say to it
as the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>I hate him, for he never ſpeaks good to me, but
evil.</hi> Say to this wicked Fleſh, as thoſe wicked
ones ſaid againſt the Lord, <hi>The word which thou
haſt ſpoken to me, I will not do:</hi> The liberty thou
demandeſt, thou ſhalt not have: the pleaſure,
and the eaſe which thou craveſt, I will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thee: my Lord, whom thou counſelleſt me
againſt, ſhall be my Lord; him will I love, him
will I obey, him will I follow in all that he
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:153036:169"/>
ſhall ſay to me: I will not pamper this <hi>Fleſh,</hi>
but pinch it the more: I will not humour this
fleſhly mind, but croſs it the more: I will not
feed this fleſhly appetite, but hold it the ſhorter
for its cravings and luſtings: I will not Pray
the leſs, or Faſt the leſs, or Hear the leſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this Fleſh is againſt it, but will Pray the
more, and Faſt the more, and beat down this
bodie, and bring it into ſubjection with the
more care and diligence: I will ſtarve this proud
beggar, and weary it out of its imperious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
it ſhall get nothing, if I can help it, by all
this ado it makes, but ſhall rather be held the
ſhorter; I will the rather deny my ſelf what I may
allow my ſelf, becauſe I will not feed or foſter
ſuch an enemy.</p>
               <p>Oh Chriſtians! What an exact life might we
live, and with what eaſe might we go on our holy
courſe, if this enemy were once well laid? What
an uncontrouled dominion might our Lord have
over us, if this Self were pulled down from ſitting
with him in the Throne? And how much might
be done to the deſtroying of it, by our conſtant
denying it? Keep the <hi>Fleſh</hi> low, and by degrees
you kill it.</p>
               <p>But woe to us, what Friends are we of this
Enemy? how <hi>gently do we deal with this old man?</hi>
What proviſion do we make for this Fleſh?
What we have a mind to, we muſt have; what
we have a mind to do, we will do; whither we
have a mind to go, we will go, and ſeldome give
our Reaſons, or our Conſciences liberty to ſay
to us, <hi>What doſt thou?</hi> or once to judge, whether
it be good for us, or fit for us, or ſafe to us, or
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:153036:170"/>
no? We are juſt like ſome fond Parents, if their
Child cry, though it be but for a knife, or a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of dirt, it muſt have it to ſtill it. A wiſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
will rather give his Child a Rod, than that
which will hurt it, and knows that this will be
hurt enough, that a Child ſhould alwayes have its
will: Oh check and whip this Brat, and <hi>let not thy
Soul spare for its crying.</hi> Better the Child cry, than
the Parent; better the Fleſh cry, than the Soul
and Conſcience.</p>
               <p>But oh what a ſad wonder is it to obſerve, how
ſtrangely indulgent too many Chriſtians are this
way, who ſuffer their fleſh to leave them almoſt
to any thing; who in a ſelf-ſeeking, fleſh-pleaſing
life, have equalled and even out-gone many of the
carnal world. What a liberty have many that <hi>ſeem</hi>
to be Chriſtians, even of the higheſt form, often
taken in the dayes of their proſperity? Some
<hi>ſeeking great things for themſelves,</hi> driving ſo hard
after eſtates, honour, high places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if they
meant to return, and take their portion with the
men of this world. Others <hi>living in pleaſure</hi>
with <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 2. 10. <hi>Whatever their eyes
deſire, they keep not from them, they withhold not
themſelves from any joy.</hi> VVho, as if they hoped to
charm their fleſh out of its enmity, or to kill it
bd kindneſs; or if this were the Enemy, which
when it <hi>hungers, they muſt feed, when it thirſts, they
muſt give it drink, and thereby heap devouring
coals upon its head;</hi> will not ſay it nay whenever
it craves. Oh what liberty have we ſeen taken
by many ſuch, for exceſſive feaſtings, coſtly attire,
vain faſhions, frothy, light and carnal merriments;
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:153036:170"/>
yea, and deſpiſings, and condemnings of the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and more ſelf-denying way of more ſevere and
mortified Chriſtians; as if this proceeded out of an
<hi>affectation of a voluntary humility,</hi> or <hi>an ignorance of
their Chriſtian liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is this indeed the way to crucifie the fleſh?
Or have you gotten it ſo much under command al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
that now you can ſecurely truſt it with, any
thing it would have, without fear of its getting
head, and making war againſt Chriſt or your Souls
again?</p>
               <p>Look to your ſelves, Chriſtians; <hi>look back,</hi> and
conſider, whether your Souls have not ſuffered,
whilſt your fleſh have been thus ſurfeited; whether
there have not been ſome <hi>abatements</hi> made to Chriſt,
for every ſuch <hi>allowance</hi> granted to the fleſh; and
whether God hath not been <hi>provoked,</hi> whilſt ſelf
hath been thus pleaſed. Think ſadly, whether this
abuſe of our liberty be not ſomething that the
Lord is now pleading with us about, and ſcourging
us for. We have even put the Lord to it, to caſt us
<hi>into the houſe of mourning,</hi> thereby to repair the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that have been made upon our Souls in our
<hi>Houſes of Feaſting:</hi> And our Lord Jeſus puts us the
harder to the ſecond Leſſon, <hi>Take up your Croſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we did no better learn our firſt, <hi>Deny your
ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Order your ſelves aright.</hi> Beloved, if you
will obſerve the former Rules well, all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
will be the more eaſie, and I ſhall be the
ſhorter in it. <hi>Order your ſelves aright,</hi> iu thoſe
things I mean, that eſpecially <hi>concern your own
perſons;</hi> keep your own hearts with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:153036:171"/>
look well to your own wayes, <hi>Gal. 6. 4. Le
every man prove his own work, and then ſhall he hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
rejoycing in himſelf, and not in another.</hi> Keep a ſtrict and
ſevere eye upon your ſelves; hold a ſtrict hand upon
your ſelves, be more ſevere towards <hi>your ſelves,</hi> than
towards <hi>all the World.</hi> It's an ill ſign, to ſee Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of Religion ſevere in their obſerving, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon, and cenſuring others; and more remiſs
towards themſelves. Be more can did and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
towards others, but exerciſe more ſeverity at
home.</p>
               <p>In the right ordering your ſelves, take great care
that you,
<list>
                     <item>1. Allow not your ſelves in the leaſt know Sin.</item>
                     <item>2. Live not in the neglect of any known Duty.</item>
                     <item>3. Take heed of the World.</item>

                     <item>6. Be Moderate.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>That you allow not your ſelves in the practice of
the leaſt known ſin.</hi> Do not look on this as any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for ſin, or your eaſier entertaining of it, That
<hi>it is but a little one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no ſin that can properly be termed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
The leaſt iniquity will coſt either the Blood
of Chriſt or the blood of your own Souls.</p>
               <p>Little Sins are <hi>ſpreading</hi> ſins; a <hi>little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump: Elijahs</hi> Cloud, out of
the bigneſſe of a <hi>Mans</hi> hand, in a few hours
cloathed the whole Heavens in black: You will
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:153036:171"/>
find it ſomething in <hi>your</hi> Repentance, which <hi>you</hi>
counted as nothing in the Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Little ſins are <hi>leading ſins;</hi> the child conveighed
in at the Window, will open <hi>the door</hi> to let all the
great Thieves in. When <hi>Gad</hi> came into the world,
his Mother ſaid, <hi>Behold a Troop cometh,</hi> 2 King. 6. 32.
When the Meſſenger of the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to
the Prophet, Shut the <hi>door,</hi> hold him faſt (ſayes he)
at the <hi>door; Is not the ſound of his Maſters feet behind
him?</hi> Shut the <hi>door</hi> againſt every ſin, for whoſe Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
is it? Look behind, and ſee who comes
after; <hi>Is not the ſound of his Maſters feet behind
him?</hi> The Devil is not far off, whenever Sir knocks
for admiſſion; and the <hi>door</hi> being opened to the
<hi>Meſſenger,</hi> it's like to ſtand open for the <hi>Maſter</hi> to
enter: Take heed, Brethren, that <hi>you</hi> do not give
a <hi>tolleration</hi> to any ſin; little ſins <hi>allowed,</hi> become
great ſins. The allowance of ſin is that which makes
the great waſt upon <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and the great ſpoil
upon our peace. I will not ſay, what grace there
may be in the heart, but ſure there is but little ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
in the <hi>conſcience,</hi> that doth not bid defiance
to the leaſt of Sins.</p>
               <p>Beloved, if Sin doth get the poſſeſſion at any
time of your hearts, let it be rather upon <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,</hi>
than <hi>ſurrender;</hi> be ſo watchful, that if it
be poſſible, you may not be ſurpriz'd by ſin, or
taken at unawares; but whatever you do, ſee
you do not ſurrender your ſelves to it; be ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that if it may be, Sin may not ſteal in upon
you in a diſguiſe, but when you ſee what it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of it as of the Devil: Will you let a known
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:153036:172"/>
Enemy lodge within you? Brethren, do not ſhut
your eyes againſt ſin, nor open your doors to it.
Shut not your eyes againſt it, be willing to know it,
do not go about to perſwade your ſelves concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing you have a mind to, that it is not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that it may be lawful enough, for ought you
know, but examine it, and look through it imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and if you find it to be ſin, receive it not in.
I cannot well ſay, whether of the two be in the
worſe caſe, thoſe that are not <hi>willing to know they
do,</hi> or thoſe that <hi>do what they know to be evil;</hi> but
this I can ſay, that neither the one nor the other,
(if there be any thing of God in them) are like to
know whether there be or no; ſuch winkings will
blind their eyes, and ſuch walkings will blot their
Evidences, and both hinder that progreſs in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which is neceſſary to build them up in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
If you would be ſure the Lord is yours, keep
cloſe to him, if you would keep cloſe by God, keep
clear of ſin, and if you would keep clear of ſin, keep
<hi>your Windows open, but your doors ſhut;</hi> ſee who 'tis
that knocks before you let them in. An open eye,
and a tender conſcience, will be the beſt ſecurity
to both your grace and peace.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Live not in the neglect of any known duty.</hi> The
Devil may be ſerved not only by your doing evil,
but by your doing nothing. We obey the will of
the fleſh, when we only neglect to obey the will of
God: As our Commiſſions ſtab, ſo our Omiſſions
ſtarve our ſouls. God will not, and our ſouls can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
want a duty; our lameneſſe in our practiſe, will
quickly appear in the leanneſſe of our Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:153036:172"/>
O miſſions will be reckoned for a Judgment, and
therefore muſt be reckoned, and repented of now.
Do not content <hi>your</hi> ſelves with a <hi>negative holineſs,</hi>
that you do not harm; do not think it enough, to
be able to ſay, <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf,</hi> no hurt that
I have done; ſuppoſe <hi>you</hi> do not, <hi>yet thereby are you
not juſtified.</hi> God will judge you, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
you, for what you have (<hi>not</hi>) done. If you
had nothing to anſwer for, but your neglects: The
neglects of one day, of one hour, will undo you for
ever, if you have not a Chriſt to anſwer for you.
To be holy hath more in it than to be harmleſs.
There muſt be doing your duty, as well as depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from iniquity, <hi>Iſa. 1. 16. Ceaſe to do evil, learn to
do well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it a little now and then that will ſerve,
There muſt be continuance in well-doing, a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to every good work, a fruitfulneſs in good
works, a faithfulneſs in good works. <hi>Well done good
and faithful Servant.</hi> That's a faithful ſervant, that
hath done his beſt, that hath not voluntarily neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
any thing of his Maſters work, nor waſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Maſters talents: that's able to ſay, though
I have not done what I ought, yet I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to do what I can. Everie neglect is a degree
of unfaithfulneſs. If ye will be the ſervants of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
be faithful ſervants; and that you may be ſo,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Neglect not any kind of Duty;</hi> One thing
lacking may be the loſſe of all. You can hear, it
may be, but you cannot pray; you can pray in
ſecret, but you cannot pray in your Families;
you can inſtruct your Families, but you cannot
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:153036:173"/>
govern them; you can <hi>love</hi> the <hi>Saints,</hi> you ſay, but
you neglect the <hi>communion of Saints;</hi> you can be
<hi>juſt</hi> in your <hi>dealings,</hi> but <hi>you</hi> cannot be <hi>charitable;</hi>
you can give an <hi>Alms</hi> to an <hi>hungry bodie,</hi> but you
cannot give <hi>counſel</hi> to a <hi>ſinful ſoul; you</hi> can give <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi>
but <hi>you</hi> cannot give a <hi>reproof; this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> you
cannot bring <hi>your</hi> heart to; but take <hi>heed,</hi> though
<hi>you</hi> cannot bring <hi>your</hi> heart to it, yet <hi>neglect</hi> not to
be <hi>working your</hi> heart to it, to be <hi>perſwading,</hi> and
<hi>reaſoning,</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> your <hi>heart</hi> to it; take heed
there be not <hi>an Act of Indulgence</hi> paſſed for <hi>this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect:</hi>
take heed <hi>you</hi> do not ſay, <hi>the Lord pardon me
in this thing,</hi> and ſo give off, and let it alone.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Neglect not any opportunity of dutie.</hi> Whenever
the Lord calls to <hi>duty,</hi> let <hi>your</hi> heart anſwer: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the <hi>Lord</hi> opens a door for any <hi>ſervice,</hi> take the
ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>1. Be <hi>watchful,</hi> and obſerve every <hi>opportunity.</hi>
Sometimes the <hi>Lord</hi> puts <hi>thine enemy into thine hand,</hi>
gives thee ſome <hi>ſpecial advantage</hi> againſt ſuch a <hi>luſt</hi>
or <hi>corruption:</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Lord</hi> puts a <hi>price into
thy hand,</hi> an opportunity of getting in, or laying up
for thy Soul, an opportunity of <hi>laying out</hi> for <hi>God</hi>
or <hi>thy Soul,</hi> obſerve diligently all ſuch <hi>ſeaſons.</hi> Thou
maieſt do more, or get more, in ſuch an hour, than
in many daies after.</p>
               <p>2. Keep thy heart in a diſpoſedneſſe, and
conſtant towardlineſſe to <hi>Dutie:</hi> be alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to everie good work; ſee that however
ſometimes thou maieſt want power to perform,
yet to will may be alwaies preſent. When a
price is put into thine hand, ſeee thou want not
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:153036:173"/>
a heart to it; When thine <hi>Enemy</hi> is in thine hand,
let not thy heart ſpare it, let not thine heart be out
of the way, whenever the ſeaſon ſerves; let not
thy heart recur thus upon thee afterward, <hi>O what
a day have I loſt?</hi> how much ſeed might I have ſown
this day for Eternity? what a treaſure might I have
laid up for Everlaſting?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Above all, take heed you (live) not under a neglect
of duty.</hi> The moſt diligent and vigilant Chriſtians
have too many <hi>neglects,</hi> but ſee that <hi>you</hi> are not
<hi>guilty</hi> of any <hi>neglect</hi> in ordinarie; that there be not
any thing that <hi>you</hi> know to be <hi>your</hi> dutie, which <hi>you
commonly, and of courſe,</hi> paſſe over, ſo that <hi>this day,</hi>
is even as <hi>yeſterday,</hi> and to <hi>morrow,</hi> and next <hi>day,</hi>
and next <hi>week,</hi> and ſo on, is like to be as <hi>this day.</hi>
Whatever it be that <hi>you</hi> perform, ſuch a <hi>neglect</hi> as
<hi>this</hi> will unavoidably hinder the <hi>thriving</hi> of <hi>your
Souls</hi> in the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>1. The guilt of ſuch a <hi>neglect,</hi> will wither and mar
the <hi>beauty</hi> of <hi>what is done,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> will have
ſuch a <hi>ſtanding controverſie</hi> with <hi>you</hi> for what <hi>is not
done,</hi> that he will not accept or proſper <hi>what is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There will be the want of the influence of
thoſe duties that are neglected. We cannot want a
duty, but we may afterwards find the want of it in
the ſtate of our Souls. Grace out of exerciſe grows
to decay, and if <hi>one of thy ſpiritual members ſuffer or
waſt, the whole body ſuffers with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Devil will fill up the vacuities of our
lives. There is not a void Plat in thy Garden,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:153036:174"/>
but the Devil will be ſowing his ſeed; If you do,
the Devil will not leave an empty day, nor an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hour of your lives: If grace do not fill up each
day with the duties of it, he will fill it up with ſin:
'Tis an hundred to one, but a weed grows up in the
room, where a Flower is wanting.</p>
               <p>Brethren, if you would be thriving Chriſtians, be
Univerſal Chriſtians, for any work your Maſter hath
to do; be ingenuous Chriſtians, willing to know
your whole duty; be watchful Chriſtians, that you
may know your duty ſeaſons; and then be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
allow not your ſelves in, be not patient with
your ſelves under any neglect.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Take heed of the world.</hi> If you be Chriſtians,
Chriſt hath gotten the better of the world, hath
gotten the preheminence in you, and brought the
world under. If it be ſo, take heed it get not head
again, and that you may be both ſecured from the
ſnares of the world, and make your beſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as Chriſtians of it, Take theſe following Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Never make an exchange of Chriſt, or any thing
of Chriſt, for the world, or any thing that is of the world;</hi>
never buy or purchaſe any thing of the world at ſo
dear a rate, as the loſſe of any thing of Chriſt.
Loſe not any degree of grace, for the gaining this
worlds goods; loſe not a ſpiritual duty, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
on a worldly buſineſs. Enrich not your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
upon the impoveriſhment of your Souls.</p>
               <p>What poſſeſſion or uſe of this world, you may
have without your ſpiritual prejudices, enjoy it,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:153036:174"/>
and be thankful; but beware you do not ſo take
up with the buſineſſes, and take in the advantages
of this earth, that your ſouls ſuffer loſſe; that
you ſhould ever have occaſion to ſay of any thing
you have done or gotten, <hi>This is the price of my
peace,</hi> this is the price of my comfort, this is the
price of a Sabbath, or a Sacrament, or a Prayer; I
have loſt a Sabbath, I have loſt my communion
with God in prayer; I have abated the life and the
vigour, and exerciſe of my grace; and this is all I
have for it, ſome addition to my outward ſtate: I
have more of earth, but ſo much the leſs of <hi>Heaven,</hi>
more <hi>Gold,</hi> but the leſs <hi>Grace,</hi> more of this <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>

but ſo much the leſs of the <hi>Fountain.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
it was never the intent of the Goſpel to ſtrip
you of this worlds goods, but to ſecure you only
from the miſchief of it: be but ſo watchful, and
ſo fearful, and ſo wiſe, and wary in the managing
your worldly buſineſſes, in the improving or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
your worldly eſtates, that you be not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
loſers upon a ſpiritual account, that you may
have what you have as <hi>an addition,</hi> but not ſo in
<hi>commutation</hi> for Chriſt, and he will never begrutch
it you, or blame you for it.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Let not Chriſt and the world again change pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or interests.</hi> If Chriſt hath your hearts, let
him not again be thrown under your feet; If
the world begotten under foot, let it not again
get up into the throne, let it be your ſervant if
you will, but let it never again be your God.
Let Chriſt be the chief in you, let him have the
higheſt eſteem, the deareſt, the ſtrength of your
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:153036:175"/>
affections, the great command of you: Let the
Word of Chriſt be of more power with you, and
carry you farther, than all the gains and glory
of the World. Let not this be your rule, <hi>To fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſt and Holineſs ſo far as you may, without
any prejudice to your worldly interest;</hi> but let this be
it, <hi>Follow the world ſo fur only as you may, without
being falſe or unfaithful to Chriſt.</hi> Venture on in
Holineſs to the greateſt hazard of your eſtate,
but venture not after this, with the leaſt hazard
of your Religion. Reſolve to be Chriſtians,
whether you be rich or poor, but endeavour not
to be rich, but upon ſuch terms that you may
be never the leſſe Chriſtians. Eſpecially take
heed that the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of the World ſteal not
away your hearts: <hi>Pſal. 62. 10. If riches (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe)
ſet not your hearts upon them.</hi> 'Tis hard
to <hi>proſper</hi> in the world, and not to <hi>proſtitute</hi> our
hearts to it. Temptation of proſperity are the
worlds courting, and complementing, and woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our love: If ever a Suitor be like to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
it is when he puts on his beſt array, and
trims up himſelf in his Richeſt and moſt enticing
habit. Proſperity is the <hi>World in its glory;</hi> when
ever it preſents it ſelf thus to you, <hi>then take heed leſt
you forget God, and prove Adulterers aud adultereſſes
from Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Let not the Lord want any thing that you have,</hi>
There is nothing that you have, but it may one
time or other be ſaid to you, <hi>The Lord hath need
of it;</hi> and if he hath, let it go: If the Lord ſay,
<hi>I have need of it;</hi> do not you ſay, <hi>I cannot ſpare
it:</hi> Deſire to have only for uſe, and what you

thoſe that he cannot keep under ſo great a reſtraint,
he is content to hold <hi>in libera cuſtodia,</hi> as priſoners
at large, any liberty to pray, to hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
they may take, and yet be priſoners, he allows
to them: if you be not cloſe priſoners, if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
does ſuffer <hi>you</hi> now and then to walk abroad
and exerciſe your ſelves in the duties, and refreſh
your ſelves with the delights, and feed your ſelves

Oh let nothing content <hi>you,</hi> but <hi>your enlargement
out of priſon,</hi> ſo that <hi>you</hi> are no longer priſoners to
the world, but Chriſts free-men.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Be humble;</hi> keep <hi>your</hi> hearts low; <hi>be low in
your own eyes;</hi> think not of <hi>your</hi> ſelves above
what is meet; <hi>be content to be low in the eyes of
others:</hi> That is the harder leſſon of the two;
there is many a perſon that is ſo conſcious of
his own poverty and worthleſſneſſe, that if he
would, he cannot have high thoughts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
but <hi>yet</hi> he would, as <hi>Saul, be honoured before
the People.</hi> Take heed of an inordinate affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:153036:178"/>
of eſteem with others. Whileſt you pretend
only to ſeek a <hi>good Name,</hi> take heed of affecting a
<hi>great Name.</hi> Account your ſelves with <hi>Paul,</hi> and
be content if others account you ſo too, <hi>the leaſt of
Saints.</hi> Whileſt others are ambitious, with <hi>Simon,</hi>
to be accounted <hi>Some-body,</hi> be you willing to be
counted <hi>No-body;</hi> let who will affect to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongſt the <hi>Worlds great Ones,</hi> let it be enough
for you to be accounted amongſt <hi>Gods little Ones.</hi> If
the Lord hath lifted you up take heed of lifting up
your ſelves; your work is to abaſe your ſelves, and
then let God alone to exalt you.</p>
               <p>Pride is a <hi>pernicious enemy,</hi> and 'tis one of the laſt
<hi>Enemies</hi> a Chriſtian hath to conquer; a pernicious
<hi>Enemy</hi> it is, it caſts us out of the heart of God and
men; God reſiſts, and men diſpiſe the proud. A proud
man, whileſt he is his own Idol, is others ſcorn;
it deprives of comfort, it ſpoils duty, it keeps us
barren: A proud man is like the high mountains,
there's little good that grows there, the lower
ground is ever the more fruitful: He is like <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi>
an <hi>empty Vine,</hi> emptie to God-wards, all his
fruit is brought forth to himſelf.</p>
               <p>An humble Chriſtian hath this advantage in
his duties, he hath none to pleaſe but God; let
God accept me, and let others think of me what
they will: A proud perſon hath his luſt to pleaſe,
the eyes and ears of others to gratifie; God
and his Soul can have but little of him, that hath
ſo manie to mind; pride blaſts all that little good
it's mingled with; 'tis as the flie in the pot, that
mars all the oyntment: Chriſtian, if thou
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:153036:179"/>
badſt nothing elſe to keep thee humble, thy pride
might do it, and would, if thou duly laidſt it to
heart.</p>
               <p>Pride is one of the laſt enemies, and longeſt liv'd
that a Chriſtian hath to deal withal, it will riſe up
out of the aſhes, and ruins of other luſts; 'tis not
ſeldom that men are proud, that they are not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
or prodigal, or intemperate; nay, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
riſes up out of its own aſhes: Men may be
proud of their humility proud, that they are not
ſo proud as they have been: And can you be too
watchful againſt ſuch an Enemie?</p>
               <p>Be humble Chriſtians; be humble, if you will be
holy. Humility is of the Eſſence of the New-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure:
he is <hi>not a Chriſtan, that is not humble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet, Oh how much of this Pride have
too many of us to charge upon our ſelves? When
our eye is ſo much at Self, and ſo little at God,
in all we do; when we are ſo tender, and ſo
touchie at any thing that reflects upon our ſelves,
and ſo little affected with the diſhonour of God,
when our very abaſing our ſelves is in order to the
exalting of our ſelves: In our very Confeſſions of the
pride of our hearts, do we not ſometimes hope,
that the ſenſe which we diſcover of this evil, will
more advance, than the evil it ſelf will impair our
reputation? When whatever evils we acknowledge
by our ſelves, we are in hope they will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:
When we cannot bear it, to be reproved,
or to hear from the mouth of another, what our
own mouths do teſtifie againſt us: When we love
to ſpeak in our own praiſe, or if we have more wit,
than to be vainlie boaſting of our ſelves, yet we
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:153036:179"/>
love to hear our ſelves commended by others?
When we are envious at thoſe that out-ſhine us,
and ſo ſtand in the way of our reputation: When
we are ſo impatient of being contradicted, that
thoſe that are not of our mind, are not for our
company: Do not our habits, our looks, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
or behaviour, our diſtances which we keep
from thoſe below us, ſadly diſcover what there is
in our hearts? Oh Brethren, how is it that our
hearts tremble no more, to behold this monſtrous
deviliſh ſin appearing in us? How can we take
pleaſure? How can we take comfort in the beſt of
all our parts, or duties, or enjoyments, which are
ſo ſtain'd with this pride? Which is even as great
an Ornament to any true worth that is in us, or in
any thing we do, as a bliſter, or a carbuncle, to a
beautiful face: How is it that we do not oftner que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether ſuch a meaſure of pride as we find in
our ſelves, can ſtand with true grace? How is it
that we are no more aſham'd to draw nigh unto
God, when our hearts tell us, how falſe we have
been to him in all our ſevices? What an <hi>Image of
jealouſie</hi> have we ſet up; another God, beſides the
Lord, which muſt at leaſt divide with him, in all the
fruits that are growing up, out of any thing we
have received from him.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian, Labour to know thy ſelf more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly;
and amongſt all the luſts of thy heart,
which might, if underſtood, bring thee low, take
particular notice of this thy ſelf-exalting Spirit,
and if this do not abaſe thee, and ſhame thee, and
lay thine honour in the duſt, thou art proud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:153036:180"/>
5. Be <hi>Temperate.</hi> In the uſe of Creatures, I
mean, beware of Exceſſe; Eat and Drink for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
nor barely for pleaſure: Let not your Lord
be a loſer by his bounty to you, loſe not a dutie in
a Dinner; A full Meal makes many a drowſie and
ſhort <hi>duty.</hi> If you be given to <hi>Appetite,</hi> take heed,
<hi>give not to your Appetite</hi> all it craves; let not Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
but Conſcience be your meaſure. Eat not
your Souls into leanneſs, let not your Table become
your Snare, and that which is given you for <hi>your</hi>
Health, become <hi>your</hi> Diſeaſe. When <hi>you</hi> are at <hi>your</hi>
meat, remember <hi>your</hi> work, and let that limit <hi>you;</hi>
be only ſo free in <hi>your</hi> food, as may make <hi>you</hi> more
fit for ſervice? He that hath ſuch a race to run,
ſuch a warfare before him, muſt be <hi>temperate in all
things,</hi> or he may loſe the goal and the battel: not
only Drunkards and Gluttons, but even Chriſtians
that are accounted ſober, are more peccant this <hi>way,</hi>
than they are ordinarily ſenſible of. Their ſpirits
would be more free, their ſervices would be more
lively, their work would be more eaſie, and their
way more pleaſant, if they were but more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
Chriſtians, let this Scripture meet you at your
Tables, as well as elſewhere, <hi>Whether you eat or
drink, or whatſoever elſe you do, do all to the Glory
of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>Be moderate,</hi> Phil. 4. 5. <hi>Let your moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</hi>
Maintain ſuch a tranquility and ſerenity of
mind, let all be quiet, and in ſuch a due and equal
compoſure within you, that it may appear in your
carriage without. Let there be no noiſes, nor tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
but as much as poſſible, let there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:153036:180"/>
ſilence and calm upon your Spirits. Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>your</hi> cares; moderate <hi>your</hi> fears; moderate
your paſſions: Say to your Spirits, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to ſwell, as Chriſt to the Wind and Waters,
<hi>Peace, be ſtill,</hi> Get the Command of all within
you, and keep them under conſtant diſcipline; be
careful for nothing; fear nothing; be impatient at
nothing, that whatſoever happens to <hi>you</hi> without,
<hi>you</hi> may be able to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>None of
theſe things move me.</hi> Be not like thoſe weakly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
whoſe temper changes with the weather. Be
able to bear whatever changes happen from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
without any perturbations or perplexing
commotions at home. <hi>In your patience poſſeſs ye your
ſouls.</hi> Chriſtians, if you can but keep your temper,
whatever happens, you may keep your way, and
hold on your courſe whatever happens: An heart
our of quiet, will put your whole Man out of courſe.
If you can but be quiet and patient, you may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing; you may do any thing, that God will
have you be or do. Let your fears, and your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and your impatiencies looſe, and whither will
they carry you? When you ſhould be denying <hi>your</hi>
ſelves, you will then be ſhifting for your ſelves,
when <hi>you</hi> ſhould be following Chriſt, you will then
be running from Chriſt; when you ſhould be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out your ſalvation, all your care will be taken
up how to ſave your ſelves in a whole skin. Let theſe
be well laid, and you will have nothing to do, but
to follow your work, and to run your Race which
God hath ſet before you.</p>

that will help to convey-down any pill of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition

their ſtomacks would riſe againſt, and ſpit out

may convince them that <hi>you are their friends,</hi> the
friends of their ſouls, whilſt you appear the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

               <p>But ſtill take heed that your courteſie to ſinners
do not lead you in a compliance with them in
their ſins, that what you intend as a Net to take
their Souls, become not a Trap to take yours.
Whilſt you are a friend to their perſons, beware
you be not drawn aſide to have fellowſhip with
them in their wickedneſs. It is better to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil
than ungodly. Be as courteous as poſſible,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:153036:183"/>
yet ſo far only that your courteſie be neither a

their ſins. Be wiſe as well as kind.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, do not paſs over theſe ſecond-Table
duties (which I have for brevities ſake packed up
into a narrow room) as the lower things of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
wherein you may be excuſed or diſpenced
with; which a little praying or confeſſing will
make up, and ſo you may go on: Truth, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and Juſtice, and Mercy, &amp;c. are to be
reckoned among the weightier matters of the
Law; there is ſo much Religion in them, that
there can be no Religion without them: Though
there may be morality where there is no true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
yet there can be no Religion where there
is not Morality, <hi>Micha 6. 11, 12. Shall I count them
pure, with the wicked ballances, and the bag of
deceitful weights? The rich men thereof are full of
violence, and the inhabitants thereof have ſpoken
lyes, and their tongue is deceitfull in their mouth.
Shall I count thoſe pure?</hi> Are theſe my People?
What, holy and not honeſt, religious and not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous?
What, ſincerity without truth, a ſingle
heart with a double tongue? What, grace where
there is no peace, nor mercy, nor temperance?
What railers, and revilers, and quarrellers, and yet
religious? <hi>James 1. 26. If any man ſeems to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his
own heart, this mans Religion is vain.</hi> A dreadfull
word! There are many Profeſſors of Religion in
whom an unbridled tongue is found: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
light and vain words, how many falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
words, eſpecially how many bitter and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
words do we ordinarily hear out of ſuch

whence at other times we hear praying and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing?

Whatever Religion <hi>ſuch men have,</hi> it will do
them no good, nor ſtand them in any ſtead, it will
never ſave their ſouls; they may die and be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and lie in hell for ever, notwithſtanding all the
Religion they have. All the <hi>concluſions</hi> that men
make from ſuch Religion, that they are in a ſtate
of grace and ſalvation, are falſe and deceitful; that
faith, and that hope, and thoſe prayers, which will
conſiſt with the raiging evils of the tongue, will
never be any good evidence of a good ſtate: That
which cannot drive the Devil out of the Tongue,
will never prove Chriſt to be in the heart. And all
the <hi>expectations</hi> that are hence raiſed of future bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs,

                  <hi>Religion.</hi> In the Law, the Maſter of the Family
was by the appointment of God, to circumciſe all

the Maſter of the Family is charged, not
only to keep the Sabbath himſelf, but to ſee that
his whole Family kept it. <hi>Thou ſhalt do no work

to ſuckle their ſouls with the milk of the

there muſt be an account given of Souls. When
there is a Child brought forth, or a Servant brought
into thy Family, God ſayes to thee, as the man in
the Prophets parable, 1 <hi>King 20. 39. Keep this man,</hi>
look to this man, if he be loſt, <hi>Thy Life ſhall go for
his Life.</hi> If any in the houſe periſh through thy

go for his Soul. This is thy charge, and if thou be
not, faithful, ſo ſhall thy Judgment be.</p>
               <p>But what muſt we do for the right ordering and
governing our Families? Why,</p>
               <p>1. Inſtruct your Families, teach them the way of

theſe four general directions:

                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:153036:187"/>
                     <item>1. Be Sincere.</item>
                     <item>2. Be Steady.</item>
                     <item>3. Be fruitful.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. <hi>In your whole courſe, and all the particular actions,
of it,</hi> be ſincere. Sincerity is not a diſtinct grace,
but notes the truth of every grace, and gracious
aicton. There is a ſincerity of,
<list>
                     <item>Our State.</item>
                     <item>Our Actions.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. There is a ſincerity of our ſtate. That notes
the uprightneſs of our hearts in the main, and hath
been already deſoribed, in the directions I have
given, in the duty of ſelf-examination.</p>
               <p>2. There is a ſincerity of our actions: This is
two-fold, either ſuch as reſpects particular and
ſingle actions, or the ſeries of our actions, our whole
courſe, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 12. This is our rejoycing, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of our Conſcience, that in all ſimplicity, and godly
ſincerity, not in fleſhly wiſdom, but by the Grace of God
we have had our Converſation in the world; in all ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and godly ſincerity:</hi> There is a natural ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and a godly ſincerity; natural ſincerity, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
no more, but ſimplicity, or plain-heartedneſs,
when there is no guile or deceit in any action; no
purpoſe to deceive, no pretence of what is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
no Conſcience of any evil in what we do,
nor any evil intent in it. In this ſenſe, God bears
witneſſe of <hi>Abimelecks</hi> integrity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 6. Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
concerning his taking <hi>Abrahams</hi> Wife, that
<hi>he did it in the integrity of his heart,</hi> that is,
he knew no evil in it: He knew not that ſhe was
another Mans Wife, nor intended any wrong to
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:153036:188"/>
her Husband in it. Then there is alſo a godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity;
this ſuppoſes the ſincerity of our ſtate. He
cannot have his converſation in godly ſincerity,
that is not firſt a godly man. It concludes in it, not
only Truth, but Faith, and Love, and ingenuity
to God; not only a good meaning, but a good will
to the work, and to the Lord, for whoſe ſake we do
it.</p>
               <p>To walk ſincerely, is to walk both as in the ſight
of God, as the witneſs of our uprightneſſe, to whom
we dare to appeal, and in the <hi>power of the Grace of
God,</hi> which carries us on to purſue his honour and
intereſt. The <hi>oppoſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> to this ſincerity, is <hi>fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
or carnal policy, which models our Religion
and the exerciſes thereof, in a conſiſtency with, and
ſubſervency to our fleſhly intereſts: And hypocriſie
or diſſimulation, to which it is moſt properly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
And there is a two-fold hypocriſie in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Either total, that which denominates them
hypocritical actions, Or tial, when though as to the
main the heart be upright, and the action accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, yet there is ſome little mixture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
in it; which, though it be matter of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the doer, yet doth not wholy hinder the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of what's done. As there is no perſon, ſo
there is no action ſo perfectly ſincere and upright
with God, but there is ſome obliquities to be found
in it.</p>
               <p>Brethren, be upright in your way, be true to
the Lord, not putting him off with eye-ſervice,
but ſerving him in ſingleneſſe of heart; be inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
towards God; with good will, doing ſervice;
whatever good words you ſpeak, whatever good

forth, let <hi>good will</hi> be at the bottom. Let not fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

there's no deceiving of <hi>Gods</hi> Eie; when you have
done all you can to varniſh an empty or deceitful
work, God cannot be deceived; his eie ſees what

Brethren, time was, when a little ſin could not
ſuffice you, a little ſporting, a little pleaſure would
not ſerve your turn; you thought you would <hi>never</hi>
have enough of the world, and the luſts and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it; why, prove your ſelves, now to be as
heartily the ſervants of Chriſt, as ever you were
the ſervants of ſin, by being fruitfully his, as
ever you were fruitful to ſin. If Chriſt be a better
Maſter, and a better Pay-Maſter, let him have
more and more chearful ſervices. Bring forth good
fruits, and of all ſorts. As it is ſaid of the Tree of
Life that ſtands in the City of God above, <hi>Rev.</hi>
22. 2. ſo let it be ſaid of every living Tree that
ſtands in the Vineyard of God here below. That
they bring forth <hi>twelve manner,</hi> that is, all manner
of fruits; be fruitful in every good work, and
bring forth fruit for every ſeaſon. There are <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
fruits,</hi> and there are <hi>winter fruits,</hi> that God
expects from you. By ſummer fruits I mean,
thoſe that are moſt <hi>proper</hi> for the daies of <hi>your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,</hi>

will make the greateſt Tryal of you, which fall

               <p>There are ſome troubles that fall promiſcuouſly

troubles as leave men to their choice, either to ſin
or ſuffer: When godlineſs becomes the common

and ſhift our ſelves out of danger. Such afflictions
as theſe will make the moſt narrow ſearch, and

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:153036:194"/>
things, how do you think to follow him, when it
muſt be in hunger and thirſt?</p>
               <p>Doſt thou talk of ſuffering for Chriſt, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and hope thou ſhalt never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him, whatever come upon thee, when thy
heart tells thee, how much thou haſt ſlighted
Chriſt, neglected thy duty to Chriſt, <hi>contented</hi> thy
ſelf with a cold, heartleſſe, luke-warm <hi>Profeſſion,</hi>
without the power of Chriſtianity, and that when
thou haſt had no pretence of damage or danger

you will utterly forſake him, if ye be put to it,
for the <hi>ſaving of your Life.</hi> You that in a calm can
ordinarily remit your Religion, for the pleaſing
a lazy heart, will be like enough to renounce your
Religion in a ſtorm, to quiet a fearful heart. He
that can ſell his Conſcience for a Luſt, will hardly
be perſwaded to buy it, with the loſſe of all that
ever he is worth. Thou ſayeſt, it may be, with <hi>Peter,
Though I dye with him, I will not deny him:</hi> I, but
doſt thou deny thy ſelf for him now, deny thy
pleaſures, and thy eaſe, and thy companions now?
Haſt thou not many a time denyed him a Prayer,
or an Alms, when he hath called for it? Canſt thou
watch with Chriſt? Doſt thou walk with Chriſt as
thou oughteſt? Doſt thou live to Chriſt? Art thou
faithful in bringing forth fruit unto Chriſt, the
fruits of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe? If not, how
doſt thou think to be able to ſuffer for him? If
the way of Chriſt be too ſtrait for thee, thou wilt
find his burthen to be too heavy; if thou canſt
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:153036:195"/>
not bear his yoke, thou wilt be leſs able to bear his
Croſs.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, conſider what your wayes and your
doings are at preſent; and if you find the Lord help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you to walk in all <hi>good conſcience</hi> now, you need
not doubt of being enabled to witneſſe for a <hi>good
conſcience</hi> when called to it. If you keep the Word,
and do the work of the Lord, you may expect his
help for bearing his burthen. If you be faithful in
your lives, you are the more like to be faithful
to the death, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the Word of my

Rev. 3. 10.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>What you are in the ordinary and ſmaller croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

that lives, that meets not with his croſſes, which
though they be, many of them, but light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
things, below the Spirit of a Chriſtian
to take notice of, yet how ſadly may we obſerve at
what a loſs they are preſently by them. Every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Wind raiſeth a ſtorm; every little croſs puts
us out of courſe. What breaches are often made
upon our conſciences, what interruptions of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
what abatements of our comforts, to what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
are we put from Chriſt, and our holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

of an <hi>evil tongue,</hi> a ſcoffe, or a ſlander, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
our ſpirits are in an uproar, and there are
ſuch tumults raiſed up within us, that for the time
we forget that we are Chriſtians: Duties, and
Comforts, Chriſt and Conſcience, Souls, and
the matters of Eternity, and all regard to them,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:153036:195"/>
are laid aſide, and turned out of doors; Faith and
Patience, and Meekneſs, and Moderation, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made to be ſilent, or at leaſt cannot be heard,
for the noiſe of our paſſions, and diſquiets; and all
this ſometimes for ſuch trivial things, that when we
come to our ſelves, we are all quite aſhamed of our
ſelves.</p>
               <p>Brethren, ſuch fails by theſe lower temptations,
I cannot wonder if they make our hearts ſhake at
the fore-fight of greater. If every ſmall party which
the Adverſary ſends out againſt us, doth put us to
the rout, How ſhall we ſtand, when he comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us with his full body? If we are overcome of
the footmen, how ſhall we contend with the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?
If a rod, or a little finger doth ſo diſturb us,
how ſhall we bear the <hi>weight of the loyns,</hi> or the
<hi>ſtinging of Scorpions?</hi> If we cannot bear an unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or a nod, or a ſcoff, or a ſlander, what would
become of us? ſhould we be brought to reſiſt unto
<hi>blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloved, it is of greater import to Chriſtians
than they are aware of, both to obſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
daily, and their carriages in theſe lower
things, and to inure themſelves to patience, and
meekneſſe of ſpirit under them. Though it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e no
great vertue to be patient, where there is no great
provocation, yet there may be great benefit by it.
If we could but ſhame our ſelves out of this folly,
and childiſhneſſe of Spirit, whereby we are apt to
be moved with every toy; if we could reaſon, and
pray our ſelves into ſuch a fixed calm and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſpirit, that we could keep our way, with
the neglect of ſuch diſturbances, our lives would
be both more comfortable and <hi>honourable</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:153036:196"/>
and we ſhould be in the better preparation
for any harder things that might come upon us. If
we know how to be Chriſtians among briars and
thorns, we ſhall be the better able to continue ſuch
among Spears and Arrows.</p>
               <p>3. What, <hi>you are under the temptation of proſperity.</hi>
The World is a Chriſtians Enemy, it expreſſeth its
enmity in its temptations; the end of all its temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
is to draw us off from God. Its temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are of two ſorts, either of <hi>proſperity</hi> or afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and both driving at the ſame end, though in a
different way.</p>
               <p>Proſperity allures, entices, and flatters us away
from God; it ſteals away our hearts from God, as
<hi>Abſalom</hi> ſtole the hearts of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>David,</hi> by
fair ſpeeches, by its fair and ſmiling face, thereby
drawing us into a neglect and forgetfulneſs of God,
to grow cold and remiſs in our duty to God, to let
fall our love and affection, and to lay aſide our care
of Religion.</p>
               <p>Afflictions fright us from God, dealing by us as
<hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he ſought to get them off
from <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by his threatnings and <hi>great words,
Iſa.</hi> 36. If <hi>you</hi> will not hearken to me, <hi>I will make
you drink your own piſs, and eat your own dung:</hi> Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are apt to weary men out of the <hi>ways of God,</hi>
to ſtarve them out of <hi>their Religion,</hi> to perſecute
them out of their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> and to make godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<hi>too hot</hi> for them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>stronger</hi> and the more dangerous of theſe <hi>two
ſorts</hi> of temptations, are held to be the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of proſperity; the World flatters more from
Chriſt, than ever it can fright from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:153036:196"/>
Now beloved, if you have ſtood your ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the former of theſe <hi>temptations, you</hi> may with
the more confidence encounter the latter: he that
hath been <hi>holy</hi> in <hi>proſperity,</hi> will be <hi>holy</hi> in <hi>afflictions;</hi>
he that knoweth how to <hi>abound,</hi> will the better
know how to <hi>want;</hi> he that hath kept cloſe to <hi>God,</hi>
kept up his <hi>affections,</hi> kept on his <hi>way,</hi> againſt all the
<hi>fawns</hi> and <hi>flatteries</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> his <hi>Spirit</hi> is not
like to be ſunk under its <hi>frowns</hi> and <hi>threatnings;</hi>
The God that hath preſerved <hi>you</hi> from being lull'd
aſleep by the warm Sun, will alſo preſerve <hi>you</hi> from
being withered by the ſcorching <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. <hi>Mortifie the fleſh with the luſts of it.</hi> 'Tis cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
that makes affliction tedious and dangerous.
Unmortified <hi>luſts</hi> will both make <hi>affliction</hi> to be the
ſharper, and alſo to be the greater <hi>temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. They will make <hi>afflictions</hi> to be the <hi>ſharper</hi> and
more painful. A <hi>Chriſtian</hi> who hath two men in one,
the <hi>old man</hi> and the <hi>new,</hi> hath two tender parts,
which are apt to ſmart, and to be put to pain at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
little thing that offends: his Conſcience and
his Luſt: that which offends Conſcience, and makes
it ſmart, is ſin; that which offends <hi>Luſt,</hi> and puts
it to pain, is <hi>affliction.</hi> If Conſcience be grown dead,
and benumb'd, ſin never troubles, and if <hi>Luſt</hi> be
once dead, <hi>afflictions</hi> never trouble: kill <hi>your</hi> luſts,
and <hi>you</hi> at once kill all <hi>your</hi> adverſaries and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>What makes contempt and diſgrace ſo tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
Why, it is the pride of our hearts. What
makes povertie and want ſo grievous, but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe
and greedineſſe of our hearts: The
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:153036:197"/>
appetite will be quarrelling that it wants its dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
the wanton mind will be vexed, that it's depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of its gay cloaths, and rich attire; carnal fears,
and worldly cares, come in with their vexations:
kill theſe luſts, and you give preſent eaſe to your
hearts; 'tis ſin that makes ſufferings ſmart:</p>
               <p>2. They hereupon make afflictions to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
temptations: the more afflictions pain us, the
more ſtrongly do they perſwade us, to take heed of
that which brings them on us, and to comply with
any thing that will give us eaſe or relief. Every
pang and throb that comes upon us for godlineſſe
ſake, will be clamouring and crying out againſt it,
<hi>away with it, away with it:</hi> this profeſſing, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and preciſe walking, hath undone me; this
Conſcience hath broken my back, loſt me my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
my Liberty, my Friends; bereft me of all my
comforts, my credit, my quiet, and created all theſe
fears, and ſorrows, and vexations which are upon
me. Will remitting my zeal, diſpenſing with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
caſt off care, make me whole, and ſave me
all this harm and loſſe? why then ſhall I thus tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
my ſelf, when I have ſuch a way open to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
all?</p>
               <p>Brethren, would you be ſecure from ſuch temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?
get your luſts ſlain, which put an edge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: Cut off all proviſion from the fleſh, that
would keep it in heart. Allow not your ſelves the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to live a ſenſual life, while you have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
bring your ſelves under a voluntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint;
abaſe your ſelves, before God hath the
abaſing of you; denie your ſelves, before God
comes to denie you; put the bridle upon your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
before God come and puts bonds upon
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:153036:197"/>
them and you; reſtrain your ſelves of your delicates,
before God come and ſhorten you; uncloath your
ſelves of your wanton habits, before God hath the
ſtripping of you; ſtarve your luſts to death, that the
Lord come not and ſtorm them; let tribulations find
their hard work done to their hand, and they will
lie more eaſie.</p>
               <p>Get your hearts ſo low, that the contempt of
men cannot bring you lower; that the <hi>Spoilers</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make you poorer than your hearts have made
you alreadie; give all you have to God, your eaſe,
and your pleaſures, and your liberty, and your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates;
give away all you have from <hi>luſt</hi> to God, and
then you will be diſquieted at whatſoever Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
he ſends to fetch it away.</p>
               <p>When this is done, what hurt can tribulation do
you? what temptation will it be unto you? You will
then dare to follow the Lord againſt all the world;
you will not fear your Religion will prejudice you;
you will not fear loſſe; you have nothing to loſe,
all is given away alreadie; <hi>you</hi> will not fear a Priſon,
<hi>your</hi> hearts have cerried <hi>you</hi> thither alreadie;
<hi>you</hi> will not fear diſgrace or contempt, <hi>your</hi> hearts
have brought <hi>you</hi> ſo low, that the pride of men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lay <hi>you</hi> lower; <hi>you</hi> will not fear torments, when
<hi>your</hi> fleſh is dead, and can feel no pain.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Mat. 7. 27. <hi>The fall of that Houſe was great,</hi> that
is, it was a dreadful and terrible fall; it was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:153036:198"/>
of the houſe built <hi>upon the Sand,</hi> which when

               <p>Heb. 13. 38. <hi>If any man draw back my ſoul ſhall have

art gone from thy God; thou muſt look to thy ſelf,
and ſhift for thy ſelf as thou canſt, God hath no
further favour for thee; his ſoul is looſed from thee.</p>
               <p>Rev. 16. 15. <hi>Bleſſed is he that watcheth and keepeth
his garments: (that keepeth his garments</hi>) that is, that
keepeth his Faith, his Conſcience, his Religion, his
holy profeſſion, wherewith he is cloathed; that
keepeth them clean, <hi>ne polluantur,</hi> that hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
his garments; that keepeth them ſafe, <hi>ne cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piantur,</hi>
that hath not loſt his garments; that hath
neither defiled his Profeſſion, nor loſt his Religion
and Conſcience; he is a bleſſed man, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. and
chap. 3. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of
the Tree of Life, of the hidden Manna; to ſit with me
on the Throne. To him that overcometh,</hi> that is, that
holds out to the end. Hold out, and you overcome,
overcome, and you ſhall reign; overcome and
you ſhall eat of the Tree of Life, and hidden Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</p>
               <p>Now brethren, if a bleſſing be the portion of
him that keeps his Garments, keeps his Faith,
and keeps his Conſcience, what ſhall be his
<hi>Portion</hi> that hath loſt all, and thrown off all?
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:153036:198"/>
He that hath loſt his <hi>holy garments</hi> hath woven to
himſelf a <hi>cloathing of curſes,</hi> not of bleſſings; If he
only that overcomes ſhall ſit on the Throne, ſhall
eat of the Tree of Life, then what ſhall he eat, or
where muſt he ſit that is overcome? He ſhall eat the
fruit of his own doings, of his lyes, and hypocriſie,
and diſſembling, he ſhall feed upon death and
wrath; death ſhall feed upon him, and he ſhall have
nothing elſe to feed upon, there is meat for him to
eat, and a place prepared for him, ſuch as it is; his
place ſhall not be on the Throne, but under the
Foot-ſtool.</p>
               <p>Now put all this together, and you may ſee the
woful ſtate of Apoſtate Profeſſors, they are <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Vengeance:</hi> Though they have loſt their <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
yet they will ſerve for <hi>Pillars of Salt;</hi> a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
dread, and terror, and warning to others, on
whoſe foreheads is written, <hi>Let him that thinks be
ſtandeth take heed leſt be fall.</hi> They are cloathed
with curſes, muſt feed upon fire, and have their
dwelling under the foot-ſtool in ſcorn and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contempt.</p>
               <p>Apoſtates are the worſt of men, Thoſe that have
loſt their <hi>Religion,</hi> have loſt by their <hi>Religion,</hi> 2 Pet.
2. 21. <hi>Better had it been for them not to have known
the way of Righteouſneſs, than having known, to turn
from the holy Commandment.</hi> Religion, which is a
wing to Saints, whereby they riſe up into Glory, is
become a weight to hypocrites, to ſink them ſo much
the deeper in wrath. Apoſtates are in the worſt caſe
of all men.</p>
               <p>1. They are the worſt in Gods account. The Lord
hath a double quarrel with them, not only for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found under the <hi>Enemies</hi> colours, but that ever
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:153036:199"/>
ſuch varlets ſhould have marched under his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours:
A quarrel with them for their Profeſſion, for
their Prayers, <hi>wherein</hi> they have but <hi>abuſed his Name</hi>
and <hi>Goſpel:</hi> God and his waies have ſuffered from
none ſo much as from Renegado diſciples.</p>
               <p>2. They are the worſt in the account of men,
both good men and evil men: there are none that
can ſpeak well of Renegado's; they are the ſorrow
of Saints, and the ſport of ſinners, good mens
ſhame, and evil mens ſcorn, and the hate of all.</p>
               <p>3. But eſpecially they are the worſt and moſt
miſerable of men, conſidered in themſelves, they
have not only <hi>loſt</hi> their Religion, but they have
<hi>arm'd</hi> it againſt themſelves. All the profeſſion and
prayers that they have made, together with all the
hopes, and joys, and comforts that once ſeemed to
grow up out of them; the remembrance of them
(I mean, when ever they come to remember them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
will be as many darts in their livers, and
ſtings in their hearts. All their hopes, and joys, and
comforts have <hi>given up the Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>theſe ghoſts do
haunt them</hi> and torment them with ſuch thoughts
as theſe.</p>
               <p>Wretched creature that I am, where am I? what
an exchange have I made? Light for darkneſs,
Wiſdom or folly, Righteouſneſs for wickedneſs,
Gain for godlineſs, Conſcience for credit, Heaven
for hell!</p>
               <p>I was once, as I thought, in the way of Life, and
I had <hi>hopes</hi> I ſhould have ſeen life; I made <hi>profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of Religion, and took pleaſure in Religion; I
walked after the Lord, and the thoughts of God
were precious to me; I found comfort in Chriſt,
I took ſweet counſel with the Saints, and went to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:153036:199"/>
the houſe of God with them in company. Sabbaths
were a delight, Ordinances were a refreſhing to
me; I have taſted of the good <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the
powers of the World to come; and whilſt it was
thus with me, I had great peace, and was full of
hopes that I ſhould once ſee the goodneſs of the
Lord in the Land of the living.</p>
               <p>But wo is me, where am I now? How hath my
treacherous heart, that I never ſuſpected, turned
me aſide from God, and ſpoiled me of all my hopes

Lyars, welcome Turk, or Pope, or Devil, I muſt
now be of your ſide, and take up my lot with you
for ever. Oh whither am I fallen? Study well the
miſery of ſuch perſons, and let that be a warning
to you.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Be Circumſpect.</hi> See that you do not unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
pull ſufferings on your ſelves, eſpecially
look to it, that you <hi>ſuffer not as evil doers.</hi> If your
ſin lead you into ſufferings, God may leave you in
them, and then what is like to become of you?</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>ſuffering for our faults,</hi> there is a <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for our righteouſneſs, without our fault,</hi> and
there is a <hi>ſuffering for our righteouſneſs through our
fault.</hi> We ſometimes run our ſelves upon trouble
when we need not: as when by our unwary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
managing and ordering our ſelves in ſome
duties, we lay our ſelves open to thoſe ſufferings,
which a little prudence might have prevented.
We muſt be wiſe as well as innocent. Chriſtians
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:153036:200"/>
ſhould never ordinarily <hi>expoſe</hi> themſelves to ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
till God hath ſo hedg'd up all lawful waies of
eſcape, that they muſt either ſuffer or ſin.</p>
               <p>Be ſo wary in <hi>your</hi> courſe, that <hi>you</hi> may not <hi>faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily</hi>
ſuffer for the <hi>good that is in you;</hi> but eſpecially
ſee to it, that you ſuffer <hi>not as evil-doers,</hi> and <hi>for the
evil that is found in you;</hi> to this end be careful.</p>
               <p>1. That you ſpeak not, nor do any thing in the
matters of Religion raſhly. 'Twas good counſel
which the Town-Clark gave the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> when
they were in a <hi>tumult</hi> and <hi>uproar</hi> about their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe
<hi>Diana,</hi> Acts 19. 36. <hi>Seeing that theſe things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſpoken againſt, ye ought to be quiet, and to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
raſhly.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould be conſiderate and
well adviſed in what they ſpeak or do, ſhould mark
and weigh their words and actions themſelves, which
they know will be ſo narrowly obſerved and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by others.</p>
               <p>2. That you ſpeak not, nor do, nor refuſe to do
any thing <hi>obstinately,</hi> or out of <hi>ſtomack,</hi> or animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Let your wayes be guided, not by <hi>paſſion,</hi> or a
<hi>ſpirit of contradiction,</hi> but by <hi>conſcience</hi> and <hi>meekneſs
of ſpirit:</hi> be not ſelf-willed, let nothing be done
through ſtrife, &amp;c. <hi>Phil. 2. 3. Be ſtedfaſt,</hi> but not
<hi>ſtubborn;</hi> be <hi>faithful,</hi> but not <hi>wilful;</hi> be <hi>zealous,</hi> but
not <hi>contentious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That you neither do nor ſuffer any thing <hi>out
of pride or vain-glory;</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.
3. Do nothing, ſo ſuffer nothing <hi>out of ſtrife</hi> or
<hi>vain glory.</hi> Take heed that an affectation of <hi>popular
applauſe,</hi> of gaining the repute of <hi>active Chriſtians,</hi>
of <hi>bold and reſolved Chriſtians,</hi> be not it that leads
you on. Your pride may coſt you much, but will
never bear your charge, may bring <hi>you</hi> into trouble,
but will never bear you out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:153036:200"/>
4. That you do nothing <hi>ignorantly,</hi> or upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.
Be <hi>clear,</hi> eſpecially in thoſe things which may
be coſtly. Study your duty throughly, labour to
ſee <hi>your way</hi> plain before <hi>you;</hi> to ſee the pillar of
fire and of the cloud going before <hi>you:</hi> Give heed
to the word of the Scriptures, which is a <hi>light to your
feet, and a Lanthorn to your ſteps:</hi> Where you are
clear you will be bold; but take heed of ſuffering
upon a miſtake. Your troubles will be like to open
your eyes, and ſhew <hi>your</hi> miſtake, and thereby put
out <hi>your</hi> lights, deſtroy your ſupports and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
               <p>5. Do not ſuffer unpeaceably. Suffer not for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceableneſs,
and ſuffer not unpeaceably; be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and you will be peaceable.</p>
               <p>Brethren, ſee that you be thus well adviſed,
meek, humble, peaceable, and clear in the grounds
of your ſufferings: And then,</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Be reſolute. Be</hi> ſure <hi>you ſtand on good ground,</hi>
and then reſolve to <hi>ſtand your ground</hi> againſt all the
world. Follow God, and fear not men. Art thou
godly? repent not, whatſoever thy Religion coſt
thee; let ſinners repent, but let not Saints repent;
let Saints repent of their faults, but not of their
<hi>faith,</hi> of their <hi>iniquities,</hi> but not of their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
The <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> as holy a man as he was, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed mine hands
in innocency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look to your ſelves you that ſtand, and take heed
leſt you fall: You that ſtand in integrity, take heed
leſt <hi>you</hi> fall <hi>away by your</hi> Repentance.</p>
               <p>

Repent not of your righteouſneſs, leſt you after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
repent of your repentance. Repent not of
your righteouſneſs, no, nor of your zeal; or your

crowd, and more out of <hi>gun-ſhot,</hi> yet wiſh not <hi>your</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Repent</hi> not, and <hi>remit</hi> not of <hi>your</hi> zeal; think
not of a retreat. Do not as the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hide
<hi>your</hi> ſelves under a diſguiſe; feign not <hi>your</hi> ſelves to
be worſe, in hope to eſcape the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> better; the arrow
may find you, though you be hid from the eye.
Let not any of you that have been confeſſors of
Chriſt, return to be only his midnight diſciples.</p>
               <p>Forſake not the Lord till you can find a better
Captain, that is, till <hi>God</hi> ceaſe to be <hi>God,</hi> till the

leave you in the lurch, renounce it and ſpare
not. If ever Religion coſt you more than it is worth,
throw it off as you will.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, know when you are well, and hold
your own, be not betrayed out of your refuge. If
you muſt ſuffer, ſuffer for that which will pay you
your charges; ſuffer not for your ſins, but for your

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:153036:202"/>
Serpent, betwixt the profeſſing and prophane
world, about the ſubſtance and power of <hi>godlineſs,</hi>
ſome quarrels and conteſts there are about the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and appendants of <hi>Religion,</hi> matter meerly
circumſtantial: but whatever noiſe there be made
about ſuch things as theſe, the bottom of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
lyes deeper; it is about the body of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and not the skirts of its garments: it is he
that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, that doth and
muſt ſuffer perſecution.</p>
               <p>Art thou godly? Fix here, and let this be thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:
I live in a World of quarrels and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>contentions</hi> about ſhadows and circumſtances;
but for ſuch things as theſe, though I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
my ſelf by complying in my practiſe, with what
Conſcience complies not, yet I liſt not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
nor to perplex my ſelf or others about
them. But by the grace of God, whilſt God is a
God of holineſſe, whilſt holineſſe is the image and
Intereſt of God, whilſt theſe words of the Lord, Be
ye holy, follow holineſs, live righteouſly, ſoberly,
and godly in this preſent World, whilſt theſe, and
the like words of the Lord, ſtand un-repeal'd, by
the Grace of God I will be a Friend, an Advocate, a
Confeſſor, a practitioner of Holineſſe to the end of
my days. This is my reſolution, and in this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
I commit my ſelf to God, and ſo <hi>come on me</hi>
what will.</p>

            <p>For mine own part, what my Doctrine and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life hath been among you, you are witneſſes,
and God alſo. And however, I have great reaſon to
judge and condemn my ſelf before the Lord, and to
bewail it, that my Converſation hath been leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
and uſeful, than oh that it had been! yet I
go off from you with this <hi>Teſtimony</hi> upon my heart,
that I have not been of thoſe who bind heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and lay them on other mens ſhoulders, but
will not touch them with one of their fingers; but
my endeavour hath been, to preſs on mine own Soul,
and to hold out in my own practice, that Word of
Life which I have preached to you; and therefore
am bold, in this ſence, to exhort you in the words of
the Apoſtle, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as far forth as you
have ſeen me a follower of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Godly Miniſters, when they are part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from their People, would fain leave God behind
them. Though it be not unuſual, when the Lord ſends
them away, he goes with them; God and his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153036:204"/>
do not ſeldome take their farewel of people
together; yet their earneſt deſire is, that though
they muſt away, yet the Lord would ſtay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Faithful Miniſters would be <hi>Meſſengers
of Peace,</hi> going, as well as coming.</p>
            <p>As the Apoſtles firſt words were to be, <hi>Peace be
unto you,</hi> Math. 10. ſo ſome of this Apoſtles laſt
words were, <hi>The God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. When-ever Miniſters part with their
People, if they can but leave Godlineſs in them,
they ſhall certainly leave God with them. Or,</p>
            <p>Thoſe that obey the Goſpel, whatſoever, or
whomſoever they want, ſhall ever be in a peaceful
and bleſſed condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe things do,</hi> that is, live in the practice and
power of that Doctrine of Godlineſs, <hi>which you have
received, and heard;</hi> and then fear not, the God of
Peace ſhall be with you.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine I ſhall fully prove to you, after <hi>I</hi>
have premiſed,</p>
            <p>That the Doctrine which I have preached to you,
is the <hi>Doctrine of Godlineſs;</hi> the ſum whereof take in
theſe four particulars:</p>
            <p>1. That Jeſus Chriſt, who came into the VVorld
to ſave ſinners, came alſo to ſanctifie and purge them
from their ſins.</p>
            <p>2. That thoſe that believe in Jeſus, muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to maintain good works, or to live a Godly
Life.</p>
            <p>That this Godlineſſe is not ſuch a flight and
eaſie, and empty thing, as the miſtaken VVorld ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
but ſtands in an exact conformity of the
whole Man, He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, and Life, to the whole VVill of
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:153036:204"/>
4. That as whoſoever believe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not in Jeſus, ſo
whoſoever is ſhort of this true ſincere Godlineſs,
cannot be ſaved.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumme of that Doctrine which I have
preached unto you; which being the eternal Truth
of God, I herein imbarque my own Soul and Life,
deſiring to be found in that ſame Jeſus, and to be
found walking in that ſame way of Righteouſneſs,
which I have declared unto you.</p>
            <p>2. That my Deſign and Aim, in preaching this
Doctrine to you, hath been to beget in you, and
through the influence and aſſiſtance of the Eternal
Spirit, to bring you to this true Godlineſs. I have
travelled in birth with you, that Chriſt might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in you; that I might leave you poſſeſſors and
partakers of that Grace which accompanies Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that your Faith might ſtand, not in the VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of men, but in the power of God; That your
Repentance might be Repentance unto Life, not to
be repented of; that you might obey from the heart
that Form of Doctrine that hath been delivered unto
you; that you might ſtand compleat in all the VVill
of God; that you might be holy and harmleſs, the
Children of God without rebuke, in the midſt of a
crooked Generation, amongſt whom you muſt ſhine
as Lights in the VVorld, holding forth the VVord
of Life; that being rooted and grounded in love, you
might comprehend with all Saints, what is the height
and depth, and length, and breadth, and might know
the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge, and be
filled with all the fulneſſe of God: To this end have
I taught every one, and warned every one, that I
might preſent you perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:153036:205"/>
3. That as far forth as the ſucceſs hath anſwered
my Deſign and aim upon any of your Souls, ſo far
forth ſtand you entitled to this glorious Promiſe in
the Text, <hi>The God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> Look how
many Souls there are amongſt you that live in the
power and obedience of thoſe Truths you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
to ſo many can I with confidence give this
Farewel of the Apoſtles, without Its or Ands, <hi>the
God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> To whomſoever
the Lord hath been a God of <hi>Grace,</hi> to them will he
be a God of <hi>Peace.</hi> Whoever amongſt you have
this God of Grace dwelling and ruling in you, ſhall
certainly find this God of peace dwelling and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with you: As for all others, though I can hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
make this my parting prayer, <hi>The Lord be with
you, the God of peace be with you;</hi> yet I cannot turn
this prayer into a Promiſe, nor give you any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that the God of Peace will be with you.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, I ſhall now give you the
full proof of the Doctrine in the following Reaſons.
The Doctrine you remember is, <hi>Thoſe that obey the
Goſpel, whatſoever, or whomſoever they want, ſhall
ever be in a peaceful and bleſſed Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſons are,
<list>
                  <item>1. The God of peace ſhall be with them.</item>
                  <item>2. If God be with them, all things whatſoever
befall them, ſhall make for their good.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The God of Peace ſhall be with them;
theſe things do, live in the obedience of the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which you have received, and the God of
Peace ſhall be with you. This glorious Promiſe is
pregnant with all the bleſſings that Heaven and
Earth can afford.</p>
            <p>If you ask, why, what is there in it? I demand
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153036:205"/>
of you, What is there in God? God is in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
all that is in God, is here aſſured to the Godly.
The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of old attained to ſome glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the excellencies that are in God, by theſe 3.
wayes.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Per viam Negationis,</hi> conceiving of him as a
Being, removed from all things, ſignifying imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
as ignorance, impotence, iniquity, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility,
compoſition, alteration, or any limits or
bounds of this Eſſence, Power and Glory.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Per viam cauſalitatis,</hi> conceiving of him, as
the Fountain of all other Beings; and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding,
that whatſoever Excellencies, or perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are ſcattered up and down in the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are all united in him, from whom they had
their Originall.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Per viam eminentiae,</hi> by way of Excellency; ſo
that whatever perfections, whatever goodneſs is to
be found in any Creature, though it be not to be
found in God, <hi>formaliter,</hi> yet there is that in him (he
being the firſt cauſe of all) that doth infinitely, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundantly
anſwer them all. Though there be not
the ſame Specifick Excellencies in him, nor thoſe
very pleaſures and delights iſſuing from him, which
the creatures yield; yet there are ſuch Excellencies,
ſuch perfections as tranſcend and ſurpaſſe them all.</p>
            <p>The Scripture tells us more poſitively, and
plainly; that God is Almighty, Omniſcient, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent,
Infinite, Eternal, Unchangeable, All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
Holy, Righteous, Gracious; the Portion, the
Protection, the Rewarder, yea the exceeding great
Reward of them that diligently ſeek him. And this
is he, that is in the promiſe, God is in the promiſe.
I muſt not enlarge in this ſpacious Field; I ſhall
keep nearer the Text, and ſhall confine my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153036:206"/>
ſelf to theſe four particulars.</p>
            <p>1. God is in the Promiſe as the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> as
the Authour and beſtower of Peace. The greateſt of
Bleſſings, is the Bleſſing of Peace, Peace hath all
bleſſings included in it. It hath poſſeſſion, fruition,
and ſecurity; it hath plenty, pleaſure and ſafety: where
there's no peace, there's no ſecurity for the holding,
nor opportunity of enjoying what we have. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we have, we have it as if we had it not. Peace is
the greateſt of Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Peace with God is the moſt glorious of Peace.
What is there that's excellent, what is there that's
deſirable, that is not comprehended in this Peace
with God? Where there's Peace, there's <hi>Pardon:</hi>
guilt cannot conſiſt with this Peace; <hi>being juſtified by
Faith, we have peace with God.</hi> Where there's <hi>Peace</hi>
there's <hi>Grace,</hi> and holineſs: <hi>there's no Peace ſaith
my God, to the wicked.</hi> Where there's Peace there's
<hi>Love,</hi> and good will. As love, ſo peace is the union
no leſſe then this; the Almighty God bears you
good will. Theſe two, peace and good will, are
Twins: <hi>On earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> Where
there's peace, there's <hi>life,</hi> everlaſting ife; Internal,
is the ſeed of eternal peace.</p>
            <p>This peace is a <hi>Portion;</hi> peace with God is our
poſſeſſion of the God of Peace. This Peace is a
<hi>Sanctuary;</hi> if the God of Peace be with us, the
Peace of God will keep our hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in the World you muſt have trouble;
ſuppoſe you have, yet in him you ſhall have peace,
who hath overcome the World, Iſa. 26. 5. <hi>Thou
wilt keep him in perfect peace</hi> (in peace, peace, as 'tis
in the Original.) <hi>whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee.</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153036:206"/>
85. 8. <hi>I will hear what the Lord God will ſpeak, he
will ſpeak peace to the People, and to his Saints.</hi> What
a clattering is there in the World? what tumults,
and commotions are raiſed about the followers of
Chriſt, as if the World were falling about their
eares? The Devil ſpeaks wrath, evil men ſpeak death,
and bonds to them; breathing out threatnings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
perſecutions againſt them. In the midſt of
all this fearful noiſe, I'le hearken, ſaith the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,</hi>
what the Lord God will ſpeak. Whatſoever
men or Devils ſpeak, I'le hearken if the Lord God
ſpeak at the ſame rate. Oh no, he will ſpeak peace
to his Saints: Let the Sons of contention do what
they can, the Sons of God ſhall be the Sons of Peace;
they ſhall live in peace, they ſhall dye in peace,
they ſhall dwell in peace for ever, <hi>Iſa. 32. 17, 18. The
Work of Righteouſneſs ſhall be Peace, and the effect of
Righteouſneſs ſhall be quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.
And my People ſhall dwell in a peaceable Habitation,
and in ſure dwellings, and in quiet reſting places:</hi> Oh
how <hi>great is the peace that they have who love thy
Law.</hi> Chriſtians fear not to follow God: let not that
ſad word, nor the fulfilling of it, ſcare you out of
your duty, <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus
ſhall ſuffer Perſecution.</hi> What if they do? whilſt
you are able to ſay, I am perſecuted, but I have
peace; I am poor, but I have peace; In a Priſon,
but I have peace; in a Wilderneſs, but I have peace;
though all the World be againſt me, God is at peace,
my Soul is in peace; what diſcouragement ſhould
all that be to you?</p>
            <p>2. He that is the God of peace, is the <hi>God of
power.</hi> He promiſes peace, and he promiſes no more
than he can perform. He can create peace, he can
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153036:207"/>
make their enemies to be at peace with them. He
can make a league for them, with the Beaſts of the
field; with the Lions, with the Wolves, with the
moſt brutiſh among the people. He can ſay to the
proud Winds and Waves, peace, be ſtill, and they
obey him. He can give them reſt [from] the dayes
of adverſitie: he can give them reſt [in] the dayes
of adverſity: he can give his Beloved ſleep, upon the
points of Swords and Spears.</p>
            <p>3. He that is the God of peace, is the <hi>God of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi>
This is my great fear, that though God gives,
yet I ſhall break my peace; The God of peace with
me? oh! this is he whom I diſhonour, and diſoblige
daily; by my diſtruſts, diſcontents, impatiencies, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings,
and what peace to ſuch an hearr? what
peace, ſo long as ſuch unbelief, ſo much iniquity, as
I find daily within me, remaines upon me? Will he,
with whom no iniquity can dwell, dwell in that
heart, where there is ſo much iniquity, by which he is
provoked every day! but he that is the God of peace
is alſo the God of patience; who though he will not
bear the iniquities of his adverſaries, yet he will bear

            </p>
            <p>But how, or in what ſence, is it to be underſtood,
that this God of peace will be with us.</p>
            <p>I anſwer in three particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>heart of God</hi> will be with you <hi>Joſeph's</hi>
bleſſing, <hi>the good will of him that dwelt in the Buſh,</hi>
will be thy portion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. what was the Buſh? the
Church, or <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. What caſe was the Buſh
in? 'twas all in a light fire, 'twas all in a flame.
VVho was it that dwelt in the Buſh? God was in the
Buſh; and that kept it from conſuming, though not
from burning. The good will of this God ſhall be
with thee: his love, his favour, his care. <hi>I love
them that love me,</hi> Prov. 8. 17. <hi>The Lord loveth the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:153036:208"/>
Righteous,</hi> Pſal. 146. 8. The Love of God is the
womb of all good. Hence ſprang <hi>the morning Star,</hi>
from the love of God came the Son of God: hence
came that <hi>womb of the Morning,</hi> the bleſſed Goſpel;
which is ſo big with glorious grace; with Light,
Life, Pardon, Peace, Glory, Immortality; from the
love of God came the glorious Goſpel of God. <hi>The
upper Springs,</hi> all ſpiritual and heavenly bleſſings:
the <hi>neither ſprings,</hi> all earthly and outward bleſſings
do all riſe, and bubble up out of this Fountain, <hi>the
love of God. The precious things of Heaven, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
fruits brought forth by the Sun: the precious
Fruits put forth by the Moon; the chief things of the
ancient Mountains, the precious things of the laſting
Hills; the precious things of the Earth, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
thereof:</hi> All theſe flow in with the <hi>good will of
him that dwelt in the Buſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Love is all; the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. our
love to God is the <hi>fulfilling of the Law;</hi> that is, it
will bring forth all that to God, all that duty, and
obedience, which the Law requires. I may tell you,
that Gods love to us, is the <hi>fulfilling of the Goſpel:</hi>
that is, it will powre down all that upon us, it will do
all that for us, which the Goſpel promiſes. Look over
the whole Goſpel; read, and ſtudy every precious
leaf, and line of that bleſſed Book: and if there be
enough in all that to make thee bleſſed, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
thee on in thy holy courſe, all this is thine.
Thou haſt that love of God with thee, which will
fulfil the Goſpel: there ſhall not one jot or tittle fail
thee, of all that the Goſpel promiſes. <hi>The zeal of
the Lord of Hoſts will perform this,</hi> Iſa. 9. 7.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>help of God will be with you,</hi> the Lord
will be your helper in the day of your diſtreſſe.

Heb. 13. 5, 6. <hi>He hath ſaid, I will never leave thee

thy God.</p>
            <p>There's no man, whoſe Caſe may not be ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
as to be above all humane help. If he ſhould
cry out, as the woman to the King of <hi>Iſrael; Help O

<hi>Help O Man of God:</hi> the Man of God muſt anſwer,
If the Lord do not help thee, whence ſhall I help
thee? If he cry out, <hi>Help O my Friends,</hi> my Wit,
my Policy, my Purſe; all theſe muſt anſwer, If the
Lord do not help thee, whence ſhall we help thee?
But what caſe is there, wherein an [<hi>Help Lord</hi>] will
not do?</p>
            <p>Fooliſh men count their caſe deſperate, when
they come to their [<hi>God help</hi>] that's an uſual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
to ſet forth the extreamity and helpleſneſs of
any mans caſe. When we ſee men even loſt in any
miſery, and their caſe even utterly hopeleſs, then
to ſignifie our ſenſe of ſuch mens loſt condition, we
cry out, God help that man, God help that woman,
they are loſt Creatures. I, but if men did underſtand
and conſider what the help of the Lord is, they
would ſee there could be no caſe ſo deſperate, but
an Help Lord, might recover all: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6.
when <hi>David</hi> was greatly diſtreſſed, and all was gone,
<hi>He encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:153036:209"/>
Conſider here two things.</p>
            <p>1. What his Caſe then was; he was in great
diſtreſs; he had loſt all that ever he had; his ſpoyls
that he had taken were all gone, his Corn, and his
Cattel, his Wives, and his City were all loſt; he
had not an habitation in all the World; he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left him but a poor Army, and theſe were
worſe than loſt, they were even ready to fall upon
him: <hi>The people ſpake of ſtoning him,</hi> but <hi>he encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>What the event hereupon was; why God
help'd him to all he had again: verſ.</hi> 19. There was
nothing lacking to them, neither ſmall nor great, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſons, nor daughters; neither ſpoyl, nor anything
they had taken, David recovered all.</p>
            <p>Hence note,</p>
            <p>1. That a Chriſtian, when he hath loſt all, hath
yet a God to go to at laſt.</p>
            <p>2. Whileſt a Chriſtian hath a God to go to, his
caſe is never deſperate; let him but encourage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his God, and all will be recovered.</p>
            <p>Sinners, triumph not over the poor people of
God; when they are at their worſt, when they are
brought as low as your Pride and malice can lay
them; though they ſhould be ſtript naked, and left
deſtitute of all their comforts, though all the World
ſhould ride on their backs, and tread on their necks,
yet rejoyce not againſt them: though they fall, they
ſhall ariſe, when they are at their worſt, there's ſtill
help for them in their God.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Preſence of the Lord</hi> ſhall be with them.
Whither ſoever they may be ſcattered, they ſhall
not be ſcattered from their God. That Promiſe
made to <hi>Moſes, Exod. 33. 14. My preſence ſhall go

            </p>
            <p>The preſence of God is either,
General, or
Special.</p>
            <p>By his general preſence, he is every where:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Per Eſſentiam,</hi> he fills all things.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Per Cognitionem,</hi> he beholds all things.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Per Suſtentationem,</hi> he upholds all things.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Per Dominium,</hi> he governs all things.</item>

            <p>But to let this paſs as not ſo proper to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>2. There is his <hi>Special</hi> or his gracious Preſence,
whereby he manifeſts himſelf to be with his people.</p>
            <p>1. In ſome <hi>viſible and ſtanding tokens</hi> of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
as in thoſe extraordinary, the Pillars of the
Cloud, and of the Fire: and in thoſe ordinary, the
Ark and the Temple, of old, and the Ordinances of
the Goſpel now.</p>
            <p>2. In ſome <hi>inward influences,</hi> and irradiations,
upon the hearts of his people.</p>
            <p>3. In ſome <hi>viſible and ſignall effects</hi> of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
whereof there are very many. There are, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
others, theſe two notable effects of Gods
gracious preſence; which his People, by vertue of
this Promiſe, may with confidence expect,
<list>
                  <item>Conduction,</item>
                  <item>Covering:</item>
               </list>
they ſhall be <hi>Led</hi> in their way, and they ſhall be <hi>Hid</hi>
in their way.</p>
            <p>1. Conduction; <hi>The Lord will be with them, to
lead them and guide them in the way that they
ſhould go.</hi> Pſal. 25. 9, 12. The Meek will he guide
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153036:210"/>
in Judgement, the meek will he teach in his way, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
107. 7. He led them forth by the right way, that they
might go to a City of habitation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 8. Lead me,
O Lord, in thy righteouſneſs, becauſe of mine Enemies,
make thy way ſtrait before my face.</p>
            <p>The Lord leads his people in their way, chiefly
<hi>by his Word,</hi> which is a Light to their feet, and a
Lanthorn to their paths: And ſometimes alſo <hi>by his
Providences,</hi> hedging up all by-wayes, and leaving
but one way open to them, that hath the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the way of God. So ordering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that any other way that is before them, looks with
too foul a face, to leave any doubt upon them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that be the way of God or nor.</p>
            <p>It's never uncomfortable to the people of God,
while they ſee their way before them: <hi>Doubts</hi> about
their way, are more perplexing, than <hi>dangers</hi> in
their way. When they know what God would have
them do, they can chearfully truſt in him for any
thing they are like to ſuffer. Doſt thou meet with
Wolves or Lions in thy way? thou maiſt bleſſe God
'tis there thou meeteſt them, 'twould be ill meeting
them elſe-where.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Covering</hi> or Protection in their way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.
20. <hi>Thou ſhalt hide them in the ſecret of thy preſence,
from the pride of man; thou ſhall keep them ſecretly
in a pavilion, from the ſtrife of tongues.</hi> [Thou ſhalt
hide them in thy preſence] or face; thy light ſhall be
their dark place to cover them: <hi>Thou art my hiding
place,</hi> Pſal. 32. 7. [In the ſecret of thy preſence] the
Saints hiding place is a ſecret: Such, where neither
the pride of man can find them, nor can they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what it is. Reproaches ſhall not find them,
perſecutions ſhall not find them, whoſe Souls are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153036:210"/>
hid in God; they are not found, when they are
found; they are hid when they ſeem to lye moſt
open, and moſt expoſed to mens will, and luſt.
Sinners do not underſtand what refuge the Saints
have in God. It is a great ſecret, a Myſtery to them:
as the joy of the Saints, the comforts of the Saints,
are a ſecret; <hi>A ſtranger, ſhall not meddle with his
joy:</hi> So is their ſafety or ſecurity; they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what kind, nor how great ſecurity; what
ſure, nor what ſweet repoſe, the Saints find in God.
The ſecret of Gods preſence is a ſure, and a ſweet
reſting place, for all his Saints; but how ſure, and
how ſweet, no man knows, but they that enjoy it.
The ſecret intimations of the care of God for them,
of his everlaſting kindneſs to them; of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hand in all that befalls them, working it to their
greater good; the ſecret ſupports and refreſhings
darted in, as the beams of his Countenance; their
ſecret ſence, that their head, their main, is in ſafety,
though they have bruiſes in their heel, will yield
ſuch reſt in the day of greateſt adverſity, as men can
neither ſee, nor take from them. The Pillar of the
Cloud interpoſed, did both hinder the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
purſuit, and hide from their eyes the comfort of
that Light which ſhined upon the Camp of <hi>Iſrael.
Moſes</hi> knew what the comfort of Gods preſence
meant, when he ſaid, <hi>Exod. 33. 15. If thy preſence
go not with us, carry us not hence.</hi> 'Tis (if conſidered)
a great word. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was then in a Wilderneſſe;
among wild beaſts, among bryars, and thorns, in a
weary pilgrimage; but they had God among them:
The Lord was carrying them to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land
of their reſt, a Land flowing with milk &amp; honey: but
<hi>Moſes</hi> prayes, <hi>If thy preſence go not with us, carry us
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:153036:211"/>
not hence.</hi> We had rather be where we are, in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
with God, than to go to <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp; leave our
God behind us. If thy preſence go with us, we are
willing to go, when thou wilt, whither thou wilt,
which way thou wilt; though by the Tents of <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
Iſhmaelites, Moabites. Hagarens;</hi> though
through the Armies of <hi>Anakims, Zamzummims,</hi>
we'l go any whither, ſo God go with us. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God makes a <hi>Canaan</hi> worſe than a <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi>
the preſence of God makes a <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> better
than a <hi>Canaan:</hi> And this preſence of God, ſhall be
the Lot of all his Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. If God be with you, all ſhall make for
you: All Providential Occurrences, and Events
whatſoever: All Difficulties, Straits, Diſaſters, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoyntments,
whatſoever, that may come upon
you, ſhall make for your good. <hi>Rom. 8. 31. If God
be with us, who ſhall be againſt us?</hi> Who can be againſt
us! that is, None can be againſt us: Or if any be,
yet thoſe that are againſt you ſhall be for you. <hi>Gen.</hi>
42. 36. <hi>Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not</hi> (ſaid old <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
and muſt <hi>Benjamin</hi> away too? <hi>all theſe things
are againſt me:</hi> but yet as old as he was, he liv'd to ſee
all making for him. <hi>Rom. 8. 26. We know all things
ſhall work together for good to thoſe that love God.</hi>
This is ſuch a Promiſe, as if it were throughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
would ſet our feet on the necks of all our

            <p>2. What that good is, which theſe things ſhall

            <p>3. To whom theſe things ſhall work for good.</p>
            <p>4. How theſe things ſhall work for good.</p>
            <p>5. That they ſhall undoubtedly work for good,
to them that love God.</p>
            <p>1. What thoſe things are, which are eſpecially
intended, in that comprehenſive term [<hi>All things.</hi>]
Some there are, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> with others, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it <hi>univerſally,</hi> of all things whatſoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good or evil, extending it even to the ſins of
<hi>the Saints.</hi> It's true, God doth often bring good out
of theſe evils, making uſe of former ſins, to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
againſt future: as the thorn, that did hurt in the
Garden, will be of uſe in the Hedge: ſin often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
it's own death, which was intended to be
the death of the Soul: There's nothing that doth
make the Sinner more weary, and wary of ſin, than
Sin it ſelf: the review of what we have done, doth
ofteneſt fright us of doing ſo any more. When
you look back on ſin, and ſee it's face (for ſin carries
it's face in it's back) you'l fear it the more, when ever
you meet it again. There's no argument doth more
effectually humble, and break the heart, and make
it more fearfull, and watchfull againſt ſin, than the
ſhame, and the ſmart of thoſe ſins we have fallen by;
he that hath felt the wound, will take heed how he
playes with edge-tools. This is true, God doth
often make this uſe of ſin, to be it's own cure: and
therefore 'tis not ſeldome ſeen, that the <hi>chief of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
have come to be the <hi>cheif of Saints.</hi> Yet, beſides
that this is not the ſubject matter that the Apoſtle is
here treating of; let thoſe that bring ſin within the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:153036:212"/>
compaſs of this promiſe, and make this to run into
the ſence of it; that even all the ſins of the Saints
ſhall work for their good, let ſuch tell us, how, or
in what way its imaginable, that the <hi>ſinful decayes</hi> of
ſuch who back-ſlide from God, and never recover to
their former life, and vigour, but live and dye in a
languiſhing ſtate of Soul, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them tell us, how ſuch
ſins can be imagined to work for their good: 'till
then, we muſt enter our diſſent from this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This then is not the ſence of the promiſe, that all
ſins ſhall work together for good.</p>
            <p>And yet if it were, it would be but a poor argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to take the more liberty to ſin, becauſe God
will turn it to good; this would be even as rational,
as for a man to tear his fleſh, break his bones, pluck
out his eyes, burn his houſe, &amp;c. becauſe God will
turn all his ſufferings to good: he is little better than
mad, that would not conclude ſuch a man out of his
Wits.</p>
            <p>Others reſtrain it to the <hi>evil things</hi> that befall the
Saints, not the <hi>turpia,</hi> but the <hi>triſtia,</hi> their ſufferings
and afflictions; to that vanity, and thoſe vexations,
they are in bondage under, and under which with
the whole Creation, they groan and travel in pain,
waiting for their redemption: of which, the Apoſtle
had been treating in the former part of this Chapter.
And yet while they pitch the ſence, eſpecially on
ſuch things as theſe, they grant it may be extended
to all other things, ſin only excepted; <hi>ad omnes res,

            <p>2. What is that good, which theſe things work
to the Saints; or in what ſence all things may be
ſaid to work good to them. The ſence in general
is this; They ſhall all work to their welfare, they
ſhall all happen to them for the better: there ſhall
nothing befall them, but one time or other, they ſhall
have reaſon to ſay; 'Twas well for me, that it was
thus with me. The wiſdome and goodneſs of God,
did cut out ſuch portions continually for me, did
lead me thorow ſuch a <hi>ſeries</hi> and ſucceſſion of caſes
and events, which though I could not underſtand,
yet now I ſee that every condition, every contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
and occurrence of my life, through which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
led me, was uſeful, and could not well have
been wanted, but it would have been the worſe for
me. Thus in the general.</p>
            <p>Particularly, for the fuller underſtanding what
good it is that all things, to conſider, that there is a
twofold good of the Saints; Such as they obtain
and enjoy, whilſt they are <hi>in via,</hi> in their way or
Courſe; or ſuch as they ſhall obtain, when they are
<hi>in termino:</hi> when they are gotten to the end of their
way, when they are come to their place. Or thus,
There is a threefold good of the Saints,

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:153036:213"/>
good things of this life, which may ſerve, and
pleaſe, and delight us in theſe dayes of our pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage:
which may abide with us, and attend us to
our graves, but there will take their leave of us.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Spiritual good,</hi> or our <hi>bona animae,</hi> and thoſe
are either, 1. Exeternal, as the Ordinances of God;
the Light, Liberties and priviledges of the Goſpel,
the Society and Communion of Saints, and our peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and plentiful enjoying of them. 2. Internal, as
ſpiritual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>race, Faith, Love, Hope, Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Eternal good,</hi> or that glory and joy, that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
reſt and peace, the poſſeſſion of that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
incorruptible and undefiled, that is reſerved in
Heaven for us.</p>
            <p>Now here note theſe things.</p>
            <p>1. That our <hi>bona corporis,</hi> our outward good
things, are only good for us, as they are conducible
<hi>ad bonum ſpirituale,</hi> to the good of our Souls. The
<hi>bona viae,</hi> are only good in the event, when they tend
to the <hi>bonum Patriae.</hi> This World is but a Nurſery
for Eternity; we are planted in this, in order to our
tranſplanting into the other World: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we have here, is either good or evil, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the reſpect that it bears to hereafter: As far
forth as our immortal part is improved by theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
things, ſo far forth only, are they good for
us. He that hath this worlds goods, and is not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
made more rich towards God; he who proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
in this World, and yet his Soul doth not
proſper: much more, he whoſe outward fulneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the emptineſs, and leanneſs of his Soul:
Are theſe good things good for him? Is he in pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:153036:213"/>
upon a true account, whoſe Soul proſpers
not? It is not ever good to proſper in the World:
It cannot be univerſally ſaid, It's good to be rich,
its good to be in health, its good to be in honour,
it's good to be at liberty: the contrary may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it's good to be poor, to be ſick, to
be in diſgrace, to be in bonds: the neceſſity of our
Souls doth not ſeldome require it: Then alone is it
good to be full, and to abound, when our outward
abundance furthers our ſpiritual welfare.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, could we receive this truth, That our
outward good things are only good for us, as far
forth, as they conduce to our ſpiritual good, could
we receive this truth, and live under the power of
it; what a different judgement ſhould we then
have of all theſe worldly matters, from what we
have? and how ſtrangely would the courſe of this
world be then changed? Would there then be ſuch
violent and eager purſuing theſe carnal things?
Would there then be ſuch whining and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and murmuring at every croſſe Providence?
VVe would then ſay, This may be good for me; good
for my ſoul, how ſad ſoever it looks.</p>
            <p>2. That the external ſpiritual good things, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
and Ordinances of the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſo far
good to us, as they conduce to our internal ſpiritual
good; and they being ordinarily ſo, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
That ordinarily it is good for us, that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
them, and be not deprived of them. God may ſee
the cutting Chriſtians ſhort of thoſe Priviledges, and
Liberties, to be ſomtimes needful for them; and
then even this alſo makes for their good: VVhereof
more anon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:153036:214"/>
3. That our inward ſpiritual good, is good for
us, ſo far forth as it tends to our eterna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> good: and
therefore grace is ever good for us. It's ever true;
It's good to be holy, good to be humble, to be in
the fear of God, and to flouriſh in his grace. VVe
may have too much Money, too much Credit, but
we can never have too much Grace. Our greateſt
flouriſhing and fruitfulneſs in grace, will certainly
abound to our more full reward.</p>
            <p>4. Note, That this is the plain ſence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the promiſe, <hi>All things ſhall work [for good</hi>]
that is, whatſoever befalls, ſhall certainly promote
our internal and eternal welfare: And as far forth
as the outward Priviledges of the Goſpel, yea, and
the good things of this life, conduce towards this,
all ſhall work for theſe alſo. If it be good for us to
be rich, if it be good for us to be in honour, good for
us to be at liberty; good for our Souls, good in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to our eternal ſtate; if it be good for us that
we enjoy the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; there ſhall
nothing befal us, that ſhall hinder; there ſhall be
nothing wanting to us, that might further this our
good.</p>
            <p>The ſumme is, That all providential diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhall be ſo ordered, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t we ſhall want nothing
but what its better want than have: VVe ſhall ſuffer
nothing but what we cannot well be without, but
what the good of our Souls requires; and that which
we do poſſeſs, and that which we do ſuffer, ſhall not
fail of bringing about its end, the advancing our
eternal good.</p>
            <p>And if this be the meaning, what a glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is this? What can any rational man deſire
more? nothing ſhall befall him but ſhall be for his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:153036:214"/>
good: He ſhall be deprived or kept ſhort of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what he had better be without than have.
He that is unſatisfied with this Promiſe, it is either
from <hi>Luſt</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief;</hi> Either he doth not believe,
that God is true, and will perform this Word: or
elſe 'tis becauſe his Luſt muſt be ſatisfied, though
with the denyal of his Reaſon and Intereſt; he that
deſires an Eſtate in the world, Eaſe, Pleaſure, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
or any thing elſe upon any other terms, but as
they may be for his real good, hath as much loſt his
Wits as his Faith: and he that will take upon him
to know what's good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or him, better than God, may
as well take upon him to govern the World. You
may with as good reaſon, deſire a Feaver, or a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
that you may have the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaſure of your drink;
as for the pleaſures that carnal things would bring
you in, to deſire them, when they would be a ſnare
to your Souls.</p>
            <p>3. To whom theſe things ſhall work for good:
<hi>To them that love God,</hi> to them that are <hi>called accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his purpoſe:</hi> To the people of God; who,
you ſee, are here deſcribed by their <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
[the <hi>called according to his purpoſe</hi>] and their
<hi>Sanctification,</hi> [they <hi>that love God] Love is,</hi> as I
told you before, <hi>the ſulfilling of the Law.</hi> Love God,
and you will live in the obedience of his whole
Will: Theſe are the people to whom this Promiſe
is made; prove your Calling and Election, prove
your Sanctification, and you may write your names
in this glorious Promiſe: <hi>All things ſhall work for
your good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To thoſe that are Rebels, and Reprobates from
God, all things ſhall work together for evil. Whil'ſt
things hurtful work together for good to the Saints:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:153036:215"/>
all good things work together for the hurt of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
their Peace hurts them, their plenty hurts
them, their pleaſure hurts them: yea, both their
proſperity, and adverſity; their plenty, and their
poverty; their pleaſure, and their trouble, their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and diſgrace, and every thing that befalls them,
turns to their prejudice. Their proſperity deſtroys
them: their Table is their ſnare; their pleaſures are
their plagues; and their very puniſhments are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into ſin: every thing that befalls them, heightens
and hardens them in their wickedneſs, and ripens
them for vengeance. God is not with them, and
therefore nothing proſpers with them. God is with
his Saints, and therefore nothing comes amiſs to
them, but all for their greater advantage: Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
this is your <hi>portion,</hi> and your <hi>peculiar,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the men of this World ſhall neither partake with
you, nor be ever able to deprive you of it.</p>
            <p>4. How all things ſhall work for their good: in
ſpecial, how ſhall the <hi>evil things,</hi> the Sufferings of
this life be for their good: How can this be? Muſt
we disbelieve our Senſes, lay down our Reaſons,
ere we can believe the Scriptures? Muſt we call
evil, good; and good, evil? Muſt we count dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
light, and light darkneſs? Is pleaſure pain, and
pain pleaſure? Is loſs gain, and gain loſs? Is eaſe
torment, and torment eaſe? Doth Religion make
things ceaſe to be what they are, and to be what
they are not? or at leaſt, Muſt we believe, that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is the <hi>Mother</hi> of light, that good is the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of evil? Can we hather grapes of thorns, or figs
of thiſtles? Can darkneſs give light, or death it ſelf
bring forth life? Muſt we ſay, that contraries no
longer deſtroy, but produce each other, and that the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:153036:215"/>
womb brings forth its own deſtruction? How can
theſe things be?</p>
            <p>But muſt God give a Reaſon of his actions, or
elſe they are not! though evil cannot bring forth
good, darkneſs cannot bring forth light; yet, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
God bring forth good out of Evil, light out of
darkneſs? Though darkneſs cannot bring forth light;
evil cannot bring forth good, by a natural cauſation;
yet Cannot God make evil an occaſion of good?
Though it do work <hi>efficiently,</hi> yet can it not work
<hi>objectively</hi> neither to it? Though the torment, the
Medicine puts men to, be not eaſe, yet may it not
work towards eaſe? May not the ſtorm, though it
help not, yet haſten the Labourer on his work, the
T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aveller on his way? May not the darkneſs of the
night, make more diligent in the day? May not ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
teach men more temperance, and poverty more
frugality?</p>
            <p>But to proceed more diſtinctly; How can the
Saints evil things work to their good? That they
do ſo cannot be denied, unleſs we will deny, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, but common Sence and Experience;
but how comes it to paſs?</p>
            <p>I anſwer in 4. Particulars:</p>
            <p>1. The Affliction and Tribulations of the Saints
are <hi>the way</hi> that leads them on to the poſſeſſion of
that good, which God hath intended to them; affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are the way of the Kingdom; the Croſs is
the way to the Crown, <hi>Acts 14. 22. Through many
Tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
Pſal. 66. 11, 12. <hi>Thou broughteſt us into the net, thou
haſt laid affliction upon our loyns, thou hast cauſed
men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and
water, thou broughteſt us into a wealthy place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:153036:216"/>
Obſerve it; Their troubles are their way to their
Triumph; their very falling into the net, their way
to eſcape. Their Enemies boaſt; Eſcape! Ariſe!
yes, let them free themſelves with ſuch hopes while
they will, we have them ſure enough, we have them
under foot, we have them in the net: If this be their
way, wee'l keep them in their way long enough;
Now we have them down they ſhall not be able to
riſe. I, but yet it appears, through all this the Lord
led them forth into a wealthy place. The High-way
of the proud is not their more ready way to the duſt,
than the duſt of Saints is their ſure way to honour.
When <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to go to <hi>Canaan,</hi> they muſt take
the Brick-Kilnes, the Red Sea, the Wilderneſs, <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
in their way: could any one have imagined,
that the bondage, the ſtraits they were under, the
doubling their Tasks, the cruelty of their Task-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
their encloſure at the Red Sea, did mean any
good to them? yet how fell it out at laſt? their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diſpenſations had light in their latter end; Their
greateſt bondage leads on to their greateſt liberty.</p>
            <p>Every croſs Providence is a ſtep to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of the Promiſe; The Wheel is ever mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on to its end; it moves ſtill forwards, even
when it ſeems to go quite backwards: As the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by its many turnings and windings forwards and
backwards is ſtill in motion to the Sea, when it ſeems
to be running quite contrary.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, if ever the Salvation of God ſeems to
be removed farther off from you; If the work of
God ſhould at any time ſeem to go backwards; if
croſs winds ſhould turn the whole courſe, ſo that
you appear rather to be marching back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> than
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:153036:216"/>
on to <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet be not diſcouraged; though your
way be an unlikely, an unpromiſing way, though
you be led about forwards, and backwards, yet ſtill
you are making on: though the leſſer Wheels be
never ſo croſs and contrary in their motions, yet
the great Wheel is ſtill moving Right on to your
bleſſed and hoped end. God intends your good,
your ſpiritual good here, your eternal good here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
and believe it now, for he will let you ſee it
hereafter, that thoſe very things which moſt threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
your miſcarriage, and a total abortion of your
hopes, are made all to concur to the bringing them
about, and to your more full and ſpeedy poſſeſſion
of them.</p>
            <p>Note farther here two Things.</p>
            <p>1. All things work; not they ſhall work, <hi>de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo,</hi>
but <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> they do work; as the Apoſtle
ſays, <hi>The Myſtery of Iniquity;</hi> ſo we may ſay, <hi>The
Myſtery of the Saints Redemption doth already work;</hi>
the work is already on the wheel, and every wheel is
in its motion for you: not only your <hi>Brethren,</hi> the
<hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> who are all praying for your
peace and ſeeking your good, but your <hi>Enemies</hi> alſo,
the <hi>Dragon,</hi> with all his Armies, are at work for you;
all <hi>the Councils</hi> of this world, are already ſitting upon
the very <hi>matter:</hi> God hath call'd them together for
this purpoſe. The <hi>Pope,</hi> with all his <hi>Conclave;</hi> the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
Preiſts, Monks,</hi> and <hi>Friars,</hi> with all their <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents;</hi>
yea, the <hi>Devil,</hi> with all his <hi>Conclave</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi>
are all at work for the good of <hi>Saints.</hi> It's true, they
mean not, nor intend any ſuch thing, their deſigns
are againſt you; they count, they are working for
themſelves; as 'tis ſaid concerning the <hi>Aſſyrian,
Iſa.</hi> 10. 6, 7. God ſent him forth upon a Deſign of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:153036:217"/>
his own, to execute his Counſel, in the puniſhing of
<hi>Hypocrites;</hi> to purge out the Chaff from the Wheat;
<hi>nevertheleſs, he meaneth not ſo, nor doth his heart
think ſo;</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> minds not what God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
is, but follows his own Deſign, fights for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſpoils for himſelf; but God's Deſign is ſtill
carried on by him, though he think not of it.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Events</hi> in the World are driving the ſame
way; every Diſeaſe or Infirmity that comes upon
you, every Loſs that you ſuſtain, every Scoff or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
that you ſuffer; the ſhame in your Faces,
the Sorrow of your Hearts, the Torment in your
Bowels, the Aches in your Bones, are all working
your good. All <hi>the changes</hi> of your Conditions, your
fair Weather and your foul, your Sun-ſhine and your
Clouds, your Plenty and your Wants, your Eaſes
and your Pains, your Liberties and your Priſons, are
all making for you; your good is <hi>already</hi> working by
all theſe Things.</p>
            <p>See Chriſtians, what an Harveſt of Bleſſedneſs is
growing up to you, out of this <hi>Promiſe;</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> is
already ſowing, your good is already working; God
is at work, the whole Creation is at work, Men and
Angels, good men and evil men, Friends and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Heaven and Earth, and Hell, are already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to work your good.</p>
            <p>2. They work together, that is, as ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it, they work together with God: all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
cauſes work together with the firſt Cauſe; or as
others, They work together amongſt themſelves.
There is ſuch a concatenation and concentring of all
theſe ſecond cauſes, in the ſame Deſign, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they ſeem to thwart, and croſs, and deſtroy ſome
of them, what the others build and advance, yet they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:153036:217"/>
are all united in their End, they jointly contribute
in the Weal of the <hi>Saints.</hi> Though, if I miſtake not,
this latter be the more ſenſe of the two: Yet I know
no reaſon, why both may not be underſtood. In the
hand, and under the conduction of <hi>Providence,</hi> all
theſe lower Things concur and co-operate in the
good of the Church.</p>
            <p>By the way, obſerve what an Harmony there is in
all the Works of <hi>Providence:</hi> The moſt croſs and
thwarting <hi>Occurrences,</hi> do all conſpire, and go hand
in hand to bring about the ſame end. As the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vertues of various Drugs, do all concur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o make
up the Medicine: As the differing ſounds of ſeveral
ſtrings or Inſtruments, do all together make up the
Melody. As the differing Colours in a Picture, the
dark as well as the brighter, do jointly contribute to
the Beauty of the Piece; no leſs do the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and contradictory Actions and Events, both
make up the Beauty of <hi>Providence,</hi> and jointly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that one End, to which, by an unſeen Hand,
and an all-ſeeing Eye, they are directed, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>evil things</hi> that befal the <hi>Saints,</hi> come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them <hi>to keep out worſe things.</hi> Where-ever the
croſs comes, if it had not come, ſomething worſe
might? The <hi>Croſs</hi> may be a means to ſecure from
the <hi>Curſe:</hi> The <hi>Curſe</hi> was ſlain on the <hi>Croſs of
Chriſt;</hi> and our Croſs alſo hath its uſe, to the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
us from it.</p>
            <p>1 Cor. 11. 32. <hi>We are chaſtened of the Lord, that
we ſhould not be condemned with the World. Periiſſem
niſi periiſſem:</hi> I had died, if I had not ſuffer'd: 'Tis
more mens caſes beſides his that ſpake it; 'tis no
bad Exchange, to have a Croſs inſtead of a Curſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:153036:218"/>
3. The <hi>evil things</hi> of the <hi>Saints prepare them for
better things:</hi> that they may work good for them, they
are working them to good; working out their ſin
and iniquity, wearying them of ſin, <hi>Hoſea 2. 6. I will
hedge up her way with thorns: then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will
return:</hi> Sin brought in Afflictions into the World,
and Afflictions help to carry ſin out; the Croſs, to
which ſin was once nail'd, is now nail'd to Sin: The
<hi>Saints</hi> can ſeldome be medling with Sin, but they find
it too heavy for them; The Croſs that is nail'd at
the farther end of it, makes it a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may have their place, in purging away the filth of
ſin; <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, &amp;
this is all the fruit to take away his ſin.</hi> Our Lord
beats the Devil with his own Weapons, by thoſe

by which he labours to <hi>force</hi> them from <hi>Holineſs,</hi>

hath caſt up his Cards, he will find himſelf a Loſer
by all his Rage.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, comfort your hearts: thoſe Flouds
that are caſt forth againſt you, ſhall but waſh you the
whiter, and make you more meet to be partakers of
the inheritance of the <hi>Saints</hi> in Light: your <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
prepares you for your <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> No unclean
thing muſt enter in thither: and you are not like to
be made ſo clean, as by falling into the hands of the
unclean. The <hi>Saints</hi> never look ſo well: like Sheep
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:153036:218"/>
come from the waſhing, as when they come up from
the Pots, their very black makes them comely.</p>
            <p>Oh Chriſtians, what a comfort would it be, if
your Experiences might come in, and ſeal to this
Truth: If you could ſay, Thus it hath been with
me, <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray:</hi> I was proud,
and vain, and wanton, and ſlothful, and carnal, <hi>but
now have I kept thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sinners, What-ever your mind be in perſecuting
the Saints, never think to debauch them by it; if that
be your aim, you miſtake your courſe; the living
Spark which God hath kindled in them, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be
blown out, but be blown up, by your puffing at it; the
Dirt you caſt upon them, doth but ſcour them the
brighter: You take the beſt courſe you can, to keep
them cloſer to the Lord, and his way: The warm
Sun will more hazard the loſs of their Garments,
than the bluſtring Wind: Let them alone, the Spirit
of the Lord within them will be too hard for Hell,
with all its black Regiments; and will not only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them, but advance them yet higher, by all their
Aſſaults. Theſe ſtars ſhine the brighteſt, when the
Night is darkeſt: When you have done your worſt,
'twill be the better with them; though they will not
thank you, yet they will thank God, for what they
have ſuffer'd by you. If this be your aim to make
them like your ſelves, you may ſet your hearts at
reſt, and give over ſuch a vain attempt: Your fury is
like to do as little to force them, as your vertues are
to invite them to a compliance with you. Your Faces
are too <hi>foul</hi> to draw them into your love, and yet not
<hi>fierce</hi> enough to drive them into your fear. Sathan,
try thy utmoſt ſtrength and skill, and if thou loſeſt
not by thine own play at laſt, if thou find'ſt not the

poor people of God gotten nearer <hi>Heaven,</hi> by thy
attempts of plucking them down to <hi>Hell,</hi> then let thy
Lyes be believed before the everlaſting Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian, Make me not aſhamed in this ſame
confident boaſting of you; yea, contradict not your
God, by ſuffering your ſelves to be corrupted by evil
men. The Lord himſelf hath adventured deep upon
your Integrity and ſtedfaſtneſs: The honour of his
Truth and Faithfulneſs lyes at ſtake; he hath ſaid,
<hi>They ſhall not be afraid of any evil Tydings, their heart
is fixed, truſting in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 112. 7. He hath ſaid
<hi>By this ſhall their iniquity be purged, and this ſhall
be all the fruit, to take away their ſin.</hi> God hath ſaid,
<hi>All things ſhall work together for good to them.</hi> They
ſhall not be the worſe, but the better, for all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals
them: They ſhall love me and my holy wayes
the more, they ſhall cleave unto me the cloſer, they
ſhall be made more pure, and more tender, by all
they ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake: they ſhall love
Conſcience, and their Integrity and Faithfulneſs to
it, never the worſe, for that it hath coſt them ſo dear;
but ſhall prize it the more, and be the more wary and
tender, how they pollute and turn aſide from it. God
hath adventured deep on you, make not him a Liar;
the devil &amp; his inſtruments will be ready to ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
you, as once he did to the Lord, concerning
his Servant <hi>Job; Put them into our power, let us have
the handling of them a while, and thou ſhalt quickly
ſee, what truth there is in them, or what truſt there is
to them; they'l curſe thee to thy face, they'l deny thee
to thy face, they'l eat their own words, they'l be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of their God, their Godlineſs, and Confidence.</hi> Let
God be true, Chriſtians, and the Devil a Lyar; be
living <hi>Commentaries</hi> on this <hi>bleſſed Text;</hi> Let the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:153036:219"/>
World, and their black Prince ſee, that they cannot
make you miſerable, becauſe they cannot make you
ſinners like themſelves: That you are ſtill the more
upright, for falling into the hands of a crooked Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:
Let them ſee, that though your God will
not ſuffer you, yet you are contented <hi>to ſerve him for
nothing.</hi> That though his Hedge be removed from
you, yet your Heart is not removed from him: Be
able to ſay, <hi>Though all this be come upon us, Our
heart is not turned back, neither have we declined
thy way.</hi> Let our ſtanding and encreaſing in the
Grace of God, and abounding in the works of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
be a ſtanding VVitneſs for God in the
VVorld, and a Seal to his Scriptures, and in ſpecial
to the glorious Truth of this Text.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>evil things</hi> of the Saints, <hi>prepare better
things for them,</hi> their Sufferings go into their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
<hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our
conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt:</hi> Every ſuffering
comes with a comfort in its Belly: and the ſweet is
ſo great, as ſwallows up the bitter; 'tis a hundred
fold, that the <hi>Saints</hi> gain by all their Loſſes in this
Life; but how great ſhall their Reward be in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!</hi>
2 Cor. 4. 17. <hi>Our light affliction, which is
but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding
Eternal Weight of Glory.</hi> They ſhall not only have
weight for weight, meaſure for meaſure, their Load
of Glory, for their Load of Sufferings; but they ſhall
have over-weight, over-meaſure; good meaſure,
preſſed down, heaped together, and running over,
ſhall then be given unto them: According to their
deep poverty, ſhall be the height of their riches; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as their blackneſs hath been in their Houſes
of Bondage, ſhall be their brightneſs in the Land of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:153036:220"/>
Promiſe; <hi>for all thy ſhame thou ſhalt have double:</hi> The
double of thy Reproach in Renown, the double of
thy Tears in Triumphs, all thy bottled Tears ſhall be
returned in Flagons of Joy, yea in Rivers of Eternal
Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>By this time Chriſtians, you ſee what glory there
is in this good word: <hi>All things ſhall work together
for good to them that love God.</hi> And that none may
have the face to ſay, all this is but conceit; I ſhall, in
the next place, bring in clear and undeniable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that it is certainly, and unqueſtionably, ſo as
hath been ſaid: And therefore know,</p>
            <p>5. That all things do and ſhall certainly work,
<hi>for good to them that love God.</hi> This (beſides the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of this Scripture) I ſhall make evident, from
theſe three Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>1. There is a <hi>Divine Providence</hi> that governs the
VVorld.</p>
            <p>2. The Deſign of <hi>Providence,</hi> is the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the good purpoſe and promiſe of God.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Providence</hi> of God ſhall never fail of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
its end.</p>
            <p>1. There is a <hi>Divine Providence</hi> which governs
the VVorld: the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who deny <hi>Providence,</hi>
and leave all on <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> may as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that there is a God; which yet they are aſham'd
to ſtand to. Of <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf it was ſaid, <hi>Quem
nihil pudendum pudet, pudet tamen Deum negare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It can be no way reconcilable to the infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, who made this Glorious Fabrick,
with the various Creatures therein, either not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
them to their Ends, or elſe to take no care
for their accompliſhing thoſe Ends they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to. The whole Current of Scripture is ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153036:220"/>
plain in theſe matters, that he that runs may read:
Let the following Scriptures, amongſt others be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 1. The Lord reigneth, let the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
let the iſles be glad. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67. 15, 16. The
Eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou giveſt them their
Meat in due ſeaſon: Thou openeſt thy hand, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieſt
the deſires of every living thing. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 6.
Thou preſerveſt man and beaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 6, 7. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the
Weſt, nor from the South; but God is the Judge, he
putteth down one, and ſetteth up another. <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 6.
Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not
done it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 13, 14. Deliver my Soul from the
wicked, which is thy Sword, from Men which are thy
Hand. <hi>The confeſſions of thoſe Infidels,</hi> Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar
<hi>and</hi> Darius, <hi>ſpeak the ſame, Dan.</hi> 4. 35. All
the Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing,
and he doth according to his Will, in the Army of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and among the inhabitants of the Earth, and none
can ſtay his Hand, or ſay unto him, What doſt thou?
<hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 26. I make a Decree, that in every Dominion
of my Kingdom, Men tremble and fear before the God
of <hi>Daniel,</hi> for he is the Living God, and ſtedfaſt for
ever; and his Kingdom that which ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;
and his Dominion ſhall be even unto the End:
He delivereth and reſcueth, and he worketh Signes and
Wonders in Heaven and Earth; who hath delivered
<hi>Daniel</hi> from the power of the Lions.</p>
            <p>But more diſtinctly, the Lord governs <hi>all inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and ſenſitive Creatures,</hi> in their actions; he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Stars in their courſes. The Stars in their
courſes, he made to fight againſt <hi>Siſera.</hi> He governs
<hi>the Winds and the Floods;</hi> he bringeth forth the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153036:221"/>
Winds out of his Treaſures, he rides upon the wings
of the Wind. He maketh the Clouds his Chariots,
he ſitteth on the Floods; the Thunder and the Hail,
and the Rain and the Froſts, are all at his Command:
He giveth Snow like Wool, and ſcattereth the hoar
froſt like aſhes. He caſteth forth the Ice like mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;
he ſets bounds to the Sea, which it ſhall not
paſs; the Birds of the Air, the Beaſts of the Field,
the Fiſhes of the Sea; yea the ſtones and duſt of the
Earth, are all at his beck.</p>
            <p>More eſpecially, he rules and governs <hi>the men of
this World.</hi> He ſits in all the <hi>Counſels of men,</hi> though
they ſee him not, he orders all <hi>their Decrees;</hi> there's
no Decree can paſs unleſs God gives his Vote. He
rules in all the <hi>actions of men;</hi> even thoſe things that
are acted through our improvidence, come not to
paſs without the providence of God. He rules in all
the <hi>changes that are in the world;</hi> he changes the
times and the ſeaſons; he changes Kingdomes, and
Governments; he removeth Kings, and ſetteth up
Kings; he makes War, and creates Peace; he bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Bow, and breaketh the Bow, and cutteth the
Spear in ſunder, and burneth the Chariots in the fire:
Peace and War, Health and Sickneſs, Plenty and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
Life and Death, are all the diſpoſures of his
hand. He orders all the <hi>events and caſualties</hi> of the
World; even from the greateſt to the ſmalleſt.
Without him, not a Sparrow ſhall fall, nor a hair of
the Head ſhall periſh; though there be to men, yet
to the Lord there are no caſualties, or contingencies.
But all things come to paſs, according as his Hand
and Counſel had before determined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:153036:221"/>
2. The deſign of Providence (as it reſpects the
Elect) is the accompliſhment of Gods good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and promiſe. Providence governs the World,
and the purpoſe and promiſe governs Providence.
All the works of Providence have <hi>rationem medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
ad finem.</hi> God doth nothing in vain: it is not
conſiſtent with the wiſdome of God, to do any thing
for nothing. God would have his People look far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the things that are before them, becauſe
all thoſe things have a farther aſpect themſelves. All
the works of Providence have a double aſpect; they
look <hi>backward,</hi> to the purpoſe and promiſe; and
they look <hi>forward,</hi> to the end for which they are:
as they look backward, ſo they have <hi>truth</hi> in them,
exactly anſwering the purpoſe and promiſe from
which they have their birth. As they look forward
to their end, ſo they have good in them; and that
good (their ſubſervience to their end) is the reaſon
of their being. Here note 2. things.</p>
            <p>1. That the ſubſerviency of things to their end, is
the goodneſs of them; if the end be good, the means
muſt (as ſuch) be good alſo: If what God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
and promiſed be good, then all things that fall
in between, having the reſpect of means to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment,
muſt upon that account be good. If
our croſſes and afflictions, do ſubſerve the bringing
about of Gods good will, and good word, we muſt
ſay concerning them, <hi>Good are the works of the Lord.</hi>
It is not, how any thing looks, or feels at preſent, but
what it means, and to what it tends. If the potion
be bitter, and yet it tends to health; if the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
be ill-looked, and ill-favoured, and yet comes
upon a good errand, you may bid them welcom. And
thus all the Providences of God are good. If you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153036:222"/>
ſhould ask of any Providence, wherefore art thou
come? <hi>comeſt thou peaceably?</hi> comeſt thou for good?
they muſt all anſwer, <hi>yes, peaceably,</hi> for good and no
hurt. 'Tis but to help all that good into thy hand,
which hath been in the heart, and hath proceeded
out of the mouth of thy God that loves thee. There
is not a <hi>Meſſenger of Sathan,</hi> that comes to buffet
thee, but is alſo a <hi>Meſſenger from God,</hi> that comes to
thee for good. The very thorns in thy fleſh ſhall
ſerve thee for Plaiſſers, thine eye-ſores ſhall be
thine eye-ſalve, and thy very Maladies thy Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
            <p>2. That this relative goodneſs of all the works of
Providence, is the reaſon of their Being. Therefore
God doth what he doth, that hereby he may do what
he hath ſaid and intended. I do not ſay that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Gods taking this or that means, is alwayes
from any thing in it ſelf, or for his natural tendency
to ſuch an end above any thing elſe: God hath his
choyce of means, he can chuſe here or there at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
can make uſe of what he will to ſerve his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
but the reaſon why things are, is this, God
in his Wiſdom, ſaw their <hi>ordinability</hi> to this good
end, and thereupon in his Providence, he <hi>orders</hi> and
brings them to paſs.</p>
            <p>So that now, whatever befals a Chriſtian, he hath
this to allay and take off the grievouſneſs and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it. This had never been, but for the good
will, and good word of the Lord to me. The Lord
God hath ſaid he will bleſs me, and do me good;
he will heal, and ſancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie, and ſave me, and now he
is about it; by this he is working that Salvation
for me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:153036:222"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> you have no reaſon to ſay, If the Lord
be with me, why am I thus? why ſo poor, why ſo
pained, ſo perſecuted, ſo ſcorned and trampled
upon? ſure, if the Lord had meant my good, it
would have been better than 'tis with me: No, no,
'tis becauſe the Lord is with thee, and means thee
well, that he deals in this manner with thee. The
Deſign of his Providence towards thee, is the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of his Promiſe.</p>
            <p>3. The Providence of God ſhall never fail of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
its end. There is nothing wanting that
might give us the fulleſt aſſurance hereof. For,</p>
            <p>1. The Providence of God hath <hi>power</hi> with it.
He is Almighty that hath promiſed; he that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in the earth, dwelleth in the Heaven, and doth
whatſoever he will. <hi>Our God is in heaven, and doth
whatſoever he will. I will work, and who ſhall lett it?
Iſ.</hi> 43. Who can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what
doeſt thou? were it not for our unbelief, our caſe
would be ſtill the ſame in greateſt difficulties, as
when the Coaſts are moſt clear. We might ſay of
difficulties, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> of darkneſs, <hi>there is no
darkneſs with thee, to thee day and night are both
alike.</hi> Difficulties are no difficulties with thee, nor
is there difference betwixt hard and eaſie. He can
ſave with many, or with few; and with none, is as
well as with ſome. We once read he had too many
but never that he had too few, to bring about his
wosk. Oh how we do deſparage the power of God,
when our difficulties make us doubt? Is he God,
and not man? Is he ſpirit, and not fleſh? Wherefore
then doſt thou doubt? What-ever God hath ſaid he
can do: Believe he is a God, and thou wilt never
ſay, How can theſe things be?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:153036:223"/>
2. The Providence of God hath <hi>wiſdom</hi> with it:
he is the only wiſe, he is the all-wiſe God; <hi>He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
how to deliver the godly out of temptations,</hi>
2 Pet. 2. 9. He knoweth what is good for his Saints,
and when 'twill be in ſeaſon; he underſtandeth what
is proper, and pertinent to every caſe. What's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to every purpoſe, to every people, to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and for every ſeaſon; he knows when 'tis a
ſeaſon to abaſe, and when to exalt: when to afflict,
and when to deliver; when to put on the yoak, and
when to take off the yoak; when to pull down, and
when to build up: every thing is beautiful in its
ſeaſon. If mercies come <hi>out of ſeaſon,</hi> mercies would
be no mercies; and if troubles come <hi>in their ſeaſon,</hi>
troubles ſhould be no troubles: He knows the beſt
method, and means to his end, the fitteſt means; he
ſees ſomtimes the unfitteſt to be the fitteſt, the
moſt unlikely unpromiſing means, do often beſt ſerve
Gods end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if you would receive every diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as coming from the hands of the wiſe God: you
would never quarrel with your lot, nor ſay of any
thing that befals, I might be happy, but this ſtands
in my way. If you would give God leave to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
than you, you would ſay where-ever you are,
<hi>its good for me to be here,</hi> this is my way to my
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſt.</p>
            <p>3. The Providence of God hath <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> with
it. Pſal. 25. 10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy
and [truth] to them that keep his Covenant, and his
Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 111. 8. His Works are <hi>done in
truth.</hi> Gods works may be ſaid to be done in truth,
in a double ſence.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:153036:223"/>
               <item>In Reality.</item>
               <item>In Fidelity.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. In <hi>Reality;</hi> not in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> or in ſhew only, but
indeed. Gods Comforts, are Comforts indeed; Gods
Salvation, is Salvation indeed. The Devil will come
with his gifts, with his comforts, and deliverances;
but they are for the moſt part, but <hi>ſpectra,</hi> like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſhews, and apparitions; quite another thing,
than what they ſeem to be: ſinners comforts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances,
enjoyments, wherewith the Devil feeds
them, do leave them in as poor a caſe, and worſe
than they found them: you will never thank the
Devil for his kindneſſes, when you have prov'd them
what they are. If you do not find your ſelves as faſt
bound, in the midſt of all your liberties; if you be
not wrapp'd up in as many ſorrows, after all the joys
he hath procured to you; if the glittering glories,
the glorying pleaſures he entices you by, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
you with, prove not traſh and dirt, and meer
lies in the end, then ſay, the Devil hath forgotten
his trade of lying: the Devils works will be even
like himſelf, falſe and deceitful. But God is true, and
all his works are done in truth.</p>
            <p>2. In <hi>Fidelity,</hi> his Works are according to his
word. 1 King. 8. 24. <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken with thy mouth,
&amp; haſt fulfilled with thine hand. In thy faithfulneſs,
thou haſt afflicted me,</hi> Pſal. 119. Not only in thy
faithfulneſs thou haſt ſaved me, in thy faithfulneſs
thou haſt comforted me, in thy faithfulneſs thou haſt
ſuccoured me: but in thy faithfulneſs thou haſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
me, in thy faithfulneſs thou haſt humbled,
and broken me, and caſt me down. The promiſe of
God is, that we ſhall want nothing; we ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
want his Staffe, nor his Rod: neither comforts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:153036:224"/>
nor croſſes; neither joys nor ſorrows; we cannot
well want either, and we ſhall want neither, becauſe
God is faithful. You may not only write down
with the Apoſtle, <hi>God is faithful, and will not ſuffer
you to be tempted above that which you are able to
bear;</hi> but you may write alſo, God is faithful, and will
not ſuffer you to want a temptation. When 'tis ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
your hearts ſhall be glad; and if need be,
for a ſeaſon you ſhall be in heavineſs. God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
he will ever be true to himſelf, and therefore to
you, 2 Tim. 2. 9. <hi>He abideth faithful, he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
himſelf.</hi> Should he be falſe to his people, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be true to himſelf, to his purpoſe and promiſe;
his Word is not yea and nay. God is not as man,
that he ſhould lye, or the Son of man, that he ſhould
repent; that he ſhould ſay, and unſay: that he
ſhould ſay, and not do; you may write Gods name
upon every word he hath ſpoken, you may write his
Name (I Am) upon all that he hath ſaid: It
ſhall be.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſtians, put theſe three Particulars to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and if you cannot ſpel out the concluſion
out of them, <hi>the Providence of God will certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
his good Purpoſe and Promiſe concerning
you:</hi> You are of little underſtanding as well as of
little Faith.</p>
            <p>If God governs the World, and nothing comes to
paſs but by his Providence; if Providence governs
according to Gods Purpoſe and promiſe; if Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
cannot fail of accompliſhing both.</p>
            <p>If God be <hi>Almighty</hi> and can, if God be <hi>Wiſe</hi> and
knowes how, if God be <hi>Faithfull</hi> and true, let the
Devil if he can, with all his Sophiſtry, evade the
Concluſion, <hi>That he will certainly do all that good
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:153036:224"/>
for you which he hath purpoſed and promiſed:</hi> If God
be not able to perform, he is not good; if he miſtake
his way, if he uſe impertinent, improper means, he
is not the All-wiſe God. If he do not actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what he is able, and knows how to do, when
he hath ſaid it, he ceaſes to be the true God: So that
the matter is brought plainly to this Iſſue; If God
be God, if God be the All-wiſe God, if God be the
true and faithful God, this word which he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
(<hi>All things ſhall work together for good to
thoſe that love God,</hi>) ſhall not fail of its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in its ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Having thus proved the Doctrine, I ſhall, after
I have added a few words by way of Caution, and
anſwered an Objection or two againſt the Sence I
have given, of this Promiſe, and ſubjoyned a few
particular Inferences, deſcend to the general Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>1. By way of Caution.</head>
               <p>1. <hi>Limit not the Lord to your time and way;</hi> God
will make good his word, but you muſt give him
leave to take his own ſeaſon. <hi>He that believeſh ſhall
not make haſt:</hi> believe God, but do nor prejudge
nor precipitate, leaſt you fall into temptation. Put no
more into the promiſe, neither for matter nor cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
then God hath put in it: put not that
into the Promiſe, which God hath not put in it, leſt
you miſs and come ſhort of that which God hath put
in it. Let others miſtakes and miſcarriages be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to you: till God hath manifeſtly ſaid, do not
you ſay, <hi>This is the time;</hi> build not your confidence
on conjectures, your Faith on the ſtrongeſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions;
leſt your Faith prove but a fancy, and
your confidence your confuſion: make not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153036:225"/>
of God of none effect, by looking for its effect
out of ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Believe not your ſelves into Infidelity: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>Acts 1. 7. It is not for you to know the times and
the ſeaſons, which God hath put in his own Power.</hi>
Study the Word, and its commentary, the Works of
God, but be ſober in your Concluſions.</p>
               <p>This you may ſafely depend upon, and this will
be enough, if you have no more: God will make
good his good Word to you, ſooner or later, in one
time or other, in one way other; in the beſt time,
in the beſt way, in the appointed time, the Viſion
ſhall ſpeak and ſhall not <hi>lye, Habak. 2. 3. Though
it may tarry, wait for it; becauſe it will ſurely come
and will not tarry:</hi> At leaſt, at the end of the days.
When you ſhall ſtand in your lott: when you ſhall
be gotten on the banks of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſhall thence
look back on the Promiſes and Providences of God,
ye ſhall ſee and ſay, God is faithful, there hath not
failed one word of all that he hath promiſed: Now
I underſtand, though once I could not, how every
Wheel was turning, every Inſtrument was moving,
every event was working toward my good and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
welfare.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Let not your expectation cauſe an abortion.</hi> Let
not your looking for mercy, hinder the working of
your affliction: It is not ſeldom, and the Lord grant
it be not too common a caſe, that our door of hope
becomes a door of ſin. We do not ſet our ſelves
with that ſeriouſneſs, to humble, to purge our ſelves
from our iniquities, as we would do, did we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
our caſe more deſperate: our feares and our
ſorrows have not their kindly work upon us, our hopes
hinders it. We might have been more broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153036:225"/>
had it not been for our hopes of building
up: as it is with a perſon, who conceives himſelf to
be dying; he then falls to praying and repenting, and
ſetting his heart in order, becauſe he muſt dye: but
upon a little hope of recovery, he layes by his dying
thoughts and preparations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> When-ever you are under afflictions,
take heed that your expectation of deliverance to be
near, put it not ſo much the farther off. Watch nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
over your ſelves, and look diligently to it,
that your hope of redemption do not harden your
hearts, nor hinder your humiliation and repentance.
Hope in God, and wait for the promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But know, That till the Rod hath done its
work, it is not like in mercy to be laid by; and its
better to be continued in the Furnace, than to be
brought forth with your droſs unpurged away.</p>
               <p>Againſt this bleſſed Truth, there are ſome Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
As,</p>
               <p>Object. 1. Can it ever be ſaid, That the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of the Goſpel, and the preaching of it, can be for
good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This is an hard, Truth; but yet a Truth:
That even this ſhall work for good to thoſe that love
God.</p>
               <p>1. It's true, That the removal of the Goſpel,
and the Miniſtry of it, <hi>is a moſt grievous Judgment:</hi>
and that which carryes with it a greater evidence of
wrath and divine diſpleaſure againſt a People, than
any thing that ever befals them in this World. How
great a Judgment it is, we may gueſs, if we obſerve
thoſe Scripture expreſſions by which it's ſet forth
It's called the <hi>famine of the Word,</hi> Amos 8. 11. <hi>The
glory departed.</hi> 1 Sam. 4. <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153036:226"/>
taken away,</hi> Matth. 6. 41. <hi>The Salvation of God ſent
away,</hi> Acts 28. and can there any thing worſe
befal a People? a Soul-famine, an Eclipſe of their
ſpiritual glory, the ſhutting up of the Kingdom of
Heaven, the carrying away of the Salvation of God:
What worſe thing can come unto them? It's a
great wonder there ſhould be no deeper Senſe of
this moſt dreadful of evils, than is moſtly found:
Men little underſtand what they <hi>do,</hi> who either in
away of <hi>merit,</hi> or <hi>inſtrumentally,</hi> procure, and
bring on this plague; and few underſtand, or are
ſenſible, what they herein <hi>ſuffer;</hi> to be an <hi>inſtrument</hi>
in this helliſh work, is <hi>an office for a Devil;</hi> and
the <hi>ſuffering</hi> of ſuch a plague, (to them that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it) is <hi>an hell above ground.</hi> This darkneſs is
the very ſame for kind, with the darkneſs of Hell;
as the light of the Goſpel is the ſame in kind, with
the everlaſting light, as glory under age; ſo is this
thick darkneſs, <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> and <hi>in ſemine,</hi> the darkneſs
of the pit. Oh, what an hell of wickedneſs doth
this World then become! the Devil is then in his
Region, is let looſe, rules the World at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
deceives, devours, deſtroys Souls, without
contradiction, takes them captive at his will, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
them down by whole ſhoals to deſtruction:
Thoſe that obſerve what a World there is, where
the Goſpel is not; what oaths, curſes, blaſphemies,
belluine luſts then abound; what Lions, Tygers,
wild Bulls, wild Boars, Men then become one to
another, need not be to ſeek for an Argument, to
prove there is an Hell; they ſee an Hell above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground.</p>
               <p>Theſe dark and diſmal ſeaſons, are the Devil's
<hi>Marts,</hi> where he may vent his Helliſh Wares, his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153036:226"/>
ſnares, and temptations, his deceits and deluſions,
and every abominable thing <hi>by whole ſale:</hi> there's
nothing ſo falſe, ſo vile; and abominable, but he can
put it off at pleaſure; Adultery, Drunkenneſſe,
VVitchcraft, Sodomy, Buggery, Blaſphemy, Idolatry,
Atheiſm, any thing that Sathan hath to offer, he'l
find Cuſtomers enough to receive: and the truth is
the <hi>Devil</hi> may ſpare his pains; men then need not a
<hi>Devil</hi> to damn them, they'l do it faſt enough of their
own accords.</p>
               <p>Oh 'twere happy, if <hi>Saints</hi> were ſo buſie in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
their Light, to haſten them Heaven-wards,
as Sinners do their Darkneſs, to hury them to Hell.
Oh the ſad proofs, that the VVorld affords of this
Dreadfull Truth: Look into all the dark Corners of
the Earth, eſpecially there where there hath been
Light, and ſee if you find not all this fully proved to
your hand. Can he then be accounted a Chriſtian,
whoſe heart doth not tremble at the Thoughts and
the Fears of ſuch a ſore Judgement? He is both dark
and dead indeed, to whom ſuch a Miſt is not as the
firſt-born of Death, or the King of Terrours.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, if ever this ſhould be your caſe, make
not light of it; and take heed, how ſad ſoever it may
ſeem in its firſt approach, that no Tract of Time do
wear off the ſence of it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are weary of the Goſpel, that cry out
of too much Preaching, that are ſick of the Light
that ſhines unto them, you may know by what hath
been ſaid, what Judgement to have of them.</p>
               <p>But is it not ſtrange, that there ſhould be any
ſuch? That thoſe that have lived in the Light, and
ſeen ſomething, what difference there is between
Light and Darkneſs, ſhould yet love Darkneſs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153036:227"/>
than Light? Is it not yet more ſtrange, that
any that pretend to be ſet up for <hi>Lights,</hi> ſhould be
for <hi>Darkneſs?</hi> That the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſhould be againſt
<hi>Prophecying?</hi> that the <hi>Pulpits</hi> ſhould ring againſt
<hi>Preaching?</hi> Some there are, that are not aſhamed
to tell us, that hence come all our miſchiefs and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries;
to tell us, and to ſtand to it, that there's now,
in ſuch a Land as this, little need of <hi>Preaching;</hi> that
it had its uſe in the firſt publiſhing and planting of
the Goſpel; but now that the Goſpel is received,
and embraced, and competently underſtood, there's
now little more need of <hi>Preaching: Praying,</hi> and
<hi>Reading</hi> may now ſerve the turn. I would put in a
word or two to ſuch.</p>
               <p>No need of <hi>Preaching;</hi> Why? Is the end of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
accompliſh'd? Till the end be attained, there's
ſtill need, that the <hi>means</hi> be continued: and what
was the end of <hi>Preaching?</hi> Was it mens <hi>Instruction</hi>
only, to bring them to the knowledge of Chriſt, to
turn them from Darkneſs to Light? Was it not for
their <hi>Converſion</hi> alſo, to turn them from the power of
<hi>Satan</hi> unto God? Yea, and their <hi>Edification</hi> and
Building up in Holineſs to Salvation? Let theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Scriptures be conſulted, <hi>Acts 26. 18. Eph.</hi> 4.
11, 12, 13. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13. told
thoſe Chriſtians to whom he wrote, that he would,
and he thought it meet ſo to do, to <hi>put them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi>
as long as he lived, and to <hi>ſtir them up</hi> to
their duty; though ſays he, <hi>you know and be eſtabliſhed
in the preſent truth.</hi> You ſay you need <hi>no more Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
the <hi>Preacher</hi> can tell you no more than you know
already; and might not theſe have better ſaid it,
when the Apoſtle acknowledgeth of them, that they
did know, and more than that, were eſtabliſhed in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153036:227"/>
thoſe very Truths, he meant, to continue Preaching
to them? And yet he tells them, it's meet they be
ſtill put in remembrance of them: Sure <hi>Peters Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
weighs not ſo much with theſe men, as his
that pretends to ſit in <hi>Peter's Chair:</hi> But hath the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
indeed done its Work, and reached its End?
Witneſs the Objectors own caſes. Let not onely
their Lewdneſs and Impenitency, but their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Unbelief, come in and teſtifie, whether it
hath or no. They that have moſt need themſelves, are
they that ſay, <hi>There's no more need of Preaching.</hi>
There needs no more Argument, to ſtop ſuch
Mouthes, but the ſhewing themſelves: Or if it
ſhould have done its work upon you, yet hath it
done its work upon all: Are there no Unbelievers
left? Have all men Faith? <hi>Faith comes by Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi>
If you ſay, they have <hi>Bibles</hi> to inſtruct them, and
their own <hi>Conſciences</hi> to preach to them: I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, for their Bibles, two Things:</p>
               <p>1. Thoſe that are no Friends to the Pulpit, are
none of the beſt Friends to the Bible: Thoſe that
would not that the people ſhould hear, care not how
little they read the Scriptures: And be ſure, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Preaching is let fall, the Bible will in a little
while be laid aſide.</p>
               <p>2. Underſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt? How
canſt thou without a Guide? He knows but little of
the Scriptures, that doth not underſtand that they are
hard to be underſtood. There are, the Apoſtle tells
us, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Scriptures, Things hard to be
underſtood: As there are many <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to all that
read, ſo to many that read, all are ſo. The Vulgar
can as well read the Scriptures without their own
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:153036:228"/>
Eyes, as underſtand them without the Preacher's
Lips. Till we come to hold, that <hi>Ignorance is the
Mother of Devotion,</hi> or that <hi>Images are Lay-mens
Goſpel:</hi> till then, let it be granted as neceſſary, that
the Preacher's Lips preſerve Knowledge.</p>
               <p>2. For <hi>Conſcience;</hi> let the Word, at leaſt, be
Preached ſo long, till it be made manifeſt in the
<hi>Conſciences</hi> of all the Hearers: That <hi>Conſcience</hi> that
hath not been ſufficiently preached to, will prove
an inſufficient <hi>Preacher:</hi> Let preaching be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
till the Word be manifeſted in the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of
all the Hearers; and if you will needs have it ſo,
then let it be forborn.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hath the <hi>Devil</hi> yet given over Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and are the <hi>Preachers</hi> yet ſilent? Hath the <hi>Devil</hi>
yet given over his Preaching, his deceiving Souls,
his perverting the good wayes of the Lord, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
perſons from walking in them? Sure
there's need that Chriſt be preached, while there is a
Devil that impeaches him. Hath the Devil them that
preach him every day, and muſt not Chriſt have
them that preach him, at leaſt every Sabbath-day?
may <hi>once a moneth,</hi> or <hi>once a quarter,</hi> be enough for
theſe, when every day, and all the day-long, does
ſcarce ſuffice for thoſe? When, or where are evil
men ſilent? Are they not preaching daily? in the
Houſe, in the Streets, in the Taverns, on the Stage, in
the Stews? Preaching by their Oaths, their Curſes,
by their Lyes, by their Scoffs, by their Habits, by their
Cups, by their Whores, and almoſt by all their words,
and works? And is there no need that Chriſt be
any longer preached any where, when the Devil is
preached every where? If in ſuch a caſe the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
of Chriſt ſhould altogether hold their peace,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:153036:228"/>
might we not expect that the very ſtones would cry
out? This is but a ſeaſonable Demand. Let Faith
and Holineſs, firſt have none found that preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, before thoſe that preach them, be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
ſuch as may well be ſpared: But what need we
reaſon any longer, in a caſe ſo plain, wherein I can
have no Adverſaries, but ſuch as the Apoſtle had,
when he fought with Beaſts at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Whoſoever
is an Adverſary to Preaching, is either an Infidel, or
a Brute. I ſhall only leave one word for ſuch to chew
upon, and ſo leave them and their cauſe to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, <hi>Act. 13. 46. It was neceſſary, that the
Word of God ſhould have been first ſpoken to you:
but becauſe you put it from you, and judge your
ſelves unworthy of everlaſting Life, Lo we turn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Gentiles?</hi> Let all back-friends to Preaching,
pauſe ſadly upon that Word; you have prevented
the Judgement of God, by putting the Word from
you, you have given your ſelves your own Sentence,
you have judged your ſelves unworthy of Everlaſting
Life. Well, by what hath been ſaid, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all that can be ſaid againſt it, it appears, that the
removal of the Goſpel, and the preaching of it, is a
grievous Judgement.</p>
               <p>2. This grievous Judgment ſhall yet work to the
good of <hi>Saints:</hi> That which comes in Wrath on
ſome, may be in Mercy to others: 'Tis the ignorant,
the unconverted, the unbelieving part of men, on
whom the Vengeance of this Judgment falls: 'Tis
thoſe that are weary of the Word, that can worſe
it. Sinners, you that ſay to the <hi>Seers,</hi> ſee not, to the
<hi>Prophets,</hi> propheſie no more to us; let us alone, we
have enough of this preaching: if God once ſay, as
you ſay, <hi>Let it be according to their word,</hi> 'tis your
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:153036:229"/>
Souls are like to go for it: And 'tis not the leaſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of the Sorrows of the <hi>Saints,</hi> the miſery
they ſee, hereby coming on you: As for themſelves,
(that I may anſwer more diſtinctly)</p>
               <p>1. The Goſpel ſhall never be <hi>totally</hi> removed
from them; they ſhall never ſee days of Famine: If
they never again hear the joyful Sound from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
they ſhall have it within. The VVord which they
have receiv'd, ſhall be in them a VVell of VVater,
ſpringing up unto Eternal Life: If the ſhowers and
the Rain fail, yet the Spring whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is within them,
ſhall ſupply that want: If they have no Bible in the
Houſe, no Preaching in the Pulpit, yet they have a
Bible in their Hearts, a Preacher in their Breaſts, that
ſhall inſtruct and comfort them. <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dream,
and the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of it, ſhall be to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
and not to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The lean Kine ſhall not devour
the fat ones; there is a <hi>Store-houſe,</hi> from whence
they ſhall be ſupply'd.</p>
               <p>VVhatever ſcarcity there be, this is certain, not one
of them ſhall want a <hi>Viaticum,</hi> to bring them to
their Journeys end. God will not ſuffer one of his
Elect to ſtarve or periſh in the way: There ſhall
not fail means of one kind or another, till the whole
Body be perfected and built up: <hi>Till (we all) come
unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature
of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That <hi>Scarcity,</hi> that does at any time befall
them, ſhall happen to them for the better, and not
for the worſe.</p>
               <p>1. For who knows, when-ever the Miniſtry is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
but it may be in order to a greater Glory at
it's Return? Perhaps, God's ſending away Paſtors
from a People, may be as <hi>Paul</hi>'s abſence from the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:153036:229"/>
                  <hi>Romanes,</hi> that they may return, <hi>in the fulneſs of the
bleſſing of the Goſpel:</hi> Or as <hi>Oneſimus</hi> his departing
from <hi>Philemon:</hi> Perhaps, they therefore depart for
a ſeaſon, that they may be received for ever: Or if
this ſhould not be the caſe of any particular Church,
if they ſhould return no more; yet,</p>
               <p>2. Their want of means ſhall ſupply their want
of means; their want of means ſhall be their means:
When they have no Preacher, their empty Pulpits
ſhall preach to them; this moſt ſmarting of Rods
will have its voyce. If they have no longer the Light
with them, their darkneſs ſhall inſtruct them; if they
want their <hi>burning</hi> Lights, the very Cold ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and increaſe their inward vigour; the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
of others ſhall make them more holy; the
violence of evil men upon ſin, ſhall enkindle their
zeal for God; the darkneſs that's here below ſhall
make them to live more above; and all this ſhall
make to their fuller reward. 'Tis a greater vertue
to keep up the heart, to keep on our way, where
there is a want, than where there are abundance of

greater reward.</p>
               <p>3. The failing of the Word will bring back to
their Memories, and upon their own hearts, that

the Stomack, will cauſe a ſecond and better Conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and turn it into better nouriſhment; when
there are no more Loaves, they'l gather up the
Fragments, that nothing be loſt; the leſs there is, more
to be had; the more reckoning, &amp; the better uſe they
will make of what they have; their preſent want,
will be a rebuke of their former wantonneſs: their
want of remembrancers will help their Memories, &amp;

whet their Appetites. Every old truth, that hath been
too much laid by, will then be precious.</p>
               <p>4. Whenever ordinary means fail, God will either
find extraordinary, or elſe will feed them more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

that <hi>thoſe that fear the Lord, ſhall want no good
thing.</hi> If that be meant of temporal good things, yet
ſure, it will yield us an argument, that will reach
the preſent caſe. If God will provide for their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſes,
much more for their Souls. If God will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them with leſs neceſſaries, then doubtleſs he will
not be wanting in what is abſolutely neceſſary, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
23. 1, 2, 3. <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd, I ſhall not want;</hi>
and ſo on through the Pſalm. <hi>Surely goodneſs and

               <p>Here we have the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> concluſion, and it's
foundation; or his confidence, and its ground;
his foundation or ground is, the Lord is my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard;
his concluſion and confidence is, I ſhall not

by the following part of the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
Logick, and his Faith too, does not fail him, the
concluſion is firm; let the Lord be his Shepherd,
and he ſhall not know famine or want.</p>
               <p>Gods Relation to his people, is their ſecurity,
for a ſufficient proviſion in all times. If the Lord be
their Shepherd, he muſt ſee them fed; he muſt either
find them thoſe that ſhall, or do it himſelf.
He muſt either find them Paſtors, or be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor;
he muſt either provide them, or be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.
If ordinary means fail, he muſt find extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:153036:230"/>
if both fail, he muſt be inſtead of means to
them.</p>
               <p>Here two things.</p>
               <p>1. That God ſtands engaged, as the Shepherd
of his people, where ordinary means fail, either to
provide them extraordinary, or to feed them more
immediately from himſelf.</p>
               <p>2. That extraordinary means, or no means, when
God brings his people to it, will be better than their
ordinary means.</p>
               <p>1. That God ſtands engaged, as the Shepherd of
his people, where ordinary means fail, either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
them extraordinary, or to feed them more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from himſelf. Feed them he muſt, or he
cannot be faithful; and if means fail, he muſt ſupply
that want one way or other. Now God is faithful,
and will not ſee his Sheep to ſtarve. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 17, 18.
<hi>When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there is none,
and their tongue faileth for thirſt, I the Lord will hear
them, I the God of Iſrael will not forſake them. I will
open Rivers in high places, and Fountains in the midſt
of the Vallyes; I will make the Wilderneſs a Pool of
water, and the dry Land, Springs of water.</hi> Oh what
a good Word is here for the poor Saints to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in hard times! It is interpreted to have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
reference to the outward, and yet a ſpecial
reſpect alſo to the ſpiritual wants and diſtreſſes.
And it will appear, if we compare it with the like
expreſſions. Chap. 44. 3. <hi>I will pour water upon him
that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will
pour my Spirit on thy Seed, and my bleſſing upon thine
off-ſpring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the former Scriptures note,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153036:231"/>
1. That the poor people of God, may ſomtimes
be (as to the viſible Soul-proviſions) but in a poor
caſe. Needy, and hungry, and thirſty, their hearts
fainting, their tongues failing for thirſt, and their
waters dryed up. [If they ſeek water, and there be
none.]</p>
               <p>2. All the wants and ſtraits of the Saints, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord. [I the Lord will hear.] Chriſtians,
though thoſe that ſhould will not, yet he that can,
will hear the cryes of your Souls: all your faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntings, and longings for the water of
life, are before your eyes, and come up into the
ears of the Lord of Sabbath.</p>
               <p>3. God hath more wayes than one to relieve the
wants, and refreſh the bowels of his hungry ones.
He hath extraordinary means for extraordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
If they can find no common Rivers, he will
open, or make new Rivers. The high places, the dry
places, the very Rock will yield a River, when God
commands it.</p>
               <p>4. Gods extraordinary Proviſions ſhall not be
ſcanty and penurious, but rich and plentiful. 'Tis
not ſome drops, or now and then a draught, a little
to ſtay the longing, or barely enough to keep them
alive; he prepares them Rivers, Fountains, Pools,
Springs of water. [I will open Rivers in the high
places, Fountains in the Vallies, &amp;c.] Where-ever
they be caſt, in the high Places, in the Vallies, in the
Wilderneſſe, in the dry Lands, where-ever they be
caſt, I will cauſe proviſion enough to meet them;
though they have neither bag, nor bottle, nor any
thing to carry with them, they ſhall not want; the
Rivers ſhall meet them, Springs ſhall ariſe and break
forth to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:153036:231"/>
5. They are not the wanting, but the thirſting, the
ſeeking Souls, whom God will ſupply. When the
poor and needy [ſeek] water, and there is none,
Oh <hi>Chriſtians!</hi> how many poor are there, that fit
down by their poverty; who if they ſtarve, yet will
not beg, their emptineſs hath taken away their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.
Theſe are ſad Souls; 'tis a ſad ſight, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a company of hunger-bitten Souls, ſit weeping
and ſighing, ſeeking after the Bread and Water of
life, and finding none; but to ſee empty, and yet
not hungry; fainting, and yet not panting, Souls; to
ſee Souls even dying away for want, and yet not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
or craving a ſupply, this is a much ſorer
ſpectacle. <hi>A ſtarving thirſtleſs Soul is next to a
Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, if ever ſuch Souls find, who never ſeek
water, 'tis more than God hath promiſed. 'Tis
they that ſeek water, to whom God will open a
River.</p>
               <p>6. VVhatever difficulty there be, to furniſh the
hungry Saints, with a ſufficiency of Proviſion, yet
one way or other it ſhall be done. I [the Lord] will
hear. I [the God] of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> will not forſake them.
Upon me be all their wants. I am [God] and can,
I am [their God] the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for them. They muſt and ſhall be provided for:
whatever courſe I be put to take, I muſt not ſee them
ſtarve.</p>
               <p>The Lord will not be wanting to them. If his
VVord be not heard, his VVorks ſhall ſpeak; if
Preachers cannot, Providence ſhall preach to them;
if their friends cannot, their enemies, their ſtripes,
their wounds, their rods, ſhall inſtruct them. <hi>Thy
Rod and thy Staffe comfort me.</hi> If they have no
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:153036:232"/>
other, the Sun, Moon, and Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, the Fouls of the
Air, the Beaſts of the Field, ſhall be their Prophets,
and Apoſtles. If any ſhould fail, yet the Spirit of the
Lord ſhall not fail to be their Teacher and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</p>
               <p>2. Extraordinary means have more in them, than
ordinary, and no means more than means.</p>
               <p>1. Extraordinary means, when ordinary cannot
be had, are ſweeter and better feeding to the Saints,
than ordinary would be. The leſs of the Creature,
the more of God; the leſs of common Providence,
the more of ſpecial Grace. Water out of the Rock
was more precious than out of the River; the Manna
of the Wilderneſs, was (to them that underſtood it)
better than the Milk of <hi>Canaan. Elijah</hi> never made
better meales, than what he got out of the Ravens
mouth. I have heard of a woman in great diſtreſs of
Soul, who received comfort, when the Word was
brought her by the mouth of a Child, which ſhe had
failed of receiving from the mouthes of many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Miniſters.</p>
               <p>2. No means, often prove better than means;
when I ſay, no means, I do not underſtand ſimply
none, meanes they ſhall have, of one kind or other;
their underſtandings, their memories, their ſecret
duties, Prayer, Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by no meanes,
I underſtand nothing from without, no Ordinances,
Friends, Societies, Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gods feeding of a
Soul more immediately, is much ſweeter, then
when he ſends proviſion by the hands of another; the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> hearing of Chriſts words, from his own
mouth, was much more to them, than the ſame words
reported by the woman. <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cius ex ipſo fonte.</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the purer, the nearer the Fountain; the Bread
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:153036:232"/>
that comes down from Heaven, is better Bread, than
that which grows up out of the Earth, though that be
originally from Heaven alſo. By how much the more
immediately our comforts come from Heaven, by ſo
much the more they have of Heaven in them. If up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the failing of publick Communion, it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> made
up ſo much the more in ſecret, ſure the Saints have
no reaſon to complain. And whether this be not ſo,
let the Priſons, into which the Saints have bin ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
caſt, the Wilderneſs into which they have been
ſometimes baniſhed; let <hi>Elihu's</hi> Songs in the night,
<hi>Peters, Pauls, Silahs</hi> Songs in the Priſon, in the
Stocks, ſtand forth and teſtifie. If Priſon joyes, and
exile comforts, have not been often both fuller and
ſweeter to them, than when they have rolled in
<hi>Manna,</hi> and lived in the fulneſs, and freedom of
all helps and means; then not a few Chriſtians, have
either miſtaken, or miſ-reported their experiences.
To pretend to live above Ordinances, whileſt God
affords them, is a wickedneſs that ſome men have to
repent of; but where God denies them, he doth, he
will provide a better ſubſiſtance without them.</p>
               <p>Now lay all this together, and then you will ſee,
that even this alſo, this moſt grievous of Judgements,
the famine of the Word, when-ever it befalls, ſhall
work for good to thoſe that love God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> chear up your hearts: whatever
drought, or dearth may fall upon the World, your
are provided for, you ſhall have enough. If the
ſhours fail without, you have within you, that which
ſhall ſpring up to eternal life. If your ſtreams
ſhould be dryed up, if your Paſtures ſhould be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
down, you have a God, that will be both your
Paſtor and Paſture. If the River fail you, the Rock
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:153036:233"/>
ſhall ſupply you; what you want in ordinary, you
may look to be made up in extraordinary means. The
drying up of the waters, ſhall but drive you up to the
Spring-head. If ever the Stars fail you, God ſhall
but exchange <hi>Star-light</hi> for <hi>Sun-light;</hi> while there's
light in the Sun, you ſhall not walk in darkneſs. See
but to this, make ſure that this God is yours, and he
muſt find out a comfortable feeding for you; if you
can but ſay <hi>Davids</hi> firſt words after him, <hi>The Lord is
my Shepherd;</hi> you may then with confidence, ſay the
whole Pſalm after him. <hi>I ſhall not want, he will make
me to lie down in green Paſtures; he will lead me by the
ſtill Waters; though I walk through the valley of the
ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil: thy Rod and thy
Staff ſhall comfort me. Thou ſhalt prepare me a Table
in the preſence of mine Enemies: Surely Goodneſs and
Mercy ſhall follow me all the dayes of my life, and I
will dwell in the Houſe of the Lord for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There is another Objection, that ſeems to have
one difficulty in it. Suppoſe a Saint to fall into <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,</hi>
and thereby to be deprived utterly of the
uſe of his Reaſon, and ſo to live and die:</p>
               <p>How can it be imagined, that this can work for his
good, either in this World, or in the World to come?
Can any good ariſe, out of an incapacity of any longer
doing or receiving good, or patiently ſuffering Evil?
Can either his Grace here, or his Glory hereafter, be
increaſed or advanced, by a mans being converted
into a meer Bruit?</p>
               <p>1. There's no doubt at all, but this may make for
the <hi>Churches good:</hi> Is there nothing that others may
learn out of ſuch a ſad <hi>Providence?</hi> If others may
reap good by my evil, is it nothing to me? May it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:153036:233"/>
not be ſaid to be good for any particular Saint, to
bear the ſoareſt affliction by which the Church may
have benefit? He hath not much of a Saint, to whom,
if it were afore-hand propoſed, whether for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Church, he would be content, if God ſee
it good, to fall into ſuch a calamity: He hath little
of a Saint, that would deliberately refuſe it. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
a ſincere Chriſtian, who would count his uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the good of the whole Body, to be his good,
would ſay even concerning ſuch a Meſſage, were it
brought to him, <hi>Good is the word of the Lord:</hi> And
that which afore-hand, he would judg to be good for
him to ſubmit to, may it not be good for him to be
under?</p>
               <p>2. It may alſo be more directly for his particular
<hi>perſonal good.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>1. It may do him the ſame good, which <hi>Death</hi>
will do for him: Concerning which the Apoſtle ſays
it is yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. that is, it is for your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
It may <hi>take him from the evil to come;</hi> from
thoſe ſorrows, and that trouble of heart, which
God might fore-ſee falling upon him, by any cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
coming either on the Church in general, or
himſelf or Family in particular: which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of his Reaſon, and power to reflect on, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
feel, or in the leaſt be afflicted by. If you reply,

from the torment of a Feaver? If there be any

               <p>

2. Who knows, <hi>what Sins and Temptations</hi> he
might have fallen into, and fallen by, had not the
Lord by this means prevented it; he might poſſibly
have been a back-ſlider, have fallen into groſs ſin,
by which he might have been a Terrour to himſelf,
and a Scandal to the Goſpel; and is it not good for
him, that this is prevented? Is not that affliction a
mercy, which ſecures from ſuch iniquity?</p>
               <p>Who can ſay it is not thus? that the Lord fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
he would have fallen into ſin, and for preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
brought him into this affliction: Who can ſay,
it is not thus? If none can, then this is no Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If you Reply, You ſay [<hi>it may be</hi>] this is the
caſe; and I may as well ſay [<hi>it may be not</hi>] there
might be no ſuch thing, that God fore-ſaw, as the
Reaſon of this <hi>Providence.</hi> 'Tis but a Conjecture, and
an uncertainty, when you have made the moſt of it:
Be it ſo; yet it will fully anſwer my end: I am not
now proving, <hi>that all things work for good to the
Saints,</hi> that's ſufficiently done already: But you are
objecting againſt it; and till you prove your Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which you can never do, unleſs you prove that
this is not the caſe; you muſt give me leave again to
tell you, your Objection comes to nothing.</p>
               <p>And ſo at length you ſee this Bleſſed, Glorious,
Comfortable Truth, ſtands its Ground, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
over whatever hath any ſhadow of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to it.</p>
               <p>By the way, learn hence two things.</p>
               <p>1. Rejoyce in this <hi>Promiſe of God:</hi> Hath the Lord
put in thy name here, let thine heart ſay, <hi>It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</hi>
Be more joyful in this, that God hath thus
undertaken the Care of thee, than if God had whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:153036:234"/>
put thee to thine own hand; giving thee power
to help, and liberty to chuſe for thy ſelf. In what
wilt thou rejoyce, if not in this, that the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are ingaged to do thee a kindneſs, to help thee
into the poſſeſſion of thy God? Thou maiſt now
not onely ſubmit to, but thankfully embrace every
<hi>Providence,</hi> knowing upon what Errand it comes to
thee: for good, and not for hurt. Thou maiſt now
triumph, not onely in the <hi>Conſternations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but in the
<hi>Triumphs</hi> of thine enemies. Whether they ride
over thy back, or thou tread on their neck, 'tis all
one, the iſſue will be the ſame. Thy Troubles and
thy Conſolations differ only in their Countenance;
with what ever Grim face thy afflictions look, there
are ſmiles under: learn to ſee through them, and
thou maiſt ſee light on the further ſide. Believe
this Word, thou maiſt read it written upon every
thing that befals thee: there's no Meſſenger that
comes, but brings this promiſe in his hand, <hi>Even this
ſhall work for good.</hi> Read it, and rejoyce.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Lay thy ſelf down quietly under it.</hi> No more
perplexing or diſtracting cares, what ſhall become
of thee: no more unwarrantable ſhifting for thy
ſelf: Let God alone. Shift not for thy ſelf, leſt
God leave thee to thine own ſhifts. Let not the
violence of evil men diſturb thy <hi>Peace,</hi> or provoke
thee to <hi>unpeaceableneſs.</hi> What-ever provocations
thou maiſt have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> avenge not thy ſelf, neither give
place unto wrath, murmuring, or fears. In thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
poſſeſs thy Soul, thy God, and his good
Word: Thy ſtrength is to ſit ſtill. Stand ſtill and
ſee the Salvation of God: thou haſt nothing to do
but to be <hi>Holy,</hi> let that be thine only care: thy God
will ſee to it thou ſhalt be <hi>happy:</hi> he is faithful that

to them, they would underſtand it as well, as the
plaineſt truths of the Goſpel: A poor Miniſter of
Chriſt may break his heart, and rend his bowels, in
mourning over them; may draw forth his Soul in
the moſt melting expreſſions of his compaſſions to
them, may break his brains, in ſtudying how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
a little light unto them, and yet cannot help
them, cannot make them to underſtand ſo much, as
that they underſtand nothing. Their minds are ſo
wholly blinded by the God of this world, that the
light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, though it
ſhine round about them, cannot find ſo much as a
crany into their hearts; but being alienated from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:153036:236"/>
the life of God, through the ignorance that is in
them, they give up themſelves to laſciviouſneſs, to
work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs; walking in

banquettings, covetouſneſs, lying, blaſphemies, and
abominable adulteries, and Idolatries; and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
without any conſcience of ſin, or fear of their

               <p>Are there none ſuch in this place? Doth not the

               </p>
               <p>There are two works which the Goſpel doth:

the Promiſe of God, that thou art content to give up
thy hopes, for the love of thy ſins? Dareſt thou ſay,
<hi>Let me have my part in the pleaſures and contentments

What if [my] laſt, ſhould be [your] laſt? If the

               <p>Thy Conſcience hath been often upon the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

hath warned thee, reproved thee, and often whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd

whither art thou going? when wilt thou return?
Away with thy ſins, have done with thy Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
no more of this drunkenneſs, this riot, this
covetouſneſs; Thou art a loſt man, thy Soul is loſt,
if thou go on. Thus Conſcience hath warned thee,
and thou haſt ſometimes hearkned to it, and ſpoken
it fair. The throbs, and the pangs, and the wounds
thou haſt felt and received from it, have wrung
from thee, now and then, a promiſe: Well, through
the Grace of God; I'le hearken to Conſcience, I'le
be a new man: Away from me ye ſinners, I will
keep the Commandments of my God. And yet
ſhortly after, when thy Temptations return, thy

of ſaving Faith, within a ſtep of ſincere Godlineſs.
They have been profeſſing, and praying, and hoping,
and wiſhing themſelves in, and yet are ſhort of it.
They have been enlightned in the knowledge of
Chriſt, have taſted of the heavenly gift, have felt
ſomthing of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt, have been made
partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, of many excellent
and uſeful gifts, have taſted of the good Word of
God, and the powers of the World to come. They
have ſet out after Chriſt, have left the blind and
prophane VVorld much behind them, have eſcaped
much of the pollutions of this VVorld, left many
ſins, taken up with many duties, have a name among
the Saints, have ſuffered many things for the Name
of Chriſt, and notwithſtanding all this, here they
ſtick, they cannot give themſelves up fully to Chriſt;
ſomthing or other, either the VVorld, or their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,

of Jeſus Chriſt, nay, it may be, they cannot tell
why, yet they cannot do it. Though they can ſay,
I would be, yet they cannot ſay, I will be the Lord's.
Theſe are near the Kingdome of God, but yet ſhort
of it. He that cannot ſay, <hi>I will be,</hi> can leſs ſay, <hi>I am
the Lords.</hi>

Chriſt; and preferring a cloſe Communion with
God, the peace of a good Conſcience, the joyes of
Religion, yea the very reproach of Chriſt above all
their worldly Honours, and fleſhly pleaſures, have
given themſelves up to the power of the Goſpel, and
an exemplary Spiritual and Heavenly life. But it is to

on a little farther: think not of hanging always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Heaven and Hell; In the other World there's

God, Glory, Soul, Eternity, all lie at ſtake;

of thy ſelf, never give over ſuſpecting thy State, till

thou haſt thoroughly diſputed the caſe, give not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>It <hi>bears through its Duties:</hi> The paſſion of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
perſon doth not hinder his action. He holds
his courſe, keeps on his way, whatever load he hath
on his back. He (runs) with patience, the race which
is ſet before him; he is not diſcouraged nor diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from his holy courſe by any ſuffering it coſts
him.</p>
               <p>And indeed, Chriſtian Patience ſtands not in a
bare forced quiet, in a biting in, or keeping down,
our fretting aeſtuations, from venting themſelves
in word or carriage, or in a ſullen ſilence or ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but in the maintaining ſuch a tranquility of
ſpirit, under all we ſuffer, as that we can ſtill, both
enjoy and ſerve the Lord. He is a patient Chriſtian,
that is as much a Chriſtian in a ſtorm as in a clam;
that can pray, believe, love, bleſs God, follow God,
and keep his way, when he ſmites, as when he ſmiles.</p>

               <p>1. He ſees <hi>the hand of the Lord</hi> in all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
him: Whence was <hi>Davids</hi> patience? <hi>Pſal:</hi>
39. 9. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, Becauſe
thou Lord didſt it.</hi> Whence was <hi>Eli's</hi> patience:
1 <hi>Sam. 3. It is the Lord, let him do what ſeems him
good.</hi> Whence was <hi>Job's</hi> patience? <hi>Job. 1. 21. The
Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be
the Name of the Lord.</hi> By the way note, That a
godly man is not only patient under his afflictions,
but thankful: He is not only thankful for Mercies,
but for Chaſtiſements. 'Tis not only, <hi>the Lord hath
given,</hi> bleſſed be his Name; the Lord hath built
me up, the Lord hath filled me, the Lord hath hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, bleſſed be his Name; but alſo, <hi>The Lord hath

undone me, left me naked, left me nothing; bleſſed
be the Name of the Lord. This by the way.</p>
               <p>2. He ſees <hi>the end of the Lord;</hi> that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
his good by all that comes upon him. He
knowes that all things, and therefore this which

<hi>Precious Promiſes,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. <hi>Gracious experiences,</hi> Rom.
5. 4. <hi>Patience worketh experience.</hi> This laſt ſupport,
[experience] hath all the reſt in it. Experience is
the whole Goſpel proved. A patient, experienced
Chriſtian, hath proved all things, what they are; hath
proved the World, and what it is, and the worſt it
can do: hath proved the Word, and what there is
in it: hath proved what God is, what Chriſt is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what grace, and peace, and a good Conſcience are;
Tribulation often takes away God, and his Goſpel;
and we never ſo well prove what God is, as when
we have him alone; what grace is, what a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is, as when we have nothing elſe left us. Our
Religion never ſhews ſo much what is in it, as when
it's moſt put to it. When the Adverſary hath gotten
the greateſt advantage of us; of the Sun, of the
Wind, of the Ground; when he preſſeth with moſt
violence, with moſt fury upon us, then we beſt know,
what the weapons of our Warfare are. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and ſupports of Religion are not known, either
of what ſtrength, or of what ſweetneſs they are, till
they are thus proved. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had never ſuch a
taſt of his integrity, as when he received the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of death. <hi>Stephen</hi> had never ſuch a ſight of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as through a ſtorm of ſtones. Chriſt is never ſo
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:153036:251"/>
ſweet as in a priſon. When God meets his Saints
in a Wilderneſs, then he ſpeaks comfortably to
them. A patient Chriſtian hath more or leſs experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of all this; and hence is he ſupported, keeps
quiet under all his ſufferings, and carried with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
on in his way.</p>
               <p>Be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of
the Lord. You have need of patience, and no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for your impatience. The ſufferings of the
Goſpel call for patience; and the ſupports of the
Goſpel will condemn your impatience. If you will
be godly, count upon it that you have a great fight
of afflictions to endure. Venture not into the fight
without your Armour: An impatient creature is a
naked Soldier: How eaſily will Sathan deſtroy,
whom he hath once diſarmed! The more you <hi>can</hi>
the leſs you <hi>ſhall</hi> ſuffer. Secure your ſpirit, and
you ſave your ſelf from harm. There's no Dart ſhall
hurt you, that does not hit your heart. Keep your
heart whole, and the Devil loſes all his ſhot. Be
patient, and you poſſeſs your Souls: keep your
Souls, and the enemy loſes the day.</p>

a contradiction, as to be proud and humble, fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

grace, you muſt be partakers of all grace. Get a

                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if you will be patient, you muſt be
painful: give diligence; be diligent in making
your Calling and Election ſure: be diligent in duty,
be vigilant againſt iniquity: If you will be patient,
be impatient of ſin, and you will be patient of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
make ſin ſure, get it ſlain by the croſs, and
buried in the grave of your Lord, ſealing the ſtone,
and ſetting a watch: have nothing to conflict with,
in the day of your affliction, but your affliction; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of carrying guilt with you up upon the Croſs.
Let not the gall of guilt be mingled with the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar

all our pains, and a pure Conſcience will bear all
our burthens.</p>
               <p>Till this be done, I muſt tell you, you will find
ſuffering to be hard ſervice. Tis an eaſie matter to

great things afore-hand; as you know who did once,
and what came of it, <hi>Though I die with thee, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Troubles come upon us, when the hand of the Lord
touches us, and touches where it's moſt tender,
brings thoſe calamities on us, which are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to us, ſtrips us of thoſe comforts which are
moſt dear to us, takes away all from us, and leaves

us naked; when we feel the <hi>ſmart</hi> of the rod, when

What witneſs did they bear? Why, <hi>That the

Seal to the Goſpel: As he that believeth, ſo much
more, he that ſuffereth in Faith, hath ſet to his Seal
that God is true. In the Faith and patience of the
Saints, may be ſeen (as the Seal in the wax) the
prints and impreſſions of the Truth and Faithfulneſs

               <p>The Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. that Chriſtians are
<hi>the Epiſtles of Chriſt,</hi> or his Letters of commendation
to the World, in whom may be read his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Glory, and the incomparable advantages
of his Service. And as all Chriſtians, ſo eſpecially
ſuffering Chriſtians: The Character of Chriſt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo viſible and legible, as when 'tis written in
Blood. The Bowels, and Bounty, and kindneſs of
God our Saviour, never appear'd in more Glory,
than upon his Croſs; and there's no ſuch lively
Tranſcript of them, as upon our Croſs. On his
Croſs, his Blood; on our Croſs, his Spirit, and the
precious grace &amp; comforts of it, are moſt plentifully
ſhed forth, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 14. If ye be reproached,</hi> that is, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:153036:254"/>

trouble, or our murmurings under them, we ſay the

let me go free: Let me have my eaſe, and my quiet,
and my liberty, and take this honour who will for
me. Unworthy Spirits! Oh me-thinks, Chriſtians,
we ſhould rather ſtep one before another; and when

<hi>I will go; let me bear it Lord;</hi> and not grudge as we

               <p>Our impatience bears falſe witneſs againſt God,

What-ever is ſaid in honour of the Goſpel, what
a bleſſedneſs, what an ineffable advantage 'tis, to all
that heartily own it; yet having proved it, I find it
even as much as nothing, by that all the coſts and
charges of it are caſt up: The comforts of it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ballance them: ſet one againſt another, the bad
againſt the good, the bitter againſt the ſweet: Set
one againſt another, and I have made but a bad bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

impatience. Chriſtian, thou paſſeſt over thy Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
as a light evil; as if thy pain might excuſe
thy pettiſhneſs: As if it were, becauſe 'tis ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,

God, to bear falſe witneſs againſt his Goſpel, thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining

               <p>Brithren, <hi>Let us do the Lord this Right, by the
patience of our ſpirits; to confeſſe before the world,</hi>
That all the ſufferings of this Life, are not worthy to be
compared to the Glory that ſhall be revealed: <hi>And</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Let us learn of him, for the Joy that is ſet before us, to

ſit down at his, as he is ſet down at the right hand of
the throne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Your patient ſuffering, will be <hi>God's
Witneſs of your Adoption,</hi> Heb. 12. 7. <hi>If you endure
chaſtening, God dealeth with you as with Sons:</hi> The
LORD doth not uſe to deal ſo with ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:153036:255"/>
Afflictions are Gods <hi>Family Diſcipline.</hi> Yet mark,
'tis not the ſuffering alone will prove our Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
(the Rod is for the fools back, as well as the
childs) but patient ſuffering will: for,</p>
               <p>1. Patient ſuffering is it ſelf, an evidence of our
adoption: it is the mark of the Lord Jeſus upon us.
If thou haſt both the ſame lot, and the ſame ſpirit,
that was upon Chriſt, there's thy Lords mark upon
thee, whereby he marks thee out for one of his own.
Men had need of other marks to prove them Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
than what the Rod hath made on their backs;
'tis our quiet ſubmitting to it, and that upon Goſpel
grounds, as hath been before ſhewed, that muſt do
it, and this will be evidence enough. None but a
Son will thus ſubmit.</p>
               <p>2. The ſuffering ſtate of Chriſtians, is ordinarily
attended with other evidences. Sufferings will ſet
patience on work, and patience will ſet every other
grace on work. Whatſoever it be, that finds work
for patience, will therein find work for faith, and
love, and hope, and ſelf-denial. Chriſtians never
appear ſo much believers, ſo humble, ſo mortified,
as under the Croſs. If there be any faith, or love,
or hope in the heart, 'twill appear in the day of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.
If there be any fire under the aſhes, throw
on water, and then you ſhall hear it, when, it may
be, before you could ſee none there. As <hi>Solomon</hi>
ſayes, <hi>folly,</hi> ſo we may ſay, <hi>wiſdom,</hi> grace is bound up
in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction will
fetch it out. We ſeldom know, either how bad, or
how good our hearts are, till they are thus proved;
<hi>This I did to prove thee, and to know what was in thine
heart.</hi>

Beſides, this is the ſeaſon, when ordinarily there
are moſt plentiful illapſes, and incomes from above.
God ſeldom ſends ſuch tokens of his love, as to his
Children in priſon. The light of his countenance
he often reſerves for their darkeſt eſtate, he ſets to
his Seal, when the wax is on fire. There have been
Chriſtians that would never believe that they were
ſuch, till God hath told it them at the ſtake; the
higheſt joyes, the fulleſt ſence of everlaſting kindneſs
have been moſt ordinarily the portion of Gods Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.
When Hell is let looſe upon them, then Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is moſt open. Many Chriſtians have met with
ſuch refreſhings in their Bonds, that their enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath been their Priſon.</p>
               <p>If this be ſo Chriſtians, who would fear ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
who would not be patient? would it comfort
you, to know that God is your Father? Be patient,
and you ſhall know it. What would you not bear,

be you have been held under doubt and fears, and
ſad uncertainties, hitherto all your dayes; you
have gone about from <hi>duty to duty,</hi> from <hi>Ordinance</hi>

Oh if I were ſure that Chriſt were mine, that my

my adoption, then could be I quiet: Why, if ever
God calls thee to Sufferings, follow him chearfully;
He calls thee out to prove to thee, that thou lov'ſt
him. Fear not to go up with him on the Croſs; Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance

Let hypocrites only fear ſufferings, 'twill be ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to them; there's many a ſelf-deceiving Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
that never ſuſpected himſelf to be an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
till perſecution made him an Apoſtate: that's
a woful caſe, to have ſufferings come upon him for
the Goſpel's ſake, only to tell him, That he hath no
part in Chriſt nor his Goſpel. Let hypocrites be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
and unquiet, but let Saints be patient. The

prove you Sons.</p>
               <p>Your patient ſuffering is the <hi>cure of your Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
Sufferings are our medicine for corruption,
and patience our cure: To what degree of patience
a Chriſtian hath attain'd, that degree of power hath
he gotten over iniquity. Till luſt be conquered,
there's no patience: If there be but one unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
corruption remaining, and an affliction comes
and grates upon that, this will provoke; there's no
beating it. Whence is impatience; but from this,
for the moſt part that we cannot bear any violence,
that's offered to luſt? what is patience, but this,
that we can bear that pain, that luſt when pinched
will put us to? quietly to ſuffer our pride, our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
our paſſion, our ſenſual appetites, to be cut ſhort
of what would gratifie them: and freely to leave
them under that which comes to kill and crucifie
them; to be able to want that fuel that feeds, and
endure that water that doth quench theſe fires; this
is Patience. VVhen our pride is ſtrip'd of its orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
our appetites deprived of their delicates,
our covetouſneſs of its ſubſtance, our fleſh of its
eaſe? and we either feel no ſmart, or can bear the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:153036:256"/>
ſmart of it; then we are Patient. And when we can
thus leave our <hi>Corruptions,</hi> to whatever ſufferings
come upon them, without taking part with them
in their ſufferings; then luſt is conquered. Luſt
no longer lives nor maintains its power, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
in us, than whileſt, in all its afflictions, we are
afflicted; when we feel its ſufferings as our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
its diſappointments and diſſatisfactions as our
own, and flie out againſt whatſoever falls upon
it, as it fell upon our Souls. When we can ſay, 'tis
my paſſion that ſuffers, but not I; 'tis my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
that ſuffers, my pride that ſuffers, but
not I; and let them ſuffer (for me) let them be
pinch'd and pain'd, and ſtarv'd and die; none of
all this ſhall move me: nay, herein I do and I will
rejoyce: There's Patience. Patience is Luſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians you complain of Corruption, you

the Devil: When Sathan and his Inſtruments

brought their Necks under your Feet. This Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
wall will make their ſhot recoil on their own
heads and hearts: Your Patience will be a Shield
to yours, and a Sword in your Enemies Souls. Be
patient, and you have won the field, and gotten the
day. They will have no hope to drive you to ſin,
where they ſee you can ſuffer. This was <hi>Job's</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and ſhall be yours; <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not,
nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> You may now make your

I hope I can be poor, if thou wilt have me ſo; I can
be in pain, in diſgrace, If thou wilt have me: But
I cannot be unholy, I cannot bear it to be ſuch a
ſtarveling in the ſtate of my Soul. Lord, for more

This diſtreſs, this ſorrow and anguiſh, the Lord

This bitter Cup hath health in the bottom; this

without rebuke in the midſt of the World.</p>
               <p>2. In its Power. Let the power of Grace be ſeen,
in its preſerving it ſelf, in its being, and vigorous
Exerciſe, againſt all the Powers of Hell. The
ſtrength of a man is ſeen in this, that he can bear
wind and weather; can live any where, without

True Grace is ſuch a Plant, that all the weeds of the

               <p>Chriſtians, prove your Grace to be a right plant,
the right Seed; the Seed of God; let it bear up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <p>2. Let Grace ripen towards <hi>Glory;</hi> let not the
ſcorching Sun wither your Bloſſoms, but ripen <hi>your</hi>
Fruit. If you would hold out, get you on: If <hi>you</hi>

that living ſpring, which is broken forth in you, be
like the waters of the Sanctuary, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 7. Which
at their firſt riſing were but up to the Ankles; but a
little further were up to the Knees, a little further
they were up to the Loins, and at length they grew
up to a great river, waters to ſwim in, the bottom
whereof could not be felt. It may be the waters
of Grace do yet run low with thee, a little Bay will
ſtop or turn the ſtream; thou art yet gotten but to
ankle deep, or knee deep, get thee on, ſtay nor,
till thy Spring become a River; let every day, every
Duty, every experience, yea, every affliction, add
to thy ſtreams; that as the acceſſion of every little
brook to the main Channel, raiſes the water as it
paſſes along, ſo it may be with thy Soul; that the
farther thou goeſt on, the fuller thy Banks may be,
till thou comeſt to be like <hi>Jordan</hi> in the Harveſt,
whoſe waters fill all its banks. To quicken thee on
in this growth in Grace, conſider.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:153036:262"/>
1. That a little Grace will make but poor work
with thy mighty ſins; where Grace is low, Luſt is
high; and how is an Infant like to ſtand before a
Man of War?</p>
               <p>2. That a little Grace will not ſuffice to bear
thee up in great Afflictions: that which thou maieſt
make a ſhift with in a Calm, will not ſerve thee in
a Storm.</p>
               <p>3. That a little Grace will be ſadly put to it, if
ever thou come to have but little means of Grace.</p>
               <p>4. That he that hath but little Grace, is like to
have no Aſſurance that he hath any at all. If thou
wouldeſt have power over Corruption, if thou
wouldeſt ſtand in the Day of temptation, if thou
wouldeſt not ſtarve in the day of Famine, if thou
wouldeſt have the comfort of the Grace. thou haſt,
let it grow up to its fuller ſtature; Grace, when it
is come to Age, will ſpeak for it ſelf, and ſhift for it
ſelf the better: which whileſt it is in its Infancie,
neither knows, nor can help it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, let your Grace grow, and let the
Fruits of it increaſe: Let your Fields ripen to the
Harveſt. I may ſay concerning Sinners, not as our
Lord ſaid, <hi>Behold the Fields are already white to the
Harveſt;</hi> but behold the Fields are already <hi>black</hi>
to the Harveſt. The Word is ready to be given;
<hi>Come, put in thy Sickle, the Harveſt is ripe; the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is great.</hi> The Fields of Tares are already black
to the Harveſt: But oh when ſhall it be ſaid of you.
<hi>Behold the fields are white to the Harveſt?</hi> ſhall evil
weeds grow ſo faſt, and ſhall only the good Corn
be at a ſtand?</p>

                  <hi>Brethren,</hi> Let your Fruits grow more <hi>plentiful,</hi> and

you, <hi>Pro. 4. 18. The path of the Juſt is a ſhining light,
that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi> Let
your hearts be ſo filled with the fulneſs of God, that
your pathes may drop fatneſs. Let it be ſaid of you,
as of the <hi>Spouſe, Cant.</hi> 4. 18. and <hi>Chap. 5. 5. Her lips

ſomething of the fatneſs, that you have received
from above, be alwayes dropping down: Be <hi>dropping</hi>
according to what you have <hi>drank:</hi> as you ſee ſinners
of whom 'tis ſaid, <hi>They drink iniquity,</hi> to be alwayes
dropping iniquity; dropping Oathes, dropping Lies,
dropping Scoffs and reproaches: So let it be ſaid of
you, <hi>They drink the Dew of Heaven, and this they are
dropping down.</hi> Let no Child, no Servant, no Friend,
come into your Company, and go away without
ſome ſweet drops from your lips: A word of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
inſtruction, a gracious admonition, a word of
encouragement, or a quickening word, let them have;
or lift up a prayer, and drop down a bleſſing upon
them. Something or other of the <hi>Dew of Heaven</hi>
let them feel flowing from your Lips.</p>
               <p>Let your lips <hi>drop as the Honey Comb,</hi> and your

               <p>Chriſtians, By your nurſing up the Souls and Fruits
of others, you will ripen and encreaſe your own. If
you ſhould look on all the Fruit as little, which your
ſelves have brought forth to God, you will have this
to comfort you, That you have born more upon your
<hi>Brethrens knees:</hi> the Fruits of thoſe Fields which
you have planted, or watered, will abound to your
account.</p>
               <p>Bring forth much Fruit unto God, and be much in
<hi>immediate converſe</hi> with God, <hi>Phil. 3. 20. Our Convet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation

               </lg>
               <p>1. Above <hi>Carnal Delights:</hi> live more purely in
the Spirit, let your Hearts be wrought up to ſuch
a ſpiritual frame; that all the joyes, pleaſures, and
comforts of your lives may be ſpiritual. Let the
Lord be all your delight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 5. Let it be with
you as much as may be, as it is with the Saints alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in glory; to whom <hi>God is all;</hi> who being changed
into his Image, and dwelling in his preſence, are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in him. Let <hi>God alone,</hi> be as much to you, as
<hi>God and all the world.</hi> Let the Faſhions, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and delights of this world, be ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
your Spirits, that it may neither be an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your joy, to want; nor an addition to your
content to poſſeſs them. Let the light of all theſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:153036:264"/>
lower ſparks be ſwallowed up in God; when the
Sun ſhines, all the Stars diſ-appear and are not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Lift up thine eyes Chriſtian, and ſee, what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
there are within the Veil: Come, drink thy fill
of this new wine, let thy Faith draw the Curtains of
Eternity, and take a view of thoſe heights and
depths; and lengths, and breadths of that Glory and
Joy, which there it may diſcover. Look on him that
fits on the Throne, and thoſe everlaſting Treaſures
of Light, Holineſs, Goodneſs and Mercy, which are
ſtreaming from his Face; on thoſe over-flowing
Bowels of kindneſs and compaſſion; on thoſe Rivers
of pure and eternal Pleaſures, Reſt &amp; Peace, that riſe
from that glorious Throne, and run through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God. Behold the Tree of life, and feed thy
Soul on its precious fruit, whoſe very leaves are for
the healing of Nations. Hearken to, and fill thine
Ears and Heart with thoſe Tryumphs and Exultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
thoſe Raptures and Extaſies of unſpeakable and
glorious joyes; thoſe bleſſings and praiſings, thoſe
Hallelujahs that are tuned upon the hearts and
tongues of the <hi>Heavenly Chore,</hi> the glorious Angels
<hi>and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> by the viſion
and fruition of thy God, the God of Glory.</p>
               <p>Look on, and poſſeſs this Joy and Glory, ſay to
thy Soul, as God to <hi>Abraham, Gen. 13. 14. Lift up
thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art,
Northward, and Southward, and Eaſtward, and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
through all the Coaſts, and all the Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the bleſſed Land of Promiſe, and holy City;
and then ſay, <hi>Come Soul, take up thy reſt here, all this
is thine.</hi>

Look and love, love and long, long and hope,
hope and rejoyce in hope, of this glory of <hi>God.</hi> Look
on thy <hi>God,</hi> and never leave looking, till thou art
changed into his Image, and ſatisfied with his Image;
And here let thy delight and thy dwelling be.</p>
               <p>2. Above all carnal diſcouragements, from any
adverſaries, or dangers, wherewith you are baited
and affrighted; as you walk in the <hi>Lord,</hi> let the joy
of the <hi>Lord</hi> be your ſtrength, let your Sun be your
ſhield, let your hope be your confidence, and fear
not your dutie nor danger. Look to your hope, and
you will laugh at fear. Dwell in your reward, and
you will not be afraid to dwell in your dutie: But
of this a word more by and by. Thus much for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Directions.</p>
               <p>2. I ſhall next give you ſome ſpecial Directions
for you daily work.</p>
               <p>General neceſſarilie depend on, and ſubſiſt in,
particulars. As there can be no Religion in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
unleſſe it be firſt in particular Families, nor
none in Families, unleſſe it be in particular perſons;
ſo a general courſe of Chriſtianity there cannot be,
unleſs it be ſupported in our particular daily walk.</p>
               <p>The advice I am giving you, I have in part bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
for your uſe, which ſome of you may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have received elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Before I give you the particular directions, I
ſhall firſt premiſe theſe things:</p>
               <p>1. Count upon this, that the Directions I am
now giving you, (if you ever mean to bring it to
any thing) will coſt you pains and labour: and how
can you count your ſelves Chriſtians, if you refuſe
to be at the neceſſary coſt of Chriſtianity? If you
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:153036:265"/>
think to be Chriſtians without labour, or if you will
ſtand out from Chriſtianity, to ſave your labour,
you are a like wiſe in both. Either come to a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to fall upon an induſtrious painful life, or
'twill be in vain to give you counſel.</p>
               <p>2. Practice the Directions I ſhall give you in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of your Covenant with God; wherein you
have ingaged to take the ſtricteſt ſevereſt Laws of
Chriſt, for the Rule of thy Life. What I am preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on you, for the matter of it, is no more than
you have bound your ſelves to, as Chriſtians. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your bonds, and let this holy practice be
followed on by you, as the paying your Vows. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
daily, the vows of God are upon you, and
there is not any material thing here preſcribed to
you, which falls not under your vows. Your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
if your eye be much upon it, will be a cord to
hold you to your work.</p>
               <p>3. Preſſe hard for ſenſible Communion with God
in all your Duties.</p>
               <p>4. Keep up a ſpiritual and holy frame from Dutie
to Dutie. Remember what I have elſewhere ſpoken
to you more at large, on theſe two particulars. See
that there be Religion in your duties, and confine
not your Religion to your duties.</p>
               <p>5. Be Watchful. The life of all Religion lies
much here; what-ever you reſolve upon, will come
to nothing without it. Watchfulneſsis the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
of your will. Let your eye be upon your
Rule, and your work. Eſpecially, watch againſt
your <hi>prevailing ſins.</hi> There's no Chriſtian that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
himſelf, but may find ſome one ſin or more
that in regard of their power over him, are taller by
the head and ſhoulders than all the reſt. In ſome
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:153036:265"/>
                  <hi>Pride,</hi> in others <hi>Worldlineſs,</hi> in others <hi>Paſſion,</hi> in others
<hi>Sloathfulneſs.</hi> It may be, if thou ſearcheſt, ſome one of
theſe four, or poſſibly ſome other may be it, that by
a ſpecialty thou may'ſt call [<hi>thine iniquity.</hi>] Find out
what it is, and know, that there thy main work lies.
In vain wilt thou ſtrive in other duties, till that which
hinders be removed out of the way. <hi>Fight neither
against ſmall nor great, but against the King of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi>
Where the Enemy moſt ordinarily makes his
breach upon thee, ſet the ſtronger Guard. Let thy
daily conflicts be here, and obſerve diligently, with
what ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>6. Walk on thy courſe in the Name and ſtrength
of the Lord Jeſus. Live by Faith. Depend on Chriſt
for the aſſiſtance of his mighty Spirit. Forget not
this, for otherwiſe thou wilt go but lamely on.</p>

is becauſe our Differences are ſo hot. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

2. Let all parties unite ſincerely in <hi>their ends:</hi> Let
the honour of Chriſt, the advancement of practical
godlineſs, the deſtruction of the intereſt of the fleſh,
the edification of the whole body, in faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
be looked at with a ſingle eye, and purſued
with a plain and honeſt heart; let not the intereſt
of a party, the affection of ſuperiority and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the carrying on of ſelfiſh or fleſhly deſigns, let
the <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Chriſt</hi> you are driving for, unbiaſs
your ſpirits, take the right mark, and let your moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be ſincerely levelled at it. If we were once ſet
right in our ends, an accommodation of all our-dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
about the means, would be more facile and
feiſable, <hi>Prov. 11. 3, 5. The integrity of the upright
ſhall guide him, the righteouſneſs of the perfect ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his way.</hi> Humble, ſingle, honeſt hearts, are moſt
like to hit upon the good and honeſt way: If we had
nothing to do, but to pleaſe the Lord, we ſhould
not have much to do to pleaſe one another.</p>
               <p>3. Let all parties unite in this Rule, <hi>Do as you
would be done by;</hi> that is, as being well informed,
and adviſed, and freed from evil, and diſcompoſed
affections, (for ſo the Rule is to be underſtood) you
would that men ſhould do unto you: Allow to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
what you challenge to your ſelves; or would,
if you were in their circumſtances: Deny not what
you would demand: The ſame liberty, the ſame
charity that you would expect from other Chriſtians,
allow to them.</p>
               <p>4. No longer tie up Chriſt to a <hi>party.</hi> Say not,
<hi>Lo here is Chriſt, and not there:</hi> Say of all <hi>Believers,</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:153036:272"/>
though of different Forms, <hi>As we are Chriſts, ſo they
are Chriſts.</hi> Of all the ſub-diviſions of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that
are conſiderable amongſt us, there's no party, the
union with which makes us, or the ſeparation from
which unmakes us, Chriſtians. We had need to have
more to ſhew for our Chriſtianity, than that we are
<hi>Presbyterians, Independants, Anabaptiſts, Epiſcopal,</hi> or
<hi>Eraſtians;</hi> and the Devil muſt have more to prove
us no Chriſtians, than this, that we are in union with
either of theſe, or inſeparation from them.</p>
               <p>5. In matters circumſtantial, be not over haſty in
ſtamping a <hi>Jus Divinum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> on things diſputable and
doubtful: Put no more weight, nor a greater neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
on any thing, than God hath evidently put on it;
and ſpend no more of your zeal about it, than is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to its weight and evidence.</p>
               <p>6. Allow for the imperfect ſtate the Church is in.
We know but in part; and till that which is perfect
is come, and that which is imperfect is done away,
we muſt bear with one another, if in any things we
be otherwiſe minded.</p>
               <p>7. Stretch not your Authority <hi>beyond your Line,</hi>
take not too much upon you: Think not to bring all
others, in every thing, to your Standard; impoſe
not your conſciences, as a Law upon others.</p>
               <p>8. Put not conſcience to the ill office of being a
meer <hi>Make-bate,</hi> catch not up every Notion, and
preſently charge it upon conſcience, as that which
muſt be maintained, though to the greateſt prejudice
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:153036:272"/>

prayes, another unprayes; inſomuch that we ſhould

that may be the reaſon, why the Lord defers his

1. Conſider, That,</p>
               <p>1. By how much the more you fear God, by ſo
much the leſs you will fear men.</p>
               <p>2. By how much the more you fear ſin, by ſo much
the leſs you will fear trouble.</p>
               <p>3. By how much the leſs your adverſaries fear
God, by ſo much the leſs need you to fear them.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Believe:</hi> Pſal. 27. 13. I had fainted, but that I
believed. <hi>Faith is a buckler againſt fears and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi>
Epheſ. 6. 16. Above all, take the ſhield of faith,
whereby you ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of
the Devil.</p>
               <p>[<hi>The ſhield of faith</hi>] A ſhield is a wall of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
interpoſed betwixt a perſon and harm; 'Tis
only our apprehenſions of harm that raiſe our fear;
Faith will ſave a Chriſtian harmleſs, and thereby
preſerve him fearleſs. The ſhield is ordained for a
ſecurity to all parts and againſt all aſſaults. Some
pieces of our armour are appropriated to one part
only; the Helmet is for the head, the Breaſt-plate
for the breſt, the Girdle for the loins, the Shooes
for the feet; but the ſhield is a moveable, that is to
be lifted up, where-ever the blow comes. Faith is an
univerſal ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Faith may be ſaid to be a Shield,</p>
               <p>1. Inſtrumentally; As it provides us of a ſhield,
as it lifts up a ſheild and ſets a guard upon the Soul
to ſecure it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It holds up Chriſt for a ſhield; it holds
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:153036:276"/>
up the <hi>Promiſes</hi> for a Shield: the very <hi>Commands</hi> and
<hi>Inſtitutions</hi> of God, for a Shield and Safe-guard to
the Soul.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the <hi>ſenſe of guilt</hi> aſſailes and weakens
the heart: It is not ſo much any thing without us,
as ſomething within us, that raiſes our fears. How
ſmall a matter will fright a guilty Soul? Guilt will
make every ſtroke a ſtab. It's the barb of the arrow,
the venome on the dart, or the ſore of the heart, that
makes every ſtroke formidable and terrible. 'Tis the
guiltleſs Soul that hath courage, and boldneſs. <hi>Hic
murus ahoeneus eſto</hi>—Now againſt this dreadful dart,
Faith holds up a Buckler, with a <hi>Crucified Jeſus</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; and ſo that's quenched.</p>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>darkneſs</hi> and uncertainties, about the
way that we are in, raiſes our fear. A Chriſtian that
knows himſelf in his duty, in his way, is out of fear.
Clearneſs gives boldneſs. Whilſt we queſtion the
warrantableneſs of the way we are in, every ſhadow
of danger will ſhake us: Againſt ſuch feares, Faith
holds up a Buckler with this inſcription, <hi>Have not I
commanded thee?</hi> It ſhews the Command, and in
that, our warrant, and in our warrant our ſecurity.</p>
               <p>When we queſtion whether our <hi>Worſhip,</hi> for which
we are like to ſuffer, be right or no, Faith holds up
<hi>an Inſtitution</hi> for our Shield.</p>
               <p>If this Fear (oh I ſhall not hold our, I ſhall deny
my Lord, and his faith, if put to it) aſſailes the Soul;
here faith holds up the <hi>Promiſe</hi> for a Buckler: <hi>He
hath ſaid, I will not fail thee, nor forſake thee, ſo that
we may boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:153036:276"/>
2. Formally; Faith not only lifts up a ſhield, but
is our ſhield; The very believing in a crucified
Jeſus; the very believing the Command, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
the promiſe, ſtays and ſupports the
heart againſt whatſoever may befall it; <hi>I had fainted
but that I believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whatever your duties, difficulties, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies,
ſtraits, temptations, afflictions, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
are; believe, and <hi>you</hi> ſhall be carried through;
believe, and <hi>you</hi> ſhall be eſtabliſhed: Believe in
Chriſt, and you ſhall dare to follow Chriſt; believe
in Chriſt, and <hi>you</hi> ſhall go through with Chriſt, and
hold out to the end. Believe, and you ſhall neither
fear, faint, nor fall. Your Faith will both keep <hi>you
faultleſs,</hi> and ſave <hi>you harmleſs,</hi> and thereby ſecure
<hi>you</hi> from ſinking, and fainting in your minds.</p>
               <p>If this be not enough, let me add, that Faith will
yet farther ſcatter all <hi>your</hi> fears, by this double Act:
<list>
                     <item>1. It will put <hi>your</hi> reward into <hi>your</hi> hands.</item>
                     <item>2. It will put all <hi>your</hi> troubles to a preſent end.</item>

               <p>1. It will put <hi>your</hi> reward into <hi>your</hi> hand; it will
ſet the Crown on your head, even whileſt the Croſs
is on your back. Faith makes things to come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. It is the ſubſiſtence, or being, of
things hoped for; it gives being to the good things
promiſed, before they are. Hope carries the eye to

Faith looks on things to come as preſent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
on things preſent as paſt: It looks on all things,
according as they will be in their iſſue and end: It
looks on things to come, according to what they will
be, when they are come. It looks on things preſent
according to what they will be, when they are paſt. It
ſees all paſſing, and conſiders it as paſt already. It
ſees all paſſing, the World upon its wing, the Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and the Gallantry, and the Glory of the World, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their wings: And it ſees the <hi>Poverty</hi> of the world,
the <hi>Troubles</hi> of the World, all upon the wing. It
looks on the <hi>blackeſt Clouds,</hi> as <hi>flying Clouds,</hi> and it
conſiders all as gone already. It looks on the clear
that is beyond the Clouds; it ſays, as God ſays,
<hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen:</hi> Not only it ſhall fall, but

               <p>1. That the good Seed, which hath been ſown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you, were well rooted in every heart: I wiſh
that my Twenty years Miniſtry among you, may
not be loſt labour, to any of your ſouls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:153036:284"/>
2. I wiſh that your next <hi>Seeds-man</hi> may be more
skilful and ſucceſsful: that the good Lord will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
you a man, that may teach you in wiſdom, gain
you in Love, lead you on to life by an holy Example;
and if the Lord grant you this mercy, I wiſh that
ſuch a one may be dearly priz'd and chearfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by you. God keep this Flock from a Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wolf, and a deceitful Shepherd.</p>
               <p>3. I wiſh that there may be no Root of Bitterneſs
ſpringing up amongſt you; that there be no Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Contentions, but that you may live in peace
and love, that the God of peace and love may be
with you.</p>
               <p>4. I wiſh that this place, where ſo much good
Seed hath been ſown, may become a fruitful Field,
that the Fruits of Faith and Repentance, the Fruits
of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, may be in you, and
abound; that you may be neither barren, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful;
that Religion, in the power and practice
of it, may ſo viſibly flouriſh, in the ſeveral perſons,
in the ſeveral Families of this Congregation, that
they that go by, may ſee and ſay, This is the <hi>Field
which the Lord hath bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. I wiſh, that whatever Clouds may at any time
gather over you, may not fall down in a withering
Storm, or a ſweeping Floud, but may paſs away in a
Miſt, or diſſolve into a fruitful Dew; that no <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions</hi>
or <hi>Temptations</hi> may ever carry you down the
Stream with evil men, nor blight any hopeful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
that are budding forth in any of your
Souls. If <hi>Tribulation</hi> ſhould be any of your Lots, I
wiſh that it may not be to you, as the <hi>Hail of Egypt,</hi>
but as the <hi>Dew of Hermon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. I wiſh you a joyful Harveſt, that you may reap
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:153036:285"/>
in Eternity, what hath been ſown in time; may you
now ſow in Righteouſneſs, and therefore reap in
Mercy: May every one of you that is now ſowing in
Tears, for ever reap in joy: May you that go on your
way weeping, bearing pretious Seed, return with
joy, and bring your Sheaves with you: May the
Showers of this day, be the watering of your Seed,
that it may ſpring up to Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi> My hearts deſire for you all is, that you
may be ſaved; and if there be any perſons that
bear evil will to me, my particular wiſh for them is,
The Good-will of him that dwelt in the Buſh be
thoſe Men's Portions for ever.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of my Wiſhes for you; will you
joyn your Wiſhes with mine: will you turn your
Wiſhes into Prayers, and let this be your prayer;
<hi>The Lord grant thee thine hearts deſire, and fulfill all
thy Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi> do I wiſh you any harm in all this? If
not, if it be to be wiſhed, that the word of Chriſt were
rooted in your hearts, and your Souls thereby root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

your Luſts were rooted out, your ſins dead and dried
up, your foot gotten out of the Snare, your Souls
brought into the Fold, your fruits of righteouſneſs
and holineſs abounding, and growing up unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

and not only I, but the Lord God that hath ſent me to

you the benefit of his <hi>Bloud;</hi> with this wiſh, <hi>Oh that
it were theirs! Oh that they would hearken and accept!</hi>

               <p>There are three deadly darts in this Wiſh [oh
that thou hadſt] it includes in it theſe three cutting
words,
<list>
                     <item>Thou haſt not.</item>
                     <item>Thou mighteſt.</item>
                     <item>Thou ſhalt not for ever.</item>

1. There is this in it, [Thou haſt not.] What
have I not? why, thou haſt not known the things
that belong to thy peace. Thou haſt had the door of
Glory, the Gate of Heaven open to thee, and haſt
been call'd for, and invited in, but thou haſt loſt the
opportunity. Thou kneweſt not when thou wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> well
offered, nor would'ſt take notice what a day was
before thee, what a price was in thine hand; thy
peace, the Goſpel of peace, the Prince of peace,
a Kingdome of peace was ſet open, offered, and
brought home to thy doors, but thou hadſt ſo many
other matters to look after, that thou tookeſt no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, but haſt let it ſlip. There's one Dart. [Thou
haſt not known.] There's a Goſpel gone, there's a
Chriſt gone, there's a Soul, a Kingdom loſt.</p>
               <p>2. There is this in it, [Thou mighteſt.] Oh that
thou hadſt? why, Might I? Ye, thou mighteſt, if
thou wouldſt thou mightſt. Thy God did not mock
thee, when he preach'd peace to thee; he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and wiſh'd it thine, if thou wouldſt, thou
mightſt have made it thine own; but whilſt he would,
thou wouldeſt not.</p>
               <p>There's another Dart. [I might have known] I
have none to thank but my ſelf for the loſs, mine
undoing was mine own doing. There are no ſuch
torments as when the Soul flies upon it ſelf, and
takes revenge on it ſelf; oh the gaſhes that ſuch
ſelf reflections make! Soul, how cameſt thou in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
into all this miſery? oh 'tis of my ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my
ſelf, that my deſtruction is! The door was open, and
I was told of it, and was bid come in, but I would
not. That I am loſt and undone, was not my <hi>Fate,</hi>
which I could not avoid, but my <hi>Fault</hi> and my folly.
It ſeems to give ſome eaſe of our torment, when we
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:153036:286"/>
can ſhift off the <hi>fault.</hi> It was not I, but the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
ſaid <hi>Adam;</hi> It was not I, but the Serpent ſaid
the Woman; if it had been true, it would have
given eaſe, as well as ſerve for an excuſe. This
<hi>thought</hi> ['Twas mine own doing] tears the very caul
of the heart. Oh I have none to blame but my ſelf,
mine own fooliſh and froward heart. This is my
ignorance, this is my unbelief, this is my willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
my luſts, and my pleaſures, and my Idols, that
I was running after, that have brought me under
this dreadful loſs. 'Twas my own doing.</p>
               <p>3. There is this in it, [Thou ſhalt not for ever]
Oh that thou hadſt! why, may I not [yet?] Is there
no hope of recovering the opportunity? not one
word more, not one hour more; may not the Sun go
[one] degree backward? No, no, 'tis too late, too
late; thou haſt had thy day, from henceforth no
more for ever. There's the laſt Dart, [Time's paſt]
there's the death, the Hell, the anguiſh, the Worm
that ſhall gnaw to eternity.</p>
               <p>This one word [Time's paſt] ſets all Hell a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and when its once ſpoken to a ſinner on Earth,
there's Hell begun. Go thy way wretch, fill up thy
meaſure, and fall into thy place; The Goſpel hath
no more to ſay to thee, but this one word, <hi>Becauſe
I have called, and thou refuſedſt, I have ſtretched out
my hand, and thou regardedſt not, but haſt ſet at nought
all my Counſels, and wouldſt none of my reproofs; I alſo
will laugh at thy calamities, and mock when thy fear
cometh; when thy fear cometh as deſolation, and thy
deſtruction cometh as a whirle-wind; when diſtreſs and
anguiſh cometh upon thee, then ſhalt thou call, but I
will not anſwer, thou ſhalt ſeek me early, but ſhalt not
find me.</hi>

Beloved, my hopes are, and I am not able to ſay

more be perſwaded with, <hi>oh that they would!</hi> but
be for ever confounded with, <hi>oh that they had!</hi> Leſt
all our wiſhes and wooings of you, be turned into
weepings and mournings over you; this once hear;
Oh that you would.</p>
               <p>I heartily thank you for your good wiſhes, and
good will towards me; for your willing and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
entertainment of my perſon, and attendance on
my Miniſtry; and particularly, for your paſſionate
deſire of my longer ſtay among you: Which deſire
if God had not, my Soul could not have denied you.
Though the Almighty, to whoſe pleaſure it's meet
that we all ſubmit, hath ſaid nay to that wiſh of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:153036:287"/>
yours; yet let your Souls ſay Amen, to this laſt of
mine, that the Lord God would dwell among you,
and in you, both now and for ever.</p>
               <p>And having thus finiſhed my Labours among you,
I ſhall now cloſe up with this double account.</p>
               <p>1. Of my diſcharge of my Miniſtry in this place.</p>
               <p>2. Of my deprival. And ſhall ſo commit you to
God, and to the word of his Grace, which is able to
huild you up, and to give you an Inheritance amongſt
all them that are ſanctified.</p>
               <p>1. Of my diſcharge of my Miniſtry. What my
Doctrine and manner of life hath been, is known to
<hi>you;</hi> and what my aim and intent hath been, is
known to God. The ſearcher of hearts, knows, that
'tis the ſalvation of Souls, that hath been the mark at
which I have levelled. My way hath been to uſe all
plainneſs, that I might be made manifeſt in <hi>your</hi>
Conſciences: Weakneſſes and infirmities, both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and ſinful (the Lord pardon it) I have had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
I am ſenſible that much more might have been
done, both in publick and in private, had it not been
for a weakly body, and a ſloathful heart.</p>
               <p>I repent that I have had no more zeal for God,
no more compaſſion to Souls; I repent that I have
been no more conſtant and importunate with you,
about the matters of Eternity. Oh <hi>Eternity, Eternity,</hi>
that thou wert no more in the heart and Lips of the
Preacher, in the hearts and ears of the hearers. But
while I thus judge my ſelf for my failings, Bleſſed
be God for any ſincerity to his name, and good will
to <hi>your</hi> Souls, that he hath ſeen in me. Bleſſed be
God, I have a witneſs in my Conſcience, and I hope
in <hi>yours</hi> alſo, that I have not ſhunned to declare
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:153036:288"/>
to you, the whole Counſel of God. Brethren, I call
Heaven and Earth to witneſs this <hi>day,</hi> that I have ſet
before you life and death, good and evil, and have
not ceaſed from <hi>day</hi> to <hi>day,</hi> to warn <hi>you</hi> to chooſe
life, and that good way, that leads to it; and to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
for your lives, from the way of ſin and death.
Oh remember the many inſtructions I have given
you, the many Arguments whereby I have ſtriven
with you, the many Prayers that have been offered
up, for the guiding and gaining your Souls, into the
path of life, and the turning your feet out of the
way of deſtruction. Oh might I be able to give this
Teſtimony concerning you all, at my departure,
<hi>they have trodden in the right path, they have choſen
the good part that ſhall not be taken from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloved Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whom I have travelled

will you help me to give it up with joy, by
ſhewing your Souls before the Lord, as the Seal of

will be a Crown of rejoycing to me in that <hi>day?</hi> So
let me rejoyce, and let my <hi>joy</hi> be the <hi>joy</hi> of <hi>you</hi> all.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I <hi>ſay</hi> more? If there be any conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, any bowels
and mercies; if the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Eternal God, the
Honour of the everlaſting Goſpel, the ſafety of <hi>your</hi>
immortal Souls, the incorruptible Crown, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
eternal weight of <hi>glory,</hi> weigh any thing
with <hi>you,</hi> then once more let me beſeech <hi>you,</hi> by all
this to hearken to that word of the Goſpel, which
God hath ſpoken to <hi>you</hi> by me.</p>
               <p>2. Of <hi>my</hi> deprival. The moſt glorious morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Sun is ſetting, upon not a few of the Prophets; the

our day draws, our work ſeems to be, at an end: Our
Pulpits and our places muſt know us no more.</p>
               <p>This is the Lords doing, let all the earth keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

               <p>It is not a light thing for me, Brethren, to be laid

               <p>I know there are not a few, that will add to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of the afflicted, by telling the world, tis their

whether this be ſo or no God knoweth, and let the

After all my moſt impartial Enquiries, after all
my ſeeking counſel from the Lord, after all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
and conſulting with men of all perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
about theſe <hi>Matters,</hi> I find my ſelf ſo far ſhort of
ſatisfaction, that I am plainly put to this choice, to
part with my <hi>Miniſtry</hi> or my <hi>Conſcience.</hi> I dare not
lie before God and the World; nor come and tell
you I approve, I allow, I heartily conſent, to what I
neither do, nor can; but muſt chooſe rather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that my
<hi>Miniſtry</hi> be ſealed up by my <hi>Sufferings,</hi> than length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out by a <hi>Lie:</hi> Through the Grace of God, though
men do, yet my heart ſhall not reproach me while I
live; <hi>If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our
hearts, and knoweth all things.</hi> But however, though I
muſt now no longer act as a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> I ſhall, through
the Grace of God, endeavour peaceably, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
to ſuffer as a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>I ſhould, to teſtifie my <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
have become all Things to all Men, to the uttermoſt
that I could with any clearneſs of heart: But ſince
<hi>Matters</hi> ſtand ſo that I muſt loſe my place, or my
peace, I chearfully ſuffer my ſelf to be thruſt off the
Stage.</p>
               <p>And now welcome the Croſs of Chriſt, welcome
Reproach, welcome Poverty, Scorn, and contempt,
or whatever elſe <hi>may</hi> befall me on this account. This
Morning I had a Flock, and <hi>you</hi> had a Paſtor; but
now behold a Paſtor without a Flock, a Flock with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Shepherd: This Morning I had an Houſe, but
now I have none; This Morning I had a living, but
now I have none: <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord
hath taken away; Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloved, I am ſenſible of my Weakneſſes and
Diſadvantages I am under, which may render a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:153036:289"/>
ſtate the harder to be born; help me by your
<hi>Prayers;</hi> and not me only, but all my <hi>Brethren</hi> alſo,
with whom my Lot muſt fall; <hi>Pray for us, for we
truſt that we have a good Conſcience, in all things wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to live honeſtly.</hi> Pray,</p>
               <p>1. That God would make our Silence ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
preach the ſame holy Doctrine that we have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with our Lips.</p>
               <p>2. That he would give <hi>Supports</hi> anſwerable to our
<hi>Sufferings;</hi> that he who comforteth thoſe that are
caſt down, will alſo comfort his Servants that are
caſt out.</p>
               <p>3. That according to our earneſt expectation,
and our hope, as always, ſo now alſo, Chriſt may be
magnified in us, whether it be by Life or Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus,</hi> Brethren, <hi>I bid you farewel, in the
words of the Apoſtle,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 11. Finally, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
farewel, be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one
mind, live in peace; and the God of Peace and Love
ſhall be with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that</hi> God of Peace that brought again from the
Dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepherd of the ſheep,
through the blood of the Everlaſting Covenant, make
you perfect in every good work, to do his will; working
in you that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through
Jeſus Chriſt; to whom be glory, for ever and ever,
<hi>AMEN.</hi>
