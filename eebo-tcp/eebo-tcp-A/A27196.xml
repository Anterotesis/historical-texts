            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>FOR <hi>this Publick Addreſs to Your</hi> Grace,
<hi>I have no other Plea, than that of a</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugee.
<hi>The</hi> Muſes <hi>in all Nations, and
Ages (and long Cuſtom is little leſs than a claim of
Right) have ſtill been ſheltered under the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
of HONOUR; nor are Diſtance,
Height, or Greatneſs a Bar to thoſe Intruders.
Beſides, as WAR and WIT, the</hi> Mars <hi>and
the</hi> Minerva, <hi>were both the Offſpring of JOVE,
they have ſome flattering dawn of Hopes from Your</hi>
Grace's <hi>condeſcending Goodneſs; that the ſame
Hand that wields the rougher Thunder, may, poſſibly,
<pb facs="tcp:53112:3"/>
not diſdain a Reception to the gentler Muſes. And
indeed, where ſhould they boldlier intrude, than
where they are the profoundeſt Homagers? That
Renown, that like Your</hi> Grace's, <hi>is the faireſt
Theam to inſpire them, muſt conſequently be the
ſtrongeſt Charm to attract them. The Dedications
of Poetry are but a part of her Devotion; and
as Devotion under the preſent eſtabliſh'd Engliſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
may make her Orizons at what Shrine ſhe
pleaſes; I hope Your</hi> Grace <hi>will generouſly
vouchſafe to pardon ſo bold a bending Knee before
You.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And indeed, where can all Knees more juſtly
bend, than to the Heir of that</hi> Illuſtrious FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER,
<hi>that quitted all the Jewels of his own

               <hi>'Twas thus the embracing</hi> BRITANIA <hi>flew

            <byline>Spoken by a Girle.</byline>
            <l>LAdies, to ſupplicate our Plays ſucceſs,</l>
            <l>Hither I am ſent, a ſmall Embaſſadreſs.</l>
            <l>Once our <hi>Philaſter</hi> was a Lady's Play;</l>
            <l>And if in the laſt Age ſo warm a Ray</l>
            <l>From that high Sphear the glittering Boxes ſhin'd,</l>
            <l>Shall Beauties bright Succeſſion be leſs kind!</l>
            <l>If he pleas'd then, he muſt your Favour ſhare:</l>
            <l>For Goodneſs is entail'd upon the Fair.</l>
            <l>I would implore the Mens ſweet kindneſs too:</l>
            <l>But I'm too Young for their dear ſmiles to ſue.</l>
            <l>Beſide, what hopes has my weak Eloquence,</l>
            <l>My ſlender Oratory, feeble Senſe!</l>
            <l>Perhaps I may ſpeak Reaſon—three Years hence.</l>
            <l>Then a ſoft Story whiſper'd in your Ear,</l>
            <l>Would be a Tale you wou'd be glad to hear.</l>
            <l>However though I am too young a Face,</l>
            <l>Kind Gallants, in your Eyes to hope for Grace:</l>
            <l>Yet for once let me my requeſt obtain;</l>
            <l>I beg this Play may live, nor let me beg in vain.</l>
            <l>Nay Sirs, if nothing elſe your ſmiles can buy,</l>
            <l>Be but ſo kind, out of meer Policy,</l>
            <l>To grant me my firſt ſuite; On theſe Conditions,</l>
            <l>That I may one Day grant you your Petitions.</l>
