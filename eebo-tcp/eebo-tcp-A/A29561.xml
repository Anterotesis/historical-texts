         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Lord Digbies Speech to the
House of COMMONS,
concerning Bishops, and the
Citie Petition the ninth
of Febr. 1640.</head>
            <opener>Mr. <hi>SPEAKER,</hi>
            </opener>
            <p>I Know it is a tender subject I am
to speake of, wherein I beleeve
some within these walls are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with earnestnesse in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinions to mine; and
therefore it will bee necessary,
that in the first place I beseech the patience of
this House, that they will bee pleased to heare
mee without interruption, though somewhat
I say should chance to bee displeasing, I hope
there will bee somewhat from mee ere I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that may bee of service to this House.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96518:3"/>Sir, if I thought there were no further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
in the desires of some, that this <hi>London</hi>
Petition should bee committed, then merely
to make use of it, as an Index of grievance:
I should winke at the faults of it, and not much
oppose it.</p>
            <p>There is no man within these walls, more
sensible of the heavy grievance of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
then my selfe; nor whose affections
are keene to the clipping of those wings of
the Prelates, whereby they have mounted to
such insolencies, nor whose zeale is more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the searing them, as that they may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
spring againe.</p>
            <p>But having reason to beleeve, that some
ayme at a totall extirpation of Bishops, which
is against my heart, and that the committing
of this Petition, may give countenance to that
designe, I cannot restraine my selfe from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to divert it, or at least to set such
notes upon it, as may make it ineffectuall to
that end.</p>
            <p>Truly Sir, when this Petition was first
brought into the House, I considered it in its
nature, in the manner of the delivery in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
conjuncture of affaires, both Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and Civill, to be a thing of the highest
consequence that any age hath presented to a
Parliament; and the same thoughts I have of
it stil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96518:3"/>I professe, I looked upon it then with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
as upon a Commet a blasing starre, raised
and kindled out of the stench, out of the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
exhalation of a corrupted Hierarchy:
Me thought the Commet had a terrible tayle
with it, Sir, and pointed to the North, the
same feares dwell with mee still concerning it,
and I beseech God they may not prove Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall:
I feare all the Prudence, all the
Fore-cast, all the Vertue of this House, how
unitedly soever collected, how vigorously
applyed, will have a hard worke of it. Yet
to hinder this meteor, from causing such distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and Combustions by its influence, as it
then portended by its appearance, what ever the
event be, I shall discharge my conscience
concerning it freely, and uprightly, as
unbyast by popularity, as by any Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.
Sir, I could never flatter, the sense
of this House, which I reverence so much, as
to suppresse a single no, that my heart dictated,
though I knew the venting of it might cast
prejudices upon mee, had my fortune plac't
mee neere a King, I could not have flattered
a King. And I doe not intend now to flatter a
multitude.</p>
            <p>I shall desire those worthy Aldermen, and
the rest here of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> not to take
any thing I shall say in the least way of dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
or reflection on the Citie, I looke
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96518:4"/>
not upon this Petition, as a Petition from the
Citie of <hi>London,</hi> but from I know not what,
15000. Londoners, all that could bee got to
subscribe.</p>
            <p>When this Petition was first presented, there
might bee more reason for the Commitment
of it, as being then the most comprehensive
Catalogue wee had of Church grievance, but
now that the Ministers by their remonstrance,
have given us so faire, and full an Index of them
without those mixtures of things contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
irrationall, and presumptuous, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
this Petition abounds, I doe not know I
professe to what good end it can bee committed,
being full of contemptible things, but first let
me recall to your mind the manner of its deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie:
And I am confident, there is no man of
judgement, that will thinke it fit for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
under a Monarchie, to give countenance
to irregular, and tumultuous assemblies of
people, bee it for never so good an end: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
there is no man of the least insight into
nature, or Historie, but knowes the danger,
when either true or pretended stimulation, of
conscience, hath once given a multitude agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Contemptible things (Sir) swarme in the
8. 13. 14. 15. 16. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7. Articles of this Petition.
Did ever any body think, that the gaites of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
or <hi>Tom. Caryes</hi> muse, should by 15000. have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96518:4"/>
beene presented to a Parliament, as a motive for
the extirpation of Bishops, the scandall of the
Rochet, the Lawne sleeves, the foure corner
Cap, the Cope, the Surplesse, the Tippet, the
Hood, the Canonicall Coat; &amp;c. may passe
with arguments of the same weight, onely
thus much let me observe upon it (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>)
that one would sweare the Penners of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
had the pluming of some Bishops already,
they are so acquainted with every feather of
them. In a word, I know not whether bee
more preposterous to inferre the extirpation of
Bishops from such weake Arguments, or to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
as they doe to Church government all
the civill grievance not a patent, not a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polie,
not the price of a commodity raised, but
these men make Bishops the cause of it.</p>
            <p>For the irrationall part (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) first
they petition us in a Method onely allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with those, whose Iudgement or Iustice
is suspected, that is <hi>Inquum petere, ut aequum feras;</hi>
There is no Logick, no reasoning in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
It were want of Logick in mee to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it from a multitude, but I consider the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
in this is led by implicite faith, to that
which hath beene digested, and contrived but
by a few, and in them truly I cannot but wonder
at the want of Reconciliation here.</p>
            <p>A Petition, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> ought in this to be
a kind of Silogisme, that the Conclusion, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96518:5"/>
prayer ought to hold proportion with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
that is with the Allegations, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and to bee reasonably deduc't from
them.</p>
            <p>But what have wee here a multitude of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
a multitude of Instances, of abuses,
and depravations of Church government:
And what inferred from thence, let the use bee
utterly abolisht for the abuses sake: As if they
should say, that because Drunkennesse and
Adultery are growne so epidemicall, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
in the Petition. Let there bee no more
use of Wine, nor of Women in the Land.</p>
            <p>Christs discipline hath beene adulterated,
'tis true, the whole Church inebriated by the
Prelates, therefore inferre our Petitioners, let
not so much as the chaste, the sober use of them
bee suffered.</p>
            <p>Give mee leave to continue one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons
a little further, should it be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto us, that Wine could not be made use of
without drunkennesse, and withall some such
liquor presented, as healthy, and as nourishing,
from which no distemper could arise; I should
not blame any man for desiring to pluck up the
Vine by the roots. But for the moveable ills<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake,
to take away the solid good of a thing, is
just as reasonable in this, as to root up a good
tree, because there is a Canker in the branches.</p>
            <p>For the bold part of this Petition, Sir, what
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96518:5"/>
can there bee of greater presumption, then for
Petitioners, not only to prescribe to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
what, and how it shall doe; but for a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to teach a Parliament, what, and what is
not, the government according to Gods Word.</p>
            <p>Besides, what is the Petition against, is it not
against the government of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
established by Acts of Parliament? Is
it not against the Liturgie, against severall
formes of Divine Service, ratified by the same
Authority?</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the Parliament may
mend, may alter, may repeale Lawes, may make
new, and I hope in due season wee shall doe so
in point of Church-government: but in the
meanetime let mee tell you, Sir, I cannot but
esteeme it an irreverence, an high presumption
in any to petition point blanck against a Law,
or Government in force.</p>
            <p>Representment of inconvenience may bee
made, (as the Ministers have done) such as may
endure the wisdome of a Parliament, to advise
Lawes, to rectifie, to repeale them; but it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
the very essence of Parliaments, to keepe
up the honour of its former Acts, and not to
suffer them to bee further blasted from abroad.</p>
            <p>Beleeve me, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> all the reverence
and authority, which wee expect from future
times to our owne Acts, hereafter depends
upon our upholding the dignity of what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96518:6"/>
Parliaments have done, even in those things
which in their due time wee may desire, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to reverse.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> you see in what plaine language
I have set forth unto you the faults of this
Petition, notwithstanding as great as they are,
so they may not obtaine any seeming counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from us; I find my selfe willing to have
them past by, especially when I consider how
naturally prone all mankind is, when it finds it
selfe opprest beyond patience, to fly unto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames
for ease. And indeed, I doe not think,
that any people hath beene evermore provoked,
then the generality of <hi>England,</hi> of late yeares,
by the insolencies, and exorbitances of the
Prelates.</p>
            <p>I protest sincerely, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I cannot cast
mine eye upon this Petition, nor my thoughts
on the practises of the Church-men, that have
governed it of late; but they appear'd to
mee as a scourge employed by God upon us for
the sinnes of the Nation; I cannot thinke of
that passage in the Booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> Hee that
escapes the Sword of <hi>Hazael,</hi> shall <hi>Iehu</hi> slay,
and he that escapes <hi>Iehu,</hi> shall <hi>Elisha</hi> slay.</p>
            <p>Mee thinkes, the vengeance of the Prelates
hath beene so laid, as if 'twere meant no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
no Degree, no Complexion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
should escape it.</p>
            <p>Was there a man of a nice and tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96518:6"/>
him have they afflicted with scandall in
Adiaphoris, imposing on him those things, as
necessary, which hee thinkes unlawfull, and they
themselves knew to be but indifferent.</p>
            <p>Was there a man of a legall conscience, that
made the establishments by Law, the measure
of his Religion? him have they netled with
innovations with fresh introductions to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
            <p>Was there a man of a meeke and humble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
him have they trampled to dirt in their
pride.</p>
            <p>Was there a man of a proud, and arrogant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
him have they bereft with indignation at
their superlative insolence about him.</p>
            <p>Was there a man peaceably affected, studious
of the quiet, and tranquillity of his countrey?
their incendiariship hath plagued him.</p>
            <p>Was there a man faithfully addicted to the
Right of the Crowne, loyally affected to the
Kings Supremacy, how hath hee beene galled
by their new Oath? a direct Covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it.</p>
            <p>Was there a man tenatious of the liberty, and
propriety of the subject, have they not set forth
Bookes, or Sermons, or Canons distructive to
them all.</p>
            <p>Was there a man of a pretty sturdy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that would not blanch for a little. Their
pernicious Oath hath made him sensible, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96518:7"/>
wounded, or I feare prepared him for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</p>
            <p>Was there a man that durst mutter against
their Insolencies? he may inquire for his Luggs,
they have beene within the Bishops visitation;
as if they would not onely derive their Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disment
of the spirituall sword from S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
but of the materiall one too, and the Right to
cut off Eares.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi> as dully, as faintly, as unlively,
as in Language these Actions of the Prelates
have beene expressed unto you, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
there is no man heares mee but is brimfull
of Indignation.</p>
            <p>For my part I professe I am so enflamed
with the sense of them, that I finde my self rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to cry out with the lowdest of the 15000
downe with them, downe with them, even to
the ground.</p>
            <p>But M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> when I cast mine Eye round
upon this great and wise Assembly, and find
my self a part too (though the most unworthy
and Inconsiderable) of that Senate, from whose
dispassionate and equall Constitutions, present
and future times must Expect their happinesse
or Infelicity.</p>
            <p>It obliges mee to the utmost of my power
to divest my self and others of all those distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
of Judgement which arise ever from
great provocations, and to settle my thoughts
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96518:7"/>
in that temper which I thinke necessary to all
those that would judge cleerely of such things
as have incenst them.</p>
            <p>I beseech you gentlemen let us not be led on
by passion to popular and vulgar Errors, it is
naturall (as I tould you before) to the multitude
to fly unto Extremes, that seemes ever the best
to them, that is most opposite to the presentest
object of their hate.</p>
            <p>Wise Councells (M. <hi>Speaker</hi>) must square
their resolutions by another measure, by what's
most just, most honourable, most convenient:
Beleeve mee, Sir, great alterations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are rarely accompanied with any of
these.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> wee all agree upon this; that a
Reformation of Church Government is most
necessary, and our happy unity of opinions
herein should be one Argument unto us to stay
there, but Sir, to strike at the Roote, to attempt
a totall Alteration, before ever I can give my
vote unto that, three things must be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
unto mee.</p>
            <p>First, that the mischiefes which wee have
felt under Episcopall Government flow from
the nature of the function, not from the abuses
of it only, that is, that no Rules, no Bamda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
can be set to Bishops able to Restraine them
from such Exorbitances.</p>
            <p>Secondly, such a frame of Government must
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96518:8"/>
be layde before us, as no time, no Corruption
can make lyable to proportionable inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
with that which wee abolish.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, it must be made to appeare that
this <hi>Utopia</hi> is Practicable.</p>
            <p>For the first, Sir, that Episcopacy a function
deduced through all ages of Christs Church,
from the Apostles times and continued by the
most venerable and sacred order Ecclesiasticall;
a function dignified by the learning and Piety
of so many Fathers of the Church, glorified
by so many Martyrdomes in the Primitive
times, and some since our owne blessed Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
a government admired (I speake it
knowingly) by the learnedst of the Reformed
Churches abroad, and lastly a Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which (till these late yeares) this Church
hath so flourished, so fructified, that such a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
such a function, should at the faggend
of 1640 yeares be found to have such a Close
Devill in it, as no power can Exercise, no Law
restrayne appeares (Sir) to me a thing very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable:
I professe I am deceived Sir if Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enniall
Parliaments will not be a Circle able to
keepe many a worse Devill in order.</p>
            <p>For the second, I know not the strength of
other mens fancies, but I will confesse unto
you ingenuously the weaknesse of my faith
in the poynt, that I do not beleeve there
can any other Government bee proposed but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96518:8"/>
will in time be subject to as great or greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
then Episcopacy, I meane Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
so ordered, reduct and limitted as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it may be by firme and sollid boundaryes.</p>
            <p>Tis true Sir, wee cannot so well judge before
hand of future inconveniences, for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the faults and mischiefes of Episcopall
government resulting from fresh and bleeding
Experience.</p>
            <p>And the insight into dangers of any new
way that shall be proposed being to rise only
from speculation, the apprehension of the one
is likely to be much more operative then of the
other, though perhaps in just reason it ought to
be the weaker with us, it is hard in such cases
for us to preserve an equall and unpropense
judgment; since being in things of this world so
much too hard for faith and contemplation: yet
as Divine as our inspection is into things not
experimented, if we harken to those that would
quite extirpate Episcopacy, I am confident
that insteed of every Bishop wee put downe
in a Diocesse, wee shall set up a Pope in every
Parish.</p>
            <p>Lastly M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> whether the subversion
of Episcopacy, and the introducing of another
kind of Government bee practiceable, I leave
it to those to judge who have considered the
connexion and interweaving of the Church
Government with the Common Law, to those
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96518:9"/>
who heard the Kings Speech to us the other
Day, or who have looked into reason of state.</p>
            <p>For my part (though no Statesman I will
speake my mind freely in this) I doe not thinke
a King can put downe Bishopps totally with
safety to Monarchy; not that there is any such
Allyance as men talke of twixt the Myter and
the Crowne, but from this reason; that upon
the putting downe of Bishopps, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Assemblies is likely to succeed it. That
(to be effectuall) must draw to it selfe the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction that (conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently)
the power of Excommunicating Kings
as well as any other Brother in Christ, and if
a King chance to be delivered over to Sathan,
Judge whether men are likely to care much
what becomes of him next.</p>
            <p>These things considered M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> let us lay
aside all thoughts of such dangerous, such fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
such unaccomplished Alterations:
&amp; all thought of countenancing those thoughts
in others; let us all resolve upon that course
wherein (with union) wee may probably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
our selves, successe, happines, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that is in a through Reformation.</p>
            <p>To that, no mans vote shall be given with
more zeale, with more heartines then mine. Let
us not destroy Bishopps, but make Bishopps
such as they were in the Primitive times.</p>
            <p>Doe their large Territories, their large Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96518:9"/>
offend? let them be retrencht, the good
Bishop of <hi>Lippo</hi> had but a narrow Diocesse.</p>
            <p>Doe their Courts and subordinates offend?
let them be brought to Governe, as in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times, by Assemblies of their Clergie.</p>
            <p>Doth their intermedling in secular affaires
offend? exclude them from the capacity, it is
no more then what reason and all Antiquity
hath interdicted them.</p>
            <p>That all this may be the better effected, M.
<hi>Speaker</hi> my motion is that: First, wee may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a Committee to collect all greevances
springing from the misgovernment of the
Church (to which the Ministers head of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
will be sufficient without counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
this Petition by a Comitment) and to
represent it to this house in a Body.</p>
            <p>And in the next place that we may (if it stand
with the order of Parliaments) desire that there
may be a standing Comittee of certaine mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Houses who (with a number of
such learned Ministers as the Houses shall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
for Assistants) may take into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all these greevances, and advise of the best
way to settle peace and satifaction in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church, to the comfort of all
good Christians and all good Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
men.</p>
