            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A <hi>Londoner</hi> of great Eſtate, riding at the beginning of the Contagion, with his wife and two onely children (hauing no more) was for his money well receiud into a Town, lodged in a faire houſe, the country-neighbors reſorted to him, and were glad of welcomes, for their ſtomackes were not ſo ſubiect to <hi>Qualmes,</hi> and watry ſpittings, as ſince they are fallen into. But in the end, God (to ſhew how far-ſoeuer we flie, hath wings to ouer-take vs) laid his hand vpon this <hi>Londoners</hi> two children, ſtrucke them with ſickneſſe firſt, and in a few dayes after with Death.</p>
               <p>Being dead, the <hi>Londoner</hi> (ſtruck in yeares) fell into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his leauing the Citie,<note place="margin">A Caueat for Run-awayes.</note> &amp; (full of ſorrow) much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his departing from it, moſt peremptorily condemning him ſelfe, as guilty of pulling downe the wrath of heauen vpon his two ſweet Babes, for his haſtie flying (like <hi>Adam</hi>) out of Gods reach, when at the holding vp of a finger, hee would finde him
<pb facs="tcp:4877:11"/>
out. This added ſome heauy weights to his ſorrow, yet this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nothing, to what was layd vpon him afterwards. For his two children lying dead vpon a table,<note place="margin">A rich Father Sexton to his own Children.</note> the Miniſter would not come neere him to bury them; no Clarke (to get a Parſons li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing) would venture to Church with them; there was none to dig a graue for as much ground as the whole town ſtood vpon; and for Coffins! had he bin owner of coffers filld with gold, hee could not with them haue hired a fellowe to make one. Then came into his mind the happineſſe of <hi>Londoners</hi> at home: for all their miſeries, for all the tedious marchings of threeſcore or fourſcore in a day to one Churchyard, yet there was a <hi>Comfort,</hi> a <hi>bleſsing,</hi> a <hi>reioycing,</hi> to ſee thoſe bodies receiue decent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Buriall. Had his children bin ſnatchd from him in <hi>London,</hi> I could, ſaid he (his heart-ſtrings being ready to crack with ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) haue had friends and kinred, to accompany them to their graues: no Ceremonies ſhould haue beene wanting due to the dead: But now! and then he brake off; recollecting his ſpirits, and reſoluing to make a vertue of neceſsitie, He determined (ſeeing no other remedy) to bury his children himſelfe. A graue herevpon he digged in the handſomeſt faſhion he could, &amp; then fetching firſt one child, and after, the other (his Wife being a partner in this tragicall paſſage) he read Seruice ouer them; the Mother, when he came to theſe words, <hi>Earth to earth, Aſhes to aſhes,</hi> performing that dutie.</p>
