         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>I Have undertaken a Great Work, <hi>viz.</hi> to
display all the Transactions of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
relating to the <hi>Methods of Religion,</hi>
from the Creation to the end of the World, from
the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> to the last of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
For I had not met with any Author
that had undertaken to comprise them all, and to
give us an account of them according to their true
<hi>Series:</hi> nor had I ever lit upon a Writer (either
Foreign or Domestick) who had designedly traced
the particular Causes and Grounds of them, or
settled them on their right and true Foundations.
Wherefore I betook my self to this Work, resolving
to attempt something, tho it were only to invite
others of greater skill to go on with it, and to add
the finishing Stroke to it. I acknowledg this Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
to be very mean, and unworthy of its Noble
Subject; but however, this I will say in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
and that with great truth, that though I
have done but little, yet I never met with any
that hath done so much on this Theme, whether

whole Circle of Religious <hi>Dispensations,</hi> we shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make such <hi>discoveries</hi> as will be of singular use
and advantage in our lives: We shall hereby avoid that
confusion which too often attends the contemplation of
these divine Matters; we shall apprehend aright the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Order of them in the succession of Times; we shall
attain to a right understanding of the Sacred Scriptures
of the Old and New Testament where the several Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations

which is the perfection of all the rest, and was more
signally contrived for the welfare and happiness of
Mankind.</p>
                     <p>Neither have we here a view only of what is past
and present, but here is represented to us a prospect of
what is to come. For the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as to Futurities may be here fully satisfied. These
are the things which I am to offer to the Reader. And
because there have been great failures in the handling of
these <hi>Dispensations,</hi> because Authors have not rightly
distinguish'd them, but some have made them more,
and others fewer than they are; sometimes they have
mix'd and confounded those which really differ in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

<hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Grand Oeconomies</hi> are these three:
<list>
                           <item>1. The <hi>State of Innocency and Felicity,</hi> or <hi>Adam</hi>
created Upright.</item>
                           <item>II. The <hi>State of Sin and Misery,</hi> or <hi>Adam</hi> Fallen.
In this State were our first Parents, till they were
reconciled to God: and in this are all their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
till they be made partakers of Grace and
Pardon.</item>
                           <item>III. The <hi>State of Reconciliation,</hi> or <hi>Adam</hi> Recovered.
In this State our first Parents were after they were
received into favour: And in this all the <hi>Faithful</hi>
are.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Man in Integrity, Man Lapsed, Man Restored,</hi>
are the three <hi>Great Oeconomies.</hi> The first of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
from the Creation to Man's Fall: The second
from Man's Fall to his being recovered: The third reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from Man's Recovery or Restauration to the end of
the World: And consequently this last General Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
(which may be called the <hi>Dispensation of Grace</hi>)
is the largest of all, and of the longest continuance.</p>
                     <p>The first <hi>General Dispensation</hi> is the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
which continued from the Creation of Man till
his Apostacy. We must know then that God having
made the World, and furnish'd it with all Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
at last made the most excellent and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd piece of the visible Creation, <hi>Man.</hi> And to
<hi>Man</hi> was added <hi>Woman,</hi> to be a Companion of his
Happiness. As the Divine Being would not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Man should be without the Woman, jointly to enjoy
the good things of the Creation, which were made for

saith the Great Philosopher, that there should be
these two distinct Sexes for mutual Communion and
Society in the World: yea, and I may add, for keeping
up the World it self, which would soon have a period if
Human Kind ceased. The first Person of this kind was
by God himself named <hi>Adam,</hi> because he was made of
Earth. <hi>Adam</hi> of <hi>Adamah;</hi> he had this name given
him to remind him of his Original. And for this
reason <hi>Adam</hi> was the name given to <hi>Woman</hi> as well as
Man; Gen. 5. 2. <hi>He called their name</hi> Adam <hi>in the
day when they were created.</hi> For tho the Man was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
descended of the Earth, yet the Woman, as
being taken out of the Man, was remotely so (for it
is said, <hi>The Rib which the Lord God had taken from
Man, made he a Woman,</hi> Gen. 2. 22. where without
doubt by a <hi>Rib</hi> are meant the Bone, and the Flesh and
Muscles that go along with it; for that is implied in
<hi>the closing up the flesh in the stead thereof,</hi> ver. 21. and
we find <hi>Bone</hi> and <hi>Flesh</hi> together, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.) Whence by
the way we may take notice of that mistake of a learned
Anatomist, the younger <hi>Bartholine,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> had
thirteen Ribs on each side, and that <hi>Eve</hi> was made out
of a <hi>pair</hi> of these; which is contrary to the express
words of the Text, <hi>God took one of his Ribs,</hi> Gen. 2.
21. and made the Woman of it. Of a single Rib then
she was formed; and that Rib, as the rest of Man's
Body, being made of Earth, she was but one remove from
the Earth, and therefore might have her name from the
Earth in common with <hi>Man:</hi> tho afterwards for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason she was named <hi>Eve</hi> by her Husband, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
20. and the name <hi>Adam</hi> became appropriated to <hi>him,</hi>
because he was the true <gap reason="foreign">

He was the only Person that had his rise from
the Soil he lived on: tho 'tis true in a remote sense we
are all <hi>Aborigines,</hi> as having our extraction from him,
and consequently are descended from the Earth.</p>
                     <p>And here (before we go any further) we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>olly of the <hi>Praeadamitick</hi> Opinion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.
The Sacred History of <hi>Moses</hi> assures us, that
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>irst Persons that were created
on the Earth; and (lest any should question it) our
Saviour hath confirmed it, <hi>From the beginning of the
Creation God made them Male and Female,</hi> Mark 10.
6. For it is undeniable that he speaks this of <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve,</hi> because in the next Verse he alledgeth what
was said by God presently after the production of this
latter; <hi>Therefore shall a Man leave his Father and his
Mother, and cleave unto his Wife,</hi> Gen. 2. 24. Whence
it evidently appears, that <hi>the Male and Female</hi> here
spoken of are <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and that these were made
<hi>from the beginning of the Creation;</hi> therefore there
were no Men and Women before them.</p>
                     <p>This is clear from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 20. Adam <hi>called his Wife's
name</hi> Eve, <hi>because she was the Mother of all living.</hi>
This reason of her Name is assigned by <hi>Moses,</hi> (for
when <hi>Adam</hi> gave her this Name she was not a <hi>Mother</hi>)
she was so call'd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by God's appointment, the only Mother of <hi>the
living,</hi> yea of <hi>all living,</hi> of human kind, that have
been or shall be upon Earth: And consequently there
was no Race of Men or Women before her. If there
were no other Text to be alledged but this one, it were
sufficient to consute the vain Opinion of the <hi>Author of

the Praeadamites,</hi> who with a great deal of straining
and forcing of Texts, endeavours to prove that there
was another Generation besides that of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>
He tells us there is a <hi>Creation</hi> of Man and Woman
spoken of in the latter end of the first Chapter of
<hi>Genesis;</hi> and another <hi>Creation</hi> of the Holy Race of
Mankind, of which the first Man and Woman were
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> spoken of <hi>Chap. 2. v.</hi> 2, 22. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the plain, obvious and true Account is, that the first
Narrative is general, but the second is particular, that
is, it gives a distinct and particular account of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Man and Woman. Notwithstanding this,

read (saith he) of none descended from <hi>Adam</hi> and

It is not to be doubted that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>
had more Children than are expresly mention'd by
<hi>Moses;</hi> yea, that they had a great many Children and
Grand children. If we consider this, we shall discover
the vanity of the <hi>Praeadamitical</hi> Conceit, and answer
the Cavils that are rais'd about it by the first Author of
it, <hi>Dyrerius,</hi> who indeed at last was sensible of the
folly of his Opinion, and (as we are<note n="†" place="bottom">

it.</p>
                     <p>Besides, to think there was any Man before <hi>Adam</hi> is
groundless, because he is expresly call'd twice by the
Apostle <hi>the first Man,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 45, 47. It is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous

then to imagine that he was not the first of his

him, even some thousands of years before him.
This Text, and the others before-mention'd, must be
removed out of the Bible before we can believe such a
thing, or that there are others of human Race besides
those that descend from <hi>Adam,</hi> as some Inhabitants in

Man alone was created in the Divine Image; as much
as to say, no other Creature whatsoever on Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth
God but Man. Therefore it is evident that
these words cannot be understood of the <hi>Idea</hi> according
to which God made all things, for according to that he
made Beasts as well as Men, and then we might have
expected to read in <hi>Genesis,</hi> not only <hi>Let us make

and was to have bodily Parts. But this hath no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

can be no mitigation of it. Besides, it is contrary to

                     <p>
                        <hi>Positively</hi> then, the <hi>Image</hi> of God wherein Man was
created was something in his <hi>Soul</hi> chiefly, something in
his <hi>outward Man,</hi> and it also consisted in his <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

over the Creatures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. In the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man is God's Image or Likeness
placed. For this part of us is of an immaterial and
spiritual Nature; and such is God, <hi>he is a Spirit,</hi> John
4. 24. Again, the Soul of Man is immortal, and
therein is God's Image and Representation. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
follows upon the former Quality; it being imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
and incorporeal, it must needs be in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
incorruptible. Herein we signally resemble the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
and therefore it is rightly asserted by St. <hi>Augustin,</hi>
that because of the immortality of the Soul (tho not
only for that) Man is said to be made according to <hi>God's
Image.</hi> Moreover, the Soul of Man is of a rational and
intelligent Nature, and therein also is like unto God.
There was no visible or sublunary Creature before <hi>Adam</hi>
that was of this kind: therefore, saith God, <hi>Let us make
Man after our Image,</hi> let us frame a terrestrial Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with a reasonable Soul, with an immortal and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Nature, which are Resemblances of the Divinity
it self: Let us make him capable of conceiving things
aright, of arguing and discoursing, and of making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and deductions from things, which no Brutes
are able to do. Let us furnish him with all Divine
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65397:16"/>
Knowledg, that he may be able to apprehend the things
of God, and have an insight into the most sublime and
heavenly Truths, and by this means also partake of the
Divine Nature and Likeness.</p>
                     <p>That this Knowledg and Wisdom are part of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Image,</hi> is clear from the Apostle's words in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.
10. where he acquaints us, that <hi>the new Man is renewed
in Knowledg, after the Image of him that created him.</hi>
Whence it is rationally to be inferr'd, that <hi>God's Image</hi>
partly consisted in <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi>

                        <hi>Smalcius</hi> had a very low opinion of the first Man

<hi>Adam</hi> was next to a Fool. But may not these Writers
be thought to be next to something of that Nature,
when they assert a thing so unreasonable and absurd, so
wild and extravagant? I do not say that <hi>Adam</hi> was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
and scholastical in his Notions, that he had any skill
in the quirks of Wit and Logick. I believe <hi>Scotus</hi> would
have baffled him, a knotty <hi>Schoolman</hi> would have put

For these Subtilties were not the accomplishments of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,

Understanding, the Salvo's of Ignorance, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the greatest increasers of it. Therefore I do not
think that <hi>Adam</hi>'s intellectual Happiness consisted in
these, but in that which was solid and useful.</p>
                     <p>What Man of sense and sober thoughts can deny that
God indued <hi>Adam</hi> with a quick Understanding, upon
considering this one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that he <hi>gave Names to

every living creature,</hi> Gen. 2. 19. and it may be
(tho it is not recorded) to the Plants and all Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
on Earth, yea, even to the Stars in Heaven, (tho
the Names of them are now lost) yea, to all things
above and below, which were useful and common in
the Life of Man? And those Names then did express
and signify the very Nature and Properties of the things,
whereas now they are generally <hi>ex instituto,</hi> merely from
custom and the arbitrary will of Men. He that was able
thus to give Names to all Creatures according to their
Natures, was no <hi>Fool</hi> or <hi>Sot</hi> certainly. This was the
great <hi>Plato</hi>'s judgment, who tells us it was no ordinary
and mean thing, it was not the work of a vulgar Person

reasonable to believe that <hi>Adam</hi> was a great natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
had knowledg of all those Creatures which he
named; else he could not have fitted Names to them.
And that he did so, is evident from comparing the 19th
Verse of the forementioned Chapter, with the 22<hi>d</hi> and
23<hi>d</hi> Verses. In the former 'tis said, that the <hi>Lord God
formed every living Creature out of the ground, and
brought them to</hi> Adam, <hi>to see what he would call them;
and whatsoever he call'd them that was the Name thereof.</hi>
In the latter 'tis said, <hi>The Rib which the Lord God had
taken from Man, made he a Woman, and brought her
unto the Man. And</hi> Adam <hi>said, She shall be called
Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</hi> You see
the parallel, the brute Creatures were brough by God
to <hi>Adam,</hi> on purpose that he should bestow <hi>Names</hi> on
them: So was <hi>Eve</hi> brought to him, that she should have
a Name given her by him. <hi>Adam</hi> gave <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
Names</hi> to the other Creatures; and so he did to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65397:17"/>
the Woman. We gather the former from the latter. We
find that when God brought the Woman to the Man,
he fastned a Name on her sutable to her Nature and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal:
therefore 'tis reasonably to be concluded, that
when the other Creatures of an inferior rank were
brought by God to <hi>Adam,</hi> he con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er'd such Names on
them as were most expressive of their different Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Qualities.</p>
                     <p>As God had given <hi>Adam</hi> his Name which was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,
so <hi>Adam</hi> gave other Creatures Names which
carried significancy with them. This argues his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals
to have been very acute and profound, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he could not have perceived the several Signatures
and Properties of those Animals which were brought
before him. It is not to be question'd then, that he had
an insight into the true Nature of all Beings, and was
one of unspeakable Sagacity. In fine, whatever some
<hi>Rabbies</hi> extravagantly assert on the one hand concerning
the prodigious transcendency of <hi>Adam</hi>'s knowledg, and
how meanly soever some of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
on the other hand speak of his Endowments, it
is a sober Truth that our First Parents were very knowing
Persons. It is not to be doubted that they had especially
a perfect knowledg of <hi>Divine</hi> Truth, from whence all
Virtue and Holiness spring.</p>
                     <p>Which reminds me of another Quality of Man's
<hi>Soul</hi> in the first Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> its <hi>Righteousness</hi> or
<hi>Holiness.</hi> For God endued it, not only with Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
but with a Will, which he adorned with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Graces; and in these also consisteth the <hi>Image of
God,</hi> as we are ascertain'd by an inspired and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

these it is that Man most of all resembles God, and is

resemble God, as if God were of human Shape: This
we exploded before as absurd and ridiculous. But the

as it was extraordinarily fair, comely and beautiful. It
is true, <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body was made of <hi>Earth;</hi> but this
Earth was marvelously refined and purified. And this
is implied, if not express'd, in <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Name,</hi> and in
the word which is used in the Original for the <hi>EARTH</hi>
out of which he was taken. For the import of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>

only <hi>rubuit, he was red</hi> or <hi>ruddy,</hi> (and so <hi>Adam</hi> is as

he was <hi>ruddy</hi> when he was born, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 25.)
but it is of a larger signification, and is as much as
<hi>splenduit.</hi> That it bears this sense, may be gathered
from the word <hi>Adamdameth,</hi> Levit. 13. 19. where it
must be rendred <hi>shining</hi> or <hi>glistering,</hi> or else the same
thing there spoken of must be very <hi>white</hi> and very <hi>red,</hi>
as <hi>Bochart</hi> hath noted, <hi>Hieroz.</hi> P. 2. l. 5. c. 6. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

<hi>Arias Montanus</hi> renders it <hi>nitidi fuere.</hi> And so the
word <hi>Admoni</hi> (which comes from the Verb <hi>Adam</hi>) is
taken in this sense, as in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 12. where 'tis said
of <hi>David,</hi> that he was <hi>ruddy,</hi> i. e. <hi>beautiful,</hi> as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd

is alike, and they both of them denote that which is

                     </p>
                     <p>And as it is thus with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verb <hi>Adam,</hi> so
proportionably the Substantive <hi>Adamah</hi> doth not only
signify <hi>red Earth</hi> (as if it were so called from its red

of the Earth in the East Country: And<note n="1" place="bottom">Antiq. l. 1. c. 1.</note>

                     <p>I attend not to the prodigious Stories which some

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65397:19"/>
strange Beauty and Elegancy, and of the vast Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body. <hi>Rabbi</hi>

                        <hi>Solomon Iarchi</hi> avers that
<hi>Adam</hi> was so tall, that standing on the Earth he could
touch the Heavens with his hand. And several other
such romantick Passages in the Writings of these fond
Men, I disregard; (nay, those that are sober among

is said, <hi>Adam</hi>'s Stature reached from one end of the Earth

of all things contained in the World) but it is certain,
that as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul was made a Transcript of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so his Body was framed in a most exquisite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and the Divine Art and Skill were wonderfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in the shaping of it. For as <hi>Philo</hi> saith,<note n="3" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>We
are begot of Men, but God himself made</hi> Adam. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
being better, the Work must be more excellent. Yea,
this must be said, that <hi>all</hi> of us, having been in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Loins, are part of that excellent Workmanship, and
have the same <hi>Image</hi> stamped upon us that <hi>Adam</hi> had.
We are all marked and sealed by the Divine Hand;
his own Impression and Signature are upon us, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our corporeal part, tho 'tis true it was much defac'd
by the Primitive Aopstacy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> was God's <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
as it was made <hi>Immortal.</hi> He was created in
full Strength, and as a Person of<note n="4" place="bottom">Dixit R. Jochanan, Adamus &amp; Eva quasi filii viginti anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum creati sunt. Beresh. Rab. Sect. 14.</note> a just Age, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
sound and flourishing. For his Body was not
like those of Beasts, weak and corruptible, but was
made to be of perpetual Duration, obnoxious to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65397:19"/>
no Decays, Diseases or Changes. If Man had stood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and kept his Innocence, this had been his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But this Image was restored to him and us who
are his Posterity; and not only our Souls but Bodies
shall everlastingly subsist. Thus by their Immortality
and eternal Continuance, they partake in some measure
of the Divine Nature and Likeness.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In the <hi>Body</hi> of Man, as well as in his Soul,
the <hi>Image</hi> of God consisteth, because the Soul worketh
on the Body, and by it. Hence the <hi>Members of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are</hi> said to be <hi>Instruments of Righteousness,</hi> Rom. 6.
13. As they are instrumental to so excellent a purpose,
as they are subservient to Grace and Holiness, and as the
Virtues of the Holy Spirit are exerted by them, they
are part of the Image of God. For it is not to be
questioned, that the whole Man is God's Image. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tho the Divine Likeness doth not equally shine in
all Parts, yet this corporeal Part of Man in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
shareth in that Image. For which reason the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of good Men are stiled <hi>the Temples of the Holy
Ghost,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, God's Image is on the Body of Man, as it
is of that particular <hi>erect</hi> Figure, which no living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
else partaketh of. <hi>Aristotle</hi> was so much a Divine
as to apprehend and acknowledg this. <hi>Man only</hi> (saith

which he was created in. The Frame of the Body
was to signify the Quality of the Soul. The outward
Man was made an Hieroglyphick of the inward Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and Disposition of the Mind. Again, this erect
Shape represented the Sovere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65397:20"/>
over all other Animals. For being not made in that low
and groveling posture which these are in, it is a sign he
was to be distinguish'd from them, and to be made a
Ruler over them. Which brings me to the next thing
I propounded.</p>
                     <p>3. God's Image in Man consisteth in his Dominion
over the Creatures. Observe therefore, that when God
had said, <hi>Let us make Man in our Image, after our
Likeness,</hi> it immediately follows, <hi>Let him have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the
Air,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So God created Man in his own Image,</hi> Gen.
1. 26, 27. Which intimates to us (as St. <hi>Basil,</hi> St.
<hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and other Fathers agree on that place) that
Man's Dominion over the Creatures was the Image and
Representation of God's Principality and Soveraignty.
God constituted him Lord of the Earth, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
over all things in it; he made him Prince of the
whole Creation, Universal Lord and Emperor, and
there is nothing but is made subject to him. Which
<hi>David</hi> sets forth thus in <hi>Psal. 8. 6, 7, 8. Thou madest
him to have Dominion over the Works of thy Hands,
thou hast put all things under his feet: All Sheep and
Oxen, yea, and the Beasts of the Field, (i. e.</hi> Beasts
which are untamed and wild) <hi>the Fowl of the Air, and
the Fish of the Sea, and whatsoever passeth through
the Paths of the Sea.</hi> Here is part of God's Image
and Likeness. And this <hi>Power</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> had over
all Animals was exerted and manifested afterwards in a
very visible and notable Instance, <hi>viz.</hi> when he call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d
them all together, and gave Names to them.<note n="6" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>The
Lord God brought them to him,</hi> by giving him this
Power to summon them, and to cause them to appear
before him at his pleasure. And when they were come.
<hi>Adam</hi> strook a terror into the fiercest of them. At the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65397:20"/>
sight of him they stood astonished; the wildest of them
(for some may be said, in comparison of others, to be
wild) grew tame and gentle, and adored him as their
Lord and Ruler. <q>There is seated in the Nature of
Man (faith<note n="7" place="bottom">De Occult. Philos. l. 3. c. 40.</note> 
                           <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi>) a certain Power of
Dominion from that dread which he is able to strike
into other Creatures. This remains in Man at this
day, and he might exert it if he knew how to make
use of it. There is a certain Terrifick Character
impress'd on Man by the Creator, by which all
Creatures stand in aw of him as the Image of his
Creator. If a Man could exercise this Power aright,
he might work Wonders in the World:</q> So he.
But the Power which <hi>Adam</hi> had over the Creatures
was discover'd, not only in making them appear, and
stand submissive before him, but also in his giving of
Names to them. <q>The Imposition of Names
(saith<note n="8" place="bottom">

and <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Creatures, as when Men
buy Servants, they change their Names and give
them new ones; this shews that they are Lords over
them.</q> And there is something of this perhaps in
<hi>Adam</hi>'s giving the <hi>Woman</hi> her Name. <hi>She shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Woman,</hi> saith he; which may imply his Primitive
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> over her.</p>
                     <p>But tho I propound this only as probable, yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is past all doubt, <hi>viz.</hi> that Man had and hath an

where the Apostle, speaking of the behaviour of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

God.</hi> Uncovering was a sign of Liberty and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
so that the <hi>Image</hi> of God in Man is that Dominion
and Superiority which God hath given him over the
Woman and all things else. This is but poor proof,
and not worth the refuting: Besides that, according to
this <hi>Father,</hi> the Image of God is peculiar to <hi>Man,</hi>
and the other Six is wholly excluded. Which sheweth
this to be a fanciful and groundless Opinion: for Man
and Woman are both of the same Nature in the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

important a thing as the Divine Image is. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,

follows them in that Opinion. Some held that <hi>Paradise</hi>
was not Local, but that it was a State rather than a Place;
and that this State was not on Earth. This was the high-flown
Notion of <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> of <hi>Basil, Ambrose</hi>
and <hi>Damascen,</hi> and sometimes of <hi>Ierom,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<hi>Paradise</hi> in a spiritual and mystical Sense, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it to be meant only of some blessed and happy
Condition. Some of them seem to refer it to <hi>Heaven,</hi>
others to the Virtues of the <hi>Soul,</hi> or the Soul's chief and

placing it in <hi>Africa,</hi> and in the warmest part

                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:65397:23"/>
Doctors hold it was seated under the <hi>Equinoctial.</hi>
And <hi>Durandus</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure</hi> among the Schoolmen
are of that Judgment. Others fancy it to be in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
and in the warmest Country there; for these Men
think the Torrid Zone to be the most comfortable part
of the World. But those most certainly are in the
right who place it in <hi>Asia.</hi> There is<note n="5" place="bottom">Cirrellus.</note> one Man who is
singular in imagining <hi>Paradise</hi> to have been in that part
of <hi>Asia</hi> which is called <hi>Palestine,</hi> near <hi>Iordan</hi> in the
Land of <hi>Sodom;</hi> which he gathers from <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 10.
But any one may see that no such thing can be inferr'd
from those words, which only intimate, that the Plain
of <hi>Iordan</hi> where <hi>Sodom</hi> stood, was a very pleasant and
delightful place, and might in some respect be <hi>compared</hi>
with <hi>Paradise.</hi> But after all the rambling Conjectures
and wild Fancies concerning <hi>Paradise,</hi> and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
place where it was, this is to be imbraced as the most
probable and accountable Truth, that it was situated on
those most pleasant and fruitful Fields of <hi>Asia,</hi> which of
old were called <hi>Babylon,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi>
In the lower part of this <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> taking in also a
part of <hi>Shinar</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> was this Garden of <hi>Eden</hi>
planted, as a<note n="6" place="bottom">Sir <hi>W. R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Paradise</hi> (being of a very great extent) reach'd
towards <hi>Armenia, Galtruchius</hi> placeth it in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Armenia the Greater;</hi> especially the Mountain
<hi>Paiarde</hi> (saith he) was <hi>Paradise.</hi> But herein this
learned Man was mistaken: for it is evident that <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>
was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> because <hi>Eden</hi> was there; as that
worthy Knight hath proved from <hi>If a.</hi> 37. 12. and
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. 23. by shewing where those other Countries
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65397:23"/>
are found which are joined with <hi>Eden.</hi> By many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he makes it clear that <hi>Eden</hi> was part of <hi>Babylonia,</hi>
and <hi>Babylonia</hi> a part of <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi> Or rather I am
inclined to determin thus, (which doth not alter the
main thing, but only gives you a more distinct account
of it) <hi>Eden,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi>
and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> were
three Names of the same Country. <hi>Eden</hi> was the first
and antientest: <hi>Babylon</hi> was the Name it was call'd by
afterwards, and <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> is a <hi>Greek</hi> Name given to
it, and signifieth that it stood in the <hi>midst of Rivers;</hi>
especially it referreth to its being situated between those
two <hi>Rivers, Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> tho I know there
is a stricter acceptation (and that not uncommon) of
Mesopotamia.</p>
                     <p>And so you find this place described in <hi>Genesis,</hi> as
famous for its <hi>Rivers,</hi> Gen. 2. 10. <hi>A River went out
of Eden to water the Garden, and from thence it was
parted, and became into four heads: i. e.</hi> the principal
River of <hi>Paradise</hi> had four great Channels. <hi>The name of
the first is</hi> Pison; <hi>that is it which compasseth the whole
Land of</hi> Havilah, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. This <hi>Pison</hi> is call'd by
some <hi>Phasis,</hi> or <hi>Phasitigris;</hi> it runs (they say) by that
<hi>Havilah</hi> whither the <hi>Amalekites</hi> fled, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 7.
and divides it from the Country of <hi>Susiana,</hi> and at last
falls into the Persian Gulf. So <hi>Galtruchius</hi> is positive
that <hi>Armenia</hi> the Greater, and the Coutries thereabout
are meant by <hi>Havilah,</hi> and that the River <hi>Phasis</hi> in that
<hi>Armenia</hi> is the same with <hi>Moses'<hi>s</hi> Pison. Str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Bochart</hi> thinks it is <hi>Arabia</hi> it self. But (so far as
I can judg) there is no reason to recede from the old
Opinion of the Christian Writers, who hold that <hi>Havi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>
is <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Pison</hi> the River <hi>Ganges.</hi> This was
first asserted by<note n="1" place="bottom">Antiq. I. 1. c. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and from him <hi>Eusebius, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>

and most of the Fathers receiv'd it. And not
without good reason, for <hi>Moses</hi> here adds, as a Mark
to know the place by, that <hi>there is Gold, and the Gold
of that Land is good,</hi> ver. 11. Now it is confes'd by
all, that <hi>India</hi> is the most noted for <hi>Gold,</hi> and that of
the <hi>best</hi> sort. Further it is added, as a Note whereby to
discover that place, that <hi>there is Bdellium and the Onyx
Stone.</hi> There is some dispute about the former; some
hold it to be a Tree or a Resinous Gum, but most
think it a precious Stone or a Pearl: And this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
it being join'd with the <hi>Onyx Stone:</hi> And <hi>India</hi>
is famous for precious Stones and Pearls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The name of the second River</hi> is Gihon, vers. 13.
<hi>Galtruchius</hi> holds that the River <hi>Araxes</hi> in <hi>Armenia</hi> the
Greater is meant by <hi>Gihon;</hi> this as well as <hi>Phasis</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Mountain <hi>Payarde</hi> there. But <hi>Moses</hi>
adding in this Verse, that the River <hi>Gihon is the same
that compasseth the whole Land of</hi> Ethiopia, (or <hi>Cush,</hi> as
it is in the Original) there is reason to believe that this
<hi>Gihon</hi> is the River <hi>Nile,</hi> as the forenamed <hi>Iewish Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary,</hi>
and most of the antient Writers of the Church

therefore runs toward the East of it. This commonly
goeth along with <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and so it doth here; for

                     <p>These are the <hi>Rivers of Paradise</hi> mention'd by <hi>Moses,</hi>
of which that Noble Author of the <hi>History of the World</hi>
hath copiously discours'd, and those that are curious may
find satisfaction to their Scruples about this matter. We
are to think this (and it is a very rational thought) that
<hi>Paradise</hi> is now scarce to be found; because after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Changes, especially that made by the <hi>Deluge,</hi> which
marr'd the Figure of it, and wash'd away a great deal
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65397:25"/>
of its Beauty, it is exceedingly alter'd. Wherefore we
must not expect to find in Historians and Geographers
the same description of <hi>Paradise</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> gives.
<hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> will tell you, that <hi>Euphrates</hi> hath
not the same Channel it had in the Ages of old, it
hath several times been put out of its way. And if in
so long a time the course of Rivers be changed, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
may be alter'd as to other things. Besides, the
names of <hi>Pison</hi> and <hi>Gihon,</hi> two Branches of the River
of <hi>Paradise,</hi> are not very well known to us, because
they are not the Names that they are call'd by in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Authors; for 'tis common in <hi>Scripture</hi> to use the
names of Places (as well as of Men sometimes) which
are not used in other Writers. Or, this may be as truly
said, that some names of Rivers mention'd by <hi>Moses,</hi>
are long since lost and extinct (as the antient names of
several Countries are, which is acknowledg'd by all the
Learned. After so many Generations, and changings
of Languages, it is no wonder that they are not call'd
after the same manner that they once were. But we
cannot gather thence that they are not in being; we
cannot say (with a late<note n="1" place="bottom">

Rivers of</hi> Paradise <hi>two remain, but the other two do
not.</hi> But this may, and ought to be said, that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of the Primitive Names renders it difficult to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
the more particular place of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and to tell
exactly where it was. But from the Account given us in
<hi>Genesis,</hi> and by comparing all things together, there is
reason to assert that <hi>Paradise</hi> was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that noted

                     <p>For first <hi>Moses</hi> acquaints us, that <hi>God planted a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

gather that this Country was the place where <hi>Paradise</hi>
was seated. Next, no part of the whole Earth bids so
fair for the Seat of <hi>Paradise</hi> as that, for all the Antient
Historians agree in this, that that Region was the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santest
in the whole World, and that the Soil of it was
prodigiously fertile, and almost fruitful to a Miracle.
Moreover, <hi>Paradise</hi> was a place remarkable for its <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi>
and such is that Country represented by all to be,
and particularly it is famous for the great and noted Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Euphrates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if it shall be objected, that it is improbable <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>
was washed with all these four Rivers, <hi>viz. Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
Tigris, Ganges,</hi> and <hi>Nile;</hi> for then it must needs be
almost as large as a third part of half the Globe: Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as to <hi>Pison</hi> and <hi>Gihon,</hi> how can we hold that the
former is <hi>Ganges,</hi> and the latter <hi>Nile?</hi> for then we
must take in almost all <hi>Asia,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Africa</hi>
into Paradise. Therefore this Notion concerning the
<hi>Rivers of Paradise</hi> is very extravagant, and consequently
must not look for any reception.</p>
                     <p>I answer, 1. It is not so extravagant to make a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of half the Earth <hi>Paradisiacal,</hi> as to hold that it was
all of it so at first, which yet we find vouched of late.</p>
                     <p>But, 2. it is a gross mistake in the Objectors to
think, that what I have said enlarges <hi>Paradise</hi> to that
wideness which they mention; for when we speak of
the <hi>Rivers</hi> belonging to this place, this must be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
that the Heads and Springs of them are meant,
not the whole body and current of them. For you read
but of a <hi>River</hi> (Gen. 2. 10.) <hi>i. e.</hi> one <hi>River;</hi> but this
one River was <hi>parted</hi> (as you read in the same Verse)
into four Branches, or (if you will) into four Rivers,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65397:26"/>
                        <hi>viz. without</hi> Paradise, not <hi>within</hi> it. The <hi>one River</hi>
was <hi>in</hi> Paradise, and was serviceable to water it, whilst
these Arms and Branches of it spread themselves to a
vast distance, even on one hand to some Regions of
<hi>Africa,</hi> and further yet on the other hand to some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
parts of <hi>India.</hi> Here is nothing extravagant in
this Assertion, and consequently <hi>Nile</hi> and <hi>Ganges</hi> might,
and certainly did descend from the capital River of
<hi>Eden.</hi> The River <hi>Pison</hi> is said to <hi>compass the whole
Land of</hi> Havilah, and <hi>Gihon</hi> is said to <hi>compass the whole
Land of</hi> Ethiopia; that is, the Waters of these Springs
or Fountain-heads which had their rise in <hi>Paradise,</hi>
flow'd as far as <hi>Havilah</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia</hi> in
<hi>Africk,</hi> and encompass'd these places with their various
turnings and windings. <hi>Moses</hi> tells us what Regions
of the World these derivative Streams and Branches
(which in broad Channels made very considerable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers)
reach'd to: But we cannot conclude thence that
<hi>Paradise</hi> it self was extended so far. This, I think, is
very plain and intelligible, and no Man of sense can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it; and therefore there is no cause for that outcry
which is made against <hi>Ganges</hi> and <hi>Nile</hi>'s being two of
the Rivers mention'd in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. Notwithstanding what

have as much probability in it as any of the Modern
ones. And so any unprejudic'd Person will be inclin'd
to think, if he considers how likely a thing it is, that
the Fountains and Springs of Rivers are much alter'd
since the Creation of the World; and consequently what
these learned Men alledg concerning the rise and spring
of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> &amp;c. which they have met with in some
Authors, is to little purpose.</p>

                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65397:26"/>3. I will add this, that <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris</hi> were
the only Rivers that were proper to <hi>Eden</hi> or <hi>Paradise;</hi>
but the other two are mention'd, because they wash'd
those Regions which appertain'd to and border'd upon
that blessed Ground called <hi>Paradise. Paradise</hi> strictly
taken was not so wide and spacious; but all the whole
Country lying about that particular Ground, is in a large
sense termed <hi>Paradise.</hi> We may observe it is said, <hi>God
planted a Garden in</hi> Eden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 8. not that the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
was as large as <hi>Eden,</hi> but rather it is evident from
these words that <hi>Eden,</hi> was that Region of the Earth in
part of which God planted a <hi>Garden;</hi> which was not,
and indeed could not be so large as the place he planted
it in. Yet without doubt it was of a very considerable
length and breadth; the circumference of it was large
and specious, and therefore Rivers, or Arms of Rivers
at a great distance might belong to it. In short, the
Soil thereabouts was in some measure <hi>Paradisiacal;</hi> but
this one part of it was more eminently so, and in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
sense might be call'd <hi>Paradise,</hi> and the <hi>Garden of
Eden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I hope I have given a full Answer to what was
objected, and thereby made it very clear and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that <hi>Paradise</hi> was planted in that Region which
was afterward call'd <hi>Eden,</hi> and that <hi>Babylon</hi> (even that
which was <hi>cursed Babylon</hi> afterwards) was the Seat of
that blessed Ground. And tho what <hi>Tertullian</hi> and

Gregory de Valentiâ, Bellarmine, Del Rio,</hi> and others)
have held, <hi>viz.</hi> that this happy place is not known to
Mortals, may be thus far true, that we are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the individual Spot of Ground where
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were placed in their Innocence: yet if
these Persons aforemention'd meant what they said in a
more general sense, their Opinion is false and groundless,
for it is evident from the premises that <hi>Paradise</hi> was in
the <hi>eastern</hi> part of the Continent of <hi>Asia;</hi> that it was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65397:27"/>
that part of <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> which was wash'd with <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris</hi>
and <hi>Euphrates;</hi> that it was a kind of an <hi>Island</hi>
made so by these and other Rivers that encompass it; and
particularly that <hi>Babylon</hi> (now a known place in <hi>Turky</hi>)
was afterward the name of the Country, that pleasant
and delightful Country where the Garden of <hi>Paradise</hi>
was situated. Here it was that our first Parents were
seated by the particular appointment of God. In this
happy Region of the World, in this blessed Island they
were to spend their days.</p>
                     <p>But what were they to do here? What manner of
Life were they to lead? What Laws were they govern'd
by? This we are next to consider, and it is necessary to
do so, in order to our being acquainted with the nature
of this <hi>first Dispensation.</hi> God who had given <hi>Adam</hi>
the whole Earth, and all that was in it to possess and
enjoy, yet assign'd him this lesser portion of Ground to
inhabit in, and to cultivate: and he would not suffer
him to be idle and unimploy'd in that happy state of
Innocence, but set him <hi>to dress and keep</hi> that choice
piece of Earth, <hi>Gen. 2. 15.</hi> which would want his
care, because it was so luxuriant. Here he was to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
his Mind, as well as exercise his Body: here he
was to enjoy God, Himself, and the whole World:
Here he was to contemplate and study God's Works;
to submit himself wholly to the Divine Conduct; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
all his Actions to the Will of his Maker, and to live
in a constant dependence upon him: Here he was to spend
his days in the continual exercises of Prayers and Praises:
and it may be the very natural dictates of Gratitude
would prompt him to offer up some of the Fruits of the
Ground, and some living Creatures in way of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
unto God. There were thousands of Objects to
exercise his Wit and Understanding, to call forth his
Reason, and to employ it. But the <hi>ultimate perfection</hi>
of his Life, without doubt, was to consist in the Union
of his Soul with the <hi>chief Good,</hi> the infinite and eternal
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65397:27"/>
Being, for it is this alone which constitutes the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Man. His Mind being of a spiritual Nature,
could find no satisfaction but in an Object that was of
that kind; for a spiritual and intellectual Being must be
entertain'd by its like. But the chief happiness ought
to be something that is above us, and far exceeds us in
excellency; for the Capacities of the Mind cannot be
happy in any thing that is of an inferior nature to them.
And the chief Good must be of infinite perfection, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the vast and capacious Faculties of the Soul
cannot be satisfied. Hence it follows that <hi>God</hi> alone
was his supreme Blessedness, which he was entirely to
possess and enjoy by such a <hi>knowledg</hi> as was perfective
of his Understanding, and by such vehement and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

in the chief Good, it cannot be known, desired, loved,
or enjoy'd too much. This was the designed Felicity
of our first Parents. Neither they nor their whole
Race were to be liable to sorrow or misery of any kind,
but to be possessed of a constant and never-failing Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
and after innumerable Ages and Successions,
they were in their courses to be taken up to a heavenly
<hi>Paradise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Oeconomy <hi>Adam</hi> had two sorts of <hi>Laws</hi> to
conduct him, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The <hi>natural Law</hi> of Goodness
and Righteousness in his own Breast. The Light of
Reason was his Guide; and this shone very bright at
that time: He had true conceptions of things, he had
clear apprehensions of what was Good and Right,
Just and Holy. He had a perfect knowledg of his
Duty from this Law which God had implanted in his
Nature. 2. Besides this natural or moral Law, <hi>Adam</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65397:28"/>
receiv'd <hi>positive Laws</hi> from God in this state of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence;
and they were these three.</p>
                     <p>1. There was <hi>the Law of Matrimony.</hi> That this
State of Life was instituted and appointed by God in
<hi>Paradise,</hi> is clear from what we read in <hi>Gen. 2. 24.</hi>
God having made the Woman, and brought her to the
Man, he pronounced the Law of Marriage in these
words, <hi>A Man shall leave his Father and his Mother,
and shall cleave unto his Wife, and they shall be one Flesh.</hi>
Here is the indissoluble Knot of Wedlock. But yet
this must be said, that tho the first instituting and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
of this State was from God, yet the Law of
Nature dictated something of it. For this teacheth that
two, and no more, agreeing to join in the Fellowship of
Marriage, should become one Flesh: the Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
discovers, that a conjugal Union cannot consist of a
Plurality. Thus far Matrimony, as 'tis the joining of
one Man to one Woman, is a branch of the natural
Law. But, as I have shew'd in another place, a Law may
be partly <hi>natural,</hi> and partly <hi>positive;</hi> and so is this.
It was <hi>positive,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> himself directed our first
Parents to this State of Matrimony. But then Reason
approving of the natural Equity of it, it may be said
to be a Law of Nature.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Masters reckon that an <hi>absolute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi>
Gen. 1. 28. <hi>Be fruitful and multiply;</hi> and they
look upon it as the first and the chiefest of all, as out of
several of their own Writers, and out of<note n="1" place="bottom">Synag. Jud. p. 408.</note> 
                        <hi>Buxtorf</hi> is
evident. But others esteem it rather a <hi>Benediction,</hi>
wherein God approves of the propagation of Mankind,
as he doth also of other Creatures, <hi>ver. 22.</hi> Yet this
we may grant, that those words had the force of a
<hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> as well as a Benediction, with respect
to our first Parents; they had the full force of a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65397:28"/>
to those two individual Persons <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve,</hi> and indispensably obliged them, because it was intended
by God that Mankind should be increas'd and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
by those two particular Persons. But they are
words of <hi>Approbation</hi> to all others afterwards; that is,
they signify the lawfulness, tho not the necessity of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
and Generation.</p>
                     <p>3. There was a <hi>positive Law</hi> given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his
Integrity concerning the <hi>keeping of the Sabbath,</hi> or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Seventh Day. <hi>God blessed the Seventh Day,
and sanctified it,</hi> Gen. 2. 3. <hi>i. e.</hi> he assign'd it for some
special purpose; he separated it from the other Days;
he dedicated it more especially to Divine Worship: he
set it apart to be the Feast of the World's Nativity; to
call to mind the Works of the Creation; to magnify
the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God in the fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Universe; to extol his Providence in the
World. In short, this Day was devoted to holy Uses,
and the more solemn Service of God: This is <hi>blessing</hi>
and <hi>sanctifying</hi> of that Day. Indeed we read not that
<hi>Adam</hi> kept this Day after this manner; nor is it said
that any of the old <hi>Patriarchs</hi> did: But we know that
many things were done which are not recorded. <hi>Moses</hi>
omits several Matters of Fact, (and he intending bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
in his History, must needs do so) but we may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them by our own collective Reason. Thus in the
present case we find it expresly recorded, that God <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and sanctified the Seventh Day;</hi> here he <hi>instituted</hi>
the celebration of it. We need not then question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Adam,</hi> and the righteous Men that succeeded him,
practis'd according to this divine Institution. But if any
shall question it, I prove it thus.</p>
                     <p>First, There was no imaginable reason why this Day
should not be celebrated presently after it was instituted.
What was it sanctified and set apart for if not for this,
to be observ'd? And can you conceive any thing that
hindred this? No certainly. Therefore seeing it was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65397:29"/>
instituted, we may conclude it was kept, that is, that it
was so from the Creation of the World. If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency lived free from Toil and
Labour, and therfore the cessation on the Seventh Day was
not necessary or proper for him: I answer, It is true, he
was not subject to hard and uneasy labour, and such as
was accompanied with fatigue; but it is as true, that he
was bid to <hi>dress and keep the Garden,</hi> and consequently
he was not unimploy'd; he had ordinarily some bodily
Work to do, and to think of: But there was a certain
time set him by God's particular appointment, on which
he was to cease from this or any other worldly and
corporeal Business, that he might devote himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Worship of God. This was the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day
which he was to keep, and there is no reason to think
he did not keep it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This appears from the reason of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
and setting apart this Day. <hi>His</hi> ceasing from
his Works of the Creation on this Day was the ground
of it: And what did that infer, but <hi>Man</hi>'s cessation
from working on that Day? <hi>Gen. 2. 2, 3.</hi> And can
we think that God would not require this at his hand?
Can we think that he would not take care to see this
Rest from all labour observ'd? Can we think that <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve,</hi> the last Piece of the Divine Work, did not call
their Creation and Formation to remembrance, and
praise God for that as well as for his wonderful making
of the World? Can we reasonably and on good grounds
imagine any of these things, when the very <hi>Sabbath</hi> was
instituted on purpose to perpetuate the memory of the
Creation? May we not rather say that it is expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
that <hi>God blessed the Seventh Day</hi> before <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Fall, to intimate to us what <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were to do
the next day after their Formation, <hi>viz.</hi> to sanctify
that Day in a solemn commemoration of the Divine
Goodness to them?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:65397:29"/>Thirdly, There are several passages in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whence we may gather the early observation of
the <hi>Seventh Day.</hi> The keeping of it seems to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 10. where we find that <hi>Noah</hi> divides
the Time by <hi>Weeks,</hi> or <hi>seven Days:</hi> And so he doth
again, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Which being repeated, seems to tell
us that the <hi>Seventh</hi> Day was then observed in a religious
way by <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark; who questionless had it
from <hi>Adam,</hi> who receiv'd it from God, who instituted
it to be a Commemoration of the Birth-day of the
World, of the Divine Blessings that accompanied the
Creation. It is not improbably conjectur'd by a
<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Lightfoot <hi>on</hi> Job, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.</note> Learned Writer, that <hi>the Day when the Sons of God</hi>
(i. e. <hi>Iob</hi>'s Sons and other Holy Men, who are rightly
call'd <hi>God's Sons or Children) came to present themselves
before the Lord</hi> (Job 1. 6. &amp; 2. 1.) was the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
Day, the Day when the Professors of Religion met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the publick Assemblies; for even in the Land
of <hi>Vz</hi> they kept this solemn Day, they living near the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> who had it deriv'd to them from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Further, I desire it may be observ'd that there is
express mention of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day before the <hi>Law</hi> was
deliver'd on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> To morrow is the rest of the
holy Sabbath unto the Lord, Faith <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 16. 23.
And when that Day was come, he thus speaks to them,
<hi>To Day is a Sabbath unto the Lord,</hi> ver. 25. And it is
plain, that it is meant of the <hi>Seventh day Sabbath,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Day before was <hi>the sixth day,</hi> as you read in
the foregoing Verse; but more expresly in <hi>ver.</hi> 26.
there is mention of <hi>the Seventh Day which is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi>
It appears then that this Day was kept before
the Decalogue was given, and was antienter than the
Laws of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65397:30"/>And indeed the Fourth Commandment which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
the keeping holy the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day, seems to hint
no less to us; for when the <hi>Israelites</hi> are bid to <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
to do this, there is intimated to us in this manner
of expression, that it was kept holy before, for <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>
hath regard to things past, and so <hi>forgetting</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
what hath been heretofore. It might be observ'd
also that it is call'd in this Commandment <hi>Ha Sabbath,</hi>
the Sabbath, or <hi>that Sabbath</hi> which I have enjoin'd you
before to keep: The Article here seems to imply so
much. But however, from what hath been said it is
manifest that there was a day of Rest, a keeping of a
<hi>Sabbath</hi> observ'd before the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And if
before it, then it was by virtue of this Primitive Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
which I am now speaking of, and consequently
the celebrating of this Day was from the beginning of
the World. In <hi>Paradise</hi> was given the Law of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Seventh Day as a Day of Rest and holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
as some of the<note n="1" place="bottom">Epiphan. Haeres. 51. Theodoret. Quaest. 21. in Gen.</note> ancient Writers of the Christian
Church, who search'd into this matter further than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
have freely acknowledged. And therefore those
words, <hi>Gen. 2. 3. God blessed the seventh Day,</hi> are
not <hi>proleptick</hi> as some groundlesly imagine, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us that that Day was then instituted, and was to
be observ'd from that very time, that they might be
settled in the Truth of God's creating the World, and
not (like Pagans) think it to have been from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
This then must go along with the succeeding Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There was a <hi>positive Law</hi> given to <hi>Adam</hi> of
<hi>abstaining from the Fruit of a certain Tree in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of</hi> Eden. We must know then, that in <hi>Paradise</hi>
were divers sorts of Trees, but two of them were of
more especial not than the rest. The first was the <hi>Tree
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65397:30"/>
of Life;</hi> which was called so, because it was appointed
by God to signify, that if our first Parents did obey
God's Command, they should live for ever. It was
design'd to be a Sacrament of that Immortality which
Man should have had if he had retain'd his Innocence.
This is clear from what is said in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22.—<hi>lest he
take of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live for ever.</hi>
This Text proves (against the Socinians) that our first
Parents should not have died if they had not transgressed
the Divine Law; and it proves that the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> was
give them on purpose to perpetuate their lives. The eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Fruit of that Tree would have been a means
to have kept them from dying, and to have made them
immortal. Yea, this Tree was a Symbol of all <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,</hi>
as <hi>Life</hi> is taken in that sense very frequently.
Wisdom is said to be <hi>a Tree of Life to those that lay hold
on her,</hi> Prov. 3. 18. Which is thus explain'd in the
next Verse, <hi>Happy is every one that retaineth her.</hi> As
often then as our first Parents had eaten of the <hi>Tree of
Life,</hi> they were to be reminded by it, that all manner
of Bliss and Happiness was to be entail'd upon them
and their Posterity, if they continued in their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and broke not the Command of God. As long
as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed on this Tree, they should be void of old Age,
Sickness, Pains, Cares, and all troubles of Body and
Mind, till at last they should have been translated from
the earthly <hi>Paradise</hi> to those compleat and eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Bliss at God's right hand. So that it was a
Type of enternal Life and Bliss, and a Sign and Seal of
these to them if they had not apostatiz'd. How long a
time this particular course of preserving Health and Life
should have continued, if Mankind (supposing in a
state of Innocence) had increas'd, or whether other
Trees of the same nature should have been produced in
other Regions of the Earth, or whether there should
have been some other way of keeping Mens Bodies
from decay, I am not able to determine, nor need we
concern our selves about it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65397:31"/>The other Tree in the Garden which was of more
note than the rest, was <hi>the Tree of Knowledg of Good
and Evil.</hi> And they were strictly forbidden by God to
eat of This, they were by no means to taste any part of
it. It was call'd <hi>the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil,</hi>
because it was to try <hi>Adam</hi> whether he would do <hi>well</hi>
or <hi>ill;</hi> or because the observing of that Prohibition was
to be follow'd with the perfect enjoyment of <hi>Good,</hi>
and the violating of it with the experience of all <hi>Evil</hi>
of Sin and Punishment. It was to signify what they
should <hi>know</hi> by eating, <hi>viz.</hi> the difference between the
Evil of Disobedience, and the God of the contrary.
Or thus, it was the Tree of <hi>Knowledg of Good and
Evil,</hi> i. e. of the Good they had before, and of the
Evil which was to ensue upon eating. They should
experimentally find what Good they lost, and what Evil
they fell into. So that it is probable this Tree had its
name from the Event and Effect of it. It taught them
by experience what Good and Evil was; for after Man
had sinn'd in eating that forbidden Fruit, he saw and
felt what Happiness he had lost, and what Misery he
had procured.</p>
                     <p>Some have been so curious as to enquire, and so bold
as to determine what <hi>particular Tree and Fruit</hi> this
was. It was and <hi>Apple-tree,</hi> say some, and they would
make it probable from <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 5. It was the <hi>Vine,</hi>
saith <hi>Vossius.</hi> It was the <hi>Indian Fig-tree,</hi> saith <hi>Goropius
Becanus.</hi> Most say it was a <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> with the Leaves
of which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> covered their nakedness as
soon as they had eaten of the Fruit.<note n="1" place="bottom">

                     <p>The grand thing which we are to mind (and which
is the principal thing in this <hi>first Oeconomy</hi>) is this,
that it was God's pleasure that the Fruit of that Tree
(whatever it was) should not be meddled with, and
therefore straitly charged <hi>Adam</hi> and his Consort, that
they should not dare to touch it. God might reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
act after this manner: For first (as an antient
Writer saith on this Subject)<note n="2" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <q>God dispenseth all
things sutably to the particular Time, and measur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Institutions by the Abilities and Powers of
Men. Therefore he gave that Command of not
eating of this Tree to <hi>Adam,</hi> as it were to a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Babe.</q> He dealt with our first Parents as with
Infants and Children; he tried them by mean and low
things, as most agreeable to their nature. But second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
tho he was thus pleased to prohibit them the Fruit
of one single Tree, yet this was highly accountable if
you consider that God gave them the use of all the rest
of the Trees in <hi>Paradise. Of every Tree in the Garden
thou mayest freely eat,</hi> Gen. 2. 16. there was only this
one Tree excepted and reserved. Here was Liberty and
Indulgence sufficient. And they might well have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
themselves in the injoyment of it. Besides, the
Creator can lay what Restraints he pleaseth on his
Creatures. He that made both them and the Garden,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65397:32"/>
could justly bar them of any thing which that place
afforded. Therefore God gave them this Precept to
shew his Dominion over them, as he was their Maker
and Lord.<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Chrysost. Hom. 16. in Gen.</note> He would let them see by this little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his absolute Soverainty over them, as a pious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speaks.</p>
                     <p>Again, God having made them reasonable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
them with a power or freedom of choice, he
might justly exercise that Faculty, and put them to an
actual trial of it: which could not be done but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
something to their choice. As they had a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Nature and free Will given them by God, they were
able to keep that Law of Abstinence; and therefore it
was not unjust in God, yea it was just and fit to impose
this upon them as they were free and reasonable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
This shews the reason of this positive Law which
was given them to try their Obedience. Likewise, it
was very reasonable and equitable Command, that
seeing God had con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>err'd on them so many Benefits and
Blessings, they should be limited as to a single one,
that thereby they might shew their Thankfulness to
God for all the rest. In the next place, consider also
that God particularly told them what he expected from
them, when he gave them a Prohibition about the
Tree. He assured them, that if they ventured to eat
of it, it should cost them their Lives, or, more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically
in the Original, they should <hi>die the death.</hi>
Here was fair warning, and they had time to consider
of it; and they were sensible how greatly they were
obliged to God, and how just and reasonable a thing it
was to observe his <hi>first</hi> and <hi>original</hi> Law, (that which was
<note n="2" place="bottom">Advers. Jud. cap. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>matrix omnium praeceptorum,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls it)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65397:32"/>
yea, to obey God in whatsoever he commanded.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, To the <hi>revealed Laws</hi> under the State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
we must refer the <hi>Covenant of Works:</hi> For we
may gather from the Sacred Writings, that there was a
mutual Agreement or federal Compact between God
and our first Parents, wherein he promis'd to them E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life and Happiness, on condition of their perfect
Obedience to his Laws; and on the contrary, Death
was threatned if they disobey'd, as we have heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
It is true, it is not expresly call'd a <hi>Covenant</hi> in
<hi>Genesis;</hi> but it was one, for God gave Man a Law, and
back'd it with Threatnings and Promises, and Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
and consented to it, which is the formal nature of
a <hi>Covenant.</hi> Not are we to think that those two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and no more, were under <hi>this Dispensation.</hi> Altho
only <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were in actual being at that time,
yet all Mankind were included in them, and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them, and therefore are to be reckon'd as under
that Dispensation. For God having created our first
Parents without Sin, and with knowledg of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and strength to do it, he made a Covenant or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with them, not only in behalf of themselves,
but of all their Posterity. It was covenanted, that if
they and their Race continued in Obedience, they should
never die, but be always blessed and happy; but if they
disobey'd the Divine Command, they should be subject
to Death, and be every way wretched and miserable.
It is certain they consented and agreed to this; for in
that State of Integrity, what God propounded to them
could not but be acceptable. God would offer that
which was just and equitable, as he was God: Our
first Parents would not disagree to it, as they were
indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d with a perfect understanding, and knew that
what their Maker propounded was most reasonable.
They could not but approve of the Condition on their
part, <hi>viz.</hi> Obedience; and they could not but accept of
the Reward promis'd on God's part, <hi>viz.</hi> endless Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65397:33"/>
That they fully consented to the Contract, in
the name of themselves and their Posterity, is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable
from many passages in Holy Writ, as that <hi>Hos.</hi>
6. 7. <hi>They like</hi> Adam (for so it is the Hebrew) <hi>have
transgress'd the Covenant;</hi> which refers to God's <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
with Mankind in the beginning of the World,
when <hi>Adam</hi> was their Representative: And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that he could not transgress it unless he had first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to it. And this is abundantly clear from the
<hi>Epistles</hi> of St. <hi>Paul.,</hi> which frequently have reference to
this very thing. And the Truth of this may be too
manifestly gather'd from the miserable Effects and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of it which we now experience. This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
then, and this Dispensation to which it belongs,
extend to all Mankind. As being in <hi>Adam</hi> they were all
indued with the Divine Image, they were all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
of Life and Happiness; and might have so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
unless they had in him fallen from their Primitive
Integrity.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto <hi>Man was in honour,</hi> Psal. 49. 12. being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in God's Image he was placed in <hi>Paradise,</hi> he was
possess'd of all manner of Felicity; and he might have
perpetuated it to himself and his Posterity. This is the

like the Beasts.</hi> The first represents his Sin and
Fall, the second the Effects of it: So here are both his
Fault and his Penalty. As among Philosophers there
is <hi>Physiology,</hi> which is the considering of Bodies in
their natural Temper, and there is <hi>Pathology,</hi> which is
the consideration of Man's Body, as fallen into a state
of Disease; so in <hi>Divinity</hi> we distinctly treat of these
two, the State of <hi>Innocence</hi> (the primitive temper of
Mankind) and the State of <hi>Corruption,</hi> (which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy
from that first Temper and Constitution.) <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> imagines this Earth of ours to have been once a
glorious Sun, but afterward to have sunk into another
<hi>Vortex,</hi> and to be overcast with Spots and Scum, and
so to move slowly, and to be what it now is. It is
certain that Man, the best Creature on Earth, was once
a bright and glorious Being, and moved in a high
Sphere, and cast a most ravishing Light: He had the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God, and the Characters of Divine Wisdom
impress'd upon him: but he soon lost his Primitive Light
and Lustre, he forsook his Station, and was absorp'd
into darkness, and overspread with Sin and Misery.</p>
                     <p>I begin first with <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Sin:</hi> and here I must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into these two things; 1. What this Sin was?
2. Who were the Instruments of it? As to the Sin it
self, it was no other than this; Whereas God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
our first Parents, that they should not eat of
the Fruit of the <hi>Tree of Good and Evil,</hi> they wilfully
despised that Command, and took of the forbidden
Fruit, and did eat of it. This was the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve,</hi> and the first Sin that ever was in the World.
But this I must insert, that there were many undue In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
and vitious Dispositions in their Souls, which
made way for this actual and external Transgression,
and may be said to be parts and ingredients of this Sin,
and which are also great Aggravations of their Crime.</p>
                     <p>1. Man being in Honour <hi>understood not,</hi> which may
signify that ignorance and senslesness which they had
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65397:34"/>
contracted by <hi>non-attention.</hi> They <hi>consider'd not</hi> what
Honour and Dignity they had, and so discerned not
what was their proper Duty in that State. <hi>Incogitancy</hi>
was the first rise and occasion of the Fall of our first
Parents, saith the profound Dr. <hi>Iackson,</hi> and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rightly. And before him St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
in the like manner; for he holds that <hi>Negligence</hi>
was the first Fault: they grew heedless and careless, not
reflecting on their state and circumstances, not duly
thinking what they were, and what they ought to do:
thence arose their transgression.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Sensuality</hi> was the previous cause of the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy.
The sight of the Fruit excited the Woman's
Appetite. <hi>When she saw the Tree was good for Food,
and that it was pleasant to the Eyes, she took of the
Fruit thereof, and did eat,</hi> Gen. 3. 6. And she might
easily prevail with her Husband to do so too, whilst he
perhaps was as much taken with her Beauty, as she was
with that of the Fruit. There have been several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
about the rise of the first Transgression (and I
am now presenting the Reader with them) but if I
should say that <hi>Lust,</hi> among other Incentives, was the
first spring of it, I think no considerate Man can disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
what I propound. For tho the new-married couple
were created without any tincture of sinful Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
yet God had planted in them those natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
which were proper and sutable to the Conjugal
State. Tho these were unpolluted and void of all Vice,
yet God had placed the Possessors of them in such a
mutable State, and had endued them with such Powers
and Faculties, both of Soul and Body, that they might
make use of them to good or evil, as they pleas'd.
And accordingly they enclined to the latter, and turn'd
the concupiscible part into that which was evil and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and so their innocent Propensions to one another
were chang'd into lustful Amours; and their mutual
desires and complacencies, occasion'd by the force of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65397:35"/>
each others Beauty, became instrumental to that Sin which
we are treating of. With <hi>Adam</hi> more especially this
had a great sway, for his Wise was a very fair and lovely
Creature; and it is probable that he look'd on her more
than on the <hi>Fruit.</hi> This was not so fair as she that
handed it to him; and therefore he was more in love
with her than with that, because he saw a brightness in
that Face which was more charming than what the <hi>Tree</hi>
afforded. But yet he had a love to this for the sake of
the other; and thereupon the uxorious Man (after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
fits of reluctancy, we may suppose) resolv'd to
gratify his Spouse; being beguil'd by her Beauty, and by
that amorous propension which it had produc'd in him,
he could deny her nothing: Or, to speak in more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
terms, his entire love and affection to her prevail'd
with him to do as <hi>she</hi> did, <hi>i. e.</hi> to violate the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
because she did so. Which we may gather
from those words of his, <hi>Gen. 3. 12. The Woman whom
thou gavest to be with me,</hi> (and to be my other-self)
<hi>she gave me of the Tree, and I did eat:</hi> For tho he did
ill in laying his Fault, and transferring his Guilt on the
Woman, thereby only to excuse himself; yet thus far
we may believe him, that he was drawn into this trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
by her whom God had given unto him. His
passionate regard to her betray'd him to this folly. Thus
this <hi>desire of his Eyes</hi> was one occasion of his misery.
By the Inchantments and Sollicitations of a Woman,
Man was first ruin'd. Whilst he was alone he did well,
but when he saw so fair and Image he was tempted to fall
down to it, and to comply with it, and to forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and his duty. This was the Origine of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
prevarication; the sensitive part was too powerful. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
betray'd him, and ever since all Mankind: the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
and sensual Life gets the better of the Divine.</p>
                     <p>3. Another previous Sin of our first Parents was, a
being dissatisfied with their condition, and an ambitious
desiring to know more, and to become greater. It was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65397:35"/>
a vile compound of Curiosity, Discontent and Pride:
yea, this latter seems to have the predominancy; whence
it was the determination of<note n="1" place="bottom">Chrysost. Hom. 65. in Matth.</note> one of the Antient Fathers,
that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>'s first Sin by which they fell was
<hi>Pride.</hi> The Devil inve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gled them with telling them,
that <hi>their Eyes should be opened,</hi> and that <hi>they should
know Good and Evil;</hi> nay, that <hi>they should be as
Gods</hi> in knowledg and perfection, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. This
was no mean incentive to the breach of the Divine
Law; tho indeed it was a strange solecism and absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
(and it is an strange that our first Parents should
not observe it) <hi>viz.</hi> that they should be like God by
breaking his Law. This was an arrant piece of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and yet it was swallowed, the vehement desire of
seeing having blinded them, their inordinate longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Wisdom rendring them so foolish and sottish. Their
affection of Knowledg, and their vain Ambition, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
them. Their desire to arrive to the Partners with
God Almighty, made them forget they were his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Their wishing to be <hi>Gods,</hi> made them become
like <hi>Beasts which perish</hi> (as you shall hear afterwards):
Yea, their desire to be like Gods, made them too like
unto Devils.</p>
                     <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Sin which made way for their actual violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God's Command was <hi>Vnbelief.</hi> God had himself
told him, that <hi>in the day they eat of the forbidden
Fruit, they should surely die,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. But Satan comes
and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ronts this, and tells them, <hi>Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> shall not surely
die,</hi> Gen. 3. 4. Whereupon they give credit to this
Tempter, and disbelieve what God had said. They at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to the Divine Threatnings, but listen to the
Devil's Promises of Impunity. They believe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Lies, but what the God of Truth saith is none
of their Creed. This was the cursed <hi>Infidelity</hi> which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65397:36"/>
was the forerunner of the actual breaking of the Divine
Command.</p>
                     <p>Thus you may be convinc'd, that tho the eating the
forbidden Fruit may at first sight seem to be a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a kind of venial Fault, (and some vain Men have
labour'd to represent it as such) yet upon a particular and
narrow view of it, and by reason of the Circumstances
that attend it, it was a most grievous and horrid Crime.
That Sin which was usher'd in with so <hi>many</hi> vile Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers,
must needs be a capital Offence. Besides, the
greatness of the Transgression must be esteem'd and
measur'd by the Authority of the Lawgiver; we must
consider not so much <hi>what</hi> was forbid, as <hi>who</hi> forbad it.
<hi>God,</hi> their Creator and Father, who had absolute
Power and Command over them; <hi>God,</hi> who knew
best how to govern them, and what was most for their
real Good and Advantage; God, who required the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
but of a small and easy thing, ought to have
been obey'd with all exactness. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had
no Father but <hi>God;</hi> how just and reasonable then was
it, that they should express all Duty and Obedience to
him; that they should observe his Laws, and not dare
to break the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>east Command of his; that they should do
nothing without his order, and never listen to any that
would attempt to withdraw them from their duty; but
that they should continually live in a sense of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
upon him; that they should call upon
him, trust in him, honour and worship him only;
that they should strive to walk worthy of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Favours they had receiv'd from him, and that
they should endeavor to persevere in their Innocence and
Integrity, and to continue in that blessed State wherein
God had created them?</p>
                     <p>And as for the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Sin, the letter and
lighter it is, the greater is the Sinner's contempt of God.
This inhances his Fault, that he preferreth so slight a
thing before God's Will and Pleasure; that he regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65397:36"/>
not the Divine Anger, tho it be so easy to avoid it.
Here we may say, as <hi>Cicero</hi> doth in defence of the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> Paradox, (<hi>viz.</hi> that all Sins are alike)<note n="1" place="bottom">Parva, inqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, res est; atqui magna culpa.</note> 
                        <hi>The
Matter is small, but the Fault is great.</hi> Yea, I may
add, the latter is the greater because the former is so
small. The Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> was the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and inexcusable, because it was in so little a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as the bare tasting of the Fruit of a Tree. Which
was a thing they had no temptation to, if we consider
that the whole Garden of Fruit was before them, and
there was but one single Tree only forbidden them. But
it seems all the rest were insipid without this; no Tree
will so content them as the forbidden one. There was
no Fruit so desirable as this; and it is likely this had not
been desired if it had not been forbidden. This argues
great perversness and obstinacy, and consequently ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravateth
their Sin, and senders their Offence very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
                     <p>Say not then, the eating of the Fruit of a Tree is a
light and inconsiderable thing. So it might be said,
<hi>Lot</hi>'s Wise did only look back to see the miserable ruin
of the place she lived in. What! might she not look
behind her? It was out of pity that she did this. Did
this deserve so sore a Punishment? <hi>Abraham</hi>
                        <note n="2" place="bottom">Gen. 19. 28.</note> look'd
on <hi>Sod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not criminal in him to do so: Why then was it in this
poor Woman? The plain Answer is this, that there are
<hi>many</hi> things from whence Actions are denominated
Good or Evil. They are sometimes reputed so by God
according to the intrinsick Causes and Reasons of them,
sometimes also according to their good or evil Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts;
but at all times according to the Will and
Command of God, allowing or disallowing of such
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65397:37"/>
Actions. By these we must judg of <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife's Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
Out of an immoderate love of the City, which had
been the place of her abode, or from an inward cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Goods which she left behind her, or from a
foolish pitying of those whom God had design'd for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
she stood, and look'd back. Which Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of hers might have produced the like Passions in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
And if it had gone unpunish'd, a great contempt
of God's Providence would have been the effect. But
the chief thing which made her looking back to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> be
sinful was this, that it was a direct Affront to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, who had strictly charged them to fly,
and not to look back, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 15. 17. And he certainly
ought to have been obey'd, he that so graciously deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
them from the flames of <hi>Sodom,</hi> he that rescued
them thence out of his mere Mercy and Favour; he
that required observance in so easy a matter as this, he
surely was not to be repay'd with Disobedience; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he acted most justly when he severely punish'd it in
this stubborn Woman.</p>
                     <p>So in the Sin of our first Parents, we have shew'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the intrinsick Causes of it were very bad, and
the adjoining Circumstances might be prov'd to be as
evil and pernicious: but if we consider that it was a
wilful violating of the Divine Command (as it most
palpably was) it will appear to be yet more sinful and
vitious. It was no less than a set and voluntary chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Death and Misery, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>using of everlasting
Happiness. There can't be imagin'd a greater Sin than
this; nothing could speak them greater Rebels against
Heaven. For God designing that his new-made Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
by conforming to that Prohibition, should testify
their acknowledgment of him, and their subjection to
him; their acting contrary to it was a high instance of
Rebellion, and a downright disowning of God's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Authority. And tho indeed it was disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Divine Command in a lesser matter, yet
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65397:37"/>
even thence the baseness of the Action is more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
and the greater ingratitude and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aithfulness of
the Sinners are discovered. Thus you see what the Sin
of our first Parents was, you are acquainted with the
nature of their Offence.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I will in a few words speak of the <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(on a contrary extreme) think that it was a bright,

And from this place, and <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. 29. they gather that
these <hi>flying Serpents,</hi> that were very bright, and shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like Fire, were usual in the Eastern Countries.</p>
                     <p>I have found lately, that two excellent Persons, of
great Name and Esteem in our own Church, favour this
Opinion. But, with due respect and deference given first
to their Judgment, I make bold to offer these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why I dissent from them in this present matter:
1. We have no certain knowledg or account of the
<hi>Serpents</hi> spoken of in the forenamed Texts; only we
know that they were raging, fierce and venomous, and
thence it is likely they were call'd <hi>Seraphim, burning,</hi>
because by their venomous Sting they produced an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation</hi>
in that part of the Body which they stung.
And they might be said to <hi>flie,</hi> because of their swift
and impetuous motion, wherein they exceeded other
Serpents. 2. If I should grant that there were such
<hi>firy flying Serpents</hi> as these worthy Persons suppose, and
that they are spoken of in the foregoing places, yet it
seems not to me probable that <hi>Satan</hi> would make use of
such an affrighting Creature to deal with our Mother
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65397:38"/>
                        <hi>Eve.</hi> This sort of Animals, in my apprehension,
would sooner scare than entice her. Methinks his fierce
and furious motion should strike terror into her; his
flaming Wings should make her fly from him, not hold
discourse with him. Or at least, 3. this Spectacle was
too glittering and dazeling, so that she could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the brightness of it. I am apt to conceive that
such a sight was fitter to amaze than to tempt. 4. When
I find this <hi>Serpent</hi> reckon'd among <hi>the Beasts of the
Field,</hi> and that twice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1, 14. I must needs
say, I cannot easily be perswaded that it was of that
kind before named; it seems not to me to be a winged
Animal moving aloft in the <hi>Air.</hi> I do not well appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
I confess, how such a one can be numbred among
<hi>the Beasts of the Field, or Earth.</hi> Tho the Holy
Ghost in Scripture having barely told us that it was a
<hi>Serpent,</hi> it is most natural and genuine to conclude,
it was an <hi>ordinary Serpent,</hi> such as God had lately crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and such as among other Creatures lived on the
Soil of <hi>Paradise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now the Serpent was more subtil than any Beasts of the
Field which the Lord God had made,</hi> Gen. 3. 1. The
<hi>subtilty</hi> of the Serpent denoteth here to us the <hi>gentle,
familiar</hi> and <hi>insinuating</hi> nature of this Animal: For
the <hi>Author of the Iewish Antiquities</hi> observes, that this
Creature<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitat. l. 1. c. 2.</note> frequently convers'd, and in a familiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
associated with <hi>Adam</hi> and his Wife. And so an
<note n="2" place="bottom">Basil. Homil. de Paradiso.</note> Antient Father of the Church agrees with this <hi>Iewish</hi>
Writer, telling us, that the Serpent before the Fall was
mild and gentle, and more familiar with Man than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Creatures were, that he came to him often, and
was pleas'd with his Society, that he did not creep on
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65397:39"/>
the ground, but went on his feet. But the same Author
goes too far when he intimates, that he was of an <hi>erect</hi>
Figure, for that is proper only to Man. It is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the Serpent did not then grovel and creep on
the Earth as he now doth, (for this was the <hi>Curse</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against him after the Fall) but he was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
lifted up from the ground by feet, (tho perhaps
they were very short) for you find in the forenamed
place, that he is sorted with the <hi>Beasts of the Field,</hi>
which are distinguish'd in kind from <hi>creeping things,</hi>
Gen. 1. 25. Another<note n="1" place="bottom">Damascen. de Orthod. fid. l. 2. c. 10.</note> Ecclesiastical Writer agrees with
the former Author, that the <hi>Serpent</hi> was more sociable
and conversant with our first Parents than all the other
Creatures were; that he often approach'd to them, and
insinuated himself into them with the gentle motions
of his Body. I do not think, with <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that the
Serpent (and all other Beasts) naturally spoke in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,</hi>
(a Dream which <hi>Basil</hi> also assents to); but this
I am ascertain'd of from the inspired Records of <hi>Moses,</hi>
that the Devil spoke by the Serpent, or (which is all
one) that the Serpent possessed by the Devil spoke to
<hi>Eve.</hi> So we read afterwards that an Ass by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
impulse spake to <hi>Balaam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And since that time, several Histories mention the
speaking of irrational Animals, yea of inanimate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
Thus a River spoke to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and saluted
him as he passed by it, if we may believe <hi>Porphyrius</hi> in
his Life. A Tree spoke to <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> saith
<hi>Philostratus.</hi> This was the effect of Magick, both
those Persons being skill'd in that Art. It will be
granted then, that the <hi>Devil</hi> is able to do what his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
and Ministers can effect; thus here, the <hi>Serpent</hi>
spake to <hi>Eve</hi> by the motion of <hi>Satan</hi> actuating his
Body: The Devil moved his Tongue, and inabled him
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65397:39"/>
to hold a Discourse with the Woman. And now if
you consider that he was by his Nature and Make of a
graceful Hew and Figure, and that he was made by God
a subtil and insinuating Creature, you will not deny that
he was fit to be made use of by Satan to intice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigle
the Woman. Wherefore the<note n="1" place="bottom">Archaeol. Philos. cap. 7.</note> bold Man that
laughs at this part of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> History concerning
the <hi>Serpent</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> talking together, and in effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
it as a mere Fiction, hath as little Reason as
Religion on his side. It is certainly agreeable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that the Devil would tempt and seduce her by
making use of some <hi>familiar</hi> and <hi>domestick Creature,</hi>
if he used any at all. The Fox was cunning and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but the Serpent was the most gentle and tractable of
all; this was his <hi>proper subtilty.</hi> It is probable that
this Creature was beloved both by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve:</hi> She
especially was delighted with it, and used to play and
sport with it; she laid it perhaps in her Bosom, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
her Neck with its twistings and windings; or
she made it a Bracelet for her Arms.</p>
                     <p>This is certain, that the <hi>enmity</hi> between the <hi>Serpent</hi>
and <hi>Mankind</hi> was not till after Man's Fall, as appears
from <hi>Gen. 3. 15. I will put Enmity between thee and the
Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed.</hi> There
could not be an <hi>Enmity</hi> put between them, unless there
had been a <hi>Friendship</hi> before. Or, if the Serpent used
before to ensnare or hurt Mankind, and to shew himself
an Enemy, why is it denounced by God as a Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Curse, that he will <hi>put Enmity between them?</hi>
It is evident then, that the Serpent was some goodly
lovely Creature, and would needs make himself accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Woman: And in this Masquerade the Devil
soon got the better of her, perswading her that if she did
eat of the prohibited Fruit, she should be so far from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65397:40"/>
receiving any harm and damage, that she should thereby
mend her condition, and be some Goddess rather than
a Woman. She was caught with these fond and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Suggestions, and slighted the Divine Injunction,
and boldly ventured on the forbidden Dainties. The
subtil Ingineer planted his Artillery against the weakest
part of the Fort: he began his Batteries against the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sex first, Alas! a silly Woman, and a subtil Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
acted by the Devil, were not Matches. And as
this latter tempted <hi>Eve</hi> by a Serpent, so he tempted
Man by <hi>Eve,</hi> who was gentle and alluring, familiar and
insinuating, and not easily to be repulsed. The weak
Woman must needs fall, being sollicited both by <hi>Satan</hi>
and the <hi>Serpent:</hi> The poor Man could not but fall who
had a triple temptation, that of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
and the <hi>Woman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus both Man and Woman fell, and that in a short
time after they were created. <hi>Man being in honour,</hi>
                        <note n="1" place="bottom">Psal. 49. 12. Non pernoctabit. Pagnin.</note> 
                        <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth
not.</hi> He stood not one night (say some) in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
but apostatized in the close of the same day in
which he was made; and in the very same day he was
cast out of <hi>Paradise.</hi> So the <hi>Iews</hi> generally, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Christian Fathers</hi> assert. <hi>Luther</hi> is very
punctual:<note n="2" place="bottom">Colloq. Mensal.</note> 
                        <q>Our first Parents entred (saith he) into
the Garden at Noon-day; and the Woman having
an Appetite, and taking delight in the Food, eat of
it about two a clock.</q> But these two things may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
us to think that they did not: 1. What the Sacred
History concerning that matter affordeth us. 2. What
Reason, and the thing it self will suggest to us about
it. 1. The History of the Acts of that Day on which
<hi>Adam</hi> was made, is a sufficient confutation of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
For <hi>Moses</hi> in the Book of <hi>Genesis</hi> acquaints us,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65397:40"/>
that on that Day wherein he was created (which was
the sixth day) all these things were done: 1. Being
created without <hi>Paradise,</hi> he was that day<note n="1" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 8, 15.</note>
brought into
it. 2. The Tree of Life, and the Tree of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of Good and Evil were<note n="2" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 9, 16.</note> proposed to him. 3. A
Law concerning<note n="3" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 17.</note> abstaining from one of them was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him. 4. All the four-footed Creatures, one of a
sort at least, were<note n="4" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 19, 20.</note> brought to him, and set before him;
and he view'd and observ'd them, and according to the
nature and differences of every Species, gave peculiar
Names to them. The same he did to all the Fowls of
the Air. This would take up a considerable time.
5. After this <hi>Adam</hi>
                        <note n="5" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 21.</note> fell into a deep sleep, and a Rib is
taken out of his side, and of it the Woman was made.
6. God, as the Paranymph,<note n="6" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 22, 23.</note> brings this Spouse to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
who acknowledgeth her to be a part of him, and
takes her into intimate familiarity, and made her his
Wife. All this was done on the sixth Day; but we
do not read that any more was done.</p>
                     <p>But you will say, If it admitted of so much work, we
may as well add the eating of the forbidden Fruit, which
did not take up much time. But I answer, we learn
not from the History that this was done on that day:
Yea, we are sure it was not done, for it is said of the
Works of the sixth day, as of the foregoing ones, <hi>God
saw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very
good,</hi> Gen. 1. 31. It is not probable this would have
been said, if Man had not <hi>continued good</hi> till then, and
if Sin, the greatest Evil of all, was entred at that time.
And we are to observe that these words were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65397:41"/>
concerning what happen'd all the space of that
<hi>sixth</hi> day of the Creation: And all the things before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
(which are the Contents of the second
Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi>) are suppos'd to be comprehended
within this time; for 'tis said immediately after the
foregoing approbation in the close of the first Chapter of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> that <hi>the Evening and the Morning</hi> (which
make the Day compleat) <hi>were the sixth Day.</hi> After
this you read that the story of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall begins, that
Satan attempts the Woman, that there were several Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
between the Serpent and the Woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her and the Man. Therefore 'tis evident that
our Parents did not fall from God on the same day they
were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reated.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Several <hi>Reasons</hi> may be offer'd why it was
not so, <hi>viz.</hi> first because it is more worthy of God to
believe that <hi>Adam</hi> and his Mate were not baffled so soo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
after their Creation. It is not congruous to God's Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to create so excellent a Frame, and let it be spoil'd
<hi>immediately.</hi> Then more particularly this may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that God's proposal of the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi>
to our first Parents, (on which depended the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of the present Affair) their mutual <hi>consenting</hi> to it,
and the <hi>ratifying</hi> it on God's part, and Man's part, in
some solemn manner, were a Work which required
some length of time. Further, the Parley between <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
and <hi>Eve</hi> might be of a long continuance, to it is
briefly set down by <hi>Moses.</hi> It is probable that she at
first gave a repulse to the Assault; it is likely that several
Onsets were made before she yielded. We cannot but
suppose a considerable time of tempting, because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it would have been a Surprize, and then it would
not have been what it is; that is, the Transgression
would not have been of so heinous a nature, and would
not have been animadverted on so severely. Again, it is
rational to think that <hi>Adam</hi> and his Wise being created by
God in that perfection of Knowledg and Holiness which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65397:41"/>
are acknowledg'd to have been in them, could not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
be drawn from their obedience to God. Those
high Endowments could not easily be lost, those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Gifts could not decay but by little and little.
Therefore upon this account we have reason to believe
and affirm, that these Persons shrunk back from their
Integrity by degrees, and not all at once, and that the
space of time between their Temptation and actual
Transgression in eating the forbidden Fruit, was of
some length, much more than we can reasonably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to have been crowded into one single day. Thus
both Scripture and Reason induce us to reject that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Opinion, that our first Parents fell from their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Innocence on the very day that they were made.</p>
                     <p>But when I say this, I pretend not to determine how
long <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> continued in their Innocence, and
what time pass'd before they were turn'd out of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi>
None can positively assert, that they were created
and fell upon the same day, because it is no where said
so. But then on the other hand, it is as true that none
can be positive as to the certain time of their abiding in
their Innocence, because we find it not mention'd. As
those who say they fell in the very day in which God
formed them, are not to be credited; so those <hi>Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listick
Iews,</hi> who say they were twenty years in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>
before they were turn'd out, are to be utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded.
The renowned <hi>Vsher</hi> (in his <hi>Annals</hi>) holds,
that <hi>Adam</hi> was expell'd out of <hi>Paradise</hi> on the tenth
day from the beginning of the World; according to
which timing of it, he fell in the third or fourth day
after that of his Creation; for it is not to be thought
that he staid there after his Fall. But in my judgment
those <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> (for they are not all o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> them of
the same mind) who hold that our first Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
both in their Integrity and in <hi>Paradise</hi> eight
days, do approach nearest to the Truth. It is likely
that they retain'd their Innocence, amidst many Assaults
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65397:42"/>
and Temptations, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ill about that time: so that as the
first Week in the World ended with the Creation of
Man and Woman; so their fatal Seduction and Fall
were the close of the second week. However, from
the Premises it is eviden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, that there was a considerable
time between their Formation and Lapse.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto I have consider'd the <hi>Sin and Fall</hi> of our first
Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ents; now I must speak of the <hi>dreadful Effects,</hi> of
it. <hi>Man became like the Beasts which perish.</hi> Man was
in a happy and glorious condition, but made himself
wretched and miserable. <hi>Man was in honour;</hi> we were
once happy. In which sense those words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
22. may be understood; <hi>Behold, the Man was as one
of us,</hi> for so it may be rendred according to the<note n="1" place="bottom">Hajah, fui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</hi>
He <hi>was</hi> so happy as to be like one of us; he <hi>was</hi>
created after our Image, but now is miserable. It is
such a manner of speaking as that of the Poet,

                        </q>
Unless you are rather inclin'd to think those words are
spoken ironically, and by way of Interrogation, <hi>Is the
Man become like one of us?</hi> As much as to say, he is
not, he is far from it, he is lost and undone, he hath
made himself a very lamentable and wretched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>Let us now briefly recount the Particulars of his
Misery. First, God who for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad Man to eat of the
Tree of Knowledg, now forbids him to touch the
Tree of Life. Now Man is turn'd out of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
that Garden of Pleasure; he is sent out of God's
Presence, and is become a Reprobate and Castaway.
There is a stern Angel with a flaming Sword set at the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65397:42"/>
entrance of <hi>Eden,</hi> to keep him and his Posterity out for
ever. We may in part imagine, but we cannot suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
relate how sad and deplorable the condition of
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> was at this time. They could not but
spend their days in languishing Grief, in continual Sighs
and Tears; they could not but be filled with Regret
and Remorse, when they reflected on their past Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the loss of it by their Folly; when they look'd
forward also, and saw the innumerable Evils which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
upon this their Miscarriage.</p>
                     <p>To augment their Sorrows, there soon happen'd a
dismal effect of their Fall and Depravation. Their
dear Son <hi>Abel</hi> was murder'd by his own Brother, the
same Devil that deluded them working on him. And
how can the disconsolate Parents bear this and the rest
of their Sorrows? The Children had been brought up
well, they had been set to honest Imployments. <hi>Adam</hi>
gave unto <hi>Cain,</hi> Lands to till, unto <hi>Abel</hi> Sheep to keep;
their Callings intimating to them what should be their
Allotment and Portion afterwards, the <hi>Real Estate</hi> being
to be assigned to the eldest Son, and the <hi>Personal</hi> to the
younger, as is in use at this day. But the careful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
might dispose of their Estate, but they could not
entail Virtue and Grace upon their Children. <hi>Cain</hi>
most maliciously rose up against his Brother, and neither
his Innocency nor his near Relation to him, could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
him from violently pursuing and shedding his
Blood. This made th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> hearts of the distressed Parents
bleed afresh, this added new dolours to their former
ones, and caus'd them yet more seriously to look back
on their vile Apostacy from God, which was the spring
of all the Miseries they underwent.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing said in Scripture of the <hi>Repentaonce</hi>
of these Sinners after their Fall; whereupon some have
concluded, that these first Offenders died in Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and were denied all Mercy and Pardon. But it thust
be remembred, that the Sacred History omits many
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65397:43"/>
things, being very short and compendious; yea, of this
very nature some things are pass'd by, as that <hi>Noah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of his Drunkenness, and <hi>Lot</hi> of his Incest; so
that we cannot draw an Argument in this case from
Scripture-silence. But we have reason rather to believe
that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did repent, and were saved: for
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Promise of the <hi>Seed,</hi> which was to redeem and save
Mankind, was made immediately after the Fall, and so
concern'd them as well as others, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Besides,
we may piously believe, that God's Mercy would not
overpass these poor Offenders at its very first setting out,
but rather that it would begin with them, to give an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of his present Pity and Kindness, and an assurance
of his future Goodness and Clemency. The wise God
would not suffer Satan to boast, that his <hi>first</hi> Conquest
and Spoils remain'd entire, and met not with an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defeat.

that he had the benefit of our Saviour's Sufferings,

they are either <hi>outward</hi> or <hi>inward.</hi> The outward

Author ingeniously lays hold upon the <hi>Sentence of Death,</hi>
which was pronounced at the same time with this part
of the <hi>Curse about the Earth's Sterility,</hi> and argues
from the suspending of that to the suspending of this.
But I conceive this is not a good way of arguing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he could have proved that neither our first Parents,
nor any others, felt the effect of that Sentence of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
before the <hi>Deluge;</hi> for it is of <hi>this</hi> which he was
discoursing, and his Opinion is, that this was the
cause which check'd the exuberance of the Earth, and
therefore the Curse took not place till this time. But
the very words and expressions themselves, by which
the Curse of Sterility is set forth, seem to me to put
this matter out of controversy: for they respect not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mankind in general, but the first Man in particular,
and more especially, and therefore must have taken place
before the Flood. <hi>Cursed is the Ground for thy sake;
in sorrow shalt</hi> thou <hi>eat of it all the days of</hi> thy <hi>Life.</hi>
See here, <hi>Adam himself,</hi> for whose sake the Earth had
its Doom, was to experience the sad Effect of it by eating
of the Fruits of the Ground <hi>in sorrow,</hi> that is, with
labour and toil, the Ground not bringing sorth its
Fruits with that ease, and in that plenty which it did
before. The Curse then was inflicted in <hi>Adam</hi>'s time,

the Lord sent him forth from the Garden of</hi> Eden,

that the Curse had actually taken effect, and that Thorns

as if it had been said to <hi>Adam,</hi> Seeing the Earth is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived

                           </gap>orth,</hi> &amp;c. Here is a plain Instance of the actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
of the Curse in our first Parents time, even long
before the Universal Deluge. Wherefore I hope I shall
prevail with this ingenious Author to aker his <hi>System of
the Earth</hi> as to this particular, that he may avoid so
considerable an Objection as this is, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is
repugnant to the Sacred Writings, to which I know he
pays a great Reverence. And besides, so far as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
his general <hi>Syst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>m</hi> can very well be without
this particular Hypothesis. I take the freedom to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
this to one who seems to be made for great Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
in Natural Philosophy; and therefore out of that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65397:45"/>
friendship which I bear to him, and which he is pleas'd
mutually to honour me with, I would not have them
tinctured with the least disrespect to the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
for this is enough to blast them in the esteem of
those that are wise and sober.</p>
                     <p>But tho I cannot yield assent to this Gentleman's Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
as he hath laid It down; yet thus far I agree
with him, that the Sentence before mention'd took not
place <hi>in the most effectual manner</hi> till the time he assigns;
it was not <hi>fully</hi> accomplish'd and executed till the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</hi>
That indeed was the Consummation of the Curse
of <hi>Barrenness:</hi> then there was a more general Restraint
and Decay of the Fruits of the Earth, caused by that
destructive Inundation. But the Curse commenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in part, as is clear from the express words of the
<hi>Mosaick</hi> History. And therefore I take it for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
Truth, because it is founded on the Sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
that the Earth was immediately curs'd upon
Man's Fall, and that all the Creatures degenerated when
he fell. The Earth, and Air, and other Elements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
disorder'd, and in some measure unwholesom,
and sometimes fatal. Hence proceeded Dearth, Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
Pestilences, Earthquakes, Storms, Tempests,
harmful Thunder and Lightning, Conflagrations, and all
manner of Evils and Calamities. Man's Body, which
was made of the Earth, participated of the Curse;
whence floweth such a variety of Diseases and Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that the Masters of Medicks have not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
their Bill of Mortality, and given us a perfect
Catalogue of the Maladies which infest us.</p>
                     <p>Another external Effect of Man's Fall, is the <hi>labour</hi>
and <hi>trouble</hi> of this Life. Using Diligence and Labour
in a lawful Calling is no Curse, for God set <hi>Adam</hi> to
work even in the State of Innocence: but afterwards
his Labour was attended with faintness and weariness,
with pain and uneasiness, as in that formentioned
place. <hi>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat Bread.</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:65397:45"/>
Which seems more particularly and especially to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the great labour which accompanies plowing
and sowing, and gathering in of the Fruits of the Earth.
For tho, it is true, part of <hi>Adam</hi>'s employment in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi>
was <hi>dressing</hi> the Ground, yet it cost him not any
considerable labour then, it was not like the Husbandry
which was afterwards, and is at present, <hi>viz.</hi> uneasy
and toilsome by reason of the barrenness of the Ground.
But in a larger and more extensive sense these words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
all the fatigue and pains which Men undergo in
this World. It was the eating of the forbidden Fruit
which was the cause of this <hi>eating in sorrow and sweat.</hi>
Now innumerable hardships and distresses are the allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Man's Life: Now <hi>Man is born to trouble,</hi> Job
5. 7. <hi>All his days are sorrow, and his travel grief,</hi>
Eccles. 2. 23. Now the Earth is truly the <hi>Land of
Labourers:</hi> Numberless poor people sweat and turmoil
in getting a livelyhood, and even their Bodies are bow'd
down sometimes with a burden: so the <hi>erect</hi> Figure of
Man is partly impair'd. Who can recount the various
Troubles and Afflictions of this mortal State? What a
vast number of Calamities and Miseries is a Man liable
to daily? How strangely is he beset with Crosses and
Disasters at home and abroad, in his private and relative
Capacity, in his Body, Mind, and all his Concerns?
His Dominion over the Creatures is much diminished:
Many of them being hard to be tamed and kept in
subjection, many of them proving hurtful and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
                     <p>He may lament the loss of <hi>another Dominion</hi> which is
more considerable, I mean that which relates to that
Sex over which God and Nature had given him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and Authority. And on the other side, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
subjection of the Woman to her Husband, is the
Curse and Punishment of the first Woman's Sin. Which
I take to be the meaning of those words, <hi>Gen. 3. 16.
Thy d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sire shall be to thy Husband, and he shall rule
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65397:46"/>
over thee.</hi> It is true, she was under his Rule and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
even in Innocency, as was suggested before:
There was then a Power and Preeminence in Man over
the Woman, as the Apostle informs us 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7,
8, 9. but they did not dispute this Superiority, they did
not contend about it, for the Man did not exert his
Power imperiously; and the Woman's subjection
(call'd here her <hi>desire unto her Husband</hi>) was free and
voluntary. But afterwards, this Obedience was forced
and unwilling, and the Man's Dominion too often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
into an arbitrary unreasonable sway. And
that this is the meaning of this place is plain from the
like words of God to <hi>Cain</hi> (to pacify his Wrath against
his Brother <hi>Abel) unto thee shall be his desire, and thou
shalt rule over him,</hi> Gen. 4. 7. that is, <hi>Abel is</hi> thy
younger Brother, and shall be subject unto thee, and
thou shalt have the superiority over him. So then the
import of the foresaid words is this, that tho indeed
Man, as being first created, had a superiority and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
over the Woman, and should have yet had
if they had stood in their Intergrity; yet now since the
Fall the latter is oftentimes too indecently treated,
whilst the former instead of claiming his just Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Power, becomes inhuman and tyrannical.</p>
                     <p>A farther <hi>Curse</hi> on Womankind is that which is
mention'd in <hi>Gen. 3. 16. I will greatly multiply thy
sorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thy conception: in sorrow thou shalt bring
forth Children.</hi> Difficulty in Childbearing, bringing
forth with pain, is the effect of the first Woman's trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression:

                     <p>Thus both Sexes partake of the Evil which accrued
by the first Apostacy. And wheresoever you look, you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65397:46"/>
may see the cursed Fruits of it: All things are out of
order, and shatter'd by the Fall. That which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles

confutes all his Pretences, and baffles all his Boastings
of Knowledg and Wisdom; for when he should give

hurt by the Fall.</p>
                     <p>His Heart likewise, his Will and Affections are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
endamag'd by it. There is a strange Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
in our elective Faculty; we are not only disabled
in a great measure from chusing Good, but we have an
aversion in us to God and Goodness, and an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the contrary to comply with Satan, and to do
whatever is displeasing to our Marker. We<note n="1" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2. 26.</note>

and we have not so much sense as to bemoan our
loss. This is our condition by Nature, abstracted from

are all unbridled and ungovern'd; they hurry us
into mischief, they fill us with perturbation, they make
us uneasy, restless, and unquiet, and they end in vanity
and vexation of Spirit. These disorders in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,

                     <p>Thus it was rightly said by the Royal Prophet, that

continue without any Period. Accordingly we read that

God's Will concerning Man's Redemption and the free

                        </gap>d. Now God treateth with Man
<hi>de novo, viz.</hi> by a Mediator. Now there was a New
Covenant made between God and <hi>Adam,</hi> or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Mankind in him. The sum of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
was this, that God on his part would shew Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
unto <hi>Adam</hi> and his Prosterity for the sake of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi>
who was to die for their Sins, and that by virtue
of his Satisfaction and Merit Man should be accepted.
And on Man's part it was covenanted and promised by
<hi>Adam,</hi> that they should believe in this <hi>Messias,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon his Undertakings and Merits, and faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all the other Conditions requir'd of them in those
Laws which God publish'd to the World. This <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace succeeded</hi> in the room of the <hi>Covenant of
Works</hi> made with Man in his State of Integrity: for he
by his Fall breaking that Covenant, there was another

be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the result of the Divine Favor and Goodness:
for on the violation of the first Covenant, Man became
obnoxious to the Devine Displeasure, and might justly

                     <p>But let me remark this by the by, that tho this grand
Revelation and Covenant constitute a new Oeconomy,
yet the Administration of the Law of Nature still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained.
As natural Religion was of use before in the
two other Oeconomies (for they were under the <hi>Law of
Nature</hi> mix'd with some <hi>Revelutions</hi>) so now it c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not. Tho Nature is corrupted, yet this Light is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd.
The Law of Nature written in Man's Heart
at his Creation is still necessary and useful. This was
imprinted on Men as they were created with rational
Minds, and therefore this must last always, and it was
made to do so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it must conduct them as they are

contain, not only a Threatning, but a Command.
Here is not only signified the Punishment consequent on

the Woman (which we mention'd before) but here is
enjoyn'd the subjection of the latter to the former, this

Reason, that those Sacrifices may not be thought to be
the Representations of the <hi>Sacrifice of Christ,</hi> which
without doubt was the chief end of the instituting of
Sacrifices. Some of other Perswasions likewise agree
in this Tenent, that Sacrifices (<hi>i. e.</hi> the killing and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of Beasts) were by the Law of Nature. But
these are contradicted by others, both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
who confidently aver, that these Sacrifices were
by the special Injunction of God, and did not proceed
from any natural Notions and Principles which they
had.</p>
                     <p>Now, it is my desire here (as 'tis in all other Cases)
to reconcile dissenting and disputing Men: which may
effectually be done, by leading them off from their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
which they adhere to. In my judgment neither
to these Parties are in the right, not those who say all
Sacrifices are by the Law of Nature, nor those who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
that all of them must needs be by Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There is a middle way between these, which I take
to be the true one, <hi>viz.</hi> that both Natural Reason, and
Supernatural Revelation concur'd here. Reason taught
them to offer <hi>some</hi> Sacrifices, and a positive Word from
God (tho not express'd by <hi>Mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi>) taught them to
offer <hi>others.</hi> I must remind you then, that Sacrifices
were either <hi>Eucharistical</hi> or <hi>Expiatory,</hi> that is, they
were either offer'd to God in way of thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
or to atone and expiate for their Sins. The
former of these, I conceive, were dictated by the Light
of Nature, but the latter were wholly or partly from
God.</p>
                     <p>First, I say, the <hi>offering of Eucharistical Sacrifices</hi>
was part of the Law of Nature: for Reason would
teach them to offer their Flocks as well as their Fruits to
God. These, no less than the other, were Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments,
they were owning of God's Dominion and
Soveraignty. As <hi>Cain,</hi> a Husbandman, offer'd by the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65397:56"/>
mere instinct of Nature the Fruits of the Ground as an
Acknowledgment that God was his Benefactor; so the
same Principle moved <hi>Abel</hi> a Shepherd, to offer the
first of his Flock in way of Recognition, that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
those good things upon him. Yea, <hi>Abel</hi> by the
only instinct of right Reason, judged that God was to
be worshipped with the best things, and that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
ought to be of the fattest of the Flock. I do not
think <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> discourseth and argueth closely,
when to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who objected against the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
that they had no Altars and Sacrifices, he replieth
thus; <q>Shall we offer Sacrifices and Oblations to God,
which he gave us on purpose for our use and service?
It is Ingratitude to return him Gifts again.</q> And
<hi>Arnobius</hi> saith the same, in answer to the same Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
but with as little reason: <q>It is madness (<hi>saith
he</hi>) to measure God by our Needs, and to give the
things that are useful to us, to God who is the giver
of them.</q> But this was a great mistake; there was
no madness in doing this, but a great deal of reason and
sobriety: For natural Gratitude directed them to give
something to God: therefore <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are called <hi>Gifts</hi>
in the Holy Scripture, particularly <hi>Abel</hi>'s Offering is
stiled a <hi>Gift,</hi> Heb. 11. 4. and so the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Sacrifices
are call'd <hi>Corban,</hi> i. e. a <hi>Gift,</hi> Mat. 5. 23 24. The
Law of Thankfulness, which is a Law of Nature, taught
the Antient Patriarchs to offer these Gifts as Tokens and
Testimonies of their Gratitude. By these they openly
proclaim'd, that God was the supreme Giver of all
things. Natural Light inform'd them, that it was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to make some Returns to God, to give something
to him from whom they receiv'd all. They needed
not a particular Command from God for this: These
were spontaneous, free and uncommanded Offerings,
these were dictated by Reason, and the voluntary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Hearts, which told them that they ought
to acknowledg God's Goodness to them by such gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65397:56"/>
Sacrifices. These were but so many Acts of
Thanksgiving to God for Benefits and Favours receiv'd
of him, and were but natural Signs of Worship due to
him. But,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Besides the <hi>Eucharistical Sacrifices,</hi> there
were <hi>Expiatory ones:</hi> But these were not the Dictates of
Natural Reason; for tho the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
themselves that those Sacrifices being thankful
Acknowledgments and Gifts would be acceptable to
God, that he would receive them kindly, and be pleas'd
not to shew himself angry and offended for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Miscarriages; yet this they might as well have
thought to have been done by the <hi>unbloody Sacrifices,</hi>
the offering of the Fruits of the Earth: for they being
<hi>Gifts</hi> as well as these, those that offer'd them might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that God would be pleas'd with them, and that
thereby they should conciliate the Divine Favor and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
and so that there should be an <hi>Expiation</hi> made
for their Sine. Thus the <hi>unbloody</hi> sort of Sacrifices
would have been sufficient, and there is no reason why
the <hi>bloody</hi> ones should be added. No truly, Nature could
afford them no substantial Reason why the Blood of
Beasts should be shed. Reason doth not tell us that
God is delighted in the Blood and Pain of the innocent
Brutes. Reason doth not acquaint us that the offering
of these is a satisfaction to his Justice, and a means to
avert the Judgments of God. there is no Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that dictates any such thing.</p>
                     <p>Hence the sacrificing of the Beasts was condemned by
the wisest Men among the Heathens. What saith <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrius?</hi>

                        </q> Thus this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
was mistaken about the first Original of bloody
Sacrifices: and it could not be expected that he should
attain to the true Reason of it, which (as I shall shew
you) is the grand bottom of <hi>revealed Religion.</hi> But
this Testimony of <hi>Porphyrius</hi> confirmeth what I am
asserting, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>bloody Sacrificing</hi> was not the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
or Precept of Nature. Had it been so, this Person,
who was so well versed in the Law of Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
would not have inveighed against this kind of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing,
as not becoming God nor Men, as having no
Reason nor Religion to justify it. He would not have
told us in plain terms, that God is by no means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in the Blood of Beasts, and that this manner of
Sacrificing was discountenanced and disapproved by the
<hi>Oracles,</hi> as he relateth.</p>
                     <p>Let us hear what other Heathens thought of the
bloody Sacrifices. <hi>It is impious to pollute Altars with

more Innocent and Primitive Ages of the World.
Which tho it be false, yet it shews the Sentiment of this
and other wise Men, who had no good opinion of this
kind of Sacrifices. Among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were
the wisest of the Antient Nations, no Animals were
kill'd for Sacrifice to the Gods, saith <hi>Macrobius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do you think now that the gravest and wisest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
would have disapproved of and condemned Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
if they had been a Dictate of Nature and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
if they had been the Natural Worship of God?
Would they not rather have defended and maintain'd
them? for natural Religion, and the main Offices of it,
are extoll'd by none more than them. But as they were
<hi>bloody Sacrifices,</hi> there was no Principle in Nature and
Reason to commend them: and thence it is that the
wisest Pagans never spoke seriously for them, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
against them; and they were of the opinion that
God was not honour'd by the Blood of Brutes, and
the killing of harmless Beasts; and that he took no
pleasure in the Smoke that ascended from their slain Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
It is evident then, that bloody Sacrificing, as it
denoteth Atonement and Propitiating, was not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65397:58"/>
of Natural Light, but was by positive and Divine
Institution. And from what was known hence, there
came to be even among the <hi>Pagans</hi> a Notion of Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by sacrificing, which we find in several of their
Writings: but they had not of themselves any such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.</p>
                     <p>This I prove from the Reason which <hi>Moses,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Lord by <hi>Moses,</hi> giveth of bloody Sacrifices, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi>
17. 11. <hi>The Life of the Flesh is in the Blood, and
I have given it to you on the Altar, to make an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for your Souls, for it is the Blood that makes Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Soul.</hi> Tho this Reason of offering the
Blood of slain Beasts was divulged to the <hi>Israelites</hi> at
this particular time, yet this reason was good at first,
and was the true account of the Service of Bloody Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
among the Patriarchs. Now the Reason here
given why these Sacrifices are to be used, is, because it is
the <hi>Blood that makes Atonement for the Soul.</hi> And if
you ask the Reason of this, it is implied in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Verse before recited, <hi>the Life of the Flesh is
in the Blood:</hi> So then when the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Beast is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
in Sacrifice, the <hi>Life</hi> of it is offer'd; and the Life
of the Beast is supposed to be given instead of the Life
of the Offender, for whom the Sacrifice is offered: and
so the Beast was slain instead of the Person that offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This was the intent and meaning of Bloody Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
                     <p>But this Divine Significations of them was not the issue
of <hi>Natural Reason.</hi> Did this tell them that the Blood
of beasts was an Atonement for the Souls of men, that
the blood of slain animals on the altar, signified that
men deserved to bleed and die? Did this tell them that
the blood of Brutes was poured forth instead of the
blood of Men? that Sacrisicing was an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Demerit and Guilt, and that he that kill'd the
Beast did as much as confess he deserved to be so used?
It must be from <hi>Revelation</hi> at first that they had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65397:58"/>
and distinct knowledg of this, that God would
accept of a Sacrifice in the place of the Guilty Sinner.
Natural light could not make this out: much less could
it discover that these Sacrifices were Representations and
Types of the <hi>Great Sacrifice</hi> which was to come; that
they shadowed our <hi>Christ</hi> the Redeemer who was to be
sacrificed on the Cross, and to shed his Blood for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Mankind. This was the main thing which
those Sacrifices represented. God instituted them chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to intimate the translating of our punishment on our
Redeemer, and to signifie the great bloody Sacrifice of
the <hi>Messias</hi> which is truly Propitiatory. It was then
by Divine Revelation discover'd to our first Parents, and
to the Antient Patriarchs, that offering the blood of slain
Beasts would be an acceptable service to God: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they constantly used themselves to this service and
worship.</p>
                     <p>But you will say, Expiatory and Bloody Sacrificing
hath been in use among all Nations, not only <hi>Iews,</hi> but
<hi>Greeks, Romans, Barbarians,</hi> and even the whole Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
World. If they knew nothing of this by the light
of Nature, how came they to use this sort of Sacrifice
constantly? How came some of them to have this notion,
that the Beasts bled in their stead? I answer, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to the Gentiles by <hi>Tradition:</hi> they receiv'd it from
those who had it first by Supernatural Manifestation.
Hence they got the notion of Expiatory Sacrifices (as
well as of some other things, as I could shew you) they
were transmitted to them from the practice of the <hi>Iews:</hi>
or if any of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had this perswasion before, they
receiv'd it by Tradition from their Forefathers, who had
it from the Father of all, <hi>Adam,</hi> who had it from God
by particular Revelation. And this seems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, chap.
11. 4. <hi>By faith Abel offered unto God a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Sacrifice than Cain.</hi> If he sacrificed <hi>by Faith</hi> (as
that word may be well understood here) there was some
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65397:59"/>
Warrant and Word of God for it, for <hi>Faith cometh by
hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 17.
<hi>Faith</hi> is grounded on some <hi>Word,</hi> it relyeth on a Divine
Command, or Promise. Therefore when <hi>Abel</hi> offered
of the fat of his flock in Sacrifice, he did that which was
instituted by God, and consequently that sort of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
was by Divine Institution, there was a precept for
it. <hi>Adam</hi> and his Sons had a particular Order from God,
though it is not recorded by <hi>Moses,</hi> neither was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it should be in so short an Account as he intended
of things.</p>
                     <p>Take the Sum of all in few words: This <hi>Law of
Sacrifices,</hi> which was in use in the <hi>Adamick Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
was partly Natural and partly Divine. As Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were tokens of Thankfulness, and Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that as they receiv'd the fruits of the Earth and all
other inanimate good things from God, so the Animals
which they sacrificed, and all other living creatures for
the use and benefit of man, were given them by the
same Divine hand; thus they were a Service dictated by
<hi>Natural Reason,</hi> and so were natural acts of Worship:
but as they carry'd with them the notion of <hi>Expiation</hi>
and <hi>Atonement</hi> for the Souls of men, but especially as they
refer'd to the <hi>Messias,</hi> and signified the future Sacrifice of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and so were to strengthen and support their faith
till that time, thus it is certain they were <hi>instituted by God,</hi>
and the practice of them was founded on a <hi>Divine Command:</hi>
and the Patriarchs knew they would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, because they were of his own Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>It may be asked, (as it is a question among Writers)
whether Sacrifices were prescribed before or after the
Fall of <hi>Adam?</hi> Here they are divided (as the manner is)
and some say they were instituted before, and others say
after the Fall. But I have made way for a more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
Answer to this Query by the distinction of <hi>Bloody</hi>
and <hi>Vnbloody Sacrifices,</hi> and of <hi>Propitiatory</hi> and <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65397:59"/>
Sacrifices.</hi> Unbloody Sacrifices, and such as
are meerly <hi>Eucharistical,</hi> i. e. such as were natural To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of Thanksgiving for benefits received, were used,
it is likely, by <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall: (which I intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under that Oeconomy) these might begin in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.
But these Sacrifices needed not to be prescribed
them by God, because they were a part of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Worship. But as for Bloody Sacrifices, I
mean such as were <hi>Expiatory,</hi> they were not instituted
by God till after the Fall: For when there was no Sin,
there was no need of Expiation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Priesthood</hi> goes along with <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> and therefore
it were pertinent to say something of that here. <hi>Adam</hi>
was the first Priest and Sacrificer: but now under this
Dispensation it is expresly recorded, that <hi>Cain</hi> made an
oblation of the fruits of the Earth, and <hi>Abel</hi> offered the
firstlings of his flock to God. The <hi>Priestly Office</hi> is hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
but obscure, and no <hi>particular Persons</hi> are assign'd
and appointed by God to act in it. This we know that
<hi>Abel,</hi> the younger brother, was the <hi>proper Sacrificer,</hi> and
acted the part of a <hi>Priest,</hi> which was to stay and offer
<hi>Living Creatures</hi> unto God; but what the practice was
afterwards in the sequel of this Dispensation is not set
down by <hi>Moses,</hi> and therefore was cannot determine any
thing. But in the other following <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we find that the Domestick Sacrifices belonging
to the Family (for of publick Sacrificing we read nothing
yet) were offered by the Fathers and Masters of Families
generally, as by <hi>Noab</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 20.) <hi>Abraham</hi> (Gen.
12. 7.) <hi>Iacob</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 3, 7.) It is the opinion of <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
Grotius,</hi> and others, that the Sacerdotal Dignity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided
in the <hi>First-born</hi> before <hi>Moses</hi>'s time, and that
the Primogeniture and Priesthood went together. Nay,
they add Kingship or Magistracy to these, asserting that
the First-born among the Patriarchs were <hi>Princes</hi> as well
as <hi>Priests.</hi> And so indeed <hi>Cohen,</hi> which is the word
for a <hi>Priest,</hi> signifies also a <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Ruler</hi> (as in <hi>Iob.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65397:60"/>
12. 19. 2 Sam.</hi> 8. 18. &amp; 20. 26.) and such were the Heads
and Fathers of Families, and the First-born of old. But
though it is true the Priesthood was exercised by the
chief Heads and Fathers of Families, and by the <hi>First-born
Sons,</hi> yet we likewise read of Priests or Sacrificers
who were <hi>younger Brothers,</hi> as <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 4.
4. &amp; 28. 18. &amp; 46. 1. Whence I gather that was not the
sole Prerogative of the <hi>First-born</hi> before the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
Law: For if the younger Brothers offer'd as well as the
Elder, the Office of Priest was not confin'd to the Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture.
The Sum then of all is this, that before the
Priesthood, was setled by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the First-born
were Priests, that is, <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>for the most
part,</hi> but <hi>not always,</hi> for some instances there are of
others that offer'd Sacrifices. So that this middle way
which I have taken may decide the Controversie that
hath been among some Learned Writers, <hi>viz.</hi> whether
the <hi>Priesthood</hi> at first resided altogether in the <hi>First-born?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place, the <hi>Difference of Clean and Vnclean
Animals</hi> was part of this Dispensation. We read of the
Distinction between these first of all in <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 2. where
<hi>Noah</hi> is commanded by God to put up in the Ark seven
pair of <hi>Clean,</hi> and two pair of <hi>Vnclean</hi> Creatures. <hi>Of
every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the
male and his female; and of beasts that are not clean, by
two, the male and his female.</hi> This account of the
<hi>number</hi> of the Beasts taken into the Ark, may seem to
differ from what is said in <hi>Gen. 6. 19. Of every living
thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring
into the Ark; and in Gen. 7. 9. There went in two and
two into the Ark, the male and the female.</hi> But by
comparing the former of these Texts with the foresaid
place, we shall find that it is only a <hi>general account of
bringing the beasts</hi> into the Ark, viz. <hi>by pairs,</hi> a male
and a female of every sort of living creatures. But that
place which I first produced speaks <hi>particularly,</hi> and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifics
the <hi>number of the pairs, i. e.</hi> seven pair of clean
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65397:60"/>
beasts, and two pair of unclean. For whereas some
have thought that of clean animals <hi>seven only</hi> of a sort
entred the Ark, it is evident from the Original that
they are mistaken, for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Shibgnah</hi> is
repeated, to signifie that there were two <hi>seven,</hi> i. e.
seven males and seven females taken into the Ark, that
they might have enough for Sacrifice and Food after
the flood. And as for the latter place, that also speaks
of all the Creatures whether <hi>clean or not clean</hi> (as you
will see in <hi>ver</hi> 8.) and is to be understood of the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of their going into the Ark: they went by couples
(and here by the way observe, that if there were only
<hi>seven,</hi> they could not go by <hi>Couples</hi>) but this order of
their march contradicts not what hath been said, and is
plainly gather'd from the other Text, <hi>viz.</hi> that 7 males
and 7 females in all of the clean Beasts were preserved in
that Receptacle. Having thus clear'd the Text (which
hath been misunderstood) I come to the matter in hand.</p>
                     <p>Some think these Beasts are call'd <hi>Clean</hi> or <hi>Vnclean</hi> by
a <hi>Prolepsis:</hi> as much as to say, some Beasts went then
into the Ark, which now since that time are reputed Clean;
and others went in which are now reckon'd Unclean.
<hi>Moses</hi> calls them Clean or Unclean, because there
was that distinction of Animals in <hi>his</hi> time. Thus <hi>Rabbi
Solomon</hi> on the place tells us, <q>that That is called Clean
which was afterwards to be Clean: Whence we learn
(saith he) that <hi>Noah</hi> at that time knew the <hi>Law.</hi>
                        </q> For
it is a fancy of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> and <hi>Talmudical</hi> Doctors, that
the <hi>Mosaical Law</hi> was made, and existed before the
World was. But this Historical <hi>Anticipation</hi> will not
serve the turn here (though at some other times I grant
it is useful) for you may observe there is a Reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the forementioned words, why <hi>Noah</hi> was to
shut up in the Ark <hi>more</hi> of <hi>one</hi> sort of Animals than of
<hi>another, viz.</hi> because at that time some were <hi>Clean</hi> and
others <hi>Vnclean.</hi> Wherefore did God order him to take
fourteen of one sort of living creatures, and but four of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65397:61"/>
another? Was there not a reason for this disparity? And
what can we imagin it to be but this, that the creatures
were of a different nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> (as 'tis here expresly
said) that some of them were Clean, and others not?
And this was before <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, for this is supposed
here as a thing well known.</p>
                     <p>But how is this to be understood? No creatures are
Naturally <hi>Vnclean:</hi> they are all <hi>Clean,</hi> and Pure, and
Good from the first Creation. In what sense then are
any said to be <hi>Vnclean?</hi> It is certain this Distinction
could not be in regard of <hi>Eating,</hi> for no Animals were
eaten before the Flood (as shall be proved anon) but it
is reasonable to think that it was with respect to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi>
that they were call'd Clean or Unclean: And
if you consult <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 20. you will <hi>see</hi> that this is
spoken with particular reference to Sacrifices. <hi>Noah</hi>
made use of clean Beasts and Fowls in Sacrificing, and
whoever sacrificed then, did so. They did not sacrifice
all sorts of Creatures, but some only. They look'd upon
some Animals, in respect of others, as unfit for Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
they offer'd to God the best, or what they thought
so, as the Sheep, and not the Hog, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was
founded in their natural Reason, as Sacrifices themselves
partly were. These Animals which at that time they
esteemed the best and choicest, and fittest for Sacrifice,
were reputed <hi>Clean</hi> and <hi>Pure,</hi> and were call'd so: And
on the contrary, the meanest and worst Animals, and
which they thought unfit for Sacrifice, were reckon'd as
<hi>Impure</hi> and <hi>Vnclean,</hi> and were so called. And it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there was also a <hi>Positive Law</hi> for this as well as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.
By this Law such and such Creatures were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
to be Clean our Unclean: and this Law was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that of <hi>Moses,</hi> yea it was long before the Flood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Even then Beasts were call'd <hi>Clean</hi> or <hi>Vnclean</hi> in respect
of <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> as afterward they were call'd so in respect
of <hi>Eating.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may observe further that there was a <hi>Publick Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65397:61"/>
Church</hi> in the days of those renowned and godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
<hi>Seth</hi> and <hi>Enos. Then began men to call upon the
name of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 4. 26. I know there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
reading of these words, for some think that <hi>huchal</hi>
signifies <hi>prophaned</hi> as well as <hi>began,</hi> and accordingly they
render the words thus, <hi>Then men prophaned by calling on
the name of the Lord.</hi> So the <hi>Iewish</hi> Writers generally
interpret this place, and particularly the <hi>Chalde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<note n="1" place="bottom">De Diis Syr. Prolegom. 3.</note> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> infers that there was Idolatry in those days,
and that it was set up then first of all. But these lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
persons considered not that the verb <hi>Chalal</hi> as it is

give themselves time to remember that this place speaks
of <hi>Seth</hi> and his godly Family, and not of any Idolaters
(yea it is likely there was no such thing as Idolatry in
those days, but that its date was afterwards) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must be meant of Religious Invoking of God, and

                     <p>Secondly, We read no where in <hi>Genesis</hi> (nor in any of
the inspired Books afterwards) that any of these <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi>
were given by God to <hi>Adam,</hi> or his immediate
children. We meet with nothing <hi>like</hi> them before <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
and <hi>Moses,</hi> and therefore we cannot with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and confidence assert, that God deliver'd these before that time.
I know it is said, and that by the Learnedest, that all Facts are
not mention'd in the Bible; the Scripture refers to some as known and
acknowledg'd, though no where expresly recorded: Thus these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
are refer'd to in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 20. But I answer, though one
thing done at this time, and another at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
may be omitted in Scripture-History, as <hi>Adam</hi>'s
observing the Seventh day, and God's Injunction about
Bloody Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it is folly to think that a
Whole Body of Precepts should be given to <hi>Adam</hi> and
his Sons, and that they should be openly divulg'd (as
the <hi>Iews</hi> say there was a formal Promulgation of them)
and yet not one of them be mention'd, nor so much
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65397:63"/>
as hinted at in the <hi>History,</hi> which purposely treats of
those things. <hi>Credat I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap>,</hi> &amp;c. And as to what some
say, that these Precepts are referr'd to in the Decree of
the Apostolical Council at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it is but a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and there is no real ground for it: only the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or substance of two or three of those Precepts is there
enjoyn'd (as we find in some other places) and that
is all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Not only the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and other
books of Holy Writ were silent concerning the giving of
these Precepts, but <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the Learned <hi>Iewish</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary,
who comments upon the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Writings,
and is wont to insert and add what he thought was left
out, saith not one word concerning these.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, These Precepts are all of them the Laws of
Nature, or most easily reducible to them: They are
Prohibitions against Injustice, Blasphemy, Idolatry, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Bloodshed, Rapine: All which are general
Dictates of Nature and Reason, and written in man's
Mind originally. Therefore it may be rememb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>red that
these Precepts obtain'd not only among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but
among all Nations whatsoever. It is not likely then that
God did orally deliver these to the Patriarchs before the
Flood; for in that early time of the World it was not
requisite. Tho afterwards some of thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Precepts were
given to <hi>Noah, viz.</hi> after the corruption and gross de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy
of the People of the Old World, and when
a New World of Men was to be set up: And tho
these and the like Precepts were made up afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> and given to the <hi>Iews, i. e.</hi>
when the World was more corrupted, and the Dictates
of Reason and Morality were almost lost; and when it
was as necessary to rouse mens Minds, and to keep Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
from decaying, and when God was erecting a New
O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>conomy, and chusing a peculiar People to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
tho in these Circumstances the giving of such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
was necessary, yet now, in the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> days,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65397:64"/>
there was no need of delivering them, they having them
fresh on their minds. There is no ground then for us to
credit the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors when they tell us, that those
<hi>six Precepts</hi> were deliver'd solemnly to the Sons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
It is only a Tradition of the <hi>Iews:</hi> and of what
truth and reality their <hi>Traditions</hi> generally are, is
known to those who are sober and unprejudiced Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
they are usually mere Fancies and Conceits,
Dreams and Dotages, Lies and Forgeries.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see how it went with the World from
<hi>Adam</hi> to the Flood, which is reckon'd to be about six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred Years. You see how the State of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stood, what Communications the World had from
God. And here by the way I cannot but take notice of
the groundless assertion of that<note n="1" place="bottom">Volkel. l. 2. c. 28.</note>

without any Precepts from God.</q> And he further
adds, <q>That the Religion from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi>
was merely Natural, and had nothing but Right

that there was a <hi>Divine Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

concerning <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> and there was a <hi>Promise</hi> (and

this <hi>Antediluvian Dispensation</hi> was mixt, partly guided

Religion consisted both of Natural Principles, and Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

with one another. Thus the Old World was govern'd:

eating of Flesh was granted just after the Flood, and

was altogether prohibited before. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
say, that the People before the Deluge fed only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what the Earth produced, and abstain'd from all
living Creatures. Most of the <hi>Christian Fathers</hi> hold
this, and say, it was by Divine Injunction: But<note n="1" place="bottom">Homil. in Gen. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi>

                        <hi>Theodoret</hi> seem to be of another Judgment.
The <hi>Moderns</hi> are divided; some hold that Flesh was
eaten before the Flood, and others not till after it.
<hi>Luther, Peter Martyr, Fr. Iunius,</hi> and <hi>Musculus,</hi> hold
the latter: But <hi>Calvin, Rivet, Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Reformed Divines, hold the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that eating
of Flesh as well as Herbs was free from the very Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Of this Opinion too are <hi>Beverovici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

This is the clear sense and import of the words; and
consequently proves, that eating Flesh before the Flood
was unl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wful. I do not say, they never ate Flesh, for

                        </gap>obable they did transgress sometimes, and made
bold to taste of that sort of Food; but this is the thing
I assert, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ating Flesh was forbidden them at that
time, and that the Prohibition was not taken off till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Flood; and that then first of all it was lawful
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65397:66"/>
to kill Animals in order to the eating of their Flesh;
all which appears from clear words of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected that the <hi>Antediluvians</hi> kept Sheep;
and therefore it is to be infer'd thence, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ade
use of their Flesh for Food: I answer, That they kept
flocks of Sheep; 1. For their Wool and Skins to clothe
them. 2. For Sacrifices, which consumed many of
their Sheep and other Cattel: And perhaps, 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
Milk, to sustain them (for, as I suggested before, they
ventured to transgress sometimes, and to eat something
else besides Herbs and Fruits, tho it was against a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.)
Thus you see the Shepherds Life, or keeping
of Sheep, proveth not that they used the Flesh of Sheep
for Food. And by what hath been said we know like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
how to answer that common Objection, that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Beasts was used by the <hi>Patriarchs;</hi> therefore
eating Flesh was in use. It follows not, because they
killed them either for their Skins or Fleece, or to offer
them on the Altar. The elder<note n="1" place="bottom">

thinks, that eating of <hi>things strangled</hi> is spoken

of this Prohibition: for by this Law it was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to eat any raw Flesh whilst it was yet warm,
and had the Blood and Life in it. Thus the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Doctors understood it, and that very rightly, as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<note n="2" place="bottom">De Jur. Nat. &amp; Gent. lib. 7. c. 1.</note> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> hath shew'd. This, they say, was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65397:68"/>
the <hi>Seventh Precept</hi> given by God to <hi>Noah</hi> after the
Flood. We are sure it was <hi>one,</hi> for the Holy Ghost by
<hi>Moses</hi> attesteth it here. Tho they had leave to eat
Flesh, yet it was with this Exception, that they should
not eat it with the <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Soul,</hi> which is the <hi>Blood,</hi>
that is, they were forbid to eat live Flesh with the Blood
in it; they were not permitted to eat the Flesh before
it was quite dead: or they were not to eat any Limb or
Member torn off from an Animal alive. The <hi>Reason</hi>
given, in another place, why they must not <hi>

                           </gap>at Blood,</hi>
is, because it is the <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> of all Flesh; that is, it
is the chief Instrument of Life; and therefore is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and significantly used in making <hi>Atonement for
Souls.</hi> Therefore it was designed wholly for <hi>Expiation,</hi>
it was appointed and appropriated to that sacred Use on
the Altar: And for this reason it ought not to be used in
a common way. Again, God forbad eating of Blood
(and that even before the <hi>Law</hi>) to teach abstaining
from Man's Blood. They must eat no Beast's Blood,
that they might not thereby learn to delight in Human
Blood: as we see (saith<note n="1" place="bottom">Mercer. in Gen. 9. 4.</note> an Expositor upon the place)
Butchers, who kill Beasts, are generally cruel and bloody
to Men; and for that reason the Law suffers them not
to be on the Jury of Life and Death<note n="2" place="bottom">Plutarch.</note> The
<hi>Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

because he put out the eyes of Quails; and this is given
as the reason, because it shew'd that the Boy was of a
cruel disposition, and would prove very hurtful if he
lived. So here it was thought that <hi>Blood-eating</hi> was a
sign of and preparative to <hi>inhuman Actions,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
was not allow'd of. Therefore this Precept, of
not eating the Flesh of Beasts with the Blood running
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65397:68"/>
about it, was to restrain this Cruelty. The old <hi>Giants</hi>
of the World before the Flood, generally liv'd on the
Blood of Beasts, and so learn'd to be cruel and savage
to Men; and thence, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
from him conjecture, this Law had its rise: God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
commanded those of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Posterity to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rain
wholly from Blood, that they might not proceed from
cruelty to Beasts, to killing of Men. Besides, this may
seem partly to be a natural Law, Blood being a gross
Meat, and not fit for nourishment.</p>
                     <p>A Third Law given to <hi>Noah</hi> was that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 5, 6.

Here the manner of punishing bloodshed is set down, and
appointed; it must be done by the Magistrate. A pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Minister of Justice is here ordered and appointed to
punish the guilty: Here is the first Institution of that
Political Order. Here is the first injunction for erecting
Courts of Judicature.</p>

<hi>Commination,</hi> but not a <hi>Precept</hi> given to Magistrates.
But herein they separate what they ought to have united,
for these words are both a threatning of Punishment, and
also an Order or Warrant given to the Magistrate to
execute that Punishment. It is to be done by <hi>Man
(Adam)</hi> which word sometimes is appropriated to one
of Eminency and Power, and therefore here not unfitly
denotes the <hi>Magistrate, the Ruler,</hi> him that hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Power above others. This is the person
that is commission'd here not to suffer Bloodshed to go
unpunish'd, but to return blood for blood: which is a
practice grounded on the Law of Reason and Equity,
which in such a case as this requires a just and equal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution.

one Charter depends the Execution of Justice against all

So that you see in this forecited place are contain'd
two of those Precepts which were said to be given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65397:72"/>

we have at this day. And this Calculation continu'd

thousand two hundred and threescore days.</hi> 4. What
I assert may be proved from the Absurdity of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Opinion; for if the <hi>antient Years</hi> were no longer
than our <hi>Months,</hi> then it would follow that some of
the Patriarchs begot Children when they were but six
or seven Years of Age; which appears undeniably from
the History of <hi>Moses,</hi> for <hi>Mahalaleel</hi> begat <hi>Iared,</hi> and
<hi>Enoch</hi> begat <hi>Methuselah</hi> at the Age of <hi>sixty five Years:</hi>
now if these <hi>Years</hi> were no other than <hi>Months,</hi> these
Persons were but five years of Age, and a little more,
when they begot Children; which is a thing that no
Man of sober thoughts will entertain. 5. According
to this Calculation the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> would have been very
short-lived. If Years were only so many Revolutions
of the Moon, it will follow that some of those Persons
mention'd in <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. lived not so long as we generally do
at this day. Nay, <hi>Methuselah</hi> himself, according to this
way of computing, had not arrived to a hundred Years,
which is a number that several reach even in this Age
of the World. Thus you see what Absurdities ensue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Some therefore taking notice of these absured Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
are forced to abandon this Conceit; but yet
they betake themselves to another, which is this. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
Years, say they, are so call'd either because they
are but <hi>one Month,</hi> or because they fall short of the

This will appear very Reasonable and Account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
if you consider,</p>
                     <p>1. That God gave them a longer space of time that
they might multiply Mankind, and replenish the Earth,

should live so long at least. But whether we admit of

Astronomy and other Arts could not be attain'd at first
in a short time. Long Observation was necessary for
this purpose, frequent and repeated Experiments being
the great Basis of most Arts. These therefore could not
be accomplish'd and perfected but by a large term of

                     <p>3. Their long Lives were serviceable to a higher and
a nobler purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> for the retaining and preserving of
Religion, and the true Worship of God, in a more
intire manner: for 'tis to be remembred that there was
no <hi>Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> then, and therefore Religion could not be

                        </gap>e <hi>Tradition.</hi> And that this was especially aim'd at and
designed by the Wisdom and Providence of God is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
hence, that as soon as the matchless Treasure of
Religion was deliver'd and secured to the World by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the <hi>Law</hi> to writing, the Age of Man was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
stinted, and reduced to a set Period. This shews
that one reason why the Dimensions of Mens Lives
were far longer in those days than they were afterwards,
was, that Religion might be the more surely kept up,
they having no Written Laws at that time. Therefore
these Living Laws (for such were the long-lived <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi>)
were requisite, whereby the Will of God was
communicated with great ease and advantage to all men.
This could be done even by <hi>Four</hi> Persons for the space of
2000 Years and more; for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Auditor was <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuselah,</hi>
whom <hi>Noah</hi> succeeded, and taught <hi>Shem,</hi>
and he those of his Age, even till the Year of the World
2160, or thereabouts: So compendious a way this was
of instructing the World, and upholding Religion in
it. But of this I shall speak afterwards.</p>
                     <p>4. Another ground of the Long Lives of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
before the Deluge was their Healthful Temper,
wherein they much exceeded others that follow'd them.
For tho we need not assert (as some have done) that
the <hi>Earth</hi> was not situated before the Flood as it is now,
that there were no Summers and Winters, but that
there was a perpetual <hi>Equinox</hi> all over the World; yet
this we may with good reason hold that there was a
greater Equality of Heat and Cold in those days, and,
as the consequent of that, there was a more constant
and uniform Temperature of Mens Bodies. For we
cannot but think that there was a great change caus'd
by that Universal Deluge which cover'd the Earth; this
could not but damp and chill the Air, and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
affect Mens Bodies, and contribute towards
the shortning of their Lives. But before this general
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65397:74"/>
Inundation they were healthful, and lived a long time.
And this Account which I give lets us see that this was
not a peculiar Donation to those Persons only whom
<hi>Moses</hi> mentions, but that it was vouchsafed to <hi>all</hi> that
lived in those early times.</p>
                     <p>5. I might add, that their Food was purer and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer
than that of the following Ages. The Fruits
of the Earth came up more kindly before the Deluge
than afterwards; for we cannot but conceive that they
were endamaged by the briny Waters of the Seas which
were let loose on the Ground. By this means the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of the Earth were not so nutritive as befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, not
so adjusted to the Constitutions and Tempers of Mens
Bodies, and thence the Plenitude of Years was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.</p>
                     <p>6. Their Health and Long-living may be ascrib'd to
their Temperance and Moderation; for their Diet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more simple and plain (consisting wholly of Herbs
and Plants, and such like Products of the Ground)
they were not tempted to that Excess which prevail'd
afterwards, when several sorts of curious and delicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Dishes were allow'd them. Hereupon follow'd Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness,
Intemperance, Luxury and Riot; and by
these the Hale Temper of Mens Bodies was impair'd,
and Diseases bred, and their Days shortned. But as
long as they continu'd sober and temperate, they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>and</hi> Japhet.</p>
                     <p>I could adjoin in the next place, that it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
they had greater Skill in <hi>Physick</hi> than there was
afterwards, tho they had seldom occasion to make use
of it. The Professors of the <hi>Spagyrick</hi> Art do indeed
tell us that the Longevity of the Patriarchs is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to their Skill in <hi>Chymistry</hi> (for it is of that
Antiquity they say) but it is to be question'd whether
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65397:75"/>
there was any such thing at that time: we may rather
content our selves with this belief, that they understood
well the Nature of Herbs and Plants, and had more
Time and Opportunity to study their Qualities and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
than Men since have; and thence perhaps
they made especial choice of such of them as were great
Strengthners of Nature, and upheld the Life of Man.</p>
                     <p>Again, their quiet and contented way of living con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
much to the lengthning of their Lives. They
were generally free from Care and Distraction, they
understood not the Intrigues and Perplexities which
vain Men are now plagu'd with. In those Golden
Times there was more Simplicity and Honesty, Men
were satisfied with a little, and could live at a cheap
rate. But afterwards the World was disorder'd, Mens
Desires and Wishes grew immoderate and extravagant,
and their Days were worn out with Troubles and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
This is the best Account I can give of the <hi>Long
Lives of the Patriarchs</hi> of the first Ages, and of the
shorter Term of Years of those that succeeded them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third Patriarchal Dispensation,</hi> or the <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamick

as to the main, and would not suffer himself to be born
down with the wicked Examples of others. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi>

seemed good to God to call him out of that place of
so great Temptation, and to command him to repair
to the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> When <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family and
Race were corrupted, he made choice of this Person
above the rest, and rais'd him up to profess the true
Doctrine and Worship. He vouchsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

made a Covenant with him, saying, <hi>Vnto thy
Seed have I given this Land,</hi> ver. 18. 5. God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd

Covenant, saying unto him after this manner, <hi>I am th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
And I will make my Covenant between me and thee, and
I will multiply thee exceedingly: and thou shalt be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their
Generations, for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God
unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</hi> Gen. 17. 1, 2, 4, 7.
And now it was that his name <hi>Abraham</hi> was given to
him, which signifies the <hi>Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This is a particular and distinct Account of God's
appearing to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of his gracious communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
himself to him. It is all in way of <hi>Covenant;</hi>
and accordingly what hath been said, may be reduced to
these two things: 1. What God promiseth to do on his
part. 2. What <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed were to do on
theirs. God promised in general that he would be a
God unto him, and to his Seed; yea, he would be an
Almighty or Alsufficient God to him; which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
all that can be said. But particularly, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
him these things: 1. To give him (<hi>i. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3. To bless all Nations of the Earth in his Seed. And
St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Sermon (<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 25, 26.) interprets
and explains this Blessing, speaking thus to the <hi>Iews,

the same Apostle, <hi>to walk worthy of the Lord unto all
pleasing,</hi> Col. 1. 10. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed,
by virtue of this Federal Transaction, were ingaged to
<hi>walk before God,</hi> to serve him in that way which was
most acceptable to him. This <hi>religious and spiritual
walking</hi> denoteth (as the <hi>bodily one</hi> generally doth)

which he is capable of in this Life.</p>
                     <p>We see then what it was that made <hi>this</hi> a <hi>peculiar

<hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>special</hi> and <hi>peculiar Promises</hi> to him

Here were new Discoveries and Manifestations concerning
the <hi>Messias, viz.</hi> That he should be of the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>

Nation and People,</hi> which shall be <hi>differenced</hi> from the

into Idolatry, and all sorts of Wickedness, set up
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed to stem the Torrent of Vice, to keep
up Religion pure and entire, and to maintain the true
Worship of God upon the Earth. The Church before
was not separated, and gathered from the rest of the
World, but was in common with it as to Place and Stock
till <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time. But now it is distinguish'd from
other Nations, and it is confined to one Race of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
among whom there shall constantly be some religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men, who are true and living Members of the
Church, and of whom at length the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Lord

                     <p>This Stock and Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> were called

said to be the <hi>Father of the Hebrews.</hi> But it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was also the <hi>Father</hi> of them; and
we cannot but acknowledg that his leaving his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and travelling into <hi>Canaan</hi> (where afterward his
Posterity settled) were most famous and remarkable
Occurrences, and might deservedly give him the name
of <hi>Gnibri</hi> the <hi>Traveller;</hi> whence the denomination of
the People descended from him is <hi>Hebrews.</hi> In this
Name is recorded the Rise of that Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> from

they were distinguish'd from all others by the bloody
Badg of <hi>Circumcision:</hi> which was another thing that
contributed towards the making this a <hi>new Dispensation.</hi>
It is true, this Rite was instituted first with relation to
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s particular Person; for in my judgment the
best Account is given by<note n="5" place="bottom">Qu. &amp; Resp. 102. ad Orthodox.</note> 
                        <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> of the <hi>primary</hi>
reason of this practice, <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>Abraham</hi> believ'd

                        </gap>t for Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and when his Wife was decrepid and barren; he
then believ'd (I say) that he should be a Father of a
Child: for that reason God gave him a Sign of this
nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the Circumcision of the Foreskin of that
part of his Body, which then through Age was useless as
to Procreation, but through Faith became otherwise.
But there are other Reasons (secondary ones, and some
of them mystical) which have reference, not only to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> but the People descended from him. 1. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was intended and appointed to be a Character
of Genealogical Sanctity, a special Mark of distinction

and the rest of the World. Therefore all the forty
Years the <hi>Israelites</hi> were in the Desert, they did not
make use of this distinguishing Mark, because then they
had no converse with other People, and so there was no
need of an external Note of distinction to discriminate
them from other Nations. 2. Circumcision (as hath
been suggested already) was a Sign and Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Promises made by God to them. Thence it
is called by God himself his <hi>Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17. 9, 10.
<hi>i. e.</hi> the Sign of it, as you read it explain'd in the next
Verse, <hi>It shall be a Token of the Covenant between you
and me.</hi> Thus this bloody Rite is call'd the <hi>Covenant
of Circumcision,</hi> Acts 7. 8. and the <hi>Sign of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
Rom. 4. 11. where the Apostle adds this high En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium
of it, that it is the <hi>Seal of the Righteousness
of Faith,</hi> i. e. of Justification and Pardon of Sin through
the free Mercy of God, for the sake of the promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Mark in that part of his Body, was to remind and
assure <hi>Abraham,</hi> that Christ should be born <hi>of his Seed.</hi>
3. It was reckon'd by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors as a kind of
an <hi>Oblation</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God, there being a taking
of something from the Body, and offering is to God:

                     <p>Some have thought it was an artificial Restraint of
Lust and Lewdness, and in the nature of the thing
it self was some check to Lasciviousness. This is but a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65397:79"/>
Fancy, for it is known that the People of that Nation
(and so of others since who use <hi>Circumcision</hi>) are none
of the chastest Men in the World, to say no worse. That
is another <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Notion, that Circumcision was
made in that part of their Flesh, to represent they were
to be a <hi>Holy Seed</hi> unto the Lord. But to speak with
Sobriety and Reason, <hi>Circumcision</hi> was appointed for
the ends at first mentioned; and lastly, to be a Symbol of
the <hi>inward and spiritual Circumcision,</hi> the <hi>Circumcision
of the Heart.</hi> Accordingly you read in the old Law
of <hi>circumcising the Foreskin of the Heart,</hi> Deut. 10.
16. &amp; 30. 6. and so in <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 4. And in the New
Testament the Apostle speaks of the <hi>Circumcision of the
Heart, in the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 2. 29. and of <hi>putting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ,</hi> Col. 2. 11. Hence observe why Sin is call'd <hi>a
Body,</hi> because it is represented by the <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Flesh</hi> in
Circumcision. When the Flesh of the Foreskin is cut
off, the taking away of Sin is signified; Sin is as it
were cut off by it. And in the <hi>13th</hi> Verse of that
Chapter the Apostle speaks thus, <hi>You being dead in your

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65397:80"/>
read not of <hi>Temples</hi> or <hi>Tabernacles</hi> under the Patriarchal
Dispensation; yet now their manner was to erect <hi>Altars</hi>
in those places where God appear'd to them: and these
were signalized for the future by dedicating them to the
publick Service of God. Here they were wont to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
together, to offer solemn Prayers and Praises to
the most High; and they became <hi>as it were, Temples and
Houses of God,</hi> Gen. 28. 17, 22. To the ordinary
Sacrifices before used, you will find that <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Iacob</hi> added another kind, <hi>viz.</hi> mere <hi>federal</hi> ones,
which are describ'd in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 9, 18. &amp; 31. 54.</p>
                     <p>Now also we first hear of <hi>Tithes: Abraham paid
Tithes of all (i. e.</hi> all the Spoils) to <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> a
Priest, <hi>Gen. 14. 20. Iacob</hi> made this Vow, <hi>I will
surely give the Tenth of all to thee,</hi> i. e. of all that
came of his Flock, or of the Fields, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 22.
Thus the paying Tithes became a Pledg of Religion,
and of subjection to God.</p>
                     <p>The Patriarchs now also used certain <hi>Ceremonial Lus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations</hi>
and <hi>Purifications,</hi> as may be gathered from
<hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2, 3. Jacob <hi>said unto his Houshold, Be clean,
and change your Garments: and let us arise and go up
to</hi> Bethel. I might add the Ceremony used in Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>putting the hand under the thigh of the
Person they swore to,</hi> Gen. 24. 2. Also, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
there were at that time <hi>Holy Feasts of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Sacrifices,</hi> Exod. 5. 1. All these were Rites

with evident truth, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>'s taking of
other Wives or Concubines differ'd from the same
custom and practice of that time in three things, which
much alters the case. 1. They did not this of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

                        <p>The Mosaick or Jewish Dispensation seems to be
Preposterous. The Law of Grace was veiled
for a season. The Triple Law which this
Oeconomy was famous for, briefly display'd.
Four Reasons assigned why the World was so
long without a Written Law. The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law is part of this Dispensation. The
several things which are comprehended in it.
Oblations, viz. of Inanimate things. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
which were of Living Creatures. An
enumeration of those Sacrifices which were Set
and Determined. Others were Occasional,

3. Peace-Offerings. Some Remarks
about Sacrifices. The several Ends and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of this way of Worship. How the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Sacrifices are said to Expiate. It is
largely proved that the guilt of all kinds of
Sins whatsoever was Atoned by them. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
to the contrary are answered. The
Principal End of the Judaick Sacrifices was to
typifie and represent the Sacrifice of Christ on
the Cross.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe <hi>Second Dispensation of Grace</hi> is that which
is known by the name of <hi>Iewish, Mosaick,</hi> or
<hi>Legal.</hi> Concerning which we may observe this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we go any further, that though this Oeconomy
in some respects was not so perfect as the <hi>Abrahamick,</hi>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:65397:82"/>
yet it was introduced after it. The Promise made to
<hi>Abraham</hi> was of Justification by Faith in Christ Jesus, as
the Apostle, who best understood it, expounds it in
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. where he calls it<note n="1" place="bottom">Ver. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>the Covenant confirmed before
of God in Christ,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that Covenant whereby the
Faithful were engaged to believe <hi>in Christ</hi> for Salvation.
But then comes <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> and seems to establish
Justification by the Works of it. So God was pleas'd
to go back as it were. You will find the Apostle taking
special notice of this in <hi>Gal. 3. 17, 19. The Covenant
that was confirm'd before of God in Christ, the Law which
was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul.—
Wherefore then serveth the Law: It was added because
of Transgressions, till the Seed should come,</hi> &amp;c. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
them here with the Reason of this strange and
preposterous Transaction, <hi>viz.</hi> Why <hi>Moses</hi> succeeded
<hi>Abraham,</hi> why the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law came after the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made and confirm'd of God in Christ. There
was a necessity of it, as things then were: <hi>The Law was
added,</hi> i. e. it followed the Promise made to <hi>Abraham,
because of transgressions:</hi> as much as to say, though
<hi>Iustification</hi> was then and ever to be had by that Promise
to the Father of the Faithful, yet the <hi>Mosaick O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

took place four hundred and thirty years afterwards, to
restrain men from Sin, to shew them their Guilt, and to
cause them to look for a Remedy. The <hi>Law</hi> was given
so long after the Covenant of Grace renewed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
because the infinitely Wise Disposer of all things
knew that it would be serviceable in discovering Sin and
Transgression, and so in preparing men for the Gospel.
Thus it was found requisite to go back a little, for the
Law of Faith could not have its free course and progress
till the Law of Works was as it were brought upon the
stage again. There seem'd to be a Representation of

are not such: and some of those call'd <hi>Iudicial,</hi> deserve

by the <hi>Moral Law</hi> we understand those Precepts and
Commands by the observance of which men are madere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Good and Virtuous. The <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> is the <hi>Iews
Canon Law,</hi> and directs them in their external Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in Religious Worship, and tells them what Rites
and Usages they must observe. By the <hi>Iudicial Law</hi>
we understand the <hi>Civil Law</hi> of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, as
<hi>Ius Civile</hi> is taken for the Particular Law of every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
State: This contains those Constitutions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
which respect Publick Justice, and acquaints men
what is Right and Equitable in their Dealings and
Commerce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with one another. The first of these are
such Precepts and Prohibitions as are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The Second are indifferent in their own Nature,
but are so far good as they are commanded by a Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Law of God. The third sort are of a mixt Nature,
being partly in their own nature good, and partly indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>

but that the Characters of the Law were the first that
ever were in the World, and consequently that now
God taught men to write, I do not see how why man
can disprove me. But this we are sure of, that from
<hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> (which is above 2000 years) there was
no <hi>Written Word of God</hi> to direct the World. The
Church was without Scriptures. God's Will which

and kept up by <hi>Tradition.</hi> If it be demanded why
God suffer'd the World to live so long without a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Law, and what was the Reason of the writing of the
Law at last; I answer,</p>
                     <p>1. The long Lives of the Patriarchs (as hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated

no Written Law for so long a time. There was a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
and Society of many Seniors living many hundred
years together with one another. <hi>Adam</hi> lived with
<hi>Seth</hi> 800 years, with <hi>Enes</hi> 695, with <hi>Cainan</hi> 605, with
<hi>Mahalaleel</hi> 535, with <hi>Iared</hi> 470, with <hi>Methuselah</hi> 243,

who was both before and after the Flood: he lived

Lives. But the Vices of men grew proportionable to
their Numbers: and when Mankind was spread wide
up and down the Earth, Immorality and Sin were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
likewise, and the World became notoriously wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Deluge did not wash away the Contagion, but
in a considerable time after men were as bad as ever, and
the very Dictates of their Reasonable nature were discar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by them. When they had thus obliterated the Law
written on their minds, God thence ingraved it on Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of Stone. If men had not been wonderfully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
there had been no need of this. So faith the
Apostle, speaking of this Law, <hi>It was not made for
the Righteous, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the
ungodly and for sinners,</hi> I Tim. 1. 9. The same he
had intimated before in <hi>Gal. 3. 19. The Law was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
because of transgression;</hi> it was given to be a Check
to their notorious Sins, and that they might not offend
uncontroul'd. And this may be the meaning of the
Apostle's words in <hi>Rom. 5. 20. The Law entred, that
the Offence might abound,</hi> i. e. that men might see how
their Sins abounded. God gave his Law in Writing,
to shew them their Guilt, to convince them of their
gross Miscarriages, and to reduce them to the way of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65397:85"/>
Virtue and Obedience, that when God himself had
writ down their Duty with his own hand, they might
be inexcusable.</p>
                     <p>3. The Law was committed to Writing that it might
not be forgot.<note n="3" place="bottom">Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

the Written Law than with it; <hi>it was a mark of God's
love and favour that they had no books and writings,</hi>
I suppose he means because they did not need them. But
afterwards there was occasion for them; for the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Law of Nature were almost defaced and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated;
the Instructions and Traditions of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were neglected; and the knowledg of God and
their Duty could not be kept pure by Oral Tradition,
when not only their Lives were short, but corrupted
and miserably depraved. Therefore an exact Written
Law was wanting, to set before their eyes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind
them of what they were to do, to put them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
in remembrance of what God required of them.

was written that it might not be corrupted. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was unsafe when the numbers of men were increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and the World was dispersed, and arrived to a great
height of Impiety. Therefore God thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to preserve and perpetuate the Law by Ingraving it
on Tables of Stone, which are Solid and Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65397:86"/>
was the best way to prevent all Error and Imposture, all
Fraud and Corruption about the Law. This made it a
thing impossible to deprave and pervert the Letter and
plain Sense of it. For <hi>these Reasons</hi> that Word, which
for near 25 Centuries of Years was delivered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged
by Tradition, was committed to Writing in
<hi>Moses</hi>'s time, and not before. For these Reasons the

                     <p>I will not here speak particularly of the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
because in the Body of the Work which I
intend, I am obliged to insist upon every one of them
distinctly and largely: and also because it is the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
of the Moral Law (of which I have given you an
Account) not the Law it self, that is part of this <hi>Mosaick
Dispensation,</hi> as it is different from those which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The Ten Command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that they were of no force before this time: but now
they were <hi>Written</hi> on Tables, and more Solemnly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulg'd.
This was it which we were to take notice of
as New, and proper to <hi>this Iudaical Period.</hi> If any

I could silence that surmise, by shewing that these
Commandments were in force before the Law given by
<hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that every one of them was a
Law before the <hi>Mosaick Oeconomy,</hi> and that those who
lived in all the former Dispensations observed these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.
Nay, they are all of them, excepting
only the Determination of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, the very
Law of Nature, written on the heart of man at his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
They are Dictates of Natural Reason, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ought to be done though they were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
For this Reason likewise it is not proper to
insist upon them in this place: for they are no special
part of this Oeconomy. But the <hi>Cerem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will hasten to speak.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ceremonial</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical Law</hi> is no other than
the Precepts given by God to the <hi>Iews</hi> concerning Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Rites belonging to Religion and the Worship of
God. Of these <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Usages several were in use
before <hi>Moses</hi>'s time, <hi>viz.</hi> Priests, Altars, Sacrifices,
Oblations, Tithes, Distinction of Clean and Unclean
Animals, Not Eating Blood, Circumcision. But now
all the former Rites and Ceremonies are digested into
One Body, and are become more Fixed and Certain.

It was offer'd every Morning and Evening with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Sacrifices; and at other times it was generally
join'd with all bloody Sacrifices. The like kind of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was called <hi>Libum.</hi> The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of the things before mentioned, were sometimes,
stiled <hi>Terumoth,</hi> or <hi>Heave-offerings,</hi> from the manner
of offering them, <hi>viz.</hi> by holding them up, and by
shaking them up and down, to signisy (say the Jews)
that God was Lord of Heaven and Earth: For <hi>Terumah</hi>
was an Offering to God of something they had received,
to acknowledg God's Dominion over the whole Earth,
and to set forth his Praise and Honour. It was an <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of God with their Substance,</hi> and a thankful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the Blessings they enjoyed in so good a
Land. The Oblations of these things were sometimes
also called <hi>Tenuphoth,</hi> or <hi>Wave-Offerings,</hi> because they
used this kind of gesture in offering them, they waved
them to and fro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the right to the left, East and
West, North and South: and this also was to declare,
that God was Lord of the whole World. These Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were instituted by God as an Acknowledgment,
that the Fruits of the Earth which they enjoy'd were
from him. The <hi>liquid things</hi> which were offered to
God, were Water, Wine, Oil, and Blood: The way
of offering these Liquors was partly by effusion; they
poured out the Water, Oil, and Blood, and some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Wine on the ground, and spilt them about
the Altar, and upon the Sacrifices. Thence that of
the Apostle may be understood, <hi>If I be poured forth</hi>

and <hi>Hostia.</hi> These Sacrifices, properly so call'd,
were Animals kill'd, and then burnt. These Animals
used in Scripture were either Terrestrial, or AErial,
Beasts or Birds. Of Beasts there were these three kinds
only, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bull, or Cow, or Ox, which made but
one kind; the Goat or Kid; the sheep or Lamb;
(and this may be observ'd, that a <hi>Lamb</hi> is applied to
the young ones both of <hi>Goats</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi> Exod. 12. 5.)
The <hi>Iewish Masters</hi> take notice, that these were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Cattel that were used in Sacrifice, because they are
mild and tame Creatures. God made choice, say they,
of those Animals that are driven by others, not those
that drive and worry others, as the Lion, the Wolf,
the Leopard. Whence they make a good moral Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that those are the Elect of God, and are fit to
be offer'd unto him, who are of a meek and patient
Spirit. Tho I believe the true reason why Bulls, Sheep
and Goats were the standing Sacrifices, was this, that
they were obvious and easy to be had. Of <hi>Birds</hi> or
<hi>Fowls,</hi> they sacrificed Pigeons, and Turtle Doves, and
some add the Sparrow. But this is certain, that if we
reckon not this last among <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> we must put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the number of <hi>Oblations.</hi>

3. Some were <hi>Weekly,</hi> offer'd every <hi>Sabbath:</hi> for we

the <hi>Iews</hi> to offer more on this day than on any other,
<hi>Num.</hi> 28. 9, 10. Two Lambs were sacrificed both in
the morning and in the evening, and a double portion
of Flower and Wine. 4. There was the <hi>Daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
Hatamid, <hi>Iuge Sacrificium,</hi> Dan. 8. 11. Two of these
were offer'd every day, <hi>viz.</hi> a Lamb in the Morning and
a Lamb in the Evening, <hi>Ex.</hi> 29. 38. but this Lamb is
taken in a Large sense, for it might be either of the <hi>Sheep</hi>
or of the <hi>Goats.</hi> The Morning Sacrifice was offer'd at
the Third hour, i. e. Nine a clock in the Morning: and
the Evening Sacrifice at the Ninth hour, i. e. Three a
clock in the Afternoon. This latter is said to be offer'd

the precise Time of offering, which was not determin'd
by the Law. These were either after the Commission of
some Sins against the <hi>Iewish</hi> Law, or after the Receipt of
some particular Mercies. The <hi>first,</hi> I say, were offered
when some Sin against the Law was committed: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

because it was appointed to be offer'd for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating
of a Sin of Infirmity and Inadvertency, or of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Error. The latter of them is named <hi>Asham,</hi>
a <hi>Trespass-Offering,</hi> because it was commanded to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
for the Expiating of a Trespass knowingly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

a Voluntary, Deliberate Sin, and therefore it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of faults of an high nature, and <hi>Asham</hi> for those
of an inferiour sort; <hi>More Nev. P. 3. C. 46.</hi> There
are other Reasons given of the Names of these two <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acular
Sacrifices:</hi> particularly Mr. <hi>Mede (Discourse 49.)</hi>
thinks that the <hi>Trespass-Offering</hi> was for sins against the
First Table, and the <hi>Sin-Offering</hi> was for sins against the
Second. Some of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors distinguish other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
and indeed there is no great Certainty here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the most Learned Writers that I have met with.
I might observe to you further concerning these Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that they were partly Burnt, and partly went to the
use of the <hi>Priests,</hi> who in the <hi>Atrium</hi> of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi>
or <hi>Temple</hi> sed upon them, <hi>i. e.</hi> when the Sacrifice was
for a particular Person. But if it was for the People or
the Priest himself, it was All of it Burnt to Ashes.</p>
                     <p>The Second sort of <hi>Occasional Sacrifices</hi> was upon
the actual Receiving some particular Mercy from God,
or upon good hopes and expectations of the arrival of
some singular Benefit and Favour. These were generally
call'd <hi>Shelamim, Peace-Offerings,</hi> or <hi>Sacrifices of Peace:</hi>
and they were either <hi>Eucharistical, i. e.</hi> Voluntary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
to return <hi>Thanks</hi> to God for the benefits they had
receiv'd; or they were <hi>Euctical, i. e.</hi> attended with <hi>Wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>
and <hi>Prayers</hi> for New Mercies and Benefits. Both
these kinds of Sacrifices were <hi>Free-will Offerings,</hi> and of
<hi>Choice.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Holocaust</hi> was all of it consumed
in the fire, and nothing was left; and whereas part of
the <hi>Sin-Offering</hi> was burnt, and another part was given
to the Priest, here it is otherwise; for these Sacrifices
were distributed into three parts, one part, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Fat
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65397:90"/>
and the Kidneys and Blood) was burnt to God on
the Altar for a sweet favour: another part was the Priests,
to him belonged the right shoulder, the breast, the two
cheeks or jaws, the tongue, and the maw: the third
part, <hi>viz.</hi> the rest of the flesh, and the skin were for the
use of those that gave the Peace-Offering, and such as
they pleas'd to call to partake with them: so that always
after the <hi>Peace-Offering</hi> follow'd a <hi>Feast</hi> made of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of the Sacrifice. Yet there was some difference
as to the <hi>Peace-Offerings of the Congregation</hi> (which were
for the whole People) and the <hi>Peace-Offerings of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Persons.</hi> In the former the Blood of them was
sprinkled, and only the Inwards burnt, and the Flesh
not eaten by the persons who offer'd them, but only by
the Priests in the Court: but in the latter (which were
Private Sacrifices) it was not so. It is to be noted that
those parts of the flesh which were not appointed to be
consumed on the Altar, but to be eaten by the Priests
and the persons that brought the Sacrifices, were not
roasted, but <hi>sodden, Num. 6. 19. 1 Sam. 2. 13. 2. Chron.
35. 13.</hi> Observe also that whereas Males only might eat
of the Sin-Offering and <hi>Trespass-Offering,</hi> Women were
admitted to the <hi>Peace-Offerings.</hi> Note this too, that
these Sacrifices were of Beasts of both Sexes, but the
<hi>Burnt-Offerings</hi> were of the Males only.</p>
                     <p>I might add this, as having relation to the <hi>Discourse
of Sacrifices,</hi> that the Fire which kindled them at first
came down from Heaven, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9. 24. This was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
kept, and not suffer'd to go out: and any Fire
but this was accounted<note n="3" place="bottom">Lev. 10. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Strange Fire.</hi> It is thought
that That Celestial Fire was preserv'd in some Vessel
whilst the <hi>Israelites</hi> were in the Wilderness, and so was
continued till <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple was finished: and then
Fire came down again from Heaven, and consumed the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65397:90"/>
Sacrifices, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 1. This was preserv'd till the
<hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, and afterwards renewed, 2 <hi>Macc.</hi>
1. 22.</p>
                     <p>Here the <hi>Difference</hi> between the <hi>Patriarchal Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and the <hi>Mosaick ones</hi> might be taken notice of. The
<hi>Patriarchs</hi> had no other Expiatory Sacrifices but <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>causts</hi>
or <hi>Burnt-Offerings,</hi> as is clear from several places.
Besides, there were Anniversary, Monthly, and Weekly
Sacrifices among the <hi>Iews,</hi> but we know not that there
was any such thing before the <hi>Law.</hi> And some <hi>other</hi> Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
the Reader may gather from the particulars
aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of these <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are chiefly
to be inquired into: (where we shall also see a further
<hi>Difference</hi> in some things between the <hi>Mosaical</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal</hi> Sacrifices) Let us see to <hi>What Purpose</hi> all those
Bloody Offerings were appointed, let us acquaint our
selves with the <hi>Design</hi> of Heaven in it. First, They
were (as the Fruits of the Earth) intended as Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
that God was their Benefactor. He gave
these Animals as well as those Fruits, and therefore it was
fit to offer these as well as the others. 2. If we speak
concerning the Continual Morning and Evening Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
it is certain they were <hi>Symbolical,</hi> they were a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of God's Presence among them. They were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
as a Testimony of This, as you read in <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.
38, to the end. They were a Sign that the Lord would
be continually with them, and be their God. 3. The
Mosaical Sacrifices were to testifie what the <hi>Iews</hi> deserved
for their Sins, <hi>viz.</hi> Death. By these Bloody Oblations
it was signified that the Life of Beasts should expiate
for the Life of Men who had sinned, and were become
worse than Beasts. Sheep and Oxen were substituted in
the room of Offenders: these sinned, and those were
slain. Though this could not be evidently discover'd by
Natural Light (as hath been said) yet now, upon God's
declaring in the <hi>Law,</hi> the nature of these Sacrifices, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65397:91"/>
that this was one design of them. Those Legal
Sacrifices were a kind of Confession of their Guilt. By
killing their Beasts they did as 'twere acknowledg that
themselves deserved to be used so. 4. The Mosaical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
were <hi>Federal Rites,</hi> and design'd to signify the
Correspondence and Agreement between God and Man.
To which purpose you may observe that as part of the
<hi>Shelamim,</hi> the <hi>Peace-Offerings,</hi> was burnt on the Altar,
so the remainder and greater part were eaten by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that brought it, to shew that it was truly a <hi>Sacrifice
of Peace,</hi> a Ceremony of <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Friendship</hi>
with God, a Token of Fellowship and Amity between
God and Man. As for the <hi>Holocaust,</hi> that indeed was
all of it burnt; but there was a <hi>Meat-Offering</hi> and <hi>Drink-Offering</hi>
annexed to it, to denote Familiarity and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
to shew that they were Guests in God's House, or
rather that they were of his Family, and were fed at his
Table, and eat of his <hi>Meat</hi> (as the Sacrifices are call'd in
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 10.) and Houshold Provision.</p>
                     <p>Again, the great Design of the Mosaick Sacrifices was
to <hi>Expiate</hi> and <hi>Atone.</hi> Not only <hi>Burnt-Offerings</hi> or
<hi>Helocausts,</hi> but all <hi>Free-will-Offerings</hi> were <hi>Expiatory,</hi>
notwithstanding what <hi>Crellius</hi> affirms, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
were <hi>Eucharistical,</hi> and therefore were not <hi>Expiatory.</hi>
But we must know that That Epithet doth not respect
the <hi>End</hi> which those Sacrifices were design'd for, but the
occasion of their Offering them. As for the name of
<hi>Peace-Offerings,</hi> that was given to this sort of Sacrifices,
not only because they were offer'd in way of Return for
their <hi>Peace, i. e.</hi> (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word denotes) their
Safety and Welfare which were vouchsafed to them, but
because the offering of them did also procure Peace with
God, and did assure them of the like Blessing for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the same Propitious Hand. And therefore tho
in <hi>another Dispensation</hi> I distinguish'd between <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical</hi>
and <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices,</hi> yet there is no reason
to do so here, when I am speaking of the <hi>Mosaick Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:65397:91"/>
all or most of which have on them the evident
marks and tokens of <hi>Expiation.</hi> They were appointed
to propitiate and appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e God's Wrath, and therefore
might all of them be call'd <hi>Pacifick,</hi> as well as some.
That these <hi>Peace-Offerings were Expiatory,</hi> is proved from this, that here was putting the Beast to Death, here
was Sprinkling the Blood, here was the Consumption
of some part of the Beast on the Altar as an Oblation to
God, which are the three Ingredients of an <hi>Expiatory
Sacrifice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what was this <hi>Expiation</hi> which was made
by the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Sacrifices? I answer, It was threesold:
1. In respect of <hi>Corporal Punishment.</hi> The Sanction of
the whole Mosaick Law is express'd in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26.
Gal. 3. 10. <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in
all things which are written in the book of the Law to do
them.</hi> Which Curse imports no less then Death it self,
besides all the miseries of this life. But God was pleas'd
to mitigate the rigour of this Sanction; and whereas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the strictness of the Law those who were
found guilty of violating it were to Die, this was not put
in Execution, but <hi>Beasts</hi> were appointed to suffer death
for the Offenders, and their death was accepted for the death of Sinners.
2. These Sacrifices <hi>Expiated</hi> as to
<hi>Legal and Bodily Impurities,</hi> which separated them from
publick Converse and Worship. Such were Leprosy,
Touching the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence the Author of the
Epistle to the <hi>Hebr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

(which is the most considerable thing of all) <hi>Expiated</hi> for
<hi>Moral Impurities, viz.</hi> all sorts of Sins.</p>
                     <p>I know it is asserted by some Men of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when they discourse of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> that the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick</hi>

great Offences were not expiated by Scarifices. This

Sins, not for<note n="1" place="bottom">De Servat. par. 2. cap. 9.</note> great ones. And<note n="2" place="bottom">De. V. Rel. l. 2. cap. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Volkelius</hi> and other
profes'd <hi>Socinians,</hi> insist upon the same thing, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to prove, that Sacrifices were offer'd only for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating
of Sins of Lgnorance, Weakness and Error, and
that Death was the Penalty of all great and enormous
Offences. The same is defended by<note n="3" place="bottom">Cont. Frantz. Disp. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Smalcius,</hi> as the
Reader may find it in his Writing. And we are told

and involuntary Transgressions, such as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Ignorance and Inadvertency, but not for Sins
of Presumption, and such as were committed with
an high hand. If Men sinned wilfully, there was
no Sacrifice appointed by the Law for such Sins.</q>

with him, saying, <q>The greater Crimes under the
Law were no otherwise to be expiated but by the
Blood of the Offender himself: whereas for lesser
ones the Blood of Beast was accepted.</q> And this
passes for a general Opinion with us, and not without
a great shew of Reason, for it seems to be founded on
the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law it self: there we see that Idolatry,
Murder, Blasphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were always punish'd with

                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:65397:92"/>
Levit. 7. 20, 21. There was no Sacrifice admitted for
<hi>Adultery,</hi> or for <hi>disobeying of Parents:</hi> In short, Sins
of <hi>Ignorance</hi> only were expiated by the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
but all Sins of <hi>Presumption</hi> remain'd unatoned;
which they prove from <hi>Numb. 15. 28, 30. The Priest
shall make an atonement for the Soul that sinneth igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly.
But the Soul that doth ought presumptuously
shall be cut off from among his People.</hi> So that Sins of
Obstinacy and Malice had no Sacrifice allow'd: the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
were either put to death by the Magistrate, or cut off by God.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding all this that is alledged, it seems
to me very evident, that the guilt of <hi>all</hi> Sins whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
if they were heartily repented of, was atoned by
the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Sacrifices. For when those of the other
Opinion say there was no Expiation for greater Sins, it
must be meant either of Internal or External Sins.
Now it is generally confess'd, that God appointed Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and Expiations for the greatest Sins of the Heart
and Mind, as Unbelief, blasphemous Thoughts, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Imaginations, desires of Murder, uncleanness of
the Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for even some of the best Men it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were not free from these mental Pollutions. Who
can imagine that there was no atonement for these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law? Can we think that all perish'd who were
at any time guilty of these? No certainly; they were
pardon'd through God's Mercy upon Repentance, and
the appointed means of sacrificing. And as for visible
and outward gross Enormities, tho there may seem to
be no provision made in the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation,
because the Offenders were presently punish'd
with Death; yet it doth not follow thence, that there
was no Expiation for those notorious Crimes, for they
might be expiated, tho it was fitting and necessary that
they should be animadverted upon by a severe Penalty,
le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t Impunity should encourage Men in Sin and Vice.
When we find then in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, that such as were
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65397:93"/>
guilty of Adultery, Murder, Incest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from Capital Punishment; we cannot thence
infer that Sacrifices purg'd none from the guilt of these
Enormities, and that the Legal Offerings were design'd
only to expiate for smaller Aberrations: for the reason
why those great Offenders were punish'd, was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there were no Sacrifices and Oblations to clear them
of their Guilt, but because it was requisite Death should
be the Recompence of those Crimes, lest the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
should be endamaged and ruined by suffering
such to go unpunish'd. But even the guilt of these hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Sins, if those that committed them sincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of them, was expiated by those <hi>daily Offerings</hi>
which were made for the Sins of the People, and by the
frequent <hi>Trespass-Offerings,</hi> notwithstanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of the corporal Punishment. The Propitiatory
Sacrifices were available even to those who suffer'd for
their Sins. They were able through God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to remove the Guilt, the not the Punishment.</p>
                     <p>Is it not acknowledg'd (and that because it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
from several Instances) that the Crimes of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have been forgiven and pardon'd, tho they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were not exempted from the Penalty? <hi>Moses</hi>'s
Death was the Recompence of his Unbelief, tho none
doubts of his expiring in the Divine Favour. <hi>David</hi>
was punish'd with the Death of his Child, tho we read
that his Sin was pardon'd. <hi>Iosiah</hi> was justly snatch'd
away in Battel, because he ingag'd in it against the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will and Command; but yet he <hi>died in peace,</hi> i. e.
in the Favour of God, and was transmitted to the place
of Everlasting Peace and Happiness. Wherefore I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hence, that tho Death was made by <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law
the penal Consequence of Adultery, Disobedience to
Parents, Violation of the Sabbath Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet whoever
among such Criminals as these turn'd unto God by an
unfeign'd detestation of the Sins they committed, had
without doubt the benefit of the Legal Sacrifices, which
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65397:93"/>
expiated the Offences of all true Penitents tho they were
never so great.</p>
                     <p>And the reason is this, because this Institution or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Sacrificing was the standing means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in the Jewish Dispensation; and therefore it was
requisite that the influence of it should extend to <hi>all</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
that were heartily sorry for their Offences, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd
their past Crimes, yea and themselves for being
guilty of them. This we must grant, unless we will
say, that no heinous Sinners under the Law were ever
pardon'd and receiv'd to <hi>Mercy:</hi> which is an assertion
that is easily baffled by a great many Instances which the
Old Testament records. It was in the was of <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
that these Persons had their Guilt remitted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated,
for there was no other Expedient or Remedy at
that time, as we are assured, not only from the End and
Design of instituting the Sacrifices, which was to take
away Sin, but from those express words of the Apostle,
(which refer to this manner of Expiation) <hi>without
shedding of Blood there is no Remission,</hi> Heb. 9. 22. This
then being the only way of <hi>Remission</hi> and <hi>Pardon</hi> of
Sin, it was certainly efficacious; and even those who
<hi>were cut off from their People,</hi> (tho this Doom doth not
always signify immature Death, and therefore can't be
absolutely made use of here) or were <hi>cut off from the
Land of the Living,</hi> and their Sins atoned by the Law of
Sacrifices, supposing (as hath been said before) that
they repented from their Hearts of their vile and flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Miscarriages.</p>
                     <p>And this may be further made good from that plain
distinction of <hi>Chattah</hi> and <hi>Asham,</hi> the <hi>Sin Offering</hi> and
the <hi>Trespass Offering,</hi> the one being design'd to remove
the Guilt of petty Declensions, the other to make sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for gross and enormous Crimes. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
this is plain from <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 4, 15. where Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
are commanded to be offer'd for great Crimes, as
<hi>unlawful swearing</hi> and <hi>sacrilege.</hi> And the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65397:94"/>
Oblation in <hi>Levit. 16. 16, &amp;c.</hi> was not only for their
<hi>Vncleannesses,</hi> but for for <hi>their Transgressions in all their Sins.</hi>
But as for the <hi>sin of Presumption,</hi> or <hi>sinning with a high
hand,</hi> (as 'tis in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) Numb. 15. 30. it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in this place <hi>Impenitence</hi> and <hi>final Obstinacy;</hi>
and therefore it is no wonder that there was no <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
for it, for even the Alsufficient Merit of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
doth not expiate for this Sin; but all other Sins
were atoned by Sacrifices. I see no reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and therefore I beg leave to dissent from those
who assert, that these Sacrifices <hi>expiated</hi> only for <hi>lesser
Sins</hi> and <hi>Failings,</hi> and not for the <hi>greater ones</hi> of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
idolatry, Murder, Blasphemy, and the like. It is
not to be doubted that all kinds and degrees of Sin
were expiated by the legal Sacrifices; not only corporal
Punishment (in the sense which I have explain'd) and
legal Uncleanness, but all moral Impurity and Guilt
were taken away by them. But this the Mosaick Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
did not do of themselves, but by virtue only of the
Expiatory Sacrifice of the <hi>MESSIAS</hi> to come, of
which they were but Shadows. To speak properly and
strictly, they did not really and formally, but typically
expiate, <hi>i. e.</hi> as they were Significations and Figures of
that great Sacrifice to be offer'd.</p>
                     <p>Lastly then, the grand and principal End of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical
Sacrifices was to typify and represent the Sacrifice
of <hi>Christ</hi> on the Cross. <hi>Socinus</hi> denies not that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary
Sacrifice on the <hi>Day of Expiation</hi> was a Type
of Christ'<hi>s</hi> Death: But as for the other common and
usual Sacrifices, he<note n="1" place="bottom">De Christo Servatore, cap. 9.</note> holds that Christ was not prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
by them, but that the Spiritual Sacrifices of
Christians were only typified thereby. This is a gross
Error, for the Burnt-Offerings, and Sin-Offerings, and
Peace-Offerings, which were common and frequent,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65397:94"/>
were <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices</hi> (as I shew'd before) and they
were as much <hi>Expiatory</hi> as that which was but once a
Year. Now, being <hi>Expiatory,</hi> they, as <hi>such,</hi> were
Types of the great Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Lamb
of God, they prefigured Christ's Death, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
and Satisfaction which he was to make for Sin.
It is a strange thing therefore to me that <hi>Socinus,</hi> who
denies Christ to be a Propitiatory Sacrifice, should grant
that the Sacrifice which the High Priest offer'd once a
Year, entring into the Holy of Holies, prefigured the
Death of Christ; for the same reason he ought to
grant, that all the Expiatory Sacrifices of the Law were
Types of our Saviour. And he could not but see that
the Holy Ghost in Scripture doth, not only speak of that
Annual Sacrifice as a prefiguration of Christ's Passion,
and apply it expresly to him in <hi>Heb. 9. 12. By his own
Blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e entred in once into the Holy Place;</hi> but the
same Infallible Spirit in that Epistle, applieth what is
said of the <hi>other Sacrifices</hi> unto Christ: Therefore the
Apostle saith, <hi>Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. 7. Therefore <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> call'd our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<hi>the Lamb of God who takes away the Sins of the
World,</hi> John 1. 29. having respect, without doubt, to
the Expiatory Sacrifices of the Old Testament, which
prefigured Christ the true Immaculate Lamb, <hi>the Lamb
that was slain</hi> (as the same inspired Writer speaks)
<hi>from the Foundation of the World,</hi> Rev. 13. 8. Christ's
Offering was the Idea and Pattern of all the Levitical
and Mosaical Sacrifices. To this very end God insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<hi>these,</hi> that they might shadow out <hi>that</hi> to us. A
greater and better Sacrifice, and Oblation of a higher
nature was to succeed those, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sacrifice of Christ
Jesus, by which God is appeased, and all our Sins are
expiated: and therefore the Phrase of <hi>a sweet-smelling
Savour</hi> applied to Expiatory Sacrifices under the Law,
is used (and that properly) by the Apostle concerning
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65397:95"/>
Christ his giving up<note n="1" place="bottom">Ephes. 5. 2.</note> himself for us, and pacifying God's
Wrath on our behalf. That the Legal Sacrifices were
Types and Symbols of spiritual things, is acknowledg'd
by<note n="2" place="bottom">De Victimis.</note> 
                        <hi>Philo;</hi> but we who have an infallible information
from the New Testament are taught further, <hi>viz.</hi> that
they were Types of Christ the great Sacrifice. And we
have the greatest reason imaginable to assent to this,
because the Blood of Bulls and Goats was a poor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
of it self. That Butchery, that bloody Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
could have no real and intrinsick worth in it,
and therefore it must needs have been in order to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else; it was to prefigure the expiatory Death and
Sacrifice of the <hi>Massias.</hi> And all the time that these
Mosaick Sacrifices lasted, they did not pacify God's
Anger, and satisfy his Justice, and take away Sin, and
justify Persons by their own Force and Virtue, or by
their own worthiness; but they did all this typically and
mystically, as they represented <hi>Christ</hi> and his Merit,
who was the <hi>Great Sacrifice;</hi> they did it by Divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Institution.</p>

was in common with that of the <hi>Priests</hi> (of whom
afterwards) to pray for, instruct and bless the People:
but his peculiar Province was to preside over the Priests
and other inferior Officers of the Church, to take care
that they discharg'd their Function aright. Whereas
these administred daily, he was obliged to officiate on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the solemn Day of <hi>Expiation.</hi> He differ'd from
them in the manner of his <hi>Consecration,</hi> and was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
in some other things. He had the singular honour
to be the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of the Jewish Church, and the

                     </p>
                     <p>To make him more pompous and venerable, the <hi>Law</hi>

this <hi>Sacred Wardrobe,</hi> (and truly if the Holy Ghost in
Scripture was pleas'd to make mention of it, and to
describe it, it cannot be improper here to repeat it) and
then leave <hi>Origen, Ierom, Durandus, Erasmus,</hi> and
others, to comment upon the several Parts, and to give
you the moral and mystical Sense of them. 1. There
were <hi>Linen Breeches</hi> which the High Priest was injoin'd
to wear <hi>to cover his nakedness,</hi> Exod. 28. 42. that is, that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65397:96"/>
his secret Parts might not be exposed, whenever it
chanced that the Wind blew up his upper Garments:
for the Men in those <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries wore long Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
hanging down low, without Breeches; whence
we read that <hi>David</hi> was <hi>uncover'd</hi> in those Parts when
he danc'd before the Ark, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20. That the
High Priest therefore might not be liable to this Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and Inconvenience, when he administred in Sacred
things, or at any other time, he was commanded to
wear these <hi>Bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ches</hi> or <hi>Drawers</hi> of Linen. 2. There
was <hi>Ketonah</hi> (from whence perhaps <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) a <hi>Tunick</hi>
or <hi>Coat,</hi> Exod. 28. 39. It was of fine Linen, and white,
and had Sleeves, and reach'd down beyond the Ankles.
It was properly the <hi>Shirt,</hi> for it was that Garment
which was worn next to his flesh; only it was closer
than a Shirt, and it was curiously woven with artificial
Figures. 3. Over these was <hi>Mechil,</hi> a <hi>Robe of Blue,</hi>
Exod. 28. 31. which answer'd exactly to the <hi>Ephod</hi>
both in wideness and shape, tho not as to length. At
the bottom or skirts of this Robe, instead of Fringes,
hung 72 <hi>Pomegranates</hi> of Blue, Purple and Scarlet, and
as many <hi>golden Bells.</hi> 4. The <hi>Ephod,</hi> which was a
short Garment without sleeves, but most artificially
wrought with Gold, Purple and broider'd Work in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
figures and colours, and thereby made very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and glorious. It was worn over all the other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
but the <hi>Girdle;</hi> it had two holes on the sides to
let the Arms come through; and they put it on over
their Heads as a Surplice is put on. This imbroider'd
Cope was remarkable for these following things; First,
On the shoulders of it were set two great <hi>Onyx Stones,
whereon were grav'd the Names of the Children of</hi> Israel,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 9. that is, of the twelve Tribes, six on one
Stone, and six on another. These precious Gems were
set in Gold, with two Chains of Gold hanging at them.
Secondly, On the fore-part of this Garment there
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65397:97"/>
was fastned a four-square piece of Cloth doubled; the
breadth and length of it were the dimension of a span,
imbroider'd with Gold, and adorn'd with twelve pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 15. They were of four Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or Rows, and there were three Stones in each Class;
and the name of one of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> was
ingraved in each of the 12 Stones. In this four-square
piece there were also contained the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi>
of which I will distinctly speak when I give you a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of the <hi>several ways of Divine Revelation.</hi> This
fore-part of the Garment was called <hi>Coshen,</hi> the <hi>Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
or <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Breast-plate of
Iudgment;</hi> and also by the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> Version <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale:</hi>
which answers to <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the Translation of the
<hi>Septuagint.</hi> This was fastned to the <hi>Ephod</hi> with golden
Chains and Rings, and might be put on or off on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
This Breast-plate was of the same artificial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
and curious work with the <hi>Ephod,</hi> i. e. it was of
fine Linen of divers colours imbroider'd with Gold.
Thirdly, This Garment was remarkable for the <hi>Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi>
or <hi>Belt</hi> with which it was surrounded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 39.
This was made of the same materials and embroider'd
work with the <hi>Ephod.</hi> This Pontifical <hi>Shash</hi> (and who
knows but this word is originally the same with <hi>Shesh,</hi>
which is the usual word in Scripture for <hi>fine Linen,</hi>
of which the <hi>Eastern Girdles</hi> were made?) was
useful to tie the rest of the High-Priest's Habits
close, especially when he was call'd to his publick
Work and Ministry, for then it girt them so together,
that they were no impediment to him in that Service.
5. There was a <hi>Mitr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>;</hi> or <hi>Bonnet</hi> of fine Linen,

(strictly taken) was proper and peculiar to the <hi>High
Priest,</hi> which he wore as the particular and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Livery</hi> of his Lord and Master.</p>
                     <p>The Third Order or Rank was <hi>Levites,</hi> so call'd,
because they were of the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> tho 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(as hath been said before) that the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>
consisted of <hi>Priests</hi> as well as <hi>Levites.</hi> The Levites
were distinguish'd, according to <hi>Levi</hi>'s three Sons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Gershonites, Cohathites,</hi> and <hi>Morarites.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the particular and distinct Office of these <hi>Levites,</hi>
there is some difference among the Learned; for some
say it was the proper Work of the <hi>Levites</hi> to carry and
pitch the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Ark,</hi> and to carry and take
care of all the Utensils belonging to both. Others say
it was none of their Office to carry the <hi>Ark,</hi> but only to
carry and take care of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and all its Vessels.
And whereas that Text 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 4. is alledged
against them, where 'tis expresly said, <hi>the Levites car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Ark;</hi> they answer thus in Scripture, the <hi>Priests</hi>
are sometimes call'd <hi>Levites,</hi> (yea, a certain<note n="1" place="bottom">Josuah ben Levi. Nettles <hi>against</hi> Selden.</note> 
                        <hi>Rabbin</hi>
tells us, that no less than 24 times they are call'd so)
but at other times these are <hi>distinct Names:</hi> and this
may occasion the Controversy. When therefore it is
said, the <hi>Levites carried the Ark,</hi> the meaning is,
that the <hi>Priests</hi> who were of <hi>Levi</hi>'s Race did so; for
this was the <hi>Priest's Work,</hi> as the <hi>Levites</hi> employment
was to <hi>carry</hi> the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and Utensils of it. But
from a due comparing of what is said on both sides. I
am bold to affirm this as the truth in this matter, <hi>viz.</hi>
that <hi>both Priests and Levites</hi> bore the <hi>Ark;</hi> but it was
<hi>ordinarily</hi> and <hi>chiefly</hi> the <hi>Levites Office.</hi> Yet might
not those <hi>Levites</hi> touch any of the Holy things which
they carried till they were covered by the <hi>Priests,</hi> Numb.
4. 15. <hi>Vzzah</hi> therefore was smitten, not only because
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65397:99"/>
he suffered the <hi>Ark</hi> to be carried on a Cart, (which
they should have carried on their Shoulders according to
the Law) but because he touched the Holy things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Law in <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 11. or, it may be he
touched some part of the <hi>Ark,</hi> which was forbid to be
touched. So then the <hi>Office of a Levite</hi> in <hi>Moses</hi>'s
days, and some time after, was to bear up and down
the <hi>Ark</hi> and the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and to look after the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things appeartining to them. And tho the <hi>Priests</hi>
might do something of this, yet the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> could not do

                     </p>
                     <p>But here we must distinguish, or else we shall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this Point aright. We must make a difference
between <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publick</hi> Sacrificing, and between
<hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> Sacrificing, and between
<hi>Sacrificing</hi> and <hi>assisting</hi> at Sacrifice. On a private Altar
others besides <hi>Priests</hi> might sacrifice: so <hi>Samuel</hi> did,

who was but of that Order, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 3. And tho it
is said he went up to sacrifice at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the publick
Place of yearly Sacrificing, yet he might sacrifice on a
<hi>private</hi> Altar, and on a <hi>private</hi> account: or, he <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted</hi>
the Priest in Sacrificing. Some have asserted,
that those who were neither <hi>Priests</hi> nor <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap>s</hi> might
sacrifice thus, and they say <hi>Saul</hi> did so; and that <hi>Saul</hi>
is rebuked, not for Sacrificing, but for not staying the
full time of God's appointment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 8. But
if you consult 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 8. you will see that <hi>Saul
tarried seven days, according to the set time which</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
<hi>had appointed.</hi> Therefore it is clear that <hi>Saul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the <hi>Priest's Office;</hi> for Kings cannot sacrifice as
Kings. <hi>Vzziah</hi> incroached on the Priest's Office, and
you read the effect of it in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 21. If <hi>David</hi>
before this sacrificed with his own hands, (which is
question'd by some) it may be said he was an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Person,</hi> and <hi>extraordinarily moved</hi> thereto. So

they being in an <hi>extraordinary manner</hi> stir'd up
by God to do it. As for <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ses,</hi> we read that he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

Act, and we always allow for such, and never

Besides, <hi>Moses</hi> himself was an extraordinary Person:
he was a compound of <hi>Priest</hi> as well as <hi>Magistrate,</hi> or

none could enter but the High Priest, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 22. In

sacrificed, it is to be understood in these accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The short is, the Levites were the Priests Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Servants, and not Priests, which was a higher
Office. And that they were inferior to the Priests, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65397:100"/>
in their paying the Tithe of their Tithes to the
Priests, as if in respect of the Priests they were a kind
of Laymen.</p>
                     <p>But tho the <hi>Levites</hi> never mingled the Priestly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
with theirs, yet it is to be taken notice of, that in
<hi>David</hi>'s time they were somewhat altered and advanced;
for that pious King having settled the Tabernacle, Ark,
and Priesthood, appointed the <hi>Levites</hi> also their Charges
and Administrations, and as to some things <hi>added</hi> to
their Office and Imployment. He chose some of them
Singers and Musicians, and Officers about the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
At last <hi>in Solomon</hi>'s time, when there was no
Tabernacle or Ark to carry about, but a Temple was
erected, and all things fixed, it must needs follow that
that part of the Levite's Work ceased. Now their
standing Task was to assist at the Altar in the time of
Sacrificing, to help in the Service of the Temple, and
openly to teach and instruct the People, and to be As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors
sometimes with the Priests in Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Thus you see there was some difference and variety
in the Function of the <hi>Levites,</hi> according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

the three Holy Orders of Ministers in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church,

they were commanded to sacrifice, and not in any <hi>other,</hi>
Levit. 17. 5. yet they did not punctually observe this:
there are several Examples in Scripture of Persons who
offered Sacrifice in other places besides the Tabernacle

                     <p>The <hi>Iewish Tabernacle</hi> (which was first erected when
they came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Wilderness, and was the
first fixed place for Oblations, Sacrifices, Hearing the

appears from <hi>Num.</hi> 3. 38. The Entrance into it was at
the East end, and there we will begin, for I will speak,
1. Of the <hi>Court</hi> of the Tabernacle. 2. Of the <hi>Body</hi> of
it, or the <hi>Holy Place.</hi> 3. Of the <hi>Holy of Holies.</hi> And
this I will do not only to give a brief Account of this

some passages of <hi>Scripture</hi> which relate to it, and to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify

                     <p>1. There was the <hi>Court of the Tabernacle,</hi> which was

Place or Yard before it which was without any covering

with <hi>Hangings</hi> and <hi>Pillars, Exod. 27. 9, &amp;c.</hi> This
Court was divided into several lesser Apartments or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,

for the People that were <hi>Men;</hi> a third perhaps for

certain that in this <hi>Court</hi> the <hi>People</hi> met for Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
hither they brought all their Offerings, and here
the Priests took them of them, and here they Prayed, and

but these Sweet Odors were a preservative against that ill

said in the Old Testament that they were put into the
<hi>Ark.</hi> But it is said of both of them, that they were <hi>laid
up,</hi> and kept <hi>before the Testimony,</hi> Exod. 16. 34. Num.
17. 10. Now, This [before the Testimony] may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
that they were laid up before the two Tables in the
<hi>Ark:</hi> that is, the two Tables being placed in the chief
Apartment of the Ark, the <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

another place or apartment of the Ark, just before them.
This is the plain and obvious sense according to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension:
and the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> confirmeth it,

for speaking of the <hi>Ark</hi> he saith expresly that <hi>therein w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the golden pot that had Manna, and Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Red that

would perswade us that <hi>therein</hi> refers to the <hi>Taber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and not to the <hi>Ark</hi> in particular; but such a reference is
strain'd and unusual, and therefore we need not admit it,
especially when what the Old Testament delivers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this matter directs us to another meaning.</p>
                     <p>The Ark was two Cubits and a half in length, one

the <hi>Oracle</hi> was given, yea the place it self was call'd the
<hi>Oracle, Debir,</hi> Psal. 28. 2. (which Name it also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
afterwards, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 6.) because from that place
God <hi>spake</hi> to the High Priest, and gave Answers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what was inquired of. We read that these Answers
were delivered from the <hi>Vppermost part</hi> of the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi>
that place which was <hi>between the Wings of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,</hi>
which hover'd over this <hi>Propitiatory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of these <hi>Cherubims</hi> let me give some account, because
it is the only thing here that hath any difficulty in it.
Concerning these, 1. Some have thought they were
Images in the shape of <hi>Boys:</hi> so the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
affirm. 2.<note n="1" place="bottom">Bonsrerius, Gaffarel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> Others say they were Images in
the likeness of <hi>Oxen</hi> or <hi>Calves,</hi> because <hi>Cherubim</hi> in Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee
and Syriack is <hi>Bos,</hi> and so is taken in <hi>Ezek</hi> 10. 14.
compared with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 10. And <hi>Ier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>boam</hi>'s <hi>Calves</hi>
were in imitation of these, they say. 3. There are those
that hold them to have been Images not of one Shape,
but of many. Thus in <hi>Ezek</hi> 1. 5. the <hi>Cherubims</hi> had
the faces or shapes of a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Lyon,</hi> an <hi>Ox,</hi> an <hi>Eagle.</hi>
Allusively in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 6, 7. the <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Cherubim</hi> are
represented under the distinct shapes of these four Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:65397:103"/>
severally. It is probable they had the Face and
erect Stature of a <hi>Man,</hi> four Wings like <hi>Eagles,</hi> the
Backs of <hi>Lions,</hi> with Mains hanging down, the Thighs
and Legs of <hi>Oxen</hi> or <hi>Calves.</hi> This is the Opinion of
<note n="2" place="bottom">Villalpandus, Mede, Grotius, Bochart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> Some. 4 It is thought by Others that the Shape of
the <hi>Cherubim</hi> is not known. Thus the <hi>Iewish</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary
tells us that<note n="3" place="bottom">Joseph. Antiq. l. 3. c. 6.</note> they were winged Animals of such a
shape as never was seen by Men. And in another place he
saith,<note n="4" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> l. 8. c. 2.</note> no man can say or conceive what Figure the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims
were of. This might be the best Account (if it be
any account at all) supposing that were true which some
say, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Cherubims</hi> were never seen by any but
the High Priest, who only could go into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
and so they were not known to Others. But this
(altho very Learned Writers have asserted it) is a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
for the <hi>Cherubims</hi> were pictured not only in the
<hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> but on the <hi>Veil</hi> between that and the
<hi>Holy Place,</hi> and on the Walls and Doors and Vessels of
the Temple; 1 <hi>Kings 6. 29, 32. 2 Chron. 3. 7.
1 Kings</hi> 7. 29. Besides, those <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Pictures</hi> were
for <hi>Ornament,</hi> and therefore were to be exposed to <hi>Sight;</hi>
and consequently the Shape of them was well known.</p>
                     <p>That they were not any of those Shapes before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
is probable, if you consider these things: 1. It is
likely that those <hi>Cherubims</hi> described by <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>l</hi> had no
affinity with the <hi>Cherubims</hi> over the <hi>Ark;</hi> for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
saw them in a Vision only, they were no real things.
2. The <hi>Talmudists</hi> and <hi>Hebr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> Rabbies</hi> were very fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
people, and so their Opinion is of little value. 3. It
appears that some of them had too great a liking to <hi>young
Boys</hi> faces, and thence perhaps this Notion came into
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65397:104"/>
their minds. 4. That God should be so incensed as we
read he was, at the making a <hi>golden Calf,</hi> and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
alter set up <hi>Calves</hi> over the <hi>Ark</hi> is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
5. <hi>Calves</hi> or <hi>Oxen</hi> are expresly distinguish'd
from <hi>Cherubims;</hi> 1 Kings 7. 29.</p>
                     <p>But if you will fix on any thing, the most probable is
this, that they were the Images and Representations of
<hi>Angels,</hi> the Heavenly Messengers. For what other is
the signification of <hi>Cherubim</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24. and so in
the 10<hi>th</hi> and 11<hi>th</hi> Chapters of <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>kiel?</hi> And what
is more usual in Sacted Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ipture than to give the name
of the thing signified or represented to that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
the thing? So here, <hi>Cherubim</hi> are the <hi>Angels</hi>
of Heaven, and the <hi>Images</hi> of them over the <hi>Propi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are call'd <hi>Cherubim</hi> for this reason, because they <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
them. And very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this was God's Palace, the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> represented
<hi>Heaven:</hi> therefore the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Attendants</hi> of the Heavenly King; they are
always near him, and stand round about him.</p>
                     <p>I have this further to add to the present Account, that
the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> had no Window to let in Light: nor
had the <hi>Holy Place</hi> any. But they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> come in
by drawing aside the <hi>Veil</hi> that was between the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
and the Outward Court. And they burnt Lamps
even in the day time in the Sanctuary, which they did
not do in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and consequently this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Not indeed was there any use or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for Light there, because the High Priest visited it
but once in a Year; and then upon drawing aside the <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Veil,</hi> which was next the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> the Light
of the burning Lamps might be transmitted into this
place. But the Priests officiating every day in the <hi>Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary,</hi>
there was need of Light in that place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>,
and accordingly in the very day time (as well as in the
night) the Lamps were burning, for this was according
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65397:104"/>
to the Prescription, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 20. But how could this be

Which gives me occesion to speak of these and the other
Covetings belonging to in, and then I have finished my
Desorlption of it. It was on the sides and ends hung
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65397:105"/>
with ten pieces of Tapestry, very artificially wrought, and
with divers colours, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 1. and besides these fine
inward Hangings (which are call'd Curtains, because they
hung in such a fashion) there were others of <hi>Goats hair,</hi>
of <hi>Rams skins,</hi> &amp;c. which were course in comparison of
the former, and were thrown over them to preserve them
from the injury of the weather, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 7, &amp;c. And
not only the sides and ends, but the Roof of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
was cover'd with rich Tapestry within, but on the
outside with stronger Coverings, the same with those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foremention'd:
and there were no less than four of these
Coverings or Safeguards all particularly specified in the
foresaid Chapter. Besides the Curtains or Hangings,
there were <hi>Boards</hi> or <hi>Planks</hi> on the sides of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
to render the Structure more strong, firm and stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and these were so artificially fastned together, that they
seemed to be all of a piece, and yet they could easily be
taken asunder, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 15, to 30.</p>
                     <p>Now I am oblig'd in the next place to discover briefly
the <hi>Mystical</hi> meaning of all these strange things before
mention'd, which appertain to the Furniture of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle:
for it is reasonable to think that these being so
solemnly appointed by God, were not insignificant, but
had some Great and Worthy Mysteries couch'd in them.
Nay, which is more, we are assured from the Inspired
Writings of the New Testament that it was so, for the
Tabernacle is said to have been <hi>a Figure for the time then
present, Heb. 9. 9. i. e.</hi> all the time of that way of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Worship some great Mystery was represented by
it. And the Mosaick Priests are said <hi>to serve unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and shadow of heavenly things, Heb.</hi> 8. 5. Let us
briefly see what these Celestial and Spiritual things were,
or at least let us guess and modestly conceive what they
were. First, in the Court of the Tabernacle the <hi>Altar of
Burnt-Offering</hi> fitly signified the great Expiatory <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
of <hi>Christ</hi> on the Cross, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 10. And the <hi>Laver</hi>
was a very congruous Symbol of Spiritual Washing and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65397:105"/>
Purifying, <hi>Eph. 5. 26. Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Then in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
the <hi>Altar of Incense</hi> and the <hi>Golden Censer</hi> plainly
denoted the Intercession of the Messias: thereby was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
that he should pray for us, and offer our Prayers,
and make them acceptable to God through his Merits;
for the <hi>Incense</hi> figures the continual <hi>sweet Savour</hi> and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptableness
of the Offering. The Table of <hi>Shew bread</hi>
did not only represent God's Providing a Table and
Maintenance for the <hi>Israelites</hi> whilst they were in the
Wilderness, but it teacheth us that God's Church hath
his constant <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> and that he <hi>Provideth</hi> for it
daily, he gives them their Daily Bread: or it signified
<hi>Christ,</hi> who calls himself <hi>the Bread of Life,</hi> with which
the Faithful are nourish'd to eternal life. Or (as things
of this nature frequently have divers significations) the
<hi>Brazen Laver</hi> before, and the <hi>Shew-Bread</hi> here represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Two Sacraments, <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
The <hi>Candlestick</hi> and <hi>Lamps</hi> very appositely signify
Christ and his Apostles: He is the <hi>True Light,</hi> and in
a secondary sense his Ministers may be call'd so too. The
Sacred <hi>Oyl</hi> belonging to them may set forth the <hi>Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Vnction from the Holy One,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the faithful are enlightened and <hi>know all things,</hi> 1 Joh.
2. 20. Or, the Golden Candlestick with <hi>Seven Branches</hi>
may denote the manifold Gifts and Graces of the Holy
Ghost, with that Abundant Light which is the Blessing
of the Gospel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4. &amp; 4. 5.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, The inmost part of the Tabernacle into which
the High Priest enter'd, and none else, is yet a more
lively Representation of the Great Mysteries of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
The Atonement which the High Priest made by
Blood, and his offering it in this most Holy Place, and
that but once a Year, are all expresly applied to <hi>Christ,</hi>
our Great <hi>High Priest,</hi> by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 7. &amp;
12. 24. &amp; 9. 22, 24. But more particularly it is
worth our observing on this occasion, that tho the
High Priest enter'd this place but once a Year, and that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65397:106"/>
on a set day in the Year, yet he enter'd <hi>thrice</hi> in that
one day. For, first, he went in with the Censer of
Coals and the Cup of Incense, and <hi>put the Incense upon
the Fire before the Lord,</hi> Levit. 16. 13. Then he came
out, and <hi>took the Blood of the Bullock slain at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
of Burnt-offering,</hi> and went with it into the Holy
of Holies, and <hi>sprinkled</hi> it upon the Mercy-Seat, <hi>Levit.</hi>
16. 14. Then he came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orth and carried the <hi>Blood of
a Goat</hi> which was also slain at the foresaid Altar, and
<hi>sprinkled</hi> it upon, or towards the Mercy-Seat, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.
This was the third time of going into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
And who sees not that the High Priest's offering
of <hi>Incense</hi> appositely represents the solemn Prayers
which our High Priest Jesus offer'd before he became a
Sacrifice, which is particularly mention'd <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 1, 2,
<hi>&amp;c?</hi> And is it not as plain that the sprinkling of the Blood
of the slain Bullock and Goat signified the Blood of
<hi>Christ</hi> crucified apply'd to Believers, to atone for their
Sins? For those words of the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 10,
11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> refer to the Blood of the Beasts brought
into the Holy Place to make Atonement, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 27.</p>
                     <p>In this place was the <hi>Ark,</hi> the special Symbol of
<hi>God's Presence,</hi> for that carnal People could not believe
God was present with them, unless they had some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
and visible Token of it: Wherefore God was
pleas'd so far to indulge their weakness, as to give them
this corporeal and sensible Sign of his Presence with
them, tho he thought good to remove it sometimes
from their sight, to wean them by degrees from that
grosser Dispensation. But it is certain that the <hi>Ark</hi> was
a Symbol of mighty import, and represented not only
the <hi>Divine Presence,</hi> but was a Type of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi>
the incarnate and visible God, in whom the Fulness of
the Godhead dwelt bodily. The <hi>Oracle</hi> from whence
God gave answer, was the Figure of the <hi>Incarnate
Word,</hi> who reveal'd the Will of God to us. By the
<hi>Pot of Manna</hi> was signified the <hi>hidden Manna</hi> vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65397:106"/>
to all Believers. Aarons <hi>Rod that blossomed,</hi> figured
that efficacious Blessing which is given to the Labours
of Christ's Ministers. The <hi>Testimony</hi> in the Ark, the
Witness or Evidence of God's Presence there, represents
to us the <hi>Word</hi> of God, the Holy Scriptures. The
<hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> or the <hi>Covering</hi> of the Ark, was a more
particular and signal Representation of Christ, by whom
alone the Divine Mercy is conferr'd on Mankind; by
whose Merits the Church is cover'd and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ended from
God's Wrath. <hi>Whom God hath set for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Rom. 3. 25. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, the very word which
the same Apostle uses for the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> Heb. 9. 5.
As the <hi>Law</hi> in the Ark was cover'd and hid by this, so
the <hi>Messias</hi> covers, hides, shields us from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which is by the <hi>Law,</hi> and consequently from the
Divine Displeasure. Or, which is the same thing, <hi>Sin
is covered</hi> (as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1.) by
Christ our <hi>Propitiatory.</hi> And 'tis observable that the
Apostle saith, God <hi>hath set him forth,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which
refers to the Prefigurations of the Law: he was <hi>before
set forth</hi> (as the word signifies) he was of old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in the <hi>Legal Types,</hi> and more signally in this
of the <hi>Propitiatory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cherubims</hi> hovering over the Ark, denote the
<hi>Angels</hi> protecting the Church: and withal it speaks
their future prying into the Mysteries of the Gospel,
<hi>which they desire to look into,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi>
Chap. 1. v. 12. which very words re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

stooping and looking down with bowed Heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>Mercy-Seat.</hi> And this by the way lets us

The <hi>Veil</hi> in the Tabernacle (and so that of the <hi>Templ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ's Passion, to signify, that he by his Death open'd
the way into the Kingdom of Heaven: for we learn
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65397:107"/>
from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
was meant by the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> Heb. 9. 24.
Whence it is call'd <hi>that within the Veil,</hi> Heb. 6. 19.
And Christian <hi>Hope</hi> is said to <hi>enter into it,</hi> because this
Grace looks beyond the Afflictions and Calamities of
this Life, into that place of endless Glory.<note n="1" place="bottom">Antiq. l. 3. c. 5 &amp; 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Ioseph</hi>
the Learned <hi>Iew</hi> gives his Suffrage here, and declares,
that this part of the Tabernacle was a Type of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial

this place to be a Typical Representation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Yea, the <hi>whole Tabernacle</hi> was, if we may so
speak, God's <hi>Heaven</hi> here below, for it was the place
of his special Presence and Habitation. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I could observe that <hi>Blue</hi> or <hi>Sky-colour,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
<hi>Heaven,</hi> God's Seat, was very much made use
of in the Tabernacle, and all the Sacred Ornaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, The Presence of God with his People,
the Glorious Undertakings of the Son of God, the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Influence of the Holy Spirit, the State of Christ's
Church both here and hereafter, were shadow'd forth by
the several things which were contain'd in the distinct
Partitions of the <hi>Mosaick Tabernacle.</hi> I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to affirm that there are no other Mystical and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
meanings of these things but what I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd:
But as I am sure in the general that a <hi>mystical</hi>
Sense was intended by the Holy Ghost, as is evident
from the greatest part of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> so
the particular meaning which I have offer'd may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
by Analogy, as many things in our Holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are; yea, the main part of what I have said is
grounded on express Texts in the New Testament,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65397:107"/>
where these Sacred Mysteries are thus unfolded, explain'd
and illustrated.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Before I take my leave of this old Venerable
<hi>Iewish</hi> Monument, the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> I will set down the
<hi>Travels</hi> and <hi>Removes</hi> of it, and the Ark. First, They
were in the <hi>Wilderness</hi> forty Years; thence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to Gilgal, and staid there about fourteen Years.
Afterwards their Mansion-place was<note n="3" place="bottom">Deut. 12. 5.</note>

of <hi>Samaria,</hi> a City in the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin:</hi> hither
they were brought in the seventh Year of <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and continued here till <hi>Samuel</hi>'s time, which
was in all about 240 Years, as from the Years of the
<hi>Iudges</hi> may be computed. Hitherto the <hi>Tabernacle</hi>
and <hi>Ark</hi> were together; now they are parted, for the

and thence to <hi>Kirjathjearim,</hi> where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
many Years; then it came to <hi>Mishphat,</hi> then to
<hi>Gilgal,</hi> then to <hi>Nob,</hi> then to <hi>Gib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> and to the House
of <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> where it staid but three months, and
was fetch'd with great joy and triumph to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi>
the City of <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 6. 17. 1 Chron. 16. 1. where
this Pious Prince erected a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> for it; which
whether it was a new one, or the old one preserv'd at
<hi>Shiloh,</hi> and fetch'd thence, I will not dispute. And
at last the <hi>Ark</hi> after all its Travels was fix'd in the <hi>Holy
of Holies</hi> in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple. And the <hi>Tabernacle</hi>
it self (which was fitted for the foregoing State, their
continual removing from place to place) was laid up
(as some think) as a Sacred Monument in some part
of the <hi>Temple;</hi> of which I am to speak next. And
this I do (as when before I gave an account of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

to correct some Mistakes about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Temple</hi> was built answerable to the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi>
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:65397:108"/>
for the Front of it was toward the East, and the <hi>Holy
of Holies</hi> was situate toward the West. Thence the
East Door of the Temple is call'd <hi>Shagnar haithon,</hi>
Ezek. 40. 15. the <hi>Gate of Access</hi> or <hi>Ingress,</hi> because
it was the chief Gate whereby they enter'd into the
Temple, or that directly led up to the main part of it.
And perhaps from this situation of it, and their coming
up to it with their Faces and Foreparts towards this
East-end and Gate of it, the <hi>East</hi> is call'd <hi>Kedem</hi> and
<hi>Kadim</hi> the <hi>fore-part,</hi> Ezek. 43. 17. The Temple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus placed, they accordingly worship'd and bowed
toward the West: tho afterwards some in imitation of
the Idolatrous <hi>Gentiles,</hi> bowed toward the East, and
turn'd their backs on the Holy of Holies, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 16.
The Temple as well as the Tabernacle, consisted of
three divisions, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>holy Place,</hi> and the
<hi>Holiest</hi> of all. I will briefly shew you what these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Parts contained in them: for tho as to the main
the Temple was built proportionable to the Tabernacle,
yet it differ'd from it in several things. And for variety
sake I will present the Temple to you differently from
the Tabernacle, that is, I will begin first with the <hi>Holy
of Holies,</hi> and so pass downward, whereas I went up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
before.</p>
                     <p>In this first part of the Temple was the <hi>Ark of the
Covenant,</hi> wherein were deposited the <hi>Two Tables of
Stone</hi> on which the <hi>Law</hi> was written. Some think the
Temple fell short of the Tabernacle in this, that in the
Ark of the Tabernacle were the <hi>Two Tables,</hi> and the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

of Manna, and</hi> Aaron'<hi>s Rod:</hi> But in the Ark of the
Temple <hi>there was nothing save the two Tables of Stone,
which</hi> Moses <hi>put there at</hi> Horeb, 1 <hi>King. 8. 9. Deut.</hi>
10. 5. It is implied in these words, say they, that
there had been something else in the <hi>Ark</hi> hereto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore, and
that now it was missing, else it would have been barely
said, that in the Ark were the <hi>two Tables of Stone,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this addition <hi>there was nothing else,</hi> which intima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65397:108"/>
that other things were there before, but now are lost, <hi>viz.</hi>
by the Ark's being carried from place to place so often.
But all this is false arguing, and groundless surmise; and
the true account is this, (which I partly assign'd before
when I spoke of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and on which I have
enlarged in a<note n="1" place="bottom">Of the Stile of Scripture, <hi>pag.</hi> 365, 366, 367.</note> former Discourse) that the <hi>Ark</hi> in that
place of the <hi>Kings</hi> is taken <hi>strictly</hi> for the chief Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Division of the Ark, and so it is rightly said it
had nothing in it but the two Tables: But in a <hi>larger</hi>
Sense, <hi>i. e.</hi> as the <hi>Ark</hi> signifies the whole Body and
Compass of the Ark, it contain'd those other things in
it. In this part of the Temple were the Cherubims,
which were placed at each end of the Ark with Wings
spread abroad. But this is to be observed, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> there were but <hi>two Cherubims,</hi> in
the Temple there were <hi>four.</hi> Between their Wings
were the <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> and the <hi>Oracle</hi> whence God gave
Answers in difficult Cases; but this latter was much
larger than that in the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Part of the Temple was the <hi>Body</hi> of it,
or the <hi>holy Place,</hi> or <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> or the <hi>outward House of
the Lord.</hi> Here was the <hi>Veil,</hi> adorned with Cherubims,
which separated the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> from the <hi>Holy Place,</hi>
but was much wider and longer than that of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.
Here were the <hi>Shew-bread</hi> and <hi>Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks:</hi>
the former of these in the Tabernacle was set on
<hi>one</hi> Table only, but in the Temple it was set on <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

five being on one side, and five on the other. In the
Tabernacle there was but one <hi>Golden Candlestick,</hi> with
seven Branches; but instead of that in the Temple,
there were ten <hi>Golden Candlesticks,</hi> five on one hand, and
five on the other; for the Temple being greater, wanted
more Light. The <gap reason="foreign">

was of the same materials and make with that in the
Tabernacle.</p>
                     <p>The third Part of the Temple was that which was
called the <hi>Court.</hi> This part was not covered, but lay
open to the Sky; but the <hi>Body of the Temple</hi> and the
<hi>Oracle</hi> were covered. This East-end of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was divided into four lesser Courts, whereas in the

Court were two Brass Pillars, call'd <hi>Iachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi>
one on the right hand, and the other on the left;
which are an addition to what was in the Tabernacle,
for we read of no such thing there. Here also were <hi>ten
Lavers of Brass,</hi> five on the right hand, and five on the
left, whereas there was but <hi>one brazen Laver</hi> in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.
The Beasts for Sacrifice were washed here,
being first wash'd in the <hi>Sheep-pool.</hi> Here was the <hi>Sea
of Brass,</hi> standing on 12 Oxen of Brass: In this the
Priests and Levites wash'd their hands and feet before
they serv'd at the Altar. Into this Court none gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

and all other Circumcised Worshippers. This is
that which is call'd the <hi>Great Court,</hi> 2 Chron. 4. 9.
Here they stood to pray, and to see the performance of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65397:109"/>
the Sacrifices. Here were several <hi>Porches</hi> for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

is sometimes call'd <hi>the Porch:</hi> and it is particularly call'd

here when he dedicated the Temple. About the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of this Court was the <hi>brazen Scaffold</hi> or Stage
which <hi>Solomon</hi> erected, and where he stood and prayed,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 13. The <hi>Gate</hi> of this Court is that which
was call'd the <hi>beautiful Gate,</hi> as some think, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.
10. The King only went in at this Gate, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 3.
but the People went in by two Gates on the North and
South, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 9. This Court was call'd the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Court,</hi> because the Jewish People went no further
than this Court, and worship'd here. But this Court
frequently goes under the Name of <hi>the Temple</hi> in the
New Testament, as in <hi>Matth. 21. 12. Acts</hi> 3. 1. and
other places. Here Christ preached, and here <hi>he cast out
the Buyers and Sellers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Womens Court,</hi> which was an Apartment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct

and Women do not worship together, but are confined
to a place that looks into the Synagogue. So among
the <hi>Turks,</hi> none but Males enter the <hi>Moschs.</hi> And in
<hi>Russia</hi> the Women either stand at the Door of the
Church, or are in some place shut up from the Men.
In this Court stood the Treasury, from whence this
Court is called the <hi>Treasury,</hi> John 8. 20. It was stiled
in H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Gifts and Mony offer'd by the People towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of the Temple, relieving the Poor, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
of Sacrifices. Here Christ saw the Widow casting
in her Mite.</p>
                     <p>4. The <hi>Court of the Gentiles,</hi> or of the <hi>Proselytes of
the Gate.</hi> Here, as some think, was a Market of Sheep
and Oxen, Doves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and here were the Shops and
Tables of <hi>Mony-changers,</hi> for the supply of Oblations.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65397:110"/>
The others think (as hath been mention'd) that the
Buyers and Sellers had intruded even into the <hi>Peoples
Court.</hi> This outward Court of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
Proselytes, is called<note n="1" place="bottom">Mark 11. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>the House of Prayer to</hi> (or
<hi>for) all Nations,</hi> because the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were admitted to
<hi>pray</hi> in this part of the Temple. But they were not
permitted to come into the Inner Court of the Temple:
thence St. <hi>Paul</hi> is impeached for <hi>bringing Greeks into
the Temple,</hi> Acts 21. 28. This Partition was divided
from the other Court (where the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Circumcised
Proselytes</hi> were) by a little <hi>Stone-wall</hi> but three Cubits

which was covered, into which the Priests only enter'd;
or <hi>largely</hi> for all that space walled in, but not covered,
where the People as well as the Priests were: and thus
these four Courts may be called the <hi>Temple.</hi> This may
suffice for an Account of those particular things which
were contained in the <hi>Iewish Temple.</hi>

                     <p>As for the Fabrick it self, I will only say this (which
exalts it above all the Buildings in the World) that the
Contriver of it was God himself; the Platform was
from Heaven. For which reason the Form of it hath
been imitated by Christians, who generally built their
Churches after that Model. Thence we read, in the

Cubits broad, and 30 Cubits high; but that was but
30 Cubits in length, 10 in breadth, and 15 in height.
But when 'tis said in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 2. that the Temple was
30 Cubits high, it must be meant only of the space
which reached from the Floor to the first Story; for when
it is compared with the Tabernacle, it is consider'd
without a Roof or any Superstructure, because the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
was such. But if you take the whole height
of the Temple, it was no less than 120 Cubits, as you
read in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 3. Thus then it is, from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
to the first Roof were 30 Cubits, from thence to
the second Roof 30 more, and from thence to the top
60 Cubits: So the height of the Temple from the
Floor to the top of all, was 120 Cubits. Thus the

                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Sacraments</hi> appointed by the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi>
Law are here to be taken notice of. They were
<hi>Circumcision</hi> and the <hi>Passover:</hi> The former was in use
before the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Dispensation, it being appointed as
a Sign of the Covenant between God and <hi>Abraham.</hi> It
was reestablished by God when he delivered the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law to <hi>Moses;</hi> and it was to continue a Badg and
Confirmation of the same Covenant, that the Posterity
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Iews,</hi> might receive comfort thence.
It was also to be a remarkable Token to difference the
<hi>Iews</hi> from other Nations (tho other People afterwards
borrow'd Circumcision from the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as the <hi>Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeans,</hi>
the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> &amp;c.) There were other Ends

                     <p>IN the Fifth place I am to treat of the <hi>Solemn Times</hi>
and <hi>Set Seasons</hi> of Worship appointed the <hi>Iews</hi> by
the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law. These by a general Name were
call'd <hi>Feasts;</hi> but if you speak properly, some of them
were Fasts. But because the word is sometimes taken
by the <hi>Iews</hi> for a solemn Time of Religious Worship,
whether it was accompanied with Rejoicing or Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that term is applied to them all. The Design
of these <hi>Festivals</hi> was to commemorate some great
Blessing, to maintain mutual Love, Friendship and
Communion, and to join together in the Service of God.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65397:112"/>
These <hi>Feasts</hi> are divided by the <hi>Iews</hi> into the <hi>greater</hi> and the lesser. The greater Feasts are these.</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Sabbaths.</hi> For tho this word be of a larger sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,

of Days,</hi> and the <hi>Sabbaths of Years.</hi> The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths
of Days are the <hi>lesser</hi> and the <hi>greater:</hi> the lesser are
<hi>every seventh Day,</hi> call'd <hi>the Sabbath</hi> by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
in memory of God's <hi>resting</hi> or <hi>ceasing</hi> from the
Works of the Creation. But it was commanded now
with particular reference to the <hi>Iewish</hi> People, and to
their <hi>resting</hi> from their Captivity and Bondage in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
I say no more of it here, because I am to insist largely
upon it when I come to treat of the <hi>Fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
The <hi>greater Sabbath of Days</hi> was, when the

                        </gap>ell on the Sabbath-day, as it did that Year
when <hi>Christ</hi> suffer'd, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 31. This was call'd
the <hi>Great Sabbath</hi> by the <hi>Iews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as there were the <hi>Sabbaths of Days,</hi> so there were
the <hi>Sabbaths of Years:</hi> These were two; first, <hi>Every
Seventh Year was a Sabbath of Rest to the Land,</hi> Levit.

making any the like provision, but what the Ground
yielded that Year of it self was sufficient, and it was in
common to all Persons to eat of it. It was God's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to deal thus with this People, to bring them to a
sense of his <hi>Providence</hi> in the World, that he was able
without their Care and Art to sustain them, that he was
Lord of all things, and the Supreme Disposer of them.
This was the reason why <hi>their Land enjoy'd its Sabbaths.</hi>
Secondly, There was the <hi>Sabbath</hi> which was the end of
seven times seven Years, that is, 49 Years, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.

at present, having said something of it in another

mortgaged Lands were to return to their Owners, and
every Freeholder repossess'd what was alien'd from him,
and all Prisoners and Debtors were set free, and Captives
were released, and all Controversies and Suits about
Lands, Estates, Possessions and Properties were ended.
It is certain likewise, that as on every seventh Year, so in
every Year of <hi>Iubilee</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> plough'd not their
Ground, but fed upon what came up of it self; which
may be attributed to the singular Nature of the Soil, and

the Clouds might hinder it several Days or Nights

Order of the Months, (for we must know that

the <hi>Iews</hi> reckon'd their Months two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> either
according to the <hi>Political</hi> or the <hi>Ecclesiastical Year.</hi>)
According to the <hi>Political</hi> or Civil Year (which was for
Contracts and Business) they began the Year with the
Month <hi>Tisri</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> and ended it with <hi>Elul</hi> or
<hi>August.</hi> But according to the <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
Account (which they observ'd in keeping their Feasts)
they began the Year with the Month <hi>Abib,</hi> Exod. 13. 4.
call'd also <hi>Nisan,</hi> Nehem. 2. 1. which answers to our
<hi>March,</hi> and concluded with <hi>Adar</hi> or <hi>February.</hi> This
Account was not in use till <hi>Moses</hi>'s Time, and was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
in memory of their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which

Names; it was called <hi>Nisan</hi> from <hi>Nus, fugit,</hi> from the

it was call'd <hi>Abib,</hi> because that word signifieth
a <hi>green Ear of Corn,</hi> denoting that that was the time
when Corn began to ripen. The Feast of the <hi>Passover</hi>
began in this first Month according to the Ecclesiastical
Computation, nay indeed according to Divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for the Month wherein the <hi>Israelites</hi> were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
being the <hi>seventh</hi> in Civil Account, was for ever
after call'd the <hi>first</hi> Month, by God's Command, <hi>Exod.</hi>
12. 2. This solemn Feast began on the 15th of this
Month, and lasted till the 21st, i. e. seven Days. On
the Evening before this Feast, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 14<hi>th</hi> Day,
the Paschal Lamb was killed and eaten; and on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
following Days the Paschal Sacrifices were offered.
This was also call'd <hi>the Feast of Vnleavened Bread,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this sort of Bread was used at that time, and no
other. Therefore two or three days together before the
Passover, they used to light up Candles, and to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every hole and corner about their Houses, to see if any
old <hi>leaven'd</hi> Bread was scatter'd there. This Feast of
the Passover was the greatest of all the Feasts which the

the <hi>Israelites</hi> First-born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God's wonderful bringing them out of that
place. But this was not the only reason of the institut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Feast; there was a higher Design, and it was no
other than this, that the <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi> should be a Type
of the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> who was to be slain, and to take
away the Sins of the World. As I have shew'd before
how the Jewish Sacrifices, and how several of those
things which appertained to the Tabernacle prefigured
Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so here I will let you see how the Jewish Passover
did the same.</p>
                     <p>I will take then those words of the Apostle for the
Ground-work of what I shall say on this Subject, <hi>Christ
our Passover is sacrificed for us,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 7. This
word <hi>Passover</hi> is taken in several senses, <hi>viz.</hi> for the
thing it self represented, the Angel's passing over the
Houses of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and doing no harm. This is
the first and original meaning of that term. But it is
taken likewise for the <hi>Israelites</hi> representation of that
Act of the Angel's <hi>Transition,</hi> Exod. 12. 11. for the
<hi>Feast</hi> which was appointed to be kept in remembrance
of that Mercy; for the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> offer'd at that Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

taken here, <hi>Christ our Passover,</hi> i. e. our Paschal Lamb,
is kill'd and <hi>sacrificed for us:</hi> And all the Rites and

to God by him,</hi> one who was indued with sufficient
Power to accomplish the great Work he undertook<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And as the <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi> was to be a <hi>Male;</hi> so on the
very same account the third Qualification of it was, that
it must be <hi>of the first Year,</hi> ver. 5. for then it was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65397:115"/>
to arrive to its <hi>vigour.</hi> Such a Lamb was <hi>Christ
Iesus,</hi> he was crucified when he was in the strength of
his Years, in the full vigour of his Age, when he was
young and lively. Thus you see there is a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
in all these Particulars between the <hi>Paschal
Lamb</hi> and <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> even our <hi>Lord Iesus
Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I may add this too, that the Paschal Lamb was
to be <hi>taken out of their own Folds,</hi> ver. 3. and <hi>Deut.</hi>
16. 2. So was our Redeemer one of the Flock, taken
out of the Fold of Mankind, taken <hi>from his Brethren,</hi>
Deut. 18. 15. Heb. 2. 17. He was one of us, a true
Man, of our Flesh, and of our Bone. And, which
was yet nearer to the matter, he was taken out of the
<hi>Fold of the Iews,</hi> and he was of the Seed of <hi>David.</hi>
In the next place the Lamb was to be <hi>kill'd,</hi> and in this
also it is a manifest Type of <hi>Christ.</hi> That <hi>without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Blood there should be no remission,</hi> was the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of Eternal Wisdom, that which Angels ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
and Men must ever stand amazed at. Therefore
the <hi>Messias</hi> was to die for us, to expiate our Sins by his
Blood, for <hi>his Blood cleanseth us from all Sin,</hi> 1 John
1. 7. But before the Lamb was kill'd, it was to <hi>be
kept in their Houses four days,</hi> ver. 3. and ver. 6. You
will find, upon perusing the History of the Gospel, that
Christ was crucified the 4<hi>th</hi> day after his last coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> own Home: he was, as it were,
all that time <hi>kept up</hi> before he was slain. Or it may be
<note place="bottom">Hierozoic. pars 1. l. 2. cap. 50.</note> 
                        <hi>Bochart</hi>'s Notion may be acceptable, who observes
that this Passage was thus fulfill'd, Christ was taken
from his Mother's House (the Fold where he was
brought up) at 30 Years of Age, and suffer'd Death
the 4<hi>th</hi> Year after that. If according to the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Stile we take a <hi>Day</hi> for a <hi>Year,</hi> this is exactly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65397:115"/>
accomplish'd. But this Judicious Author favours rather
the other Interpretation, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ suffering on the
fourth day after his coming to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> tho I conceive
this Learned Man is mistaken in his <hi>Reckoning</hi> of it, for
tho our Saviour rode into <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on the 10<hi>th</hi> day of
the Month, yet he return'd to <hi>Bethany</hi> (whence he came)
at the Evening, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 17. and came back to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
the next day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 18. and consequently he
was not crucified on the 14<hi>th</hi> day (as this Author deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines)
but on the 15<hi>th.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let us pass to the next Circumstance of Time, and
that is, that they were to kill the Lamb <hi>in the Evening,
at the going down of the Sun,</hi> ver. 6. &amp; Deut. 16. 6.
Which plainly points at the Time of <hi>Christ's</hi> Passion and
Death, <hi>viz.</hi> towards the shutting in of the day, at the
declining of the Sun. Then did this Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
leave this World. For tho some apply it to the
<hi>Evening of the Iewish Oeconomy</hi> and Government, and
others to the <hi>Evening of the World,</hi> yet I rather pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the most easie and unexceptionable meaning, <hi>i. e.</hi> the
Evening of the Day: then our Christian Passover was
sacrificed for us. He was slain in <hi>the Evening,</hi> or, as
'tis said here of the Paschal Lamb, <hi>between the two Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi>
i. e. (as I have shew'd before) between the first
declining of the Sun, and its going down, or setting,
which was about the Ninth hour, or Three a clock in the
Afternoon. Then <hi>the Lamb which was slain from the
foundation of the World, viz.</hi> as to the Decree of God, and
as to the virtue and efficacy of his Death (for those that
were before Christ's coming, were as effectually saved by
him as those that lived at or after it) was really and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
slain in his body on the Cross. And thus He and
the Paschal Lamb were slain at the same hour of the day,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 45, 46.</p>
                     <p>The next thing observable is the <hi>Effusion and Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
of the Blood of the Lamb, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, &amp; 13. <hi>The
Blood was to be to them for a Token upon the houses where
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65397:116"/>
they were, that when the Angel saw the Blood he should
pass over them, and the plague should not be upon them to
destroy them.</hi> Here is the Benefit which came to the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
by the <hi>Passover,</hi> they were kept safe and secure
from the Destroying Angel, when Death and Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
seiz'd upon the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Can any thing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
set forth the Design of <hi>Iesus the Messias,</hi> who
was to come and shed his Blood for us, that thereby we
might be freed from the Vengeance of God, and escape
the stroak of the Destroyer, and be rescued from Death
and Eternal Misery? Wherefore a<note n="1" place="bottom">Chrysost. in Psal. 119.</note> Pious Father saith
rightly, <q>The Lamb which of old was slain by the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
was a Type of the True Lamb Christ our Lord,
who was sacrificed for us: for as there the Blood
sprinkled on the posts saved those that sprinkled it, so
the Blood of the True Lamb Christ our God delivers
us from the Curse of the Enemy and from Eternal
Death.</q> Indeed this is the grand and principal thing
signified by the Paschal Lamb, <hi>viz.</hi> our Redemption
by the Blood of Jesus Christ. And the <hi>Sprinkling</hi> of this
Blood is twice expresly mention'd as absolutely necessary
for this purpose, <hi>Heb. 12. 24. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 1. And the
hearts of Believers are said to be <hi>sprinkled from an evil
conscience,</hi> Heb. 10. 22. that is, purged and cleans'd
from the defilements of Sin by sprinkling of the Blood of
this Lamb. Besides, the <hi>sprinkling</hi> and <hi>striking</hi> of the
Blood on the posts, denotes unto us the particular apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Blood of Jesus and the virtue of his Passion to
our selves by a lively <hi>Faith.</hi> Which that Religious and
Pious<note n="2" place="bottom">Bochart, ibid.</note> Critick, whom I have before quoted, expresses thus,
<q>The Blood of Christ (saith he) is sprinkled on the posts
of our hearts, when with a firm <hi>Faith</hi> we imbrace the
Doctrine of the Cross, being assured that the Son of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65397:116"/>
God poured out his Blood for us, so that every one of
us may say with the Apostle, <hi>This is a faithful saying,
and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Iesus came into
the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</hi>
                        </q> Moreover,
at the Celebration of the Passover they were to strike the
blood of the slain Lamb on the two side posts of the door
within and without, on purpose <hi>that they might see it,
and take special notice of it</hi> (as the Angel did before) and
that they might call that Wonderful Mercy to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.
<hi>This shall be to you for a Memorial, and ye
shall keep it a Feast to the Lord for ever,</hi> ver. 14. This
solemn Feast was instituted on purpose to <hi>remind</hi> them of
their Deliverance: and so the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in its room, is a <hi>Commem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

by Christ. <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me,</hi> saith he; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this Holy Feast, to help you to call to mind my
Death, and consequently the Infinite Benefits and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which you receive by it.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, we come to speak of the <hi>Eating</hi> of
the Paschal Lamb, and the <hi>several Circumstances</hi> that
were observable in it: and let us see how they agree with
that which we are speaking of. First, I say, it was to
be <hi>Eaten,</hi> and so was the Lamb of God. He himself uses
this stile and language, he calls unto us saying, <hi>Take,
eat, this is my Body,</hi> Mat. 26. 26. And he assures us
that <hi>except we eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and
drink his Blood, we have no life in u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. Whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ateth my
Flesh and drinketh my Blood, hath eternal life: for my Flesh
is meat indeed, and my Blood is drink indeed. He that
eateth my Flesh and drinketh my Blood dwelle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h in me, and
I in him.</hi> Joh. 6. 53, &amp;c. This I think is sufficient to
prove the Parallel between Christ and the Paschal Lamb,
as to <hi>eating</hi> them. Next, we are to observe that this
Lamb which was to be eaten, was to be <hi>roasted with fire,</hi>
ver. 8. And therein also is prefigured what be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>el the
Lamb of God. The Holy Ghost in Scripture is pleased
to compare <hi>God's Wrath</hi> to <hi>Fire,</hi> Deut. 32. 24. Jer. 4. 4.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65397:117"/>
Jer. 15. 14. Jer. 21. 12. Lam. 1. 13. Lam. 2. 4. and
in many other places. Therefore <hi>Roasting in the fire</hi> fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expresseth the Extremity of Christs Sufferings under
the Flames of God's Anger. He was as it were <hi>Scorched</hi>
and <hi>Burnt,</hi> he underwent the Displeasure of God, who is a
<hi>Consuming Fire,</hi> Deut. 4. 24. Heb. 12. 29. This is
thus expressed in other terms by <hi>Isaiah, He was wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities,</hi>
Isa. 53. 5. <hi>He was oppressed and he was afflicted,</hi> ver. 7.
<hi>It pleased the Lord to bruise him, and to put him to grief,</hi>
ver. 10. Some Commentators take no notice of this
Parallel, but certainly it is not to be omitted, nay it is
of very great moment: and the manner of speech very
fitly and significantly expresses the <hi>Heat,</hi> the <hi>Height</hi> of
God's wrath kindled against Sinners. We see this <hi>Torre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
is adapted to the usual language of Scripture,
where the Extremity of the Divine Anger against the
wicked is set forth by <hi>fire, with which</hi> (saith the Learned
and Pious<note n="3" place="bottom">Hierozoic. p. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Bochart) it behoved Christ to be as it were
scorched and burnt, who had made himself a Surety for
Sinners, that he might undergo the Punishment which they
deserved.</hi> Nay, besides the <hi>Mystical</hi> signification, there
is a kind of literal fulfilling of the Expression here used,
if we may credit an antient and pious<note n="4" place="bottom">Just. Mart. Dialog. cum Tryph.</note> 
                        <hi>Father,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us that the <hi>Roasted Lamb at the Passover was spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in such a manner that it resembled the figure of a Cross,</hi>
and he particularly tells us <hi>how.</hi> If we consider that this
Antient Writer of the Church was born and bred in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine,</hi>
and was skill'd in the <hi>Iewish</hi> (as well as <hi>Pagan</hi>)
Rites and Customs; and likewise if we remember that
he spoke these words in a Conference with a knowing
<hi>Iew,</hi> who could and would have contradicted him if he
had deliver'd any thing concerning the <hi>Iewish</hi> practices
which was not true, we cannot but look upon this as a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65397:117"/>
very considerable Testimony, and we must conclude that
he would not have dared to apply this particular passage
of the <hi>Roasting</hi> of the Lamb to our blessed <hi>Savi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ur;</hi> he
would not have compar'd this <hi>Cross</hi> to the <hi>Spit,</hi> unless
there had been ground for it.</p>
                     <p>The next thing observable is, that <hi>the whole Lamb</hi> was
to be eaten, <hi>ver. 10. Ye shall let nothing of it remain</hi>'s
which may import how Intire and Compleat the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
eating of the Lamb of God should be. Whole Christ,
or none, must be receiv'd by Faith. Which the forecited
Author thus piously descants upon. <q>It is not sufficient
to eat Christ in part, as if we were desirous to enjoy
his Glory, but not to be partakers of his Sufferings, or
as if we would have him for our Redeemer, not for
our Lawgiver and Master: as if not attributing enough
to the Merits of Christ, we would partly place our
confident hope of Salvation in our own Works, or in
the Mediation and Intercession of others.</q> And further,
when it is said that the Lamb <hi>must not remain till mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
it doth strangely and marvelously agree with what
the Evangelists relate, that Christ was taken down from
the Cross on a sudden, contrary to the Custom in such
cases, and partly because of the Sabbath on the ensuing
day, that thereby the <hi>Parallel</hi> between our <hi>Saviour</hi> and
the <hi>Iewish Passover</hi> might be more manifest. It is said
further <hi>ver.</hi> 46. and <hi>Num. 9. 12. Neither shall ye break
a bone thereof.</hi> That <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> who suffer'd on the
Cross, was presignifi'd and foretold by this, is plain from
what is recorded by St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who tells us that Divine
Providence so order'd it, that tho the Souldiers broke the
Legs of those that were crucified with Christ, yet <hi>they
br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ke not his Legs,</hi> Joh. 19. 33. A most remarkable
completion of the Type, and that by the wonderful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of Heaven. Whereupon the Evangelist saith, This
was done, that the Scripture might be fulfill'd, <hi>A B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
of him shall not be broken,</hi> ver. 36. Which plainly refers
to this passage concerning the Paschal Lamb of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:65397:118"/>
that they were commanded not to break any bone of it.
And if, according to St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that particular injunction
concerning the <hi>Lamb</hi> be applicable to <hi>Christ,</hi> and was
fulfill'd in him, there is just ground so believe that the
other passages and circumstances relating to that <hi>Lamb,</hi>
are to be apply'd to <hi>Christ</hi> the Lamb of God, and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd
in him. This no man of composed thoughts
can deny.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the <hi>Iews</hi> were to eat their Paschal Lamb
with <hi>Vnleavened Bread,</hi> ver. 8, &amp; 20. the Apostle hath
told us the meaning of that; for after he had said, <hi>Christ
our Passover i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> sacrificed for us,</hi> he immediately adds, <hi>Let
us therefore keep the Feast, not with old Leaven, neither
with the Leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the
Vnleavened Bread of sincerity and truth.</hi> The corrupt
Ferment of Sin, especially of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Dissimulation,</hi>
(which our Saviour also calls <hi>Leaven, Luks 12. 1.</hi>) fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not with the Bread of Life which we are to eat.</p>
                     <p>Yea, we must purge out <hi>all sin and wickedness,</hi> which
the same Inspired Author in the same place again calls
the <hi>Old Leaven,</hi> ver. 7. If we would keep the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Passover aright, we must abandon every known Vice,
which is fitly compared to <hi>Leaven,</hi> because it spreadeth
it self, and soon corrupteth the Soul: <hi>a little Leaven
leaveneth the whole lump,</hi> ver. 6. &amp; Gal. 5. 9. But
from what we read in <hi>Deut. 16. 3.</hi> we may gather that
something besides this is shadowed out: there they are
bid <hi>to eat</hi> all the time of the Passover <hi>Vnleavened Bread,
even the Bread of affliction, because they came forth out
of the Land of Egypt in haste. Vnleavened Bread</hi> then is
the <hi>Bread of affliction;</hi> but why is it call'd so? I conceive
it hath this name, because it is such Bread as the Poor and
Afflicted by reason of pressing hunger eat, not staying till
it be leavened: This sort of Bread they were to eat. And
so we are taught here in what manner we are to eat the
<hi>Christian Passover,</hi> viz. with the Bread of affliction: we
must not pamper our carnal part, we must <hi>not make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65397:118"/>
for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof;</hi> we must, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Apostles Example, <hi>keep under our bodies,
and bring them into subjection</hi> to our better part.</p>
                     <p>And this was partly signified by the eating of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Lamb <hi>with bitter herbs,</hi> ver. 8. The spiritual mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whereof is, that we should not indulge our selves in
the pleasures of Sin, that we should celebrate our Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Passover with godly Contrition and Sorrow, with
hearty Remorse and Repentance, and that with the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Apostle, we should <hi>weep bitterly</hi> for our Sins. The
Crucified <hi>Iesus</hi> is best entertain'd with a broken Heart.</p>
                     <p>And moreover, the posture and demeanour which the
<hi>Israelites</hi> were to observe in their celebrating the Passover,
viz. <hi>with their loins girded, and with sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>s on their feet,</hi>
and <hi>staves in their hands,</hi> ver. 11. which exprest their
readiness to leave <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to depart out of it at the
first warning, represent unto us our duty, which is to be
prepar'd to quit our sins, which make us worse than <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
Bondslaves. Christ being sacrificed and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
we are to fit our selves to follow him, we must
<hi>gird up the loins of our minds,</hi> we must have <hi>our feet sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
with the Evangelical preparation;</hi> we must be constantly
in the posture of <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> whose thoughts are on leaving
the place where they are: and we must be willing and
ready to follow our Blessed Saviour which way soever he
calls us.</p>
                     <p>This is to be remarked likewise, that <hi>no Vncircumcised
person was to eat</hi> of the Passover, no <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>reigner</hi> or <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
ver. 43, 44. Which acquainteth us that none but
those who are admitted into Christ's Church, and are
True and Proper Members of it, can partake of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
which accrue by the death of our Lord; and also,
that Strangers and Aliens from the Covenant of Grace,
and those that are Uncircumcis'd in heart, receive no real
Advantage by coming to the Lord's Supper: they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
only of the outward Elements, but are excluded
from sharing in the Inward Grace and Blessing which
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65397:119"/>
are represented by those External Signs.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see the Parallel between the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Passover.</hi> The Paschal Lamb was a Male, and
without Blemish, and of the First Year: It was taken
out of their own Fold, and kill'd in the Evening, and the
Door-posts were sprinkled with the Blood: It was roas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and then eaten whole, not a bone of it was to be
broken, and nothing of it was to remain. It was eaten
with Unleavened bread, and bitter herbs, with loins girt,
and in haste: it was eaten not by Strangers and Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
persons: and in every one of these particulars it
was Typical and Representative. For tho it is true, there
was this general Reason why these several Observances
concerning the Paschal Lamb were enjoyn'd, namely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their direct opposition to the <hi>Heathen Cerem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
then in practice (as you shall hear afterwards) yet
there was a more particular reason and distinct ground
of the prescribing of these several Rites, <hi>viz.</hi> because
they in some manner were Types and Significations of
what our Lord Christ was to do or suffer, and of what
is required of us in solemnizing the Gospel-Passover.
If any man shall despise these things, and imagine them
little, and not worthy of the Spirit of God, he may
correct his prophane mistake by looking into the <hi>Epistles</hi>
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> especially that to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where he
will find that the Apostle takes notice of such passages as
these which <hi>relate</hi> to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Observances, and by the
direction of the Divine and Infallible Spirit applies them
to our <hi>Lord,</hi> and his Blessed Undertakings, and the main
things of the Gospel-Dispensation. Let none then be so
presumptuous and imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ous as to say that these are Little
and Contemptible, seeing they are such as the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was pleased to dictate. Nay, I might add with great
reason and truth that this <hi>Mystical</hi> way of delivering the
most weighty matters was heretofore used and approved
of by all the <hi>Antient</hi> Sages and Men of Wisdom, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whose Learning chiefly consisted
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65397:119"/>
in <hi>Hieroglyphicks.</hi> And therefore when we see that some
men who have a great esteem of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Learning,
and admire it at a very high rate, do yet slight and vilifie
those <hi>Mysterious Representations</hi> of the greatest and most
important Truths which the Old Testament presents us
with, we cannot but observe their wicked perversness,
whilst they disregard and even ridicule that very way of
communicating Truth in the Holy and Inspired <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
which they magnifie and extol in <hi>Prophane Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I have not finished this <hi>Parallel</hi> yet. To make it
every way compleat, <hi>Christ our Passover</hi> chose to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
<hi>on the very day</hi> that the <hi>Iews</hi> eat their Paschal
Lamb. It is remarkable that Christ, who came to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the Typical and Ceremonious Service of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
yet just before his leaving the World submitted to this
<hi>Mosaical</hi> Observance, and kept it with his Disciples,
which certainly he would never have done if it had not
been to signifie this very thing which I am treating of,
<hi>viz.</hi> that He was the True and Real <hi>Paschal Lamb,</hi> and
that before he died he designed to let them know that
there was an exact Resemblance and Agreement between
one and the other, and more especially as to the <hi>Times.</hi>
This hath been partly proved already; I will now give
farther evidence of it. It is a mighty Controversy among
some Writers, whether Christ kept the Passover on the
same day the <hi>Iews</hi> did, or the day before? Some are
of the opinion that the Lamb according to the Law was
to be killed on that night Christ kept his Passover, but
was to be eaten the next Evening. Therefore they say
Christ eat not the Paschal Lamb, but only celebrated the
Passover with Unleavened Bread and Bitter Herbs. But
this is only said, and not proved. On the contrary, we
know that the Paschal Lamb was to be kill'd and eaten
in the same night, <hi>Exod 12. 8. Dent.</hi> 16. 4. Yea, all
of it was to be eaten that very night, nothing was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
till the morning. Next then, it is to be demanded
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65397:120"/>
whether Christ eat the Passover on the same night with
the <hi>Iews?</hi> I answer, he did not keep the Passover on
the same night that the <hi>Iews</hi> did, but on the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>i. e.</hi> on the Evening of the day before. Not that
Christ anticipated the time of celebrating the Passover
according to the <hi>Law</hi> (as the <hi>Greek Church</hi> holds) but
he kept the true time, he celebrated it according to
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> on the 14<hi>th</hi> day of the first Month
(which answer'd to our <hi>March</hi>) after Evening, <hi>Levit.</hi>
23. 5 <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 17, &amp;c. But the Jews (contrary to
the Law) eat the Passover on the Evening of the day
following, being the 15<hi>th</hi> day. This they did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Custom among them which had obtain'd
for a good while. I will at present offer only one Text,
as a clear proof of this their practice: In <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 28.
'tis said of the jews, that <hi>they went not into the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> the Passover.</hi> Thence it appears that they had not
at that time (<hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> morning) eaten the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
which Christ and his Apostles had done; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ kept the Passover a Night sooner then the
Iews did: they eat not theirs till the Evening after Christ
was crucified, <hi>i. e.</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> Night or Evening. This
following <hi>Scheme</hi> will represent it to you more clearly;
which also will be serviceable to clear some other passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

                        <pb n="224" facs="tcp:65397:121"/>Some Writers, because the Jews day of 24 Hours

and the sormer part of the insuing Night was added to

that in the <hi>Scheme,</hi> and adjust the foremention'd time
by a small alteration: but still it holds true, that the

on the same day that the Jews kill'd and eat
their Passover, as appeareth from the place before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. And this is very remarkable, for the Jews
putting off their Passover a day longer, contrary to their
own Law, was not without the disposal of the All-wise
God, that hereby the Paschal Lamb, and he that was
represented by it, might be slain on the same day. Which
shews the Agreement and Resemblance between <hi>Christ</hi>

(for it was known by both those Names) was another
of those <hi>greater Feasts</hi> observ'd by the Jews. It was
call'd the <hi>Feast of Weeks,</hi> because it was kept at the

and it had the Greek name of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> because the

falling then on a Sabbath, is call'd the <hi>second Sabbath
after the first, <hi>or the</hi> second Prime or chief Sabbath,</hi>
because the Passover before being on a Sabbath Day, was
the <hi>first Prime</hi> or <hi>chief Sabbath.</hi> So then in respect of that,
this is call'd the <hi>second chief Sabbath,</hi> as the <hi>Feast of
Tabernacles</hi> (which come afterwards) may be call'd
the <hi>third chief Sabbath.</hi> Thus <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Hammond;</hi>
but <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Lightfoot</hi> refer it to the <hi>Feast of Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaven'd
Bread,</hi> and make it the <hi>first Sabbath after the

on the sixth day of the Month <hi>Sivan,</hi> which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to our <hi>May:</hi> and the Harvest began at this time.
Wherefore it is call'd <hi>the Feast of Harvest,</hi> and <hi>the
Feast of First-fruits of what was sown in the Field,</hi>
Exod. 23. 16. Then the <hi>first-fruits</hi> of the Corn were
offer'd to God. So I may call it the <hi>Iewish Lammass,
Sax. Lafmasse</hi> i. e. Loas-Masse or Bread-Masse, so call'd
heretofore as a Feast of Thanksgiving to God for the
First-fruits of the Corn. But when the Feast of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost
is called the <hi>Feast of Harvest,</hi> we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this aright, (and I mention it the rather, because
some Writers have mistaken here, and represented the
Matter amiss) we must know then that there were two
Harvests among the Jews, but not in the same order
that they are with us, for their <hi>Barley-harvest</hi> began
first, <hi>viz.</hi> at the <hi>Passover,</hi> and their <hi>Wheat-harvest</hi> was
seven weeks after that. It is of this latter that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Text in <hi>Exodus</hi> is meant. This Feast was of seven
days continuance, but the first and last days were most
solemnly kept: it was instituted in memory of the Law
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65397:122"/>
given on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> fifty days after the Passover, <hi>Lev.</hi>
23. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. There was the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> which began
on the 15<hi>th</hi> day of the 7<hi>th</hi> Month, or <hi>September,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the computation of the <hi>Sacred Year,</hi> which
commenced from <hi>March,</hi> Levit. 23. 34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
eight days, in the first seven of which they dwelt
in Tabernacles or Booths, made of the Boughs of these
Trees especially, Willow, Palm, Mirtle. Whatever
weather happen'd, they remain'd in these Tabernacles so
many days together. They used at this time to hold in
their hands <hi>Branches of Trees,</hi> which they call'd <hi>Hosan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi>
because when they had them in their hands, it was
their custom to cry <hi>Hasanna, Save now.</hi> The first and
last days were the chiefest, as it was in all their <hi>Feasts.</hi>
On the last day they fetch'd Water out of the River
<hi>Siloah,</hi> and brought it to the Temple, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the Priest, who poured it with Wine upon
the Altar, the People singing that in <hi>Isa.</hi> 12. 3. Hence
our Saviour took occasion on this last day of the Feast
to cry, saying, <hi>If any Man thirst, let him come unto
me and drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iohn 7. 37, 38.</hi> This Anniversary
Feast was kept in remembrance of the 40 Years sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Wilderness, all which time they dwelt in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles.</p>
                     <p>These are they which the Jews call <hi>Shalosh regalim,</hi>
the <hi>great Feasts:</hi> but more especially they call the
three last so, which you find mentioned together in
<hi>Exod. 23. 14, 15. Three times in the Year shalt thou
keep a Feast unto me: thou shalt keep the Feast of Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened
Bread,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Feast of the Passover) <hi>and
the Feast of Ingathering, which is in the end of the Year,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>
the Feast of Tabernacles): <hi>these three times in the Year
shall all thy Males appear before the Lord,</hi> i. e. they were
to go from their own Habitations up to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

had issues of Blood, and the like. But the main thing
remarkable was, the <hi>difference of Meats and Drinks:</hi>
therefore I will speak particularly of that in this place,
(and I may have occasion to glance on some of the rest
afterwards.) Some have thought (as hath been suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before) that this usage prevailed before the <hi>Mosaick
Law,</hi> i. e. that some Creatures were clean, and others
unclean, in regard of their being permitted or forbidden
to be eaten. But I have already shew'd in what sense
they were said to be <hi>clean</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi>unclean,</hi> viz. in respect of
<hi>Sacrificing,</hi> and not of <hi>eating.</hi> But under the <hi>Mosaick
Law</hi> there is (and never was before) set down the
Number of those Creatures which must not be eaten, and
we are particularly told what the Cleanness or Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of them is. The <hi>clean Animals</hi> were only those
that <hi>chew the Cud,</hi> and <hi>divide the Hoof.</hi> This was the
Sign and Mark of them; and it must be observed, that
by dividing the Hoof is meant, dividing it into <hi>two</hi>
parts only, not into more; for some divide the Hoof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>more</hi> parts, and are not clean, as a Dog, a Lion, a
Wolf. And Camels have the Hoof divided, but not
quite through, it is pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is said of the Camel, <hi>Levit.</hi> 11. 4. that <hi>he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not the Hoof,</hi> viz. from the top to the bottom,
but only in part, as Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ural Historians have observed.
And as parting the Hoof, and chewing the Cud, are two
signs of a <hi>clean Beast, so Fins</hi> and <hi>Scales</hi> make a <hi>Fish</hi>
legally <hi>clean.</hi> And as for <hi>Fowl,</hi> you have a particular
enumeration of those that are clean or unclean. <hi>Bees</hi>

also were unclean and forbidden Food to the Jews, but
their <hi>Honey</hi> was not. I might observe further, that <hi>Fat</hi>
is forbidden to be eaten, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Fat which covers the
inward Parts, as the Heart, Liver, Kidneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.
3. 16. This the Jews might not eat, no not at
home when they kill'd a Beast. But it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of such Beasts as were used to be sacrificed to God,
as Sheep, Oxen, Goats, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 23, 25. The Fat
of these Creatures was to be burnt, but by no means
eaten. And as for the Blood of these, and all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
it was to be poured on the Ground, and by no
means to be eaten or drank. I could add, that the Jews
stretched this <hi>Abstinence</hi> from Meats beyond what was
injoined, for they would not eat the hinder Legs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
because the Angel strained <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Thigh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Sinews shrank: But in <hi>Italy</hi> the Jews cut out
these Nerves by Art, and eat the Legs.</p>
                     <p>If it be asked, What was the <hi>Reason</hi> that such and
such Creatures were forbidden to be Food? Why did not
God suffer the Jews to feed on all Animals indifferently?
The Answer may be that of St. <hi>Augus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

case, <hi>Quia voluit,</hi> because it seemed good to God to do

be given. Thus <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wholly into God's Authority and Sovereignty. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
offer <hi>Reason</hi> of God's acting thus: 1. Some
think that it was God's Pleasure to ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ies
observ'd in those Creatures. They conceive that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> are represented by unclean Animals,

he warned them against the Timorousness of the one,
the Filthiness of the other, and the Ravenousness of

this to be a Prohibition of a Gentile Custom that had a

of the <hi>Chief and main Reasons</hi> of God's appointing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65397:126"/>
the difference of Meats to the Jews was, because he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this should be a <hi>distinction</hi> between them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
People. This is the positive Reason given by God
himself, in <hi>Deut. 14. 2, 3. Levit.</hi> 20. 24, 25. The
Jews were a peculiar People, and therefore had this as a
peculiar Law. 6. With this Reason another is insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
join'd, viz. that by this means they were kept from
occasions of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> for hereby a familiar Converse
with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was hindred. They could not eat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
because some Meats were unclean to the <hi>Iews:</hi>
therefore the <hi>Iews</hi> could not mix with them, but were
forced to separate from them, which was a good Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to keep them from the Idolatry of the Nations.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, This Law was given the Jews, to prevent all
<hi>Idolatry</hi> on <hi>another account,</hi> as thus, God appointed
some Animals Clen, and others Unclean, that these
People eating the former, and abhorring the latter,
might worship neither; for<note n="1" place="bottom">

imaginable to adore what we eat; and there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
of deifying what we abominate. Thus <hi>Theodoret</hi>
and some other <hi>Fathers</hi> say, the difference of <hi>Clean</hi> and
<hi>Vnclean</hi> Animals was set by God, because he foresaw
the Jews inclinable to Idolatry. He ordered some to be
clean, as Sheep, and Oxen, and Goats, and Doves,
these being abstain'd from, and counted as <hi>Gods</hi> by the
<hi>Egyptians:</hi> therefore the <hi>Israelites</hi> were commanded to
<hi>eat</hi> these. They must now not only <hi>sacrifice,</hi> but feed

16. 3. which seems to argue that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (from
whom they had these Flesh-pots) did not abstain from
the <hi>flesh of Animals.</hi> To which I answer, 1. This may
be understood of the flesh of Sheep, Oxen, and Goats,
which it was lawful for the <hi>Israelites</hi> to eat, and which
they did eat in <hi>Egypt</hi> as often as they could get it. So
that this refers not to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but the <hi>Israelites</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Or 2. supposing it hath reference to the former,
it is meant of the <hi>flesh of Fish</hi> and <hi>Fowl</hi> which the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
fed upon, and of which there was very great plenty
in that Countrey. And it is to be understood likewise of
the <hi>Pots</hi> and vessels wherein the <hi>Egyptians</hi> boil'd and kept
<hi>Hogs-flesh,</hi> which was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ood permitted to them. And
indeed generally the people of other Heathen Countries,
tho they abstain'd from some other Animals out of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
reverence to them, fed freely on <hi>Swines-flesh.</hi>
Whence, I remember, Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> gathers that the
<hi>Gadarens</hi> were <hi>Heathens,</hi> viz. because we read there
were Swine among them, <hi>Luke. 8. 32, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>If it be objected, the <hi>Egytians</hi> had Cattle, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 6.

their Beasts for Sacrifice, as if they were meat for their

to affront the Idolatry of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who used to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
several Animals. Now G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Vows</hi> under the Law. There you will find these
Vows (which were voluntary Services tending to the
Honour of God) were either <hi>Estimat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ry,</hi> or <hi>Vows of
Destruction.</hi> Of the first of these the Chapter treateth
from the beginning to the 28<hi>th ver. Estimatory Vows</hi>
were either <hi>Personal</hi> or <hi>Real.</hi> Of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the

Vowing or Consecrating of the Persons of Men, Women
or Children to God, that Chapter speaketh from <hi>ver.</hi> 1.
to the 9<hi>th.</hi> But tho the <hi>Persons</hi> were Vowed, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that a <hi>Valuation</hi> should serve the turn, <hi>i. e.</hi> the
Priest was to set a Value on the Person, and then such a
Sum of Money was to be paid by the person that made
the Vow, which was to be laid out on pious uses, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
the Tabernacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And accordingly you find
the Persons are here <hi>Estimated,</hi> and so were to be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with money. Such <hi>Vows</hi> as that of <hi>Anna,</hi> who

                           </gap>l</hi> to the Lord, were of another kind:
That was a Vow to be actually performed, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.
That devoted a person to a particular Function
or Service, but this was the solemn promising of giving
the Rate of a Person, of Himself, or his Wife, or Servant,
or Child to God. And there was a general Law that all
the <hi>first-born</hi> of Men should be set apart for God's Service,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 2. which was occasion'd by God's saving the
<hi>first-born</hi> of the <hi>Israelites</hi> when he destroy'd those of the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 13. 15. These therefore were to
be <hi>redeem'd</hi> with a certain Sum which was to be paid to
the Priest. This is all the meaning of this sort of <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Vows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>Real Vows</hi> the Chapter speaks from <hi>ver.</hi> 9. to
28. These were Vowings of <hi>Things</hi> to God, as Cattle,
Fields, Houses, Possessions. The giving of <hi>Beasts</hi> by
Vow was to <hi>sacrifice</hi> them, if they were Clean, (and
indeed the First-born males of all <hi>Clean Creatures</hi> were
to be sacrificed, <hi>Exod. 13. 2, 12. Num.</hi> 18. 17.) if
<hi>Vnclean,</hi> to <hi>redeem</hi> them, <hi>Exod</hi> 13. 8. (for here an As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God, was bestowing them on the Priests and Levites for
their maintenance, or for repairing the Tabernacle or
Temple, or for any other Pious uses. But all these
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65397:128"/>
might be <hi>Redeemed</hi> at a certain Price or Rate; <hi>i. e.</hi> by
giving something in lieu of them to the Priests: the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Valuations are set down in this Chapter. And
here it is to be observ'd, that it was intolerable prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to vow and offer things to God that were mean
and base, and of a polluted nature. Which is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd in <hi>Deut. 23. 18. Thou shalt not bring the hire of a
whore, or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord thy
God for any Vow.</hi> Money which Harlots receiv'd for
prostitution was to be by no means dedicated to God.
The Sacrifices which were bought with the price of their
Whoredom were abominable to him. Their Money
was adulterate as well as themselves. Not only they
but their Gains were detestable. It was the price of Sin,
and therefore must not be offer'd. This was a sufficient
Caution against the future practice of some of the <hi>Pontifs</hi>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who exact a Tribute of the <hi>Stews,</hi>
and pretend to employ it to Religious uses. And so as
for money for the sale of any vile Creature, especially of
a <hi>Dog,</hi> it was not to be brought into the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> or
<hi>Temple.</hi> Nay, whereas the Firstilings of all other Unclean
Animals were redeemed with money, this is excepted,
as being under the <hi>Law</hi> a very contemptible and base
Creature, and therefore deservedly joyn'd with <hi>Harlets.</hi>
So<note n="1" place="bottom">Gregor. Tolos. De Repub. l. 3. c. 5.</note> one tells us that a Tribute on <hi>Dogs</hi> as well as <hi>Prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>
was used among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and he proves it out of
<hi>Evagrius</hi> and <hi>Cedrenus.</hi> So much for the <hi>Real Vows,</hi>
which concern things Redeemable.</p>
                     <p>But as there were some Persons and Things Vowed
which might be Redeemed, so there was another fort
of Devoted Things and Persons, call'd <hi>Cherem,</hi> which
could not be Redeemed. Of these you read in <hi>Ver.</hi> 28,
&amp;. 29. of this Chapter. Here are meant <hi>Vows of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, i. e.</hi> Devoting <hi>Persons to slaughter and death,</hi>
                        <pb n="239" facs="tcp:65397:128"/>
or destining <hi>Things</hi> to <hi>Desolation</hi> and <hi>Ruine,</hi> as in the
case of <hi>Iericho,</hi> which was pronounced a Curs'd, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
place, with all the persons in it, <hi>Ios.</hi> 6. 17. And
the killing and destroying of the <hi>Seven Nations</hi> was an

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Will now enter upon another Task: for tho I have
already, as I went along, interspersed some <hi>Reasons</hi>
of the particular Rites and Ceremonial Practices which
I mention'd; yet, before I proceed to the next main
Head propounded, I will yet further produce some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,

and Observances already mentioned, as also of the
rest of the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Customs and Practices. And these
six Reasons I offer,</p>
                     <p>1. By these Ceremonious Rites God was pleas'd <hi>to
try and exercise the</hi> Jews <hi>Obedience.</hi> I do not say with

Ceremonies and Observa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ces prescrib'd the <hi>Iews</hi> were
impos'd upon them by God as a <hi>Punishment</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or making
the Golden Calf; as if the whole <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> was
given them meerly to chastize them for their Idolatry:
This is a groundless <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ancy, and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ounds the notions of a
<hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Punishment,</hi> which are two distinct things.
But this we may safely and on good grounds assert, that
God design'd this Law to be a <hi>Tryal</hi> of them. As God
thought fit to try the Obedience of our First Parents by
the Fruit of one single Tree, as it was his Pleasure to
choose that particular way, so here it seem'd good to
him to make experiment of the <hi>Iews</hi> readiness to comply
with his Will, by imposing these <hi>Rit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi> upon them, and
by requiring their submission to them.</p>
                     <p>2. God thought good to put <hi>This Restraint</hi> upon the
<hi>Iewish</hi> people. <hi>Before Faith came</hi> (saith the Apostle)

this <hi>Hedg of the Law</hi> (as the <hi>Iews</hi> call'd the Mosaick
Rites) enclos'd them, and kept them in. It [was the
Wisdom of God to keep that People in Awe by this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Discipline. If there were no other Account to be
given of the Imposing of the <hi>Legal Ceremonies</hi> but this,
this were enough. But there are several others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:65397:130"/>3. The primary Reason of the Mosaick Rites was to
keep the people from <hi>Idolatry.</hi> This I had occasion to
touch upon when I gave the <hi>particular Reason</hi> of the Law
concerning the <hi>Distinction of Meats.</hi> But now I apply
it more generally to all the parts of the <hi>Ceremonial Law.</hi>
The Observance of these kept them from <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and
this it did two ways: 1. As those Rites held the people
in Employment. 2. As they were directly opposite to
the Rites and Customs of the Idolatrous Nations<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> First,
I say, they serve to keep them <hi>Employ'd,</hi> and so in some
measure hindred them from Idolatry. This is certain,
that the <hi>Iewish</hi> people were strangely prone to imitate
the <hi>Heathens</hi> that lived about them, they used to ape
their gross<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st Idolatries. Wherefore God used this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
he prescribed them all these <hi>various Rites,</hi> which
he knew would certainly keep them in action, and not
allow them leisure to mind the Usages of other Nations.
They had their hands full, and could not well apply
themselves to any thing else. By busying themselves
with their own Rites and Customs they were diverted
from following Idolatrous ones. By the multitude and
variety of those Ceremonies they were diverted from the
Idolatry of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were round about them, and
who otherwise would have infected them with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
fashions. St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> expresseth it thus:<note n="1" place="bottom">

Ceremonies were prescribed to the</hi> Jews <hi>for a certain Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to them, and that they might yield an occasion of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
and Employment.</hi> They had work enough to do,
and so could not attend to Idolatrous practices. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The Mosaick Rites and Ceremonies were a good
Remedy against these, because they were directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the Idolatrous Rites of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> I have
shew'd this already in the Instance of <hi>forbidding of Swines

flesh,</hi> &amp;c. But now I will make it good in other parts
of the <hi>Mosaick Law:</hi> I will let you see that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in opposition to the Customs and Practices of
the <hi>Heathen Idolaters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We must know then that the <hi>Eastern Nations,</hi> as <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrians,</hi>
and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and others that were neighbours
to the <hi>Iews,</hi> used these following Ceremonies, <hi>viz.</hi> Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their flesh, Rounding the corners of their heads,
Sowing the ground with divers seeds: It was usual for
Women to wear the Garments of Men, and Men those
of Women; they accustom'd themselves to eating of the
blood of Animals, looking towards the East when they
Worshipp'd, and Adoring the rising Sun; and some
things likewise relating to Sacrifices and Oblations might
be mention'd. These and many more were constantly
practised by the <hi>Zabians</hi> and other neighbouring people
who were given to Idolatry, and they were used by them
in a Superstitious and Idolatrous manner. This you will
find proved by the Excellent <hi>Selden, Hottinger,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Learned Writers out of<note n="1" place="bottom">In More Nevochim. P. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Maimonides.</hi> And from
him the Learned<note n="2" place="bottom">De Legib. Hebraic. lib. 3.</note> Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi> and others shew that even
all the Rites and Ceremonies used at the <hi>Paschal Feast,</hi>
which I particularly enumerated before, were in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Idolatrous Customs among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The
Paschal Lamb was to be a <hi>Male of the first year,</hi> i. e. a
young Ram, in defiance of the idolatrous <hi>Egyptians</hi> who
counted a Ram the most sacred Animal: this therefore
God bids them kill and sacrifice. <hi>They must not eat it
raw,</hi> because the Heathens eat their Sacrifices raw. It
was to be eaten <hi>in the house,</hi> to avoid the <hi>Procession</hi> used
by the <hi>Gentiles. A Bone was not to be broken,</hi> because
the <hi>Heathens</hi> tore their Sacrifices in pieces. <hi>The head
with the legs and purtenance</hi> were to be eaten, to affront
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65397:131"/>
the <hi>Pagans</hi> who eat the Entrails only. <hi>Nothing was to
remain till the morning,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Heathens</hi>
who used the relicks of Sacrifices superstitiously. <hi>It
was not to be sodden in water, but to be roasted,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the custom of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and others who boyl'd
their Sacrifices.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Maimonides</hi> was indeed the first that opposed and
confuted that received opinion of some <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors,
that there was <hi>no Reason</hi> to be given of the <hi>Ritual Law,</hi>
but that it was wholly from the Soveraign Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God. He on the Contrary proves that these <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Rites</hi> have <hi>Reason</hi> to vouch them, and that they
were not given as the Arbitrary Commands of an Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Empire over mankind. And he came to know this
particular Reason, which I now assign of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances,
from his being acquainted with the Rites and
Ceremonies of the <hi>Zabii.</hi> He largely insists on this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that most of the Jewish Rites were instituted to
oppose the Superstitions of those <hi>Zabii,</hi> an antient sort of
Idolaters in the <hi>East.</hi> The very things which those Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
practised are particularly forbid by God to the <hi>Iews:</hi>
Hence they are forbid to<note n="3" place="bottom">Lev. 19. 27, 28.</note> cut or mangle their flesh, to
<note n="3" place="bottom">Lev. 19. 27, 28.</note> shave the corners of their heads, to<note n="4" place="bottom">Deut. 22. 9.</note> sow the ground with
different seeds, because all these were Superstitious Usages
of the <hi>Zabii.</hi> Likewise<note n="5" place="bottom">Lev. 19. 26.</note> eating of blood was severely
forbidden on the same account, and so was<note n="6" place="bottom">Deut. 22. 5.</note> the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
wearing the Garment of a Man, and <hi>vice versa.</hi>
This changing of Vestments is forbid (saith<note n="7" place="bottom">De Diis Syr. Syntag. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Selden</hi>) that
they might not imitate the Worshippers of the <hi>Syrian Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
who had various Rites in worshipping her, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the difference of those put on Mens or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
clothes. And this Learned Antiquary had it from
<note n="8" place="bottom">More Nevoch. pars 3. cap. 38.</note> 
                        <hi>Maimonides,</hi> who tells us that by that <hi>Mosaick</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65397:131"/>
is forbid Idolatrous Worship, and particularly the
Worship of <hi>Venus Male and Female</hi> in use among the
<hi>Assyrians.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> were forbid also<note n="3" place="bottom">Exod. 23. 19.</note> to seeth a Kid
in his Mother's milk, <hi>i. e.</hi> to offer a Kid or any Animal
in Sacrifice whilst it is immature, and sucking its Dam:
It must be kept up seven days with its Dam, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.
30. Or, this may refer not only to Sacrifices and First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits,
but to Food; they were not to eat a Kid till it was
come to a sufficient growth, i. e. till it was fit, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of age, to be eaten: so this is applied in <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.
21. In either of these senses the Precept may seem to
be oppos'd to a <hi>Heathenish Zabian</hi> Rite, and therefore
was enjoyn'd the <hi>Iews,</hi> saith our Learned <hi>Gregory.</hi> A
Dog was the most abominable Animal of all the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
under the <hi>Law</hi> (as appears from what was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the occasion of which was this, it was the chief
Animal and in highest respect among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and
was worshipp'd by them. Whence in opposition to
this base and idolatrous venerating of it by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
it is by the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law rendred the most filthy and
detestable Creature upon earth. So the <hi>Iews</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to worship toward the West, and accordingly
the Holy of Holies in the Sanctuary and Temple was
built West-ward, in opposition to the <hi>Sabaan</hi> Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Sun, who turn'd towards the East. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God would have the <hi>Iews</hi> turn their backs to the
Sun when they worshipped.</p>
                     <p>And several other Precepts of the Mosaick Law were

and amply maintain'd this Assertion, That most of
the Rites and Usages which we read of in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

were borrow'd from the <hi>Gentile</hi> Idolaters, <hi>viz.</hi> worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

of First-fruits, paying of Tithes, the Priest's Vestments
of Linen, the Vow of <hi>Nazarites,</hi> or letting the hair grow

to their title of Sanctity. 3. The <hi>Gentile</hi> Gods shew'd

of it: even so (saith this Writer) the true God punish'd
the curiosity and prophaneness of such as peep'd into his
Ark, or irreverently laid hands upon it, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 19.
4. The Idolaters placed their Ark in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and in
the chief Apartment of their Temple: thus the Ark of
the Testament was set in the Holiest place of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
or Temple. Thus they agree as to the place.
5. The Pagans had their <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> men appointed on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
for the <hi>carrying of their Ark.</hi> Every one was not
permitted to be employ'd in that sacred work: yea they
chose persons of the highest Rank among them to execute
this worthy Office. Thus the bearing of the Ark among
the <hi>Israelites</hi> was the work of those who were Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to that Employment, and were of the <hi>Levitical</hi>
Race, which was esteemed most Worthy and Noble.
6. Both sorts of Arks agree in their Use and principal
End, which was to contain the sacred things belonging
to God and Idols. As the Pagans Ark held their magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Instruments, Diabolical Utensils, and prophane
Knacks and Trumpery, even so, and just so God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Ark to hold and preserve the <hi>Tables of the Law.</hi>
Is not this playing with Holy Things? The very exposing
these particulars is, I think, Confutation sufficient.</p>
                     <p>The Second <hi>Parallel</hi> is between the <hi>Egyptian Images</hi>
and the <hi>Cherubims:</hi> 1. Saith he, those <hi>Images</hi> were held
to be the most sacred things among that people; so the
<hi>Iews,</hi> God's people, knew nothing more Sacred and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
than the <hi>Cherubinical Images.</hi> 2. The Images of
<hi>Egypt</hi> were generally made of Gold: In imitation of
which the <hi>Cherubims</hi> were of the same costly matter.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> all the time of their Worship, cast
their eyes on their Images; In like manner the <hi>Iews</hi>
look'd towards the Cherubins whenever they pray'd, or
sprinkled the Blood of the Sacrifices. 4. The <hi>Egyptian</hi>
Images were the Seat or Throne of their Gods, from
whence they gave <hi>Answers</hi> to those who came to inquire
of them; after which Example God placed his Royal
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65397:133"/>
Seat or Throne between the <hi>Cherubins,</hi> and from thence
he gave forth <hi>Answers</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> whenever he came to
consult upon great occasions. 5. The Images of those
Pagans were of a mixt shape, and did not resemble any
one Animal: thus the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>erubim</hi> appointed by God were
miscellaneous Images, made up of the likeness of Man
and Beasts. 6. He adds that it was the Custom of the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests to bear their Images on their shoulders,
and to carry them about with great Pomp. The <hi>Iewish
Priests</hi> were commanded by God to follow this Practice,
whence we read that they li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Pagan Nations (which is freely acknowledged by this

Rites,</hi> and that therefore God injoined those Laws be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were so directly contrary to the Pagan Rights
and Usages. Yet in his <hi>whole Third Book</hi> he labours to
prove that the <hi>Iewish Rites</hi> were taken from the <hi>Gentile</hi>
Idolaters. He (as well as <hi>Maimonides, Scaliger, Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinger</hi>
and others) asserts that the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Institutions
were a remedy against <hi>Zabiism,</hi> i. e. they were given
and injoyn'd to the <hi>Iews</hi> to keep them from Idolatry,
especially that practis'd by the <hi>Zabii,</hi> that is, the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi>
and <hi>Arabians,</hi> yea and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whose Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
practices were most known in <hi>Moses</hi>'s time. But
you may wonder to find at the same time the great Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this Notion endeavouring to convince his Readers
in many places of his Writings, that God in the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and framing of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Laws, borrowed many
things from those <hi>Zabii,</hi> and designedly made his Laws
in imitation of them.</p>
                     <p>What strange Notions are these! God instituted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Rites me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Rites of the Heathens; for he would have the <hi>Iews</hi>
to be <hi>Antipodes</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their Worship: Yet he
appointed several other Rites and Observances, and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded his people to use them for this reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were such Rites as were observed by the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
Idolaters. The <hi>Iews</hi> were forbid to symbolize with
the <hi>Pagans,</hi> lest they should learn their Idolatry: and yet
they were commanded to practise sundry of their Rites,
that they might not relapse into Idolatry. What? must
we believe that a great part of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Laws were made
on purpose to oppose the Rites of the <hi>Zabii,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that God takes these Heathens for his pattern, and
gives his people several Commandments merely to
comply with their Usages? Is it to be credited that
God forbad and abhorred the <hi>Gentile</hi> practices, and yet
at the same time appointed his people several Rites which
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> used, yea <hi>because</hi> they were <hi>Gentile Rites,</hi>
and practis'd by the <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Nations, as this Author
expresly asserts?</p>

                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:65397:134"/>He hath no where satisfied these Difficulties, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
these Absurdities and Contradictions, which it

But being warmed with this Notion, he keeps on
with full career, and attempts to shew (as he imagines)
that many Customs Prophane and Diabolical were taken
into the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from Satan's service to his own. A great part of his
<hi>Third Book</hi> is spent in this. With those Old Rites the
Devil had been served, and now he pretends it is God's
turn to be serv'd by them. He labours to shew there
that the most Holy and Tremendous things in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are taken from the most prophane and impure practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the worst of Heathens. In short, he maintains no
other than this throughout his <hi>whole Third Book,</hi> that God
raked up all the Vain, Lud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Mankind, and out of all these patch'd up a great part
of the Religion which he appointed his own People. If
you can credit this (and you must credit it if you assent

I will not press them any further: especially because
I discours'd of this matter somewhat freely when I made
it my business to prove that many of the Pagan Rites and
Customs in Religion (as well as in Secular Affairs) were
borrow'd from the <hi>Iews</hi> and their Sacred Usages: which

the Rites and Ceremonies injoyn'd by God himself to

Thus the Apostle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24, &amp;c. very handsomely il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrates
the nature of this part of the Legal Dispensation:
<hi>The Law was our Schoolmaster,</hi> saith he. Here is <hi>Moses</hi>

                        </hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi>
for being but in our minority, we were not capable then
of a higher Institution and Instruction. But this fitted
and prepared us by degrees for the reception of that other,
and this <hi>Schoolmaster</hi> of the Law serv'd as an usher to
the Gospel. But saith the Apostle in the next verse,
<hi>After that Faith</hi> (i. e. the time of the Gospel) <hi>is come, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

under the lash of the Law; our state and condition do
not require it. And God is pleas'd to administer things
wisely according to the condition and circumstances we
are under. And this Apostle by another fit Allusion in
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, &amp;c. sets forth the nature of this <hi>Oeconomy</hi> which
he had spoken of before: <hi>The Heir as long as he is a child,
differeth nothing from a servant, though he be Lord of all,
bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Father. Even so we, when we were children,
were in bondage under the elements of the world: but when
the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son,</hi>
&amp;c. In which words St. <hi>Paul</hi> compareth the <hi>Iudaical
Law</hi> to a <hi>Tutor</hi> or <hi>Guardian,</hi> under whom the Heir
doth not enjoy that freedom of a Son which afterwards
he is to come to. This (saith he) was the case of the
<hi>Iewish</hi> people: they were but <hi>Minors</hi> and <hi>Pupils,</hi> and
so stood in need of a <hi>Tutor,</hi> i. e. one that is appointed
to take care and have the charge of those who by reason
of their insufficient age and understanding cannot look to
themselves. The <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> was the <hi>Iews</hi> Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
whilst they were under age: this sowr Governour
and Overseer kept them in, and curb'd them, and on
that account was very useful to them at that time.</p>
                     <p>But the Apostle seems here to recur to his former
comparison of the <hi>Law</hi> to a <hi>Schoolmaster,</hi> when he
adds, that the <hi>Iews</hi> as long as they were <hi>Children,
were in bondage under the Elements of the world.</hi> The

and consequently for diversity of Laws. Parents
rule <hi>Children</hi> after another manner than when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive

So God ordereth his Church: that is fit for it
at one time which is not at another. <hi>Israel was a Child,</hi>
Hos. 11. 1. that was the state of the <hi>Iews</hi> when they
<hi>were call'd out of Egypt.</hi> And the Apostle uses the same
Expression, as you have heard. Now, when the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
Church was in this lower Form, the <hi>First Rudiments</hi>
were most agreeable to that condition: these <hi>Beginners</hi>
were to be used to their <hi>Letters.</hi> God dealt with that
People according to their Weakness and Shallowness.
Wherefore we may observe that he Invited and Allured
them, as well as Terrified them: The Promise of a Land
flowing with <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Honey</hi> suited these <hi>Children</hi>
well.

                     <p>6. These <hi>Ritual</hi> Observances and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> to represent greater things
that were to come. God chose out a certain People

And the same may be said of their <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Ritual</hi>
Worship. I have shew'd already that the <hi>Mosaick Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi>

Interpreters, who apply the Mosaick Rites to

they are sometimes more Ingenious than Solid, and may
be thought to strain and force some things, yet as to
the main they let us see that those Mosaick and Ritual
Constitutions had some reference to the Gospel, and that
most of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than the literal one, they come far short of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

and Types of Spiritual things, that they represented and
pointed out the <hi>Messias</hi> with all his Blessed Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
and the unspeakable Benefits which accrue to us
thence, you will not say those Laws were light and
ludicrous and unworthy of God, but that they were of
great and singular use, and serv'd to most excellent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
This is the best account I can give of the true
<hi>Reasons</hi> of this part of the <hi>Legal Dispensation,</hi> viz. why
after so long a time from the Creation these <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
and Observations (some of which were very irksome and
burdensome) were imposed by God on the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
People, and lasted till Christ's coming.</p>
                     <p>It may be expected I should treat, in the next place,
of the <hi>Iudicial Law,</hi> which was for preserving of Civil
Peace and Justice among the <hi>Iews.</hi> This was the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
or <hi>Municipal Law</hi> of that Nation. It contain'd
Precepts concerning the ordering of that People in the
matter of Judgement, Punishments, Contracts, Division
of Lands and Inheritances, making of War and the like.
These Precepts may be distinguish'd according to the
different Ranks of Men, and so, 1. they have a regard to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65397:139"/>
the Relation between the <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Magistrate</hi> and the
<hi>People:</hi> there you have the Injunctions which concern
Governours and their Office, and likewise the Duty
which is to be paid to them. 2. They have respect to
the Relation and Commerce which People have with <hi>one
another:</hi> and there you have Precepts concerning Buying
and Selling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. They direct the <hi>Iews</hi> as to their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
towards <hi>Strangers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> here are Rules concerning
entertaining of Strangers, going to War against their
Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. They take notice of <hi>Domestick</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and accordingly give directions as to the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of Husbands, Wives, Children, Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not of <hi>this Law</hi> that I am concern'd at present to
speak, because it is Secular rather than Religious, and
so doth not properly fall under my consideration when I
treat of the <hi>Dispensations of Religion.</hi> Only, as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
before of some of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> enjoyn'd by the
Mosaick Law, that they were in use before that Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so here it may be noted that some of the <hi>Iudicial
Laws</hi> were in force before <hi>Moses</hi>'s time, as punishing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery</hi>
with death: (only with this difference, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

with S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oning) <hi>Killing</hi> of a Man or Woman was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with death: <hi>marrying the Brother</hi>'s <hi>Widow</hi> was
enjoyn'd: <hi>Cutting off from the People</hi> was a Sanction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

before the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, I will remark that some things in this
juncture pass for <hi>Laws,</hi> which are rather, and more
properly may be call'd <hi>Dispensations</hi> or <hi>Permissions.</hi>
Thus <hi>Poligamy,</hi> which was practis'd by <hi>Lamech</hi> first,
then by <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> is now permitted under
the <hi>Law,</hi> as in <hi>Elkana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, David, Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. And
thus they permitted a Man to put away his Wife for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
or Adultery. As for the <hi>Degrees of Consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and <hi>Affinity,</hi> within which the <hi>Iews</hi> were forbid to
marry, the 18<hi>th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Leviticus</hi> gives us a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65397:139"/>
of them, and I shall afterwards have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of discoursing of them. Therefore I will not insert
any thing of them in this place, for what I have said is
sufficient for my purpose, which was to give you some
account of this <hi>distinct Administration,</hi> and to let you
see wherein it differeth from the rest.</p>
                     <p>Only here I will inquire what obligation these <hi>Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Laws</hi> have upon <hi>Christians.</hi> It was the opinion of
<hi>Castalio</hi> and some others, that these are to be perpetually
retain'd in Christian Commonwealths, but it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to pronounce this in the gross, for we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>distinguish</hi> concerning this matter. I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
then to you that as <hi>Moral Laws,</hi> viz. concerning
the Poor, Forgiving of Injuries, Equity in Contracts,
Duty towards Strangers, were mixed with the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
ones</hi> in Levit. 19. So several <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Natural
Laws,</hi> such as oblige all Nations, were delivered on
Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> mixed with <hi>Iudicial ones.</hi> Such was the
Law against Homicide, the Duty of Men to Widows, and
Orphans, the Reverence due to the Magistrate, and
others mention'd in the 21, and 22. Chapters of <hi>Exodu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

These belong not to the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Law, but concern all Persons at all Times, and in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
In the inquiry then proposed, there are these two
kinds of Laws, 1. Such as have respect to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Condition and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and
concern their individual Polity and State. 2. Such as
are not appropriated to the State of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> People,
but were given to them as <hi>Men</hi> rather than <hi>Iews,</hi> and
consequently may be serviceable and useful to other
Nations. As to the former of these, they do not oblige
<hi>Christians</hi> in the least, but expired with the State of that
People: but the latter are obligatory under the Gospel,
so far as they are of common Equity, and as they may
be made use of now as well as then. And tho what our
Church (in her <hi>Seventh Article</hi>) saith is to be granted,
namely, that <hi>the Civil Precepts of the Mosaick Law
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65397:140"/>
ought not of necessity to be receiv'd in any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>
yet where Reason and Equity commend those
Civil Constitutions to any Commonwealth or Kingdom,
they are to be embraced and made use of. For there is
some Reverence to be given to those <hi>Politicks</hi> which
were the Invention and Appointment of Heaven: and so
far as they were not appropriated to the condition of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> People, they may be practised among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
without offence. Thus the Law of <hi>Tithes</hi> is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
adopted into our Constitutions in this Nation.</p>
                     <p>So likewise if you look to their <hi>bodily Punishments,</hi>
you will see that some of them are made use of in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kingdoms, if not all of them, in one place or
other. But here it will be asked, May <hi>Christians</hi> inflict
severer Punishments than the <hi>Iewish</hi> Law prescribed? To
which<note n="1" place="bottom">Hist. of the World, B. 2. Ch. 5.</note> Sr. <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> answers thus, Christian Magistrates
may abate of the severity of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, and mitigate the
punishment of Death, but they can't make it more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy;
for it becomes not the Gospel to shew more rigour
than the Law. But why then is a Capital Punishment
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>flicted on <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> not only among our
selves but in other <hi>Christian</hi> Countries, whereas such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
were only to make Restitution, or to be Sold, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law? I answer, Law-givers
have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound that a less punishment than Death is not a
sufficient Restraint, and therefore think it necessary to
make use of this. And as to what is alledged, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
this, that <hi>Thieves</hi> sometimes had a greater Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than a <hi>Mulct</hi> even under the <hi>Law.</hi> We read that
they might have been <hi>kill'd</hi> by those that found them
breaking up a house in the night time, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 2.
And it appears from that Judgment and Decision of
King <hi>David</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 5. that <hi>Theft</hi> in some cases
was Capital. And we read that two <hi>Thieves</hi> were <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifled</hi>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:65397:140"/>
with Christ, which was no Punishment for Theft
among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and therefore we may probably
think the Execution was <hi>Iewish,</hi> and had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Revelation were, 1. That which was vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to Moses alone. The Nature of it. It
differ'd from other Revelations as to Degree
only. 2. That from between the Cherubims.
3. The Urim and Thummim. These are not
the same with the Teraphim. They were not
borrowed from Pagan Idolaters. This would
be a countenancing of Image-Worship. The

which we have discoursed of. Here I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
them all together. God under all his Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made known his Will by the Law of Nature and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65397:141"/>
Reason which he implanted in Men: but I speak not of

as distinct from the Discoveries of natural Light and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
There were several ways of this Revelation: for
God not only spake <hi>at sundry times</hi> (as the Apostle saith)
<hi>i. e.</hi> in the days of <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses,
Ioshua,</hi> the <hi>Iudges, David,</hi> and of the following Kings

                        </note> 
                        <hi>in divers manners,</hi> i. e. there was a <hi>great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Revelations,</hi> there were several distinct ways of
God's discovering his Will to the World: and as the
World was more and more corrupted, the discoveries of
God's Will were multiply'd and increas'd.</p>
                     <p>These supernatural <hi>Revelations</hi> are divided by Writers
into <hi>Immediate</hi> and <hi>Mediate,</hi> but they can't well agree in
determining which are of the former sort, and which of
the latter. Some rank Revelations by <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
under those that are Immediate, others again hold
that they belong to mediate Discoveries, and in several
other instances I could shew how they disagree. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
controversy here I will take another course, and I
offer this as the exactest Division of <hi>Divine Revelations,</hi>
viz. that they are either <hi>Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Frequent,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>
and <hi>Rare.</hi> The Ordinary are either <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
or <hi>Inward.</hi> The Outward are made to the Bodily
Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> Hearing and Seeing. The Inward are made
to the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> either to the Fancy, when persons are
asleep, or to the Rational mind of Man when he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God spake,</hi> i. e, communicated his Will, 1. In an
<hi>Outward manner,</hi> viz. to the Bodily Senses, and first to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65397:142"/>
the <hi>Hearing.</hi> This was done first by an <hi>Immediate
Voice:</hi> so God spake to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them not to eat of the Tree of Knowledg of
Good and Evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16, 17. (which was the <hi>first
Revelation</hi> we read of) and thus He communicated his
Pleasure to them at other times, mention'd in the third
Chapter, for 'tis call'd the <hi>Voice of the Lord,</hi> ver. 8.
Thus he reveal'd his Will several times to <hi>Abraham,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> as we read. By such a <hi>Voice</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ramed
by the air, God spake to <hi>Moses</hi> in the Tabernacle and in
the Bush, and to <hi>Samuel</hi> in the Temple, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 3.
And it is probable that at other times in those first ages
God convers'd with his Servants by speaking audibly to
them. Secondly, God spake <hi>by the Voice of an Angel</hi>
very frequently, as to <hi>Adam,</hi> it is likely, presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Fall: for that <hi>Angel</hi> who guarded <hi>Paradise</hi> spoke
to him without doubt, and told him roundly of the dire
effects of his Apostacy, and warn'd him not to approach
the flaming Sword, lest he perish immediately. We
read that God spake by <hi>Angels</hi> to <hi>Moses, Lot, Abraham,
Isaac, Iacob, Daniel,</hi> and several others. Or, when
God spake by a Wind or Thunder, or some strange
Sound and terrible Concu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ion of the Air, it was thought
to be by the ministry of <hi>Angels.</hi> This was call'd by the
<hi>Iews Bath Kol,</hi> the Daughter of a Voice. It was any
Voice heard as descending from Heaven, and directing
them in any matter or concern whatsoever. The <hi>Iews</hi>
say that by this Voice <hi>the Six Precept<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> were given to the
Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the additional one to <hi>Noah</hi> and his
Sons: and by this the <hi>Law of Circumcision</hi> and the <hi>Ten
Commandments</hi> (which were not written at first) were
given to <hi>Moses.</hi> Many of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors assert
This <hi>Bath Kol</hi> to have been the lowest degree of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and they say this supplied the room of <hi>Prophecy,</hi>
and was frequent after that ceased among the <hi>Iews.</hi>
Thirdly, God spake to his People by the <hi>Voice of Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65397:142"/>
his Will. Of these we often read in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but especially about King <hi>David</hi>'s time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
For tho <hi>Abraham</hi> be the first that is call'd by
the name of <hi>Prophet,</hi> Gen. 20. 7. because he was one
that was acquainted with God's Will, and was preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in Prayer, yet now we are speaking of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
sort of <hi>Prophets</hi> who foretold things to come, and
denounced the Judgments which were to be executed
on Offenders, and were sent forth by God to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
very usually, but especially when the Nation of the
<hi>Iews</hi> grew very wicked and Idolatrous. Then these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were rais'd up by God to admonish that People, to
tell them freely of their Miscarriages, and to declare the
displeasure of God against them. And these Envoys of
Heaven were sent not only to God's own People, but
sometimes to others, as the <hi>Ninivites.</hi> Thus <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was made by <hi>Voice:</hi> God spake himself, or by others
audibly: and this was no uncommon way of divulging
and discovering his Will.</p>
                     <p>Again, God <hi>spake,</hi> i. e. communicated himself here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
not only by the sense of <hi>Hearing,</hi> but by that of
<hi>Seeing.</hi> He was pleased to make known his Divine
Pleasure by some visible Appearances, which most vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
struck on that Sense, and gave more evident Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
of the Will of Heaven. Thus God discovered
himself, 1. by <hi>Angels Appearing;</hi> for tho it was not the
<hi>Appearing</hi> of these Messengers, but their <hi>Speaking</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which gave them the discovery of God's pleasure,
yet the former was no mean Confirmation of what was
delivered, because those Glorious Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ts could not <hi>appear</hi>
to Mankind unless they were commission'd by God.
When he thought fit to send them, then (and not else)
they descended from Heaven, and shew'd themselves to
Men. 2. <hi>Writing</hi> was another manner of <hi>Visible Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
Thus the Law was deliver'd to <hi>Moses,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
this way of Revelation grew frequent, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
History of <hi>Moses,</hi> and other Histories and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65397:143"/>
being committed to Writing. Thus the Antient
Church before Christ's coming had the <hi>Written</hi> Word of
the Holy Scriptures to inform them. 3. God spake to
the <hi>Sight</hi> by those Representations which in Holy Writ
are so usually stiled <hi>Visions,</hi> for these properly belong to
the outward Sense of <hi>Seeing:</hi> they are either Real Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
exposed to the eye, as the <hi>Burning Bush</hi> which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
saw, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 2. and the <hi>Pillar of a Cloud</hi> which
went before the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the day, and the <hi>Pillar of
Fire</hi> which conducted them in the night, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 21.
and the <hi>Cloud</hi> in the Temple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 13, 14. call'd
<hi>the Glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 7. 1, 2. And this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
is used in other places of the Old Testament, to
signifie that <hi>Visible Glory and Majesty</hi> whereby he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
himself to Mankind in those times. Or else <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in Holy Scripture are certain <hi>Images</hi> of things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by God to the Eye, as those <hi>Strange Appearances</hi>
and <hi>Signs</hi> mention'd in the Books of <hi>Ieremiah, Ezekiel</hi>
and <hi>Daniel.</hi> Whether these things may be said to be
real Objects, or whether they be mere Apparitions, we
need not (as some) solicitously inquire. If they be
Resemblances caused by God, and there be such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
made on the Sense of Seeing that the Organ be
affected, as if there were such an Object before it, it is
sufficient to denominate it <hi>Vision.</hi> But this is not to
be doubted of, that these external Representations and
Figures pointed out Real things, either present or to
come. From this sort of Manifestation, call'd <hi>Vision,</hi>
the <hi>Prophets</hi> who were most conversant in this way of
Revelation, were stiled <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rs,</hi> 1 Sam. 9. 9, 18. 2 Chron.
35. 15.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have distinctly spoken of <hi>Voices</hi> and <hi>Visions:</hi>
but it must be observed also that these two are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
sometimes. This you may see in some of the
foregoing Instances; and in others not named, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
by Voice was mixed with that by Vision: so
in the New Testament <hi>Saul saw a Light, and heard a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65397:143"/>
Voice.</hi> But I am confined at present to the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
for I speak now only of the variety of Revelations
which were before the Gospel-Dicd\sspensation. It is to
be observed moreover that sometimes <hi>Vision</hi> and <hi>Voice</hi>
were accompanied with an <hi>Extasy:</hi> tho the persons were
awake, yet they were cast into a <hi>Trance.</hi> Lastly, under
this head it is remarkable that all the outward and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
ways of God's revealing himself, especially those
that are visible, are call'd by the Jewish Masters the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinah,</hi>
i. e. the Divine Presence and Majesty, whereby the
doth as it were <hi>dwell,</hi> and is constantly present with
his Church (for the word <hi>Shakan</hi> signifies to <hi>inha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                              <desc>••••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> or
<hi>dwell</hi>) whereby he doth gloriously discover himself to his
Servants. With reference to this the Apostle saith, <hi>to
the Israelites pertaineth the Glory,</hi> Rom. 9. 4. <hi>i. e.</hi> the
Glorious Presence and Habitation of God with them, not
only by Angels, but all those other ways before spoken
of, in which he appear'd and manifested himself in the
times of the Law. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> stiles <hi>the Glory,</hi> because
this Visible Appearing of God is so stiled (as you have
heard) in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and because the <hi>Seventy
Interpreters</hi> (whose way of speaking this Apostle is wont
to imitate) used the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to express the <hi>Glorious
Presence</hi> of the Divine Majesty in any kind of <hi>Sensible</hi>
and <hi>External</hi> manner.</p>
                     <p>2. There are <hi>Inward</hi> as well as <hi>Outward Revelations.</hi>
These are made more immediately to the Soul, as the
other were to the Body. First, God spake or reveal'd
himself to the <hi>Fancies</hi> of Men, by <hi>Dreams.</hi> He thought
good to communicate his Will to persons by a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Influence on their Imaginations whilst they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep,
as well as by presenting things to their Senses when
they were awake. Thus God reveal'd himself to<note n="6" place="bottom">Gen. 15. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>

                        <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> In their Dreams their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
were impress'd with such and such Representations,
they verily thought they beheld this or that Object, as
<hi>Iacob</hi> thought he saw a <hi>Ladder</hi> that reached from Heaven
to Earth. And because these Representations seem to be
offer'd to the eye, therefore they are sometimes call'd <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
in Scripture. <hi>I saw a Dream,</hi> saith <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
Dan. 4. 5. And so we read of <hi>a Dream of the
night Vision,</hi> Isai. 29. 7. But if you speak of <hi>Visions</hi> in
the proper sense, then it is certain <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Dreams</hi>
are two distinct Species of <hi>Revelation;</hi> and so I have
made them, having before spoken of <hi>Visions</hi> strictly so
call'd. But this is a thing not consider'd sometimes by
Writers on this Subject, and so they confound <hi>Visions</hi>
and <hi>Dreams.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, God speaks to the Soul not only by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Imagination in Sleep, but by immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
the minds of the Prophets when they are awake.
This way of revealing his Will to Men is call'd <hi>Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and sometimes <hi>Illumination:</hi> but there is a gradual
difference between these, the former being of a higher
degree than the later, and the later being as it were a
Preparative to the former. This <hi>Inspiration,</hi> which is
made by an inward <hi>Afflatus</hi> and Excitation of the Spirit,
is signally call'd<note n="5" place="bottom">Ruach Hakkadesh.</note> the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> by the Jewish Writers.
A man, say they, is said to have the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> when
being awake, and having the full use of his Senses, he
speaks by the Incitement of the Spirit. Thus the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
of old spake as they were stirr'd up, by this Inward
Afflation and Instinct. The Jewish Doctors think that
this degree of Divine Revelation is especially in the
<hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the
Book of <hi>Iob,</hi> &amp;c. the Writers of which are termed by
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65397:144"/>
way of Excellency <hi>Chetubim Scriptores,</hi> by the Hebrews,
and their Writings are distinguish'd from other Books of
Scripture by the name of <hi>Hagiographa.</hi> This put Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Men upon Pious Discourses, and excellent Strains of
Devotion, and rais'd them above their ordinary temper.
Yea, All the Holy Penmen of Scripture were moved and
actuated by this Divine Influx: By this they dictated
and composed those Sacred Writings. This is that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Prophecy</hi> or <hi>Prophetick Inspiration</hi> which is call'd
the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> Tho you may observe too that all those
kinds of <hi>Revelation</hi> beforemention'd, are stiled in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Writings <hi>Inspiration</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they are call'd <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
For <hi>Prophecy</hi> (Nebuah) is taken either strictly or
largely: In the strict acception, according to the Jewish
Notion of it, it is when any thing is reveal'd to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
when he is asleep, or in a rapture, or besides himself.
And others of them say, that <hi>Prophecy</hi> properly so call'd,
is either in the way of <hi>Dreams</hi> or <hi>Visions.
Prophecy</hi> in
Scripture is taken in a restrained sense, for seeing and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
things to come: and hence (as well as from
what was suggested before) it is probable the <hi>Prophets</hi>
antiently were call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Seers.</hi> This also is that
which most usually is call'd <hi>Prophecy</hi> by the <hi>Iews.</hi> But
<hi>Prophecy</hi> in the largest acception is the general word to
comprehend all kinds of Divine Revelation: it is the way
whereby all revealed Knowledg and Truth are convey'd
to us. Therefore the <hi>Schools of the Prophets</hi> were those
places where young Men were prepar'd for all sorts of
<hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Inspiration;</hi> and out of these Schools ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
the <hi>Prophets</hi> were chosen. Education and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
fitted them for the Prophetick Office, and by
these Testimonials they were able to go abroad.</p>
                     <p>There was a way to know who were <hi>True Prophets</hi>
and who <hi>False,</hi> and to distinguish one from the other.
Indeed when a Prophet foretold things <hi>to come to pass
hereafter,</hi> he could not be convinced of falshood present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65397:145"/>
because his Prophecy must be known to be true or
false by the <hi>Event</hi> of his Prediction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 21.
And yet <hi>here</hi> was some uncertainty, for the thing he
foretold might not come to pass, and yet he might be a
True Prophet, for God could do otherwise than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
foretold, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 7, 8. But then the Prediction
was conditional, not absolute, or rather it was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
But if any one by the Prophetical Spirit dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<hi>such and such things to be done,</hi> it was possible to
tell, and that presently, or in a very short time, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was a true Prophet or no. This might be known
first from the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of a true Prophet: for first
he must be no way inclined to <hi>Idolatry;</hi> secondly he
must predict nothing against the <hi>Law.</hi> If he said any
thing derogatory to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Moral Law
chiefly and the Worship of God, he discover'd himself
to be a false Prophet; <hi>Deut. 18. 20. Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3.
Thirdly, some add, that as he was one who said nothing
against the Law, so neither must he do any thing against
it. It was a Notion of the <hi>Iews</hi> that the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
was not communicated to any but Holy Men.
But there is reason to doubt as to this. Besides the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,</hi>
a Prophet might be known to be true, when
he was back'd by <hi>another Prophet</hi> who was certainly
known to be true, when this Prophet testified of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Further, when God himself testified concerning a
Prophet by some manifest <hi>Sign,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. Thus
they were to judg whether <hi>Prophets</hi> were counterfeit or
no. Add this also, that they were deterred from counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
the <hi>Prophetick Spirit,</hi> because by the <hi>Law</hi> a false
Prophet was to be punish'd with Death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 20.
Lastly, The true Prophets might be discern'd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd
from the false ones by this, that they were
plain and downright in their Predictions, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were generally ambiguous and equivocating, as we
see in the Example of those false Prophets whom <hi>Ahab</hi>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:65397:145"/>
consulted, <hi>The Lord shall deliver it</hi> (say they) <hi>into the
hands of the King,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 6. So we render that
place, but the Relative <hi>it</hi> is not in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and so
the words have two senses, either <hi>the Lord shall deliver</hi>
Ramoth Gilead <hi>into the hands of the King of</hi> Israel, or,
<hi>the Lord shall deliver thee and thy forces into the hands of
the King of</hi> Syria. This was frequently imitated after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by<note n="1" place="bottom">Croesus Halyn penetrans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Aio te AEacida, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ibis, r<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> the <hi>Heathen Oracles,</hi> and was of some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
for from the ambiguity of the words mistakes
might easily arise, and by that means the credit of the
false Prophets was salved. But however this rendred
their Predictions uncertain and wavering, whereas those
that had the true Prophetick Spirit were sure and fix'd:
and thus there could not but be a certainty of Prophecy
among the <hi>Iews.</hi> But at last the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and (as the Jewish Writers and Christian Fathers
agree) ended in <hi>Malachi,</hi> who was the last Prophet.
But this way of <hi>Revelation</hi> was afterwards restored by
<hi>Christ,</hi> as shall be shew'd afterwards.</p>
                     <p>To the foremention'd ways of God's communicating
his Will and Pleasure, may be added that <hi>Impulse</hi> whereby
persons are stir'd up by God to undertake some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Enterprize, and to accomplish some very notable
Act. Thus<note n="2" place="bottom">More Nevoch. p. 2. c. 45.</note> 
                        <hi>Maimonides</hi> reckons it among the several kinds
of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> by a particular intimation from
God slew the <hi>Egyptian, Exod.</hi> 2. 12. So by the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Motion <hi>Phineas</hi> knew it would be acceptable to God
to kill those two notorious Sinners, and he was stir'd up
accordingly to do it. By the same Heavenly Impulse
<hi>Sampson</hi> was excited to destroy the <hi>Philistines,</hi> tho with
the loss of his own life. And several other Instances
might be produced of this nature in the Old Testament.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65397:146"/>
Thus you see what were the <hi>Ordinary ways of Revelation,</hi>
what was the <hi>frequent and usual manner</hi> of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
his Will in the several Dispensations before
treated of. In the next place I will enumerate the <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Means</hi> of revealing God's Will: As,</p>
                     <p>1. That way of Revelation whereby God conversed
with <hi>Moses</hi> on the Mount, when he gave him the <hi>Law,</hi>
and whereby he was pleas'd to communicate himself to
him at some other times. The Jewish Doctors cry up
This for the highest Degree of <hi>Revelation</hi> that ever was,
and some of them talk such strange things of it as are next
to Blasphemy. But this we are sure of, that the Sacred
Spirit represents this as an <hi>Vnusual</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary
Revelation,</hi> and such as was peculiar to <hi>Moses</hi> alone:
for it is said, <hi>The Lord spake to</hi> Moses<note n="3" place="bottom">Panim el Panim.</note> 
                        <hi>face to face, as a
man speaketh to his friend, Exod.</hi> 33. 11. Indeed <hi>Iacob</hi>
testifieth of himself, that <hi>he had seen God face to face,</hi> Gen.
32. 30. But tho he had <hi>seen</hi> God so, yet we do not
read that he <hi>talk'd</hi> with him after that manner, which
implieth something more. I know <hi>Moses</hi> tells the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Israel,</hi> that <hi>God talked with them face to face in the
Mount,</hi> Deut. 5. 4. But this he means of himself, <hi>viz.</hi>
that after God had spoken to him in that immediate
manner, he imparted God's Will to them, but they
were not suffer'd to come near the Mount, as we expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read. Besides, this is part of <hi>Moses</hi>'s peculiar cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
that <hi>there arose not a Prophet since in</hi> Israel <hi>like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, whom the Lord knew face to face,</hi> Deut. 34. 10.
<hi>viz.</hi> by talking, conversing with him face to face; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this was a singular Prerogative granted to him, and no
other Prophet partook of it, or was to be compared with
<hi>Moses</hi> as to this. But what you read in <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 6,
7, 8. is yet more full: <hi>If there be a Prophet among you,
I the Lord will make my self known unto him in a Vision,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65397:146"/>
and will speak unto him in a Dream. My servant</hi> Moses
<hi>is not so, who is faithful in all my House</hi> (he is a singular
person, and I trust him with all my Concerns: therefore
I vouchsafe him a greater measure of Revelation than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prophets have. I make my Pleasure known to them
in Dreams and Visions, the ordinary ways of Divine
Discovery, but) <hi>with him will I speak</hi>
                        <note n="4" place="bottom">Peh el Peh.</note> 
                        <hi>mouth to mouth,
even apparently, and not in dark speeches: and the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Lord shall be behold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it is evident, that the <hi>Gradus Mosaicus</hi> was not
communicable to any other <hi>Prophet,</hi> and consequently
that there was a vast difference between <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying</hi>
and that of other <hi>Prophets. Moses</hi> convers'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
with God: that is, in that clear and evident
manner which no other Prophets were acquainted with,
without any disturbing Impressions on his Imagination,
as in the usual Dreams and Visions of Prophets. Or,
<hi>Moses</hi> had not that Awe and Astonishment on him which
the rest of the Prophets had. Or, <hi>face to face,</hi> i. e. friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily
(as 'tis explain'd in the place before mention'd; <hi>as
a man speaketh to his friend</hi>) signifieth that he conversed
intimately and familiarly with God; he was admitted
to the nearest Communion with the Divine Presence and
Majesty that ever any mortal Man had. In this he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd all former Prophets, as to This he was Singular
and Peculiar, and the way of Discovery made to him
was the highest Degree that ever was.</p>
                     <p>But tho I allow this, that <hi>Moses</hi> experienc'd a more
Immediate and Familiar way of Revelation than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and that this was the most Exalted Degree of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
yet I do not see but that we may affirm it was
in some of those ways I have before mention'd. As to
the <hi>Degree</hi> it was most Sublime and Transcendent, but
yet the <hi>way</hi> of Conveyance might be the same. It might
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65397:147"/>
be by immediate Voice from God, and by the Voice of
Angels, by Visions and Dreams, Sleeping and Waking,
by inward Illumination and Divine Afflation: in all these
ways, and in the height and transcendency of them, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
it is likely, receiv'd Communications from God.
Thus it <hi>differs</hi> from all other Revelations, tho as to the
substance it is the <hi>same.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God's <hi>calling to Moses out of the Bush, Exod.</hi> 3. 4. is
counted by<note n="5" place="bottom">More Nevoch. p. 2. cap. 45.</note> 
                        <hi>Maimonides</hi> one of the highest Degrees of
Divine Revelation; for none but <hi>Moses,</hi> saith he, had
the honour to hear God speak to him in a Vision, whilst
he was awake. But this Learned <hi>Iew</hi> seems to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
here, and therefore I will not reckon this as a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
and peculiar way of Divine <hi>Manifestation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Another way of Revelation</hi> was that of the <hi>Oracle
in the Tabernacle,</hi> or <hi>Temple.</hi> Exod. 25. 22. <hi>I will
meet with thee, and I will commune with thee, from above
the Mercy-Seat, from between the two Cherubims which
are upon the Ark of the Testimony, of all things which I
will give thee in Commandment unto the Children of</hi> Israel.
And accordingly in <hi>Num.</hi> 7. 89. we read that God
spake to <hi>Moses</hi> from the Mercy-Seat, and gave Answer
to him when he consulted him: and none else had that
honour in his time. But afterwards the High Priests had
this privilege conferred upon them. Some of the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised
Doctors</hi> tell us prodigious things of this way
of <hi>Revelation:</hi> they talk as seraphically as if they had
been the persons that were admitted to that Sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
But after all they have said, either we must refer
it to some, or all of the ways of <hi>Revelation</hi> before speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,

                     <p>3. The Answering by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Extraordinary way of <hi>Revelation.</hi> By this God
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65397:147"/>
gave Answers in great and weighty Affairs, especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Kingdom, for it may be reckon'd a <hi>Politick Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:</hi>
and some have thought (from what they read in
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 7, 8.) that <hi>Kings</hi> as well as the <hi>High Priests</hi>
were the persons to whom the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were
committed. But I see no ground for this, for this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
had its residence in the <hi>High Priests Breast-plate,</hi> and
therefore was given out wholly by him. And as for
what is said in the foremention'd place in <hi>Samuel,</hi> it is
not to be understood of <hi>David</hi>'s personal Act, but of
what he did by his Authority. But that this <hi>great Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
of the <hi>Iews</hi> was consulted chiefly in <hi>difficult cases</hi> of
State, may be gather'd from <hi>Num. 27. 21. 1 Sam.</hi> 23.
9. &amp; 28. 6. &amp; 30. 7. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 1. Tho I fee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to appropriate it <hi>wholly</hi> to Civil Matters, for the
High Priests <hi>Pectoral</hi> had this general Name given it, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shen

15. because by the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> which were
lodg'd here, <hi>Iudgment</hi> infallibly pass'd; but we do not
find that this <hi>Iudgment</hi> or Decision was restrain'd to one
particular sort of Cases. When this <hi>Oracle</hi> ceas'd, is not
agreed among Writers. According to<note n="6" place="bottom">Antiq. l. 3. c. q.</note> 
                        <hi>Ioseph the Iew</hi>
there was no such thing about two hundred years before
our Saviour's time. But some of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors
say, it had its period in the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi>'s days.
Nay, it was never heard of from the day that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel</hi> were carry'd captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> say
others of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who it is probable come nearest to
the truth.</p>
                     <p>As to the nature of the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi>
there have been several Conjectures of <hi>Iews</hi> and
Christians; but the most considerable of late hath
been that of the famous Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and some others,
who think they were <hi>little Images,</hi> that were represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65397:148"/>
of <hi>Angels,</hi> and that they were the same with the
<hi>Teraphim.</hi> But I have subverted the foundation of this
opinion, by shewing that the word <hi>Teraphim</hi> is not of a
middle signification in Scripture, but that it is the word
to express <hi>Idolatry,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 23. And that in all
other places it signifies some unlawful Images, Idols, or
False Gods. A Noble<note n="7" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi> de Leg. Hebr.</note> Critick strikes in with our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Antiquary, and would perswade us that <hi>Vrim</hi> and
<hi>Teraphim</hi> are the same. He hath shew'd a great deal of
excellent Reading and Criticism in his undertaking, to
maintain the Identity of these two: he hath done great
and amazing things in so barren a Subject; his Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are extraordinary, and like himself: but if I may
be so free with this worthy Man, and the rest of those
Authors that have gone this way, as to deliver my
thoughts impartially concerning the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
which they have offer'd, truly I must pronounce
that some of them are slight and frivolous, and they
might as well have asserted that the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Teraphim</hi>
are the same because they both end in <hi>im.</hi> This Learned
Writer adds, that both the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were of
<hi>Pagan</hi> Extraction; but herein he leaves the Judicious
<hi>Selden,</hi> who held not that the <hi>Vrim</hi> was borrow'd from
the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> but that this was taken from that, for he
saith expresly that the <hi>Teraphim</hi> are call'd <hi>Vrim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim,</hi> because they aped the fanctity of these.</p>
                     <p>But this later Author avers that the <hi>Iews</hi> imitated
he <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their <hi>Teraphim</hi> and other Idolatrous Rites
and Practices. Tho the <hi>Iewish Laws</hi> were made in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
opposition (as hath been said before) to the Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of the <hi>Idolatrous Nations,</hi> yet (notwithstanding
this) he asserts that God borrowed this and most of the
<hi>Mosaick</hi> Rites from those <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolaters. Did God
himself openly declare against the Idolatry of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:65397:148"/>
and yet would he by these <hi>Images</hi> of Pagan Invention
nurse it up? Is it possible for considerate minds to give
credit to this? To think that the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
commanded <hi>not to learn the way of the Heathen,
Ier.</hi> 10. 12. not to comply with the Customs of the
Idolatrous Nations, but to avoid them, and act quite
contrary to them; to think that these persons were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
nay in a particular manner commanded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd to use this Superstitious and Magical Rite, and
other the like Customs of the <hi>Heathens;</hi> to think that
God, who had so often declared his hatred and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Idols, and whatever look'd like Idolatry, gave
out his Oracles to his own People by a couple of little
Pert <hi>Waxen Images,</hi> and that in complyance with the
<hi>Talismanical Puppets</hi> used by most Pagans, and which
were first invented by their Idolatrous Priests, is such a
heap of odd and wild Conceits that no unprejudiced and
unbyass'd mind can entertain. As for the <hi>Thummim,</hi>
that also is held by the same Author to have been bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
from the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> As <hi>Vrim</hi> was fetch'd from <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis</hi>
an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Idol, so (saith he) <hi>Thummim</hi> is of the
like Original, for it was an <hi>Image</hi> set with precious Stones which the High Priests of <hi>Egypt</hi> wore about their
necks. Now, because these Pagans were brave and gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and had a rich <hi>Saphire</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> engraven on it
hanging at their breasts, therefore God appointed his
own High Priest a <hi>Thummim,</hi> which was such another
fine brave thing. Yea, God gave him <hi>Bells</hi> to dangle
and make a noise at his heels, because the <hi>Egyptian
Priests</hi> were hung about after that manner, for which
this Author quoteth <hi>Alexander ab Alexandre.</hi> This in
brief is his conjecture about <hi>Thummim.</hi> And thus
the <hi>Vrim</hi> were <hi>Images,</hi> and the <hi>Thummim</hi> was an
<hi>Image.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which it seems was the opinion of <hi>A. Castre</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(tho he hath not the same particular notion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
these <hi>Images</hi> with this present Writer) but hear

censures him for it; <hi>As this is a new opinion, so it
is very improbable, because such a thing as this would have

have been encourag'd and confirm'd in their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Service, <hi>i. e.</hi> worshipping of Images. And truly,
if I may speak freely, this assertion that God's most Holy
Oracle, whereby he deliver'd his Will to the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
people, was managed altogether by <hi>Images,</hi> gives too
much encouragement to the <hi>Image-Worship</hi> maintain'd
and practis'd by some of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
you will find that<note n="9" place="bottom">Dr. Parker (Bp. of Oxford) against the Test.</note> One who was a well-willer
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cause and Interest, highly applauds these
Notions, and borrows several pages together from Doctor
<hi>Spencer</hi> as sutable to his purpose. He furnish'd himself
with materials for his Pamphlet about the notion of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
from this Writer's conceptions of it.</p>
                     <p>But that which is the greatest reproach to these <hi>Images</hi>
is, that they were borrow'd from the <hi>Idolatrous Pagans,</hi>
which is the thing this Reverend Gentleman asserts and
defends. This makes them unworthy of God and his
Worship, and not fit to be used by the People of God.
This Opinion makes God to imitate the Pagan in their
Customs and usages. But he thinks he salves the absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
and impiety of this, by adding, that God did this,
<hi>by reason of the bardness of the Jews hearts.</hi> He imputes
the use of this <hi>Vrim</hi> or <hi>Teraphim</hi> to the morosity of that
people, who were to be pleas'd by all means, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
GOd indulged them in these <hi>Heathen</hi> Superstitions.
But who can think this to be a satisfactory account of the
matter? It is as much as to say, God, to comply with
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65397:149"/>
the vain humour of this people, gave them these <hi>Little
Images,</hi> these <hi>Pratling Puppets</hi> to dance and dandle.
The <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation being Children, must have these <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
to play with. The froward <hi>Israelites</hi> cried for the
<hi>Pagan Gewgaws,</hi> therefore God let them have them,
that they might <hi>Play</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> at the same time. We
must hold that these <hi>Pretty Idols</hi> wrap'd up in a folded
piece of cloth of a span long, were the <hi>Famous, Celebrated,
and Sacred Vrim</hi> of the <hi>Iews:</hi> these <hi>Ludicrous Images</hi>
were the <hi>Holy Oracles</hi> whereby God spake to his people on
the most serious and eminent occasions: In short, the <hi>Vrim</hi>
were the very same with the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which were the
<hi>Heathens Penates,</hi> the <hi>Pagans Houshold-Gods,</hi> or rather
(to speak more plainly) they were the Bodies of those
Gods, or (to speak yet more plainly) of the Infernal
Ghosts, who came and informed these little Carcases af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were prepared under a certain <hi>Constellation:</hi> then
and not before, they were <hi>a Trap to catch Damons,</hi> as
Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> pleasantly speaks. These were the <hi>Teraphim,</hi>
as all the Learned know, and consequently they were the
<hi>Vrim:</hi> which if any man can believe, 'tis next to the
Faith of Miracles, in my apprehension. If we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
our selves that the Holy God of <hi>Israel</hi> was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Imitator of the Pagans Magical Feats, and Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Conjurations, we may then swallow any thing, be it
never so incredible and impossible. What is erroneous
and absurd, yea what is prophane and blasphemous if
this be not, <hi>viz.</hi> that God's Worship was borrow'd by
God himself from the Idolatrous <hi>Gentiles?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have in another place offer'd my particular Sentiment
concerning these <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> (so much contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by the Learned) the Sum of which is this, that
they were no other than these two <hi>Hebrew</hi> words <hi>VRIM</hi>
and <hi>THVMMIM</hi> written or engraven, and put into
the High Priest's <hi>Breast-plate.</hi> To which purpose it is
observable that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 8, &amp;c. where the <hi>High
Priests Garments</hi> are rehears'd, and are said to be <hi>made,</hi>
                        <pb n="282" facs="tcp:65397:150"/>
the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> are not mention'd at all, because
these were not made of materials of Linen, Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
the <hi>Garments</hi> were, but were only bare words written
or engraved, and deposited in the hollow of the <hi>Breast-Plate,</hi>
which was a folded or doubled Cloth, and was
capable of holding those written Words: wherefore they
are bid to put them <hi>in it,</hi> not <hi>upon it,</hi> for upon it were
the twelve <hi>Precious Stones.</hi> I have shew'd the probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this Opinion from several material Considerations,
as well as from the manner of Expression us'd in <hi>Exod.</hi>
28. 30. <hi>Thou shalt put,</hi> or (according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi>)
<hi>thou shalt give in the Breast-plate the Vrim and Thummim.</hi>
I have shew'd that <hi>giving</hi> is apply'd in several places of
Scripture to <hi>writing:</hi> and I will further confirm it by one
Instance more, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, give <hi>i. e.
write a mark on the Foreheads,</hi> &amp;c. for it is spoken to
him who had <hi>the Writer</hi>'s <hi>Inkhorn,</hi> ver. 2, 3. Thus <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
and <hi>writing</hi> are the same. And so in our own way
of speaking there is something like it, for to <hi>render</hi> or
<hi>give</hi> and to <hi>ascribe</hi> are sometimes synonimous. These
written Words (which were of mighty Importance and
Significancy) were put into the <hi>Rationale,</hi> or rather,
the <hi>Duplicature</hi> contain'd in it, and were made use of by
the <hi>High Priest</hi> when Answers were to be given. Those
Words may signifie to us the nature of this kind of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<hi>viz.</hi> that by consulting it they should be <hi>illuminated</hi>
(that is the import of <hi>Vrim</hi>) they should have a clear
discovery of what they ask'd and enquired after, and they
should have not only a <hi>Distinct,</hi> but a <hi>Full</hi> and <hi>Perfect</hi>
Answer (that is implied in <hi>Thummim</hi>) to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                     <p>If it be <hi>Objected</hi> (as I find it is) that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

being set before <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and the particle <hi>the</hi>
being placed before them in our <hi>English</hi> Translation, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> to be <hi>things,</hi> and not bare
<hi>words:</hi> I answer, it is true that the Hebrew <hi>ha</hi> which is
sometimes a <hi>Praepositive Article</hi> before Nouns, and is
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65397:150"/>
rendred <hi>the,</hi> is (like the <hi>Greek Articles</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> before
some words) very significant and emphatical, having
the force of a <hi>Demonstrative:</hi> but at other times you
will find that it is of no significancy at all, but is a mere
Expletive. So that we cannot infer with any certainty
that <hi>ha</hi> or <hi>the</hi> being prefix'd to <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> have
any Emphasis, or argue them to be <hi>Things,</hi> and not
<hi>Words.</hi> Again, you may observe that tho it be <hi>haurim</hi>
in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 30. and is translated the <hi>Vrim,</hi> yet in
<hi>Num.</hi> 27. 21. tho there be the Article <hi>ha</hi> in the Original,
yet in our <hi>English</hi> Translation it is plain <hi>Vrim.</hi> And
moreover, take notice that it is barely <hi>Vrim,</hi> Deut. 33.
8. 1 Sam. 28. 6. both in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and in our <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation.</hi>
Whence still you may infer that there is no stress
to be laid on either the Hebrew <hi>ha</hi> or the English <hi>the</hi>
when they are prefix'd to <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> there is
nothing Emphatick in it. Nay, that <hi>the</hi> is no note of a
<hi>thing</hi> is clear from <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 6. (not to mention any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place) where the Hebrew <hi>ha</hi> and the English <hi>the</hi>
are set before [word] and you'l find almost a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times in your <hi>English</hi> Bible <hi>the word,</hi> but I suppose
you will not thence gather that a <hi>word</hi> is a <hi>thing,</hi> taking
this latter in the strictest sense. This is the best and
plainest account I can give of the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi>
on which I should further have enlarged if I had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
my self by a <hi>Particular Essay</hi> on this subject. I
never met with any one that had any thing considerable to
object against this Notion, but on the contrary I find that
one or two Writers of good Note have shew'd themselves
much inclin'd to embrace it. I am not concern'd to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
those who ask, how God answer'd by these <hi>Words</hi>
or <hi>Letters.</hi> It is hard to resolve this Question, but such
a Conjecture as this may be probable, that the High
Priest was particularly taught by God to understand this
Secret, from some difference which he observ'd in the
Letters made by God's own disposal. If the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Writers thought such a thing as this was Reasonable and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65397:151"/>
Accountable when they asserted the Responses to be
made by the <hi>Precious Stones,</hi> I do not see why we may
not with greater reason make use of the same Solution
here. But this we are certain of, that the Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponses
were given by and from these <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi>
and we are sure that they were part of the celebrated
<hi>Shekinah,</hi> the <hi>Divine Presence,</hi> the Visible and Glorious
Appearance of God: for by these in an extraordinary
manner (which none is able to relate) he reveal'd his
Will to the High Priests, and they imparted it to those
who came to inquire of this Oracle.</p>
                     <p>And so I have let you see what were the <hi>Various Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
both <hi>Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Dispensations we have been speaking of. The
<hi>Mosaick Occonomy</hi> especially had the advantage of all
these: the <hi>Iewish People</hi> were most signally honoured
with all these sorts of <hi>Revelations; Vnto them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 2. The High Priest's

cases were <hi>Spoken</hi> and <hi>Reveal'd</hi> thereby: and so
the <hi>Revelations</hi> of God's Will by that way are call'd

                     <p>It might be expected now that I should pass to the

at that time) and tho the <hi>Church</hi> were those of the
stock of <hi>Abraham</hi> who retain'd the true Worship of God,
and more especially and eminently the <hi>Iews</hi> were call'd
the <hi>Church</hi> and peculiar People of God; and the <hi>Nations</hi>
were those that invented new Gods, and worshipped
them, and lived in all sorts of Wickedness and Lewdness
(as <hi>Babylon, Sodom, Egypt,</hi> and other places) yet the
Seat of the <hi>Church</hi> was not so tied to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family,
or afterwards to the <hi>Iews,</hi> that Salvation was confined
to that People, or that there were no other persons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Godliness besides them. Altho God in a peculiar
way reveal'd himself to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Family, and
that by Covenant, yet others likewise were favoured by
God, and included in that Covenant. Tho God calls
himself <hi>the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Isaac, <hi>and the
God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 6. that is, he was the God of
those Patriarchs and of their Seed in a peculiar manner,

thence; yet in a larger and extensive sense God was the
God of other People besides. For as all were not <hi>Good</hi>
that were in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family or of his Posterity (there
were <hi>Ismael</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> Incestuous <hi>Reuben,</hi> the Bloody
<hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi;</hi> and both in the Wilderness and in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
there were Murmurers, Blasphemers, Idolaters,
and persons every way defiled) so all were not <hi>Bad</hi> or
shut out from Grace and the Covenant of Mercy that
were not of the Family or Race of <hi>Abraham.</hi> There
was <hi>Shem, Noah</hi>'s First-born, who lived in <hi>Palestine</hi>
when <hi>Abraham</hi> came thither out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and it is
highly probable that he was a Good Man and a Religious
Worshipper. Nor must <hi>Iaphet</hi> be supposed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted

and it is likely was a godly Person. <hi>Abimelech,</hi> one
of the Kings of <hi>Canaan</hi> (it is probable of the Southern
part of it, as <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> of whom I shall speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that feared the true God, and thereby was taught to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
form <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 3, 4. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
form several passages in this Chapter it appears that
this King was a very Religious and conscientious Man,
that he had the knowledg of the true God, and worship'd
him. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s asking God to spare <hi>Sodom</hi> if there
were fifty Righteous Men in it, implies that he thought
there were so many there: and consequently other Cities
of that bigness had at least that number of Righteous
Persons: and proportionably in greater places he thought
there were more that might be saved. Now it is not
probable that he was wholly mistaken, and consequently
there were Religious Persons besides those of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Seed even in the Cities of <hi>Palestine. Rahab</hi> was a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanite,</hi>
but yet a Religious Faithful Woman, one that
acknowledg'd and worship'd the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
is commended for her <hi>Faith,</hi> Heb. 11. 31.
and questionless others there were in that Countrey
(tho they are not particularly mention'd) who feared
God.</p>
                     <p>I will instance in one very Great and Eminent Person
who was a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> viz. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

disputed <hi>who</hi> he was: 1. Some have thought that he was
an <hi>Angel</hi> in the Form of a Man, as St.<note n="9" place="bottom">Lib. 1. Quaest. super Gen. quaest. 72.</note> 
                        <hi>Augustin</hi> tells us.
This was the fancy of <hi>Origen,</hi> as we may gather from
<note n="1" place="bottom">Hom. 1. in Gen.</note> one of his Homilies. 2. Others, as <hi>Hierax</hi> and the
<hi>Hieracites</hi> (a sort of Hereticks in the Third Century

3. Others (as the same<note n="3" place="bottom">Haeres. 55.</note> Father relates) said
he was the Son of God Incarnate. And this Opinion is
imbraced by a modern<note n="4" place="bottom">Cunaeus de Rep. Hebr. l. 3. c. 3.</note> Writer, who would perswade
us that <hi>Melchisedech</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> are the same. But these
are false and groundless surmises, and have no bottom to
support them. As to the last of them, it is incredible
that the Type and Antitype should be the same: for this
is the case here, <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was a Representative of
our Saviour, according to that of the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.
20. <hi>Iesus was a Priest after the Order of</hi> Melchisedech.
Which he explains in Chap. 7. ver. 15. <hi>After the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of</hi> Melchisedech <hi>there ariseth another Priest:</hi> as
much as to say, <hi>Melchisedech</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> were <hi>like</hi> one
another in several things, and thereupon one was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to be a fit Type of the other. But it is unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and absurd to say that a Person is <hi>like</hi> himself, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cannot rationally imagine that <hi>Christ,</hi> who (as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) was <hi>after the similitude</hi> of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi>
was the same with him. This cannot be admitted by
any considerate Man. And this also is to be remembred,
that the Apostle in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (where he
particularly treateth of <hi>Melchisedech</hi>) would certainly
have told us this if it had been so.</p>

And such might some others of that part of <hi>Arabia</hi> be:
it is likely they were Proselytes to the true Religion. We

of part of <hi>Arabia the Desart,</hi> of the Posterity of

for that reason his Book is placed in the Bible after

Countrey, because 'tis the same to my present purpose
whether he was an <hi>Arabian</hi> or an <hi>Idumean.</hi> If he was
either of them, it is certain he was a <hi>Gentile;</hi> and yet
(which is the thing we are now concen'd in) he was a
Holy Man and a Right Worshipper. His Character is
briefly given him by him who wrote the Book, <hi>He was</hi>
(saith he) <hi>perfect and upright, and one that feared God,
and eschewed evil,</hi> Chap. 1. ver. 1. And God himself
gave him this high Encomium, <hi>There was none like him,</hi>
(i. e. for Goodness) <hi>in the earth,</hi> ver. 8. Whence
some would gather that he lived not in the time of any
of the Holy <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> or of <hi>Moses,</hi> for then it could
not be said, that he had not his fellow <hi>in the earth.</hi> But
this Inference is of no weight, because it is most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that this is spoken of that particular Countrey where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Iob</hi> lived, as <hi>the Earth</hi> is sometimes taken in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
sense in Scripture. So that the meaning is, <hi>there
was no man like him in the Land of</hi> Uz, for the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
word, <hi>Eretz,</hi> is the same in both places. He was the
most eminent Saint in that Region of the World. That
which we observe at present is, that he was so, tho he
was no <hi>Israelite,</hi> tho he was not of the <hi>Holy Seed.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this, he was a Worshipper of the True
God, and a Righteous Person. In Chap. 31. you may
hear him making a solemn Protestation of his Integrity
as to many grand things of Religion, and particularly
his abhorrence of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> ver. 26. Indeed the greatest
part of the Book is a Testimony of his singular Faith, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and Piety. Whereupon St. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith thus
of him,<note n="3" place="bottom">Divinitus provisum suisse non dubito ut ex hoc uno sciremus etiam per alias gentes esse potuisse qui secundùm Deum vixerunt, ei<expan>

                        <hi>Iob's Friends</hi> likewise may be reckoned among the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> for <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite</hi> was of <hi>Esau</hi>'s lineage,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 36. 11. and <hi>Bildad</hi> the <hi>Shuite</hi> was of the posterity
of <hi>Shuah</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Keturah,</hi> Gen. 25. 2.
and <hi>Elihu</hi> the <hi>Buzite</hi> was of <hi>Buz</hi> the Son of <hi>Nahor,</hi>
Gen. 22. 21. As <hi>Iob</hi> sacrificed for his Sons, (Chap.
1. ver. 5.) so <hi>Eliphaz</hi> did for himself and his two
friends (<hi>Iob</hi> 42. 8) to appease God's Wrath: and
all of them shew'd themselves Religious and Pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
For tho they were faulty as to their misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Iob</hi> sometimes, yet they were in their designs
upright, and intended only to justifie God, and to assert
his Providence, and to check Sin and Wickedness where
they thought they espi'd them. And it is not unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to think that <hi>Iob</hi> and his Companions, who were
Persons of such eminent Goodness, and moreover were
Rich and Wealthy Men, and of great Authority in the
Land of <hi>Vz</hi> (for as <hi>Iob</hi> himself was a Great Man, a
kind of <hi>King</hi> in that Countrey, so his three friends were
Men of Power and Eminency, and are call'd <hi>Kings</hi> by
the Author of the Book of <hi>Tobit</hi>) used their Wealth and
Authority for the promoting of Religion among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of that place: and so it is probable that there
were several that feared God there, and consequently
that the <hi>Church</hi> was not confined to one Nation, but
that God revealed himself in a saving manner to other
Countreys.</p>
                     <p>Of this we have further proof, for as there were these
Religious People in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> or <hi>Idumea,</hi> so

were acquainted with the True Religion. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s

was of this sort, and became a Convert, as may be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
collected from <hi>Dan. 3. 28, 29. Dan.</hi> 4. 34, &amp;c.
And it may be <hi>Cyrus</hi> (who is stiled by God <hi>his Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
Isai. 45. 1.) may be reckon'd in this number. But
tho there may be <hi>some</hi> doubt as to these latter, yet it is
certain that the rest, and several others that might be
named in <hi>Gentile</hi> Countreys, were Proselytes to the true
Faith, In prosecution of which Subject it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
observ'd that God sent <hi>Hebrew Prophets</hi> to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>other Nations: Isaiah, Ieremiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiest,</hi>
prophesied almost to all Nations; <hi>Obadiah</hi> to the <hi>Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means,</hi>
and <hi>Ionas</hi> was dispatch'd to the people of <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve</hi>
the Metropolis of <hi>Assyria,</hi> who believ'd and repented
at <hi>Ionas</hi>'s Preaching. This shews that God was kind to
<hi>Them</hi> as well as to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that they had the True
God and his Will in some measure discover'd to them
before: otherwise they would not have been so capable
of understanding the Divine Message when it came to
them, and of behaving themselves sutably to it. For it
is not to be question'd that the <hi>Ninivites</hi> Repentance
was true, it proceeding (as some of the Antients of the
Christian Church have observ'd) from a true Faith,
<hi>Ion. 2. 5. Mat. 12. 41.</hi> Their Fasting and Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were so eminent, that the <hi>Abyssine Church</hi> keeps year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Fast of threeday in remembrance of it. And I find
it is the Comfortable Note of <hi>Rabbi Kimchi,</hi> question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
why the Book of <hi>Ionas</hi> was rank'd among the Holy
Scriptures, it making no mention of <hi>Israel,</hi> as all other
Prophets do, but being wholly directed against the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivites,</hi>
who were Heathens and Strangers to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
of <hi>Israel, This Book,</hi> saith he, <hi>was written
to shew that God is merciful to those that repent, of what
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65397:157"/>
Nation soever they be.</hi> This Example makes it evident
that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not wholly rejected, altho as to
the greatest part they were, but that many of them
were accepted of God.</p>
                     <p>Yea, it seemeth to be plain from <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 11. that
the <hi>Getiles</hi> worshipp'd God no less than the <hi>Iews.</hi> The
words are in the <hi>present time</hi> in the Original. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to be so meant, that <hi>some of the Gentiles</hi> in
those days had the true Worship of God among them,
in one part or other of the whole <hi>World</hi> he was Adored
and Served. The History of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, and of
God's care of them, was the thing chiefly designed in the
<hi>Old Testament;</hi> and therefore it cannot be expected
that it should treat of <hi>other Nations,</hi> and give a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
account of what was done there. But it makes
mention (as you have heard) of <hi>some</hi> Holy Persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, and without doubt there were many more,
tho not spoken of. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not deserted of
God, but taken notice of by him, and encouraged. The
<hi>Visible Church</hi> did not altogether consist of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Family and Kindred; but many others that were not of
that Stock were true Members of it. Especially among
the <hi>neighbouring Nations</hi> several were converted to God
by the Preaching of the <hi>Israelitish Prophets,</hi> and in part
receiv'd the <hi>Iewish Religion,</hi> and by the <hi>Iews</hi> were call'd
<hi>Proselytes.</hi> These <hi>properly</hi> belong to the <hi>Gentile Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,</hi>
because they were first <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but converted
from their <hi>Gentilism</hi> to the Knowledg and Worship of
the True God. These <hi>Proselytes</hi> or <hi>Converts</hi> were of
two sorts:</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Proselytes of the Gate,</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi> stiled them
(because they lived within the Gates of <hi>Isreal,</hi> and they
held free Commerce and Trade within their Houses, the
same with the <hi>Strangers within their Gates,</hi> Exod. 20.
10. Deat. 14. 21.) They were those Heathens that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
their Pagan Superstition and Idolatry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the True Faith, and acknowledg'd the True God,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65397:158"/>
but were left to their liberty as to Circumcision. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Rank of <hi>Proselytes</hi> remain'd Uncircumcised, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did they observe the other <hi>Mosaick</hi> Laws and Rites,
but were only tied to the keeping of the Seven Precepts,
supposed to be given to <hi>Noab</hi>'s Sons, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> and
other Learned Writers among the <hi>Iews</hi> inform us. These,
tho they were no Idolaters, yet because they were Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised,
were not permitted to worship in the same
<hi>Court of the Temple</hi> with the <hi>Iews,</hi> but in a distinct
Place by themselves, therefore call'd <hi>the Court of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi>
and tho they went to the <hi>Iewish Synagogues,</hi> yet
they had a distinct Apartment there. There were many
of these <hi>Proselytes</hi> among the <hi>Iews</hi> every where in their

became Head of the Second Monarchy, which is the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
of the Sacred History of the Old Testament. These
were all left by God to themselves, and Idolatry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
among them all: they worshipp'd the Sun,
Moon and Stars, yea all kinds of Beasts tho never so base
and contemptible: Nay, Worshipping of Devils was a
common practice with them. Thus God suffer'd the
greatest part of the World to <hi>walk in their own ways</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: Thus they
were (as the Apostle speaks of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) <hi>without
God in the World,</hi> till he came into it. But yet even
then, when they were addicted to Idolatry (which is
also to be observed in this Oeconomy of the Nations)
<hi>God left not himself without witness,</hi> Acts 14. 17. He
led them to the knowledg of himself by the Book of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
they had sufficient light of God and Religion, <hi>i. e.</hi>
to teach them some general Duties of Virtue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to instruct them in the Nature and Attributes
of God, according to that of the Apostle, <hi>That which
may be known of God was manifest in them: for God
shew'd it unto them,</hi> Rom. 1. 19. But (as the Apostle
there adds) <hi>they held the Truth in unrighteousness, and
when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, but
changed the Glory of the incorruptible God into an Image
made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and fourfoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Beasts, and creeping things: and were filled with all
unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness,
maliciousness, full of envy, murder,</hi> and all manner of
Vice and Villany.</p>
                     <p>But tho it was thus with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> generally, yet
it was not so with them <hi>All:</hi> there were many that
abandon'd Idolatry, and profess'd the only True God.
There were excellent Persons even among the <hi>Heathens,</hi>
who were eminent for Grace and Holiness, as the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
before mention'd testifie. There was a kind of a
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65397:159"/>
Church out of the Church. Many of the Gentiles had
the knowledg of <hi>

                           </gap>,</hi> and of his <hi>Covenant</hi> with
Mankind: for a great part of the <hi>Covenant</hi> consisted in
the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> which was solemnly proclaim'd on
Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and was the principal part of the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
Religion, but appertain'd to all Men: for being the Law
of Nature, it had respect to the whole Race of <hi>

                           </gap>,</hi> it
concern'd every Person of what Nation or Countrey so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
And it might be remark'd to this purpose, that
at the promulgation of this Law, there were present
not only <hi>Israelites</hi> but <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Exod.
12. 38. Num. 11. 4. Deut. 29. 11. This intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that the <hi>Church</hi> was not shut up within the <hi>Iewish
Nation:</hi> the Covenant of Grace extended farther than
<hi>Iudea.</hi> And thus we see this Dispensation is a <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation

but as some of them were actual partakers of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar

no sort of People from the participation of his

we stand in need of Direction and Assistance, he

                        <hi>What Nation is there
so great that hath Statutes and Iudgments so righteous?</hi>
Where he sheweth on another account the <hi>Iews</hi> Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
<hi>viz.</hi> their having so exact a <hi>Law</hi> given them
by God. It appears not that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had any <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Rules</hi> and <hi>Positive Laws</hi> prescribed them, as the
<hi>Iews</hi> had. The Laws of the Old Testament were revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
only to this People, and to no other Nations. They
were peculiar Laws, and therefore the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not
under the particular Obligation of them. <hi>Moses</hi> his Law
never bound any but the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Proselytes</hi> who made
themselves Inhabitants of that Land: it obliged no other
Nations under Heaven. For it was <hi>designed</hi> for the Jews
only, and not for others; that is, <hi>Christ</hi> being to be
born amongst them, God granted to them Particular
and Special Favours, to distinguish them from other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to Sanctifie and Consecrate them especially. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God separated the <hi>Israelites</hi> from the rest of the
World, and gave them particular Constitutions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions:
<hi>he shew'd his Word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his Statutes
and Iudgments unto</hi> Israel: <hi>he hath not deale so with
any Nation; and as for his Iudgments, they have not
known them,</hi> Psal. 147. 19, 20. <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Nations</hi> of
the World were not govern'd by particular Laws as the
<hi>Iews,</hi> they were not so highly honour'd and blessed.
God was not pleas'd to manifest himself to them in a
like degree. In this regard the Psalmist saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.
4. <hi>The Lord hath chosen</hi> Jacob <hi>unto himself, and</hi> Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
<hi>for his peculiar treasure.</hi> And in this respect God
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:65397:160"/>
saith to <hi>Israel, You only have I known of all the Families
of the Earth,</hi> Amos 3. 2. God <hi>knew</hi> that People in a
manner different from all others: he convers'd with
them in a more intimate way than with the rest of the
World, he reveal'd himself to them in a particular and
special manner: he govern'd and ruled that People by
peculiar Laws and Sanctions, and he wrought extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Wonders to support and deliver them: so that in
comparison of the <hi>Iews</hi> God may be said <hi>not to have
known</hi> the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The Apostle likewise declareth the
Preference and Prerogative of the <hi>Iew</hi> above other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in answer to that question,<note n="9" place="bottom">Rom. 3. 1, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>What advantage hath
the</hi> Jew? <hi>or what profit is there of Circumcision? much
every way,</hi> saith he, <hi>chiefly because unto them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Oracles of God.</hi> They had singular Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Revelations of God's Will above others, which
was a Sign and Assurance of the greatest Favour imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
They had Holy Laws, to make them holier than
others, and they carried the Sign and Mark of the Holy
Covenant even on their flesh. For this reason God may
be said to have been the God of their Nation.</p>
                     <p>But whilst he shew'd more especial kindness to them,
he did not neglect the rest; for besides that all of them
lived under the Law of general Grace, many of them
were specially favoured, and experienced the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace of God. The Blessings of God's Church rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
even to some of those that were not within the Pale
of it. A Divine Light was reflected from the Church to
those that were not thought Members of it. Some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning
and refreshing Rays were sent out to them, tho
the Sun was not risen on their Horizon. The Sum of all
is, that when God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his Posterity the <hi>Israelites,</hi> he did not debar other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from Saving Grace and all Spiritual Benefits. There
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:65397:161"/>
were, besides <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and the Body of the
<hi>Israelites</hi> who came from <hi>Abraham,</hi> other Persons in
the World who knew and worship'd God in a true and
right manner. Some that were at a great distance from
the Holy Land, and were Aliens to the Commonwealth
of <hi>Israel,</hi> were Heirs of Eternal life. Some of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were virtually included in the Covenant, altho not
mantioned. Tho they were not to enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi>
(and <hi>Canaan</hi> could not hold them) which was part of
the Covenant to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> yet they were as good as
taken in as to other Clauses of it, and as to the Effence
and Substance of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spiritual Mercies couched
in it. Thus they were comprehended in the Covenant
of Life and Salvation, for all (of what Nation soever)
were Partakers of the Benefits of it upon their believing
and repenting. Not only <hi>Iews</hi> but <hi>Gentiles</hi> were inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
in it. In the full Meal and Provision which God
made for his own People the <hi>Israelites,</hi> some Portions,
some Fragments fell besides the Table, which others ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
up. This is God's Administration to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi>
and I make it a <hi>particular and distinct Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
tho I see those who reckon up the <hi>different Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Religion</hi> omit this. The Reason, I suppose, is
because this <hi>Gentile Dispensation</hi> is mixed with the rest
of the Dispensations. Because it was concurrent with
the <hi>Patriachal</hi> and <hi>Mosaical</hi> Oeconomies, and was not
a thing by it self, they took no notice of it. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this, it is a <hi>peculiar Dispensation,</hi> and a
very remarkable one too, as the Premises may convince
us. And at last our Blessed Saviour perfected this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
for a little before he left the World he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
the Apostles <hi>to go and teach all Nations,</hi> Mat. 28.
19. to Evangelize the Goyim, the <hi>Nations,</hi> (for so the
<hi>Iews</hi> call'd all People besides themselves) to propagate
Christianity throughout <hi>the whole World.</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
we read that when the Apostles had continued
some time at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> after Christ's Ascention (only
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65397:161"/>
some of them now and then slepping abroad to confirm
the neighbouring Churches that were lately planted)
<note place="bottom">Euseb. Eccles. Hist. l. 5. c. 18.</note> they issued out with one consent into several Countries,
where by their Travels they spread the Gospel as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> did the Hebrew Tongue, the
one by his numerous Conquests, the other by his prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Fleets and Commerces: so that even in St. <hi>Paul's</hi>
time <hi>the Gospel was Preached to every Creature under
Heaven,</hi> Col. 1. 23. Thus at length the <hi>Gentile Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation</hi>
was swallow'd up of the <hi>Evangelical one,</hi> which
now I will particularly speak of.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Christian or Evangelical Oeconomy. It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with the former Dispensations of Grace as
to the Designation of the Messias. As to
the way of Salvation. As to the Conditions
and Qualifications of it. This corroborated by
the suffrage of the Antient Fathers. It differs
from the Mosaick Oeconomy or Law as to the
Author in some respect. As to the Actual
Discovery of it. As to the Clearness of it.
As to its Spirituality. As to its Extent. As
to several Circumstances that relate to the
Conditions of Salvation; which are largely
enumerated. As to the Motives of Obedience.
The Doctrine of the Socinians, viz. that there
were no Promises of Eternal Life under the
Old Testament, confuted. As to the Perfection
of its Pattern. As to its Helps and Assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
This Query, Whether Christ added any
new Laws to those which were before under
the Old Testament, resolved in several Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
It is proved against the Socinians,
that Prayer was commanded under the Law.
How Love is call'd a New Commandment.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe <hi>Christian or Evangelical Dispensation</hi> is next to
be treated of. <hi>God having at sundry times and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
manners spoken in times past, hath</hi> now <hi>in these last
days spoken unto us by his Son,</hi> Heb. l. 1, 2. He was

Now by Christ's coming we have the perfect Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of them all. <hi>Christianity</hi> comprehends all the
other Dispensations, and is the Upshot of them all. This
is called the <hi>Revelation of the Mystery which was kepe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
since the World began but now is made manifest,</hi>
Rom. 16. 26, 27. and the <hi>Mystery of Christ which in

brings forth, and distributes that which was before laid
up. This is agreeable to the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> which we are
now to discourse of; the great Things which were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and treasured up before, are now brought forth, and
discovered, and communicated to the World. This is
that <hi>Dispensation</hi> which brings <hi>Everlasting Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
with it, this is the Highest and Noblest Exertment
of the <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> and all the Mercy and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
which former Generations found, were on the sole
account of this Period. This Dispensation of the Messias
is represented by <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and by <hi>Christ</hi> himself, to
be the most Glorious State that hath yet appeared in the
World, or that ever shall appear; for <hi>Christianity,</hi> as
most perfect, includes all the Laws before named, and
all the ways of Discovery that can be made.</p>
                     <p>1. I will shew the <hi>particular Nature</hi> of this Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and how it differs from the others. 2. I will
shew why this Evangelical Dispensation took not place
in the World <hi>before.</hi> 3. I must particularly and directly
prove the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of this Oeconomy, and
of the Christian Religion. 4. I will discover to you the
<hi>several Degrees</hi> of this Dispensation. All which Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
are of great use for the right understanding of this
last Administration of Religion.</p>
                     <p>1. I will display the <hi>particular Nature</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi>
of this Oeconomy, this new Oeconomy of the Gospel.
Here I will let you see, 1. That as to the main it agrees
with all the other Oeconomies of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> from the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65397:163"/>
Restoration of <hi>Adam.</hi> 2. That tho as to the main it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with all the foregoing Dispensations, yet as to sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
particulars it differs from them. First, all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations
agree in the main, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Divine Designation</hi> or <hi>Appointment of the
Messias</hi> reach'd to them all. This <hi>Lamb was slain from
the foundation of the World,</hi> Rev. 13. 8. His Sufferings
and Death were decreed from all Ages; Christ was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
from the beginning, even from Eternity. For
tho some interpret this place, as if it alluded to the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Abel,</hi> the first holy Person that was <hi>slain,</hi> and as
if it took in the rest of the Martyrs in after Ages, <hi>the
Lamb</hi> here signifying the whole Succession of Saints who
were innocent and spotless in their Lives, and invincible
in their Deaths (and so <hi>Christ</hi> as well as others may be
said to be <hi>slain from the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there was <hi>at First,</hi> even at the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the World,
this Example of the Wicked's murdering the Just) yet
this must be look'd upon as a forced Interpretation of the
words: for in the stile of Scripture (excepting those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where the Sense must needs be restrained and limited
because of the subject matter) <hi>from the foundation of the
World</hi> is as much as <hi>from Eternity,</hi> as is plain from <hi>Mat.</hi>
25. 34. <hi>Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the World;</hi> and from <hi>Ioh. 17. 24. Thou

Or, suppose this Phrase [from the foundation of the
World] doth not denote Eternity, yet it is enough for
our purpose that Christ, the Lamb of God, was slain
<hi>from the beginning of the World,</hi> for from thence we may
gather, that it was designed and appointed to reach to
all following Generations.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>The way and method of Salvation</hi> was the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                        <hi>Socinians</hi>
oppose this, and generally hold that the Godly who lived
before the time of the Messias were not saved by <hi>Him:</hi>
they assert that they knew nothing of it, and that there
were other means of being saved under the <hi>Old Testament</hi>
than there are under the <hi>New.</hi> But this is a Doctrine
deservedly exploded by all Persons who are of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Faith, and who own the True Christian Religion.
They all agree that the same way of Salvation hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
prevailed, that all who were saved under the Old
Testament, were saved by Virtue of Christ's Death and
Satisfaction. There was Justification <hi>under the Law,</hi>
tho not <hi>by it,</hi> or by virtue of it. Those that believed
with their whole hearts on God, and faithfully serv'd
him, were justified, and obtain'd Remission of their Sins,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:65397:164"/>
and Eternal Life by that <hi>Grace</hi> which was couched in the
<hi>Law,</hi> i. e. promis'd in the <hi>Messias,</hi> and figured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the obscure Types of the Law. By virtue
of the Grace to be exhibited by <hi>Christ,</hi> even those who
were before his arrival, were saved. This is the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
which St. <hi>Peter</hi> preach'd, <hi>Acts 15. 11. We believe
that through the grace of the Lord Iesus Christ we shall be
saved even as They,</hi> i. e. the Fathers before Christ, as
is clear from the foregoing verse. The Holy Men then
were acquainted with the Substance of this Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Promise of Restoration by <hi>Christ:</hi> and consequently
the Old Testament Saints were saved by him. Thus
we are told by another inspired Author, that <hi>by means of
Christ's Death there was Redemption for the Transgressors
that were under the first Testament,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. For tho
the Redemption of Mankind was not actually wrought
by him till he died on the Cross, yet the Virtue and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of it were in all Ages, as the Sun spreads its light,
and illuminates our Region before its glorious Body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
above the Horizon.</p>
                     <p>3. As to the <hi>Conditions</hi> and <hi>Qualifications</hi> on our part,
all the Dispensations of Grace were the same. All sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Duties towards God and Man are the same now
that they were then. Even Faith in the <hi>Messias</hi> is as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
as that Promise on which it was first founded, that
the Bless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in this Promised Deliverer, by whose Merit they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to be reconciled to God. <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> was a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
under the Old Testament, because there were Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
concerning the <hi>Messias</hi> then, as is evident from <hi>Luke</hi>
1. 72. and what were these Promisessor, but to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
and relied upon? Therefore it is recorded that
<hi>Abraham Believed,</hi> Rom. 4. 3. Gal. 3. 6. And our
Saviour witnesseth, that <hi>Abraham rejoiced to see his day,
and he saw it, and was glad,</hi> Joh. 8. 56. The Reason
was, because (as the Apostle saith) God <hi>preached the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

are clearly understood by us. This makes the difference
between the <hi>Mosaick Dispensation</hi> and the <hi>Evangelical
One.</hi> The Doctrine of Salvation and the means of Life
by Christ, are more intelligible and plain than they were
before. Their Conceptions of those things were intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and obscure, but we have arrived to clear and distinct
Notions concerning them. In short, the way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was before more dark and general, they saw Christ
through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of time is come, and hath given us a near and more
perfect view of those things which they saw but in a glass
darkly.</p>
                     <p>4. The Religion of the Gospel is more <hi>Inward</hi> and
<hi>Lively</hi> than that of the Law and the Jewish Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
There is now introduced a Rational and Manly
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65397:167"/>
Service: our Religion is chiefly the employment of our
Minds and Understandings, and not so much of our
Bodies and lower Faculties. We now worship God <hi>in
Spirit</hi> as well as <hi>in Truth</hi> (of which I spake befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e):
we worship in a <hi>spiritual manner,</hi> opposed to outward
and bodily Service, as <hi>Sacrifices, Purifications,</hi> &amp;c.
The Evangelical Righteousness is a Spiritual Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
a Vital Principle, able to beget a Divine Life;
whereas the Law comparatively was an external dead
Letter, and did not sufficiently actuate the Minds and
Spirits of Men. It is true, the History of the Gospel, or
the Doctrin of the Evangelists, as it is merely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and written, is as much external as the Law;
but <hi>the ministration of the Spirit</hi> (as the Apostle calls
it) going along with the Gospel in a more especial and
peculiar manner, is a powerful Principle in the Souls of
Men, whereby they are inwardly renewed and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
And so the Gospel (compared with the Law)
is of greater Power, Might and Efficacy, and is able to
produce a heavenly and spiritual frame of Soul, and a
sincere performance of the Divine Laws. This is <hi>the
Law</hi> promis'd to be <hi>written in the Hearts of Men,</hi> and
to be <hi>put into their inward parts,</hi> Jer. 31. 33.</p>
                     <p>5. This Dispensation of the Gospel is <hi>larger</hi> and
<hi>ampler</hi> than that of the <hi>Law,</hi> and of other Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before it: For the Church was shut up in narrow
bounds, and confined to a few Families of the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs:</hi>
Afterwards it was limited to the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
and to the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>brew</hi> People, (excepting a few that
were without, who knew God's Will, and were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
accepted.) But after Christ came, the Church
was not tied to one Place or certain Nation, but hath
been ever since the Congregation of all such as truly
know and worship Christ in any part of the World.
The <hi>Christian Dispensation</hi> is not local and temporary,
not confined to place or time, not circumscribed by a
particular Country. Now not one Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65397:168"/>
few of others, are honoured with Laws given from
God himself; but <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Iews, Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Barbarians,</hi> all Kindreds and Tongues, all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Regions of the Universe have heard the
sound of the Gospel, and have had the Divine Laws,
which were given by Christ himself, offer'd to them.
Our Saviour bid his Disciples<note n="1" place="bottom">Mat. 28. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>go into all the World,</hi>
and <hi>teach all Nations:</hi> And accordingly (as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
before) they travell'd into all the World which
was at that time known, and proclaimed the <hi>Messias</hi> to
them. Thus <hi>Christ came and preach'd Peace to them
that were afar off, and to them that were nigh,</hi> Ephes.
2. 17. All Places and Countries had the privilege of
the Gospel, and might receive advantage by it. This
is one remarkable Difference between the <hi>Legal</hi> and the
<hi>Evangelical Dispensation:</hi> the former was Narrow and
Contracted; the latter was Full, Ample, Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and Catholick.</p>
                     <p>6. Altho (as hath been said) the <hi>Conditions of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
are the same now as to the main with those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet they vary as to <hi>several Circumstances.</hi> To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with <hi>Faith,</hi> the first and chief Condition of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the grand Fundamental Grace of Christianity:
This is reckon'd by the Reverend Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> among
the <hi>Instances of Duties which are new under the Gospel:</hi>
But the true account is this, that Faith was not a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the Natural or Moral Law, but was a new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
added to it by <hi>Revelation,</hi> when the First Promise
and New Covenant were made. But ever since that it
hath not been New; for (as I have proved) the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Patriarchs were saved by Faith in Christ. He was
the Object of Faith then as well as now: the<note n="2" place="bottom">Tempora variata sunt, non fides. <hi>Augustin.</hi>
                        </note> Faith of
the first Believers was the same with the Faith of <hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
                        <pb n="319" facs="tcp:65397:168"/>
Yet notwithstanding this, this Grace of Faith
hath a different aspect from what it had. The Fathers
believed in the Messias that <hi>was to come,</hi> and we believe
in the same Jesus who <hi>is come,</hi> and hath taken on him
our Nature, and laid down his Life, and shed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Blood for the redemption of lost Man; and rose
again and ascended into Heaven. Thus the <hi>believing</hi> of
Christ's Birth, Passion, Resurrection and Ascension, is
in this respect <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>w,</hi> that Faith looks upon them as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished.
But otherwise, in respect of the things
themselves, it is the <hi>old</hi> Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> the same which
those that lived before the time of the Messias exerted.
Christ that was to be crucified, was the Object of <hi>their</hi>
Belief; and Christ already crucified, is the Object of
<hi>ours.</hi> This is confirm'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they were not named</hi> Christian <hi>men, yet was it a</hi> Christian
Faith <hi>which they had, for they looked for all the Benefits

Christ, as we now do. This difference is between them
and us, that they looked when Christ should come, and we
are in the time when he is come.</hi> Besides, a <hi>more general
Belief</hi> was sufficient for mens Salvation before the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>'s

to believe so expresly and explicitly concerning
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65397:169"/>
Christ and his Undertakings, as we are obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
since. So that tho there is not now a New Faith,
neither are there New Articles of Faith, yet there are
New Exertments of Faith, and more clear and express
Acts of Belief.</p>
                     <p>And to Faith I may adjoin <hi>Hope,</hi> for Hope is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on Faith; and therefore <hi>Faith</hi> being more clear and
express under the Gospel (as I have said) it follows
that <hi>Hope</hi> is so too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is more stable and firm, more
sure and certain than the Hope of those before Christ's
coming: and on this account the Gospel is deservedly
call'd <hi>the bringing in of a better Hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 19.

                     <p>And as for <hi>Charity,</hi> and all the rest of the <hi>Virtues,
Graces</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> required of us (for I will speak of
them altogether) they differ from what they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Dispensation as to these following
things.</p>
                     <p>(1.) There are <hi>greater measures</hi> of every Grace now
under <hi>Christianity,</hi> than there were under the other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations.
Christians reach now to higher Degrees
and Perfections of Virtue than those under the Law
did: And this indeed was the <hi>design</hi> of the Gospel;
this Dispensation came in the last place, to add a greater
<hi>Perfection</hi> than ever any other preceding Models of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
pretended to.</p>
                     <p>(2.) A greater <hi>stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This you must know, that tho the Rigour
of the Law be abated under the Gospel, yet the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical

Scribes and Pharisees, yo cannot enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20. A more
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65397:169"/>
circumspect and accurate way of living is expected from
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Disciples, than from those of <hi>Moses:</hi> A more
severe sanctity and conformity to God's Will are requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of them, than of these.</p>
                     <p>But yet I must add in the third place, That whereas
the <hi>Law</hi> (which did in a manner revive the <hi>Covenant
of Works)</hi> required perfect Works and sinless Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the <hi>Gospel</hi> requires no such thing, but accepts of
imperfect, but sincere Obedience, which is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
by Christ's Satisfaction. Under the <hi>Gospel</hi>
Men are not so much obnoxious for offending, as
for continuing obstinately in their Offences: And Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is now denied, not for Sin committed, but for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in Sin without Repentance. This is a grand Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Law and the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that was harsh
and rigorous, this is gentle and favourable.</p>
                     <p>Again, Duties are <hi>further extended and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi>
now than they were before: Which must needs be,
because the State of <hi>Christianity</hi> is wider and larger
than that of <hi>Iudaism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> There is more Love now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the former aversness and enmities are removed.

about peculiar Rites and distinct Observances,
whereby the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were differenced from the <hi>Iews,</hi>
which made a breach between them. But a <hi>Vniversal
Charity</hi> breaths in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the Exertments of it are
of greater latitude than those heretofore. <hi>Elijah</hi> call'd for
Fire from Heaven upon his Enemies, and was not blamed,
but heard by God, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 10, 12. but <hi>Iames</hi> and
<hi>Iohn,</hi> Apostles of Christ, did the same thing, and were
severely check'd for it, <hi>Luke 9. 54.</hi> And we read that
St. <hi>Peter</hi> was commanded to put up his Sword when he
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:65397:170"/>
drew it in his Master's Quarrel, which certainly was the
best in the World. The reason of this is not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Evangelical Temper is more mild and loving
than that legal one, but because its Laws are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive,
and more favourable. Nay, whereas the Old
Law commanded Love to their Brethren, the Gospel
bids us shew that Love by <hi>dying for them,</hi> if there be
occasion, <hi>Iohn 15. 12. 1 Iohn 3. 16.</hi> And in other
Circumstances I might shew that the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is larger and more comprehensive than that of the

                     <p>In the fifth place, this must be said likewise, that some

that there were no Promises of Eternal Life

that the Fathers of old rested not in Temporal and

the coming of the <hi>Messias.</hi> It is granted, that the
<hi>Law</hi> dealt in temporal and secular things most of all;
but it doth not follow thence that the <hi>Iews</hi> had no
higher Promises than those that were earthly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
this Life only. Yea, this also must be further
granted, that tho <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the Prophets,
and the most devout Persons among them were sensible
of this; yet it is likely many of the <hi>Iews</hi> look'd no
further than the present Enjoyments of this Animal

to hold forth nothing else.</p>
                     <p>But under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> Eternal Life is openly
and clearly offer'd, and all Persons may be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of it. Hence it is that Christ is said to be
<hi>the Mediator of a better Covenant, which is establish'd
on better Promises,</hi> Heb. 8. 6. The <hi>Promises</hi> under the

makes it manifest, evident and undeniable, that there
are such things; it demonstrates to us, that there are
never-ceasing Torments for the Wicked, and eternal
Joys for the Righteous; of which latter Christ hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
us by his ascending into Heaven, there to prepare
perpetual Mansions of Glory for all his Followers. He

who sent his Son, and <hi>the Love of Christ</hi> who died
for us. <hi>God so loved the World that he gave his only
begotten Son,</hi> saith that blessed Disciple whom Jesus
loved, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. And again, 1 <hi>Iohn 4. 9, 10. In
this was manifested the Love of God towards us, because
that God sent his only begotten Son into the World, that
we might live through him. Herein is Love, not that
we</hi> (first) <hi>loved him, but that he loved us</hi> (first.) Now
observe how he makes this a Motive to the Duty of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Love; <hi>If God so loved us, we ought to love
one another,</hi> ver. 11. No former Dispensation affords
this <hi>Motive.</hi> Christ therefore might well say, <hi>A New
Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another
as I have loved you,</hi> John 13. 34. This is a <hi>new thing,</hi>
and is proper to <hi>Christianity</hi> only. Here <hi>the Love of
God is shed abroad in our Hearts,</hi> Rom. 5. 5. Here
<hi>the Love of Christ constraineth us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14. And
then no Duty in Religion comes amiss to us, then we
act with vigour and chearfulness, and exert our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Powers, and that with ease and complacency.
This <hi>Principle of Love</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi>
which is most proper to the Occonomy of the <hi>Law,</hi>
to the breach of every part of which God hath annexed
severe Curses to terrify Offenders, and these <hi>generally</hi>
were the most powerful Motives they had to make them
obedient. The promulgation of the <hi>Law</hi> was with
great Terrors and Astonishment: <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>AEtna,</hi> it cast out Flames and Smoke, and nothing
was seen and heard but what was very frightful: This
well represented the terrible administration of the <hi>Law,</hi>
which breaths Severity and Rigour, and is rightly call'd
<hi>Esh dath,</hi> a <hi>firy Law,</hi> Deut. 33. 2. They were scar'd
into their Duty for the most part. But this servile
Spirit, this Principle of legal Fear is banish'd out of
<hi>Christianity:</hi> those that are effectually brought under
this Dispensation, act by a Principle of Love; for the
Spirit of the Gospel is free and ingenuous, sweet and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65397:174"/>
gentle, and needs not to be push'd on by rigour and
austerity. <hi>God hath not given us the Spirit of Fear,

were worthy and eminent Examples of Virtue

Religion, was without spot and blemish in his Life, he
neither spoke nor did any thing amiss, he was every

gave us a perfect Example of Piety and Devotion, of
Justice and Righteousness, of Moderation and Sobriety,
of Mercy and Charity, of Humility and Self-denial, of
Contentedness and Resignation, of religious Zeal and
Courage, of all Virtues and Graces whatsoever which
are to adorn the Life of a Christian. Our Saviour was
sent on purpose to be a Guide, a Pattern, a Rule to the
degenerate World, that by the excellency and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of his Example, he might reduce Mankind to
the ways of Religion and Righteousness, that in him
they might behold and admire the beauty of Goodness,
and the worth of Piety and Holiness; and that by this
means <hi>Christianity</hi> might be commended to the World,
and that Men might esteem and love it when it shineth

and the <hi>Christian Church.</hi>

toward the performing of our Duty, than those
who lived under other Dispensations had. We have greater
Light to direct us, we have more effectual Means to
make use of; we have all the revealed Knowledg which
they had, and we have much more besides. We have
the Holy Scriptures of the New Testament to enlighten,
to inform, to instruct us, to check and reprove us, to

Ordinances of Christ's own Institution, the sole
design of which was to convey Knowledg and Grace,
Strength and Establishment to our Souls. <hi>God hath set
in the Church some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting
of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the Body of Christ; till we all come in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Faith, and of the Knowledg of the Son of God,
unto a perfect Man, unto the measure of the Stature of
the fulness of Christ,</hi> Ephes. 4. 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and Fulness contribute the Holy <hi>Sacraments</hi> of

the <hi>Covenant</hi> being the same, the <hi>Sacraments</hi> must be

Sacraments</hi> were only typified by those; they
were never in actual use till Christ's coming. <hi>Baptism</hi>

may be rightly said to have been <hi>virtually</hi> in Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and the Passover, and so are <hi>not new:</hi> but they are
<hi>new</hi> in another respect, <hi>viz.</hi> as by the former we are

initiated and adopted into the <hi>Christian O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the latter we are confirmed in it. By the pious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating
of both which the Spiritual Benefits of the
Gospel are exhibited and conferr'd, sealed and assured
to the Souls of the Faithful, and they are found to be
no contemptible <hi>Helps</hi> to Religion and Holiness. But
the <hi>assistance of the Holy Spirit</hi> in these and all other
Duties of Christianity, is the most signal Privilege of
the Gospel. For <hi>when</hi>
                        <note n="1" place="bottom">Ephes. 4. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Christ ascended up on high he
gave Gifts unto Men,</hi> especially that matchless Gift
the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> whereby not only the Apostles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians were enabled to speak and act in a
miraculous manner; but in all succeeding Ages, the
true Followers of Jesus feel the wonderful influence
and operation of it on their Hearts and Lives, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are strengthned to perform what is required of
them in a way far surpassing what was in the former
Dispensations. This is that which makes <hi>Evangelical
Grace</hi> differ from <hi>Moral Virtue</hi> and <hi>Iudaical Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>
viz. that the former is heightned (not only
by the <hi>Motives</hi> of the Gospel, of which I spake before,
but) by the <hi>Assistance of the Spirit.</hi> By this we not
only <hi>cry, Abba Father,</hi> but are enabled to demean our
selves as those who are the Sons of God. Thus our
<hi>Power</hi> is mightily increased, which is another great
Difference between the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> between
Judaism and Christianity.</p>

whoso can rightly judg between the Law and the

this Task, and therefore I have gone through it
with much caution; and the whole I leave to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

baffled by those several Particulars which I have offered
to you concerning the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel.</hi> The same
God, blessed for evermore, wisely appointed both these
Oeconomies; and tho they are different, yet they are
not contradictory. <hi>God made those two great Lights,
the one to rule the Night, the other the Day:</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was fitted to those darker times, and the latter is
most sutable to the Fulness of time, when a redundant
Light overspread the World. The <hi>Iewish</hi> Oeconomy
was narrow, weak and imperfect, and best comported
with the People that were under it: but the <hi>Gospel</hi>-Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
is large and ample, compleat and perfect, and

his Laws and those are the same?</hi> I find this Question is
too peremptorily decided on both sides. One positively
asserts, that all the Evangelical Commands are the very
same with the Laws of the former Administration: The
others say, there are New Commands added in the
Gospel to those of the Law. But, I conceive, the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65397:176"/>
Question is not to be decided thus in gross, but we
ought to be more particular and exact in it. Take it in
short thus; First, There were many things of Religion
under the <hi>Law,</hi> which are abrogated under the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
as all Rites and Ceremonies merely <hi>Mosaick:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Gospel is called the <hi>Law of Liberty,</hi> Jam. 1. 25.
because it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>reesus from observing those <hi>Iewish</hi> Rites.
These were Duties then, but are no Duties now. But,
secondly, all things that are our Duty now, were their
Duty then. Which I explain thus in these four Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. There were the same Laws and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Old; as admitting of all Believers into the Church by
<hi>Baptism</hi> (which was never practis'd among the Body of
the <hi>Iews,</hi> tho it was used toward some Proselytes) and
celebrating the Lord's Death in the <hi>Holy Communion</hi>
(which could not be done before, because Christ was
not come, and therefore could not die.) So there are

This is very rational to believe, tho there were no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

as the former was set apart from the beginning for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating
the Creation of the World, so this latter
might be in remembrance of the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
The change of the Day, and our celebrating of
it, are upon weighty grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Christ's Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the Dead, whereby Man's New Creation
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:65397:176"/>

that of our Saviour himself: for first it is most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that Christ himself gave particular Order concerning
the observing of this day, when (as we read) for <hi>forty

gave particular directions about it, (tho it is not to be

the Scripture is silent as to many other things, which

Isa. 67. 7. and <hi>Prayers</hi> were mix'd with all the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

Man have the confidence to say that Prayer is a <hi>New

                     <p>But here it may be alledged that <hi>Love</hi> is call'd a <hi>New
Commandment</hi> both by our Saviour (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 34.) and
by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> (1 Epist, chap. 2. ver. 8.) therefore there is
<hi>this Commandment</hi> at least added anew by Christ to what
was before. I will reply to this, by explaining to you
how <hi>Love</hi> may be said to be a <hi>New Commandment.</hi> 1.
I have suggested before that it may be call'd <hi>New</hi> because
of the <hi>New Motive</hi> annex'd to it in <hi>Iohn 13. 34. A
New Commandment I give unto you that ye love one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as I have loved you.</hi> This latter Clause is New,
tho the former be Old. This is one Reason which a
<note n="7" place="bottom">Isidor. Pelus. l. 3. Epist. 410.</note> Learned Writer gives why <hi>Love</hi> is call'd a New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.
2. Another is because it was <hi>Ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Christ, and urged on his Disciples <hi>afresh</hi> as their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
badg. <hi>A New Commandment give I unto you that
ye love one another,</hi> said our Saviour to his Apostles
that night when he celebrated the Passover with them,
and instituted the Holy Sacrament of his Body and Blood,
and when he was taking his leave of them and the
World: Now he seasonably presses what he had exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to before, now he calls upon them more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to exercise the Grace of Love. Thus it is a <hi>New
Commandment</hi> because Christ repeats it anew. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ vindicated it (as you shall hear more by
and by) from the false Glosses of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and so
made it as it were <hi>New.</hi> They thought that <hi>Love</hi> was

shewing distinctly and particularly what is the
Law, and how Christ came to fulfil it. It is
held by some that Christ came to add New Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
to the Moral Law. In confutation of
which Opinion it is proved that Anger is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
by the Decalogue. So is a Lustful Eye.
So is all Rash and Prophane Swearing. So
is Divorce, unless in the case of Adultery. So
is Resisting of Evil. So is hating of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
It is largely discuss'd whether it was
lawful for the Israelites to hate the seven Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whom they were commanded to destroy.
And whether the Command to destroy them
was Absolute. Objections from Deut. 13. 8,
9. &amp; Psal. 139. 21. answer'd. The Nature
of the Two Covenants, viz. of Works and
of Grace, fully stated. The Conditions on our
part. How [do this, and live] is applicable
to the Covenant of Grace. The Covenant made
with the Israelites at the giving of the Law on
Mount Sinai was the Covenant of Grace,
though it seem'd to resemble the Covenant of
Works. The Covenant of Grace was completed
and perfected by Christ's Coming, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The Mediator, the Terms, the Seals
of this Covenant now fully manifested. It is
proved that according to the Stile of Scripture
the Old and New Covenant are the same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace.</p>

of by many to confront, and (as they think) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
this Doctrine. They maintain that there is a far
greater difference between the Precepts of the <hi>Old</hi> and
<hi>New Testament</hi> than I have asserted, and that Christ not
only explained those Old Laws, but added New Ones to
them, for that (say they) is the meaning of Christ's
words in that place, <hi>Think not that I am come to destroy
the Law or the Prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to
fulfil.</hi> Because these words and the rest of the Chapter
which follows them, are alledged with great earnestness
by the Patrons of this Opinion, and because they boast
that they are an irrefragable Proof of what they say, I
will inlarge upon them, and faithfully present you with
the true meaning of them, which you will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ee is so far
from Patronizing their Cause, that it overthroweth it,
and layeth it in the dust. To explain these words
then,</p>
                     <p>1st. By the <hi>Law and the Prophets</hi> is meant whatever is
contain'd in the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> or of the other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
of the Old Testament (for the whole Scripture of
the Old Testament is summed up in these two, <hi>the Law</hi>
and <hi>the Prophets</hi>) but especially what is contain'd in
them concerning the <hi>Messias,</hi> his Person, his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
and his Kingdom. Now, Christ was so far
from <hi>destroying,</hi> baffling and nulling of these, that he
came to <hi>fulfil</hi> them, <hi>i. e.</hi> by his Coming he <hi>verified,
made good and accomplished</hi> whatever was foretold or
promis'd concerning him in the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and
the <hi>Prophets.</hi> Thence it is that you so often read in the
New Testament that such and such things came to pass,
<hi>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by</hi> this or that
Prophet. Christ came to perform and bring into Act,
whatever was prophesied in those Antient Writings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him: and here in <hi>ver.</hi> 18. he assured his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

and Hearers, that <hi>one jot or one tittle should in no

                     </p>
                     <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> When our Saviour saith <hi>he came not to destroy but

here. And that <hi>he came not to destroy this,
but to fulfil it,</hi> is true in these two senses, First, this Law
as far as it concern'd our Saviour was obeyed and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
by him; that may be the meaning of <hi>fulfilling.</hi> He
was Circumcised the eighth day, he was presented in the
Temple, and made his Offering there. When he entred
on his Ministry, he exactly complied with the Mosaick
Injunctions, for he took not that Employment till he was
thirty Years of age, the very time when the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests

yet more punctually he <hi>fulfilled the Law</hi> in keeping the
<hi>Passover;</hi> for whereas the <hi>Iews</hi> by their Traditions had
corrupted the Law concerning the Observation of this
Feast, and kept it not till the fifteenth day of the Month,
our Saviour kept it th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and so observed the true time which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by God at first, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. Thus Christ <hi>came
to fulfil even the Ceremonial Law,</hi> and that with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

him to fulfil all righteousness,</hi> Mat. 3. 15. Secondly,

in any person. But he came <hi>to fulfil it,</hi> i. e. 1. To <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi>
and <hi>Obey it,</hi> and that first in his own Person: He
inviolably kept the Law himself, he most strictly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
both the <hi>Tables</hi> of it all his Life. Again, he obliged
others to keep and obey this Law: He always inculcated
the use and necessity of it in Mens Lives. 2. He came to
<hi>fulfil it,</hi> i. e. to teach Men to observe the <hi>Full Design</hi>
and <hi>Vtmost Intent</hi> of the Moral Law. This is first clear
from the Context, <hi>ver. 19. Whosoever therefore shall
break one of these least Commandments, shall be called least
in the kingdom of Heaven,</hi> i. e. he shall be a very despised
and contemptible Person under the <hi>Christian O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who shall <hi>diminish</hi> any of the Precepts of the Moral Law.
They must be taken one with another. The Decalogue
is full and comprehensive. Anger as well as Murder is
prohibited in the Sixth Commandment: and so in the

And not only he that breaks the least of these
Commandments, but <hi>he that teacheth men so to do,</hi> (as

                        <hi>the Commandments are exceeding

broad.</hi> But <hi>I say unto you,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>except
your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the
kingdom of Heaven,</hi> ver. 20. And then in the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
part of the Chapter our Saviour proceeds to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
his hearers particularly how these. <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi>
and those from whom they receiv'd their Notions,
had mistaken the true meaning of the Law, and had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the genuine Sense of it by their false Glosses and
Interpretations.</p>
                     <p>But not only the <hi>Context</hi> but <hi>this very word it self</hi>
which is here used, leads us to this thing which I am
now offering to you. The known and common signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the<note n="3" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> implere, perficere, absolvere.</note> Greek word which is rendred <hi>to fulfil,</hi>
is to accomplish a thing fully, to bring it to Perfection.
The word is properly used when a Man doth as much as
he can, and acts his best. Thus the Apostle saith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ,</hi> Rom. 15.
19. It is the same word which our Saviour useth here,
when he saith he came to <hi>fulfil</hi> the Law. How did St.
<hi>Paul fulfil the Gospel of Christ?</hi> He labour'd abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
than the rest of the Apostles, he travel'd from
place to place, <hi>from Ierusalem and round about unto Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum</hi>
(as he saith in the same verse) he went his Circuit,
he took extraordinary pains wheresoever he came, he was
careful to instruct people in all the necessary Doctrines
of Christianity, and to keep back nothing from them.
Thus he <hi>fulfilled,</hi> or <hi>fully preached</hi> the Gospel. And
this is the sense of the word in other places of the New
Testament. You will find<note n="4" place="bottom">John 15. 11. Joh. 17. 13.</note> our Saviour himself, and his
<note n="5" place="bottom">Mat. 2. 17, 23. Luke 1. 20. Joh. 3. 29. Rom. 8. 4. 1 Joh. 1. 4. Phil. 2. 2.</note> Apostles and others applying this word to such things
as are <hi>fully Accomplished,</hi> and are <hi>become entire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</hi> And so here Christ saith he came to <hi>fulfil the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65397:181"/>
Law,</hi> the Precepts of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> dispers'd up and
down in the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
comprehended in the <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi> he came
to <hi>fulfil</hi> these not only by representing them to us Intire
and Perfect, by giving us a full and compleat account
of them, but by supplying them and filling them up
when they were diminish'd and impaired by the corrupt
Glosses of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors. So that there are <hi>no New
Commandments</hi> added by Christ, but some of the <hi>Old</hi>
ones which were corrupted, and others which were quite
taken away, are renewed and restored, and so the Body
of Commandments and Moral Precepts is perfected and
consummated. This is to <hi>fulfil:</hi> this is the plain and
obvious sense of the word, so far as I apprehend.</p>
                     <p>But others understand it thus, Christ came to <hi>fulfil</hi>
the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> to add some <hi>New Moral Precepts</hi> to it,
which were no part of the Law before, to increase the
number of the <hi>Commandments,</hi> and thus (in a sense dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from what was allowed before) <hi>to fill up the Law.</hi>
Accordingly they hold that our Saviour in the fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> is a <hi>New Lawgiver,</hi> and commands
things which were not commanded before. Christ, say
they, opposed to <hi>Moses</hi>'s Moral Precepts some New and
Contrary Precepts of his own, as about <hi>Swearing,</hi> and
<hi>Divorce,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Some</hi> of the<note n="5" place="bottom">Tertullian, Eusebius, Chrysostom <hi>who reads it [It was said to them, of old</hi>] Mat. 5. 21, 27, 33.</note>

or at least have utter'd some words which favour
it. But it is not to be denied that the <hi>Papists</hi> generally,
as also the <hi>Socinians</hi> expresly hold this. These<note n="6" place="bottom">Volkel. l. 4. C. 2. Smalc. de Divinit. Christi cap. 5. Catech. Racov. de proph. Christi mun. cap. 1.</note> latter
follow their Master <hi>Socinus,</hi> who in his <hi>Explication</hi> of
the 5<hi>th</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> interprets <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in
the foresaid Sense, and tells us that Christ's Sermon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<hi>New Precepts</hi> which never were before. Some
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65397:182"/>
                        <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> (not to mention some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
plainly assert this, and that with much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedness.
These all hold that Christ <hi>fulfil'd</hi> or <hi>perfected
the Law</hi> not only by a clearer Explication of the Precepts
of it, but by an Addition of New Precepts. And this
indeed follows on what was asserted by them before, <hi>viz.</hi>
that <hi>Christ</hi>'s Laws in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. are opposed to <hi>Moses</hi>'s.
If there be an opposition, then that is injoin'd in one
which is not in the other, then <hi>Christ</hi> added to what
was commanded by <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all this is a mistake: for the <hi>Opposition</hi> which is
observable in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. is quite of another kind. Christ
there opposeth himself to the Scribes and Pharisees, and
his Interpretation of the Law to theirs. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he speaks, <hi>Ye have heard is hath been said of the</hi>

Murder, or that a lustful Eye is a breach of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
against Adultery: and so in other instances
you miserably mistake and corrupt the Law. This is
the sense of our Saviour in this Chapter. And hence it
is plain that here is no such thing as <hi>New Precepts,</hi> or any
kind of Commands contrary to those that were given by
<hi>Moses.</hi> We do not hear Christ say, <hi>it hath been said
by Moses,</hi> or <hi>you read it in the Law,</hi> but <hi>it hath been

These wilfully mistook and depraved the Moral Law, and
our Saviour sets himself against these, and their Doctrine.
He doth not oppose one Law to another, but all that he
doth is this, he corrects and amends the Law as it was
corrupted by the Scribes and Pharisees; or rather, he
doth not correct and amend <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> but the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and takes off their false Expositions: and gives
the true and genuine sense of the Law. He acquaints

and more is forbidden than they think. And to convince
them throughly of this he proceeds to particulars, instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in some Duties which <hi>seem</hi> to be New and Proper
only to <hi>Christianity;</hi> but he acquaints them that they are
not New, but Old Commandments: and so likewise he
instances in some Actions which are unlawful under the
Gospel, and seem to have been made so first of all by
the <hi>Christian</hi> Laws: but the design of this Discourse is
to let them know that they were forbidden by <hi>Moses,</hi>

Therefore if Bloodshed be a sin, Anger is so too, and

Christ faith, <hi>ver. 28. Whosoever looketh on a woman to
lust after her, hath committed Adultery already with her
in his heart,</hi> he doth not declare this as a thing contrary

<hi>viz.</hi> that there is no such thing as the Adultery of the

know that this is a great mistake, and that he had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced

the Reason of the Law of <hi>Fringes</hi> given to the Jews,
<hi>Num.</hi> 15. 38, 39. viz. that these being constantly in

                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Swearing rashly</hi> is forbidden here by <hi>Christ,</hi> and so
it was by the <hi>Third Commandment.</hi> But this (as well as
the other) was misinterpreted by the Scribes and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and not understood in its full Extent. Whereupon
our Saviour corrects their mistakes, saying, <hi>Swear not at
all, neither by Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 34. As much as if he
had said, you make nothing of Swearing by <hi>Heaven,</hi>
and by the <hi>Earth,</hi> and by <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and by your <hi>Heads,</hi>
and this is a very common and frequent thing with you;
and you are perswaded that you act not amiss in doing
thus, for you think that the Commandment forbids only
<hi>False Swearing</hi> and <hi>Perjury:</hi> you have been told that
these are the only breach of that part of the Law. But
I tell you another thing, that Law forbids not only <hi>False</hi>
but <hi>Rash Swearing;</hi> you violate that Commandment as
often as you use any vain and unnecessary Oaths, as often
as you prophanely swear by <hi>God</hi>'s Name, as often as you
make use of <hi>other</hi> Names besides <hi>God</hi>'s to swear by, as
often as you swear by <hi>Heaven,</hi> or by the <hi>Earth,</hi> &amp;c.
This is the true meaning of our Saviour here. Some
have thought that <hi>all Swearing</hi> is forbid in this place by
Christ, as unlawful under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> altho it was lawful
to Swear under the <hi>Law:</hi> but if you consider that it is a
Religious Act, and is innocent and harmless in its own
nature, and sometimes becomes necessary (as in matters
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65397:184"/>
of Controversie which can't otherwise be decided) and is
an Act of Charity and Righteousness (when it is for the
real advantage of the Community, or any of our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Brethren, and sometimes it is) and is approved of
by the Example of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the New Testament, you
will be induced to believe that Religious Swearing is
lawful even under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and that there is no New
Law given by Christ to forbid it now. That which he
forbids is Unnecessary and Prophane Swearing; yea
moreover, he commands you to avoid all Swearing in
common intercourse and converse one with another, and
as much as lies in them to abstain wholly from an Oath.
He would have them to be Persons of so holy and strict
lives, of such integtity and faithfulness, that no one should
have occasion to require an Oath of them, but that they
might be credited upon their bare Words and Promises.
He would have them shew such Truth and Honesty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Men, that Swearing might become useless. This
is the true meaning of our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>That a Man should not put away his Wife unless
for Fornication or Adultery,</hi> is a Law of Christ, and yet
is no New Law, but an Old one Restored and Renewed
by him. This Law was corrupted by the Jews, which
<hi>Malachi</hi> takes notice of, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. and he
brings them back to the Primitive Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> Chap.
4. ver. 4. So that our Saviour doth the same which the
Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> did before. And as to the Law of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
in <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 1. it was rather a <hi>Permission</hi> than a
<hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Law:</hi> and so saith Christ, <hi>Moses suffer'd you
for the hardness of your hearts to put away your wives, but
from the beginning it was not so,</hi> Mat. 19. 8. This way of
divorcing among the Jews was unlawful, being against
the Institution of God in the <hi>beginning,</hi> Gen. 2. 24. <hi>They
two shall be one flesh.</hi> But it was tolerated to avoid a
greater Evil among that People, <hi>viz.</hi> that curst Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
might not use their Wives inhumanely: It was for
the sake of the Women that this was permitted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65397:184"/>
it is clear that Christ doth not correct or alter the
Law, but only removes the false Interpretations which
were made of it. That Matrimony cannot be dissolv'd,
is a <hi>Christian Law,</hi> and it was also a <hi>Mosaick</hi> one.</p>

stretched this even to the patronizing of <hi>private Revenge,</hi>
and returning Evil for Evil among themselves. This is
that which our Lord here complains of, as a gross per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
of the sense of the Law: and he peremptorily
commands his Followers that <hi>they resist not evil, that if

not so. Mark therefore our Saviour's words, <hi>Ye have
heard that it hath been said,</hi> viz. <hi>by them of Old, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thy enemy,</hi> ver. 43.
Whence it is evident, that Christ both here and in the
verses before mentioned, speaks not of what <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

the <hi>Law</hi> it self said, but of what the corrupt <hi>Doctors</hi> and
<hi>Scribes</hi> said. For tho <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>Thou shalt love thy
neighbour,</hi> Lev. 19. 18. yet he no where saith, <hi>Thou shalt
hate thy enemy.</hi> Therefore we may conclude, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Christ uttereth these words in this Chapter, <hi>It hath
been said by them of old time,</hi> he understands not <hi>Moses</hi>
and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> but the perverse Teachers among the
<hi>Iews</hi> who falsly expounded them. <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law bid
them love their Neighbours, but it was their own false
Inference that they should hate their Enemies, <hi>I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

what was the Duty even of those who lived under <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s
Laws) <hi>Love your Enemies, do good to them that hate
you,</hi> ver. 44. That this was a Duty before Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the doing of these things were kindnesses to the Beasts,
yet they were also offices of kindness to the Persons who

Friend or Fo, Native or Alien: every one is thy <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

that these words of <hi>Moses</hi> are to be taken thus largely, is
manifest from what he saith in <hi>Deut. 23. 7. Thou shalt
not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy Brother:</hi> nay, it is

If any <hi>City made answer to them of Peace,</hi> and <hi>opened to
them,</hi> they were to make Peace with them. But some
say that this was the manner of the <hi>Israelites</hi> treating the
Nations a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

difference which was to be made between them is set
down in <hi>ver. 15, 16. Thus shalt thou do to all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which are very far off, but of the Cities of these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth.</hi> Here
it seems to be said that tho the <hi>Distant Nations</hi> were to
be favourably used, and admitted to Terms of Peace, yet
the Cities of <hi>Canaan</hi> and others which were near, were
to be denied that favour, and to be utterly cut off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mercy. But these apprehensions arise from the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying
of those words, <hi>thus shalt thou do,</hi> which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
refer to what immediately went before, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>when God hath delivered a City into their hands, they
shall smite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Women and the little Ones, and the Cattel. Thus
shall they do unto them.</hi> But when they came to any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Seven Nations,</hi> they were to deal otherwise,
they were to spare neither Man nor Woman, Old or
Young, but utterly to destroy all. Here lies the Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
this was the grand difference which was to be made
between their dealing with the <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap> Nations</hi> and with
the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> This is all the distinction that they
were to make between the one and the other. Whereas
the one is to be spared in some sort, thou shalt shew no

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uch favour to the other: thou shalt devote them to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Destruction. But it is not said, thou shalt not offer
Peace to them first, thou shalt fall upon them without
any warning. No: the contrary is said, <hi>When thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
nigh to a City to fight against it, then proclaim
Peace unto it:</hi> which kind Tender reacheth not only to
the Cities of the <hi>Nations afar off,</hi> but to those which
were <hi>nearer.</hi> This may be gather'd from other places,
as <hi>Ios. 11. 19. There was not a City which made Peace
with the Children of Israel save the Hivite, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eon: all others they took in battel.</hi> Which
implies that Peace was offer'd to them all, and that their
Refusal was the cause of their Ruin: for it would be
ridiculous and impertinent (as I apprehend) to register
this, that <hi>no Cities made Peace,</hi> when they could not
make Peace if they had had a mind to it.</p>
                     <p>As to the Instance of the <hi>Gibeonites, Ioshua</hi> was faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in making Peace with them <hi>rashly, without enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
who they were, and whence.</hi> But as to <hi>the thing it
self,</hi> he was not faulty, for they had leave to make Peace
not only with the People that were remote (and such
they took these to be) but with the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> But
these <hi>Gibe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nites</hi> had heard that they were to be most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
dealt with, that they were to be utterly destroy'd
upon refusal; therefore they seign'd themselves to be of
the remoter Nations. What can be more evident than
this, that the Command of destroying the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
was not <hi>Absolute</hi> but <hi>Conditional,</hi> seeing the Oath made
to the <hi>Gibe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nites</hi> (who were <hi>Canaanites</hi>) was lawful?
which may be proved from this, that God was angry,
with <hi>Saul</hi> for the violation of this Oath several years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now, if it was lawful to swear to the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>
(tho it was extorted by fraud and dissembling) that they
should be spared, then it follows that there was no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from God to destroy them, without offering Peace
and Mercy to them. We read also that <hi>Rahab</hi> requested
of the Spies that she might be spared; and they would
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:65397:187"/>
not have sworn to her that they would <hi>Save her and
her Fathers house alive</hi> (as they did, <hi>Ios. 2. 12.) if they</hi>
had known that there was no mercy to be shew'd to the
<hi>Canaanites:</hi> but it is plain that they were apprehensive of
the contrary, and so engaged to spare <hi>Rahab</hi> and her Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
And if the whole People of <hi>Ierich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> had humbly
requested the same Boon, they might have obtain'd it,
for the <hi>Israelites</hi> were not bid to destroy any People
unless they were obstinate and refractory. On such
considerations as these<note n="1" place="bottom">Maimonides, <hi>quoted by</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> de Jure Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. &amp; Gent. l. 6. c. 13.</note> One of the most Judicious and
Discerning Writers among the <hi>Iews,</hi> declares it to be
his Opinion that the <hi>Seven N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>tions</hi> had offers of Peace,
on condition they would surrender themselves.</p>
                     <p>Again, that Clause (which contains the <hi>Second Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
offer'd to all Cities) belonged to the <hi>Seven Nations</hi>
as well as to the rest, <hi>viz. All the People that is found
therein shall be Tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve
thee,</hi> ver. 11. of Deut. 20. If the <hi>Canaanites</hi> would
have owned the <hi>Israelites</hi> for their Lords and Masters,
they might have escaped Destruction. Which is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of those words in <hi>Ios. 16. 10. They drave not
out the Canaanite that dwelt in G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>zer, but the Canaanite
dwelleth among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serveth
under Tribute.</hi> And the same you read in <hi>Iosh.</hi> 17. 13.
&amp; <hi>Iudg.</hi> 1. 29, 30. The <hi>Third Condition</hi> was this, the
<hi>Iews</hi> might make Peace with the Seven Nations if they
would turn to the True God of <hi>Israel</hi> from their <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
as appears from <hi>Deut. 7. 3, 4. Thou shalt make
no Marriages with them, thy Daughter thou shalt not give
to his Son, nor his Daughter shalt thou take unto thy Son,</hi>
(which by the by, you may observe, supposes that they
should not all be destroyed) <hi>for they will turn away thy
Son from following me, that they may serve other Gods.</hi>
                        <pb n="358" facs="tcp:65397:188"/>
This is given as the Reason here and in other places why
those Nations were to be destroyed, <hi>viz.</hi> because of their
abominable Idolatry, and that they might not Corrupt
and Infect the People of God. Therefore the <hi>Israelites</hi>
are often forbid to<note n="2" place="bottom">Exod. 23. 32. &amp; 34. 12, 15. Deut. 7. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>make a Covenant with them,</hi> which
signifies to hold Correspondence with them in <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to
make such a League and Alliance with them as to suffer
them to use their Altars and Images, and freely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
them in their former Abominations.</p>
                     <p>The short then is, that <hi>Conditions of Peace</hi> were offer'd
to all the Nations foreign and near, their Lives were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them if they would ask them: they might be spared
if they would become Tributary: they were not to be
cut off if they would turn from their Idolatry to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, and embrace the Jewish Religion, or (as the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> tell us) keep the Precepts of the Sons of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.</hi>
But the Israelites had a Commission to fight all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that refused these Conditions, they had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lay them either with a universal Slaughter,
<hi>viz,</hi> the <hi>Seven Nations</hi> and the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> or only to
destroy the males, as they did to the other Nations.
Now if this be the Truth of the Case, if the <hi>Israelites</hi>
were willing to make Peace with All, both <hi>Canaanites</hi>
and Foreigners (as I have endeavour'd to evince, and
as several<note n="3" place="bottom">Maimonides, Junius, Grotius.</note> Learned Men have asserted) then the <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
which is pretended to be drawn from the Practice of
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and from the very Command of God,
falls to the ground, and is of no value and weight:
then it appears that the <hi>Israelites</hi> were not bid to <hi>hate
their Enemies,</hi> but that they were to <hi>love them,</hi> for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Conditions of Peace was a Sign and Token of
Love.</p>
                     <p>But suppose I have not sufficiently proved what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:65397:188"/>
(which I refer to the Judicious); suppose the
<hi>seven Nations</hi> had no Terms of <hi>Peace</hi> offer'd them, but
they were utterly abolished; yet then I see not how
this any ways invalidateth my former Assertion, for
they might be commanded to <hi>kill</hi> all the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and
yet not be commanded to <hi>hate</hi> them: nor doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from their killing them, that they bore a hatred to
them. Judges and Executioners punish Malefactors
with Death, but without Hatred and Malice; or they
ought to do so at least.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Answer</hi> will serve to take off other <hi>Objections</hi>
which are made, as that from the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
where you read that all Persons who <hi>inticed others to
Idolatry, were to be put to death,</hi> and the nearest Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Friend <hi>was not to be pitied or spared.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if no kindness was to be shew'd to Kindred and
near Relatives in this case, much less was there any to
be extended to <hi>Enemies,</hi> and consequently it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to <hi>hate them.</hi> And from the <hi>Law of Retaliation</hi>
they would argue after the same manner, <hi>viz.</hi> that God
commanded the <hi>Iews</hi> to hate those who wronged and
hurted them; for if they were bid to punish them, they
were bid to hate them, the greater containing in it the
lesser. But the answer to these Cavils is the same which
I gave before: the <hi>Iews</hi> might prosecute Offenders, and
the Magistrate punish them, and both might and ought
to be done with commiseration and love, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
without hatred. Indeed they were <hi>not to pity
them,</hi> i. e. so as to let them go unpunish'd, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that they might have a brotherly compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
toward their Souls. So we at this day are bound,
by Law and Conscience, to prosecute Malefactors, and
to cause them to receive condign Punishment; yet all
this may be done without hatred, and it is a wonder
that the <hi>Object<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rs</hi> have not seen it.</p>
                     <p>Others make use of those words of <hi>David, Do not I
hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? I hate them with
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65397:189"/>
perfect hatred,</hi> Psal. 139. 21, 22. Therefore, say they,
<hi>hating of Enemies</hi> was lawful under the Old Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law; and by consequence when Christ bids
us <hi>love our Enemies,</hi> he gives a <hi>New Law.</hi> I answer
briefly, that <hi>David</hi>'s hating of the Wicked is meant,
1. of his hating their Company and Conversation;
therefore he frequently declareth how loathing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
it was to him to associate with them. 2. Of
his hatred of their Vices, not of their Persons. Their
ways and actions he perfectly abhorred, but you hear
him sometimes praying for their Conversion, which
sheweth that he had no Enmity, either against their
Souls or Bodies, but loved both. And indeed if we
must love our very Enemies, it follows by natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that we ought to pray for them, and wish
them well; therefore it is added here by Christ, <hi>Ver. 44.
Pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute
you.</hi> These are not New Injunctions, but were obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
under <hi>Moses,</hi> and are indeed part of the <hi>Moral
Law.</hi> Thus I have shew'd, that even under the Law
<hi>hating their Enemies,</hi> i. e. their Persons, was not lawful,
but on the contrary, they were bound to <hi>love them:</hi>
and consequently Christ's Command concerning <hi>loving
of Enemies,</hi> is not added as a New Precept to those of
<hi>Moses.</hi> We must hate no Man <hi>now,</hi> and it was sinful
to do so <hi>then. Vniversal Charity</hi> was a Law even at
that time. In a word, it appears that <hi>Christ came not
to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it,</hi> because he establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and confirmed <hi>this Catholick Love,</hi> which is call'd
by the Apostle <hi>the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13. 9.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have insisted on the Particulars mentioned by
our Saviour in this Chapter, and you may be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
convinced thence, that <hi>Christ</hi>'s words here are
not oppofed to <hi>Moses</hi>'s, that he doth command no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
contrary to the <hi>Law,</hi> but that he vindicated the
Law from the false and corrupt Glosses of the <hi>Pharisees;</hi>
you may be convinced, that Christ is here no New Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65397:189"/>
but an Interpreter of the Old Law; that he
only explaineth and cleareth it, and more fully deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to the World, and consequently that the Precepts
of the <hi>Gospel</hi> are the same in substance with the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue;</hi>
that Christ enjoineth no New Virtue, as to the
kind of it, that he hath made no addition of New Laws
and Precepts to the Old ones, unless in those respects
which I have before mentioned: and on the account of
them it is, that <hi>the Legal and Evangelical Dispensation</hi>
differ so much.</p>
                     <p>Being now employed in shewing the <hi>Difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Old Dispensations before Christ, and that
which he introduced; I cannot finish what I intend,
unless I particularly handle that noted <hi>Question, What is
the difference between the Covenant of Works, and the
Covenant of Grace; or between the Old and New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and why they are called so?</hi> I have said something
already which may give light to this, but now I will
purposely insist upon it. Indeed the Discourse of the
<hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

some things which I have mention'd since, and
I must have treated of the <hi>Evangelical Dispensation</hi> long

most proper to treat of the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to shew the true difference between them.</p>
                     <p>We must call to mind then what I said before, that
God covenanted with Man: 1. When he was in the
State of Innocence. 2. When he was fallen. The
former was <hi>the Covenant of W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Covenant of Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ce.</hi> As to the first, it was properly a
<hi>Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> for a <hi>Covenant</hi> is a mutual Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65397:190"/>
Party and Party, with reciprocal Obligations of
each other. So that Covenant was a Contract between
God and <hi>Adam</hi> (and in him with all Mankind,)
wherein God promised Everlasting Life and Happiness
to Man, if he continued in his Obedience to him. And
Man (having a sufficient Ability given him by God)
ingaged on his part to perform perfect Obedience, and
to persevere in all good Works without sinning, whence
it was call'd <hi>the Covenant of Works.</hi> Upon this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
God gave <hi>Adam</hi> a particular Commandment (as
a trial of his Obedience) that he should abstain from
the Fruit of a certain <hi>Tree</hi> in the Garden where God
had placed him. But <hi>Adam</hi> soon broke this Covenant
by eating the forbidden Fruit, and so brought a Curse
on himself and all his Posterity.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the First Convenant, or Covenant of Works,
was succeeded by a Second, <hi>viz. the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
This is that Covenant which God made with <hi>Adam</hi>
and his Posterity just after his Fall, when they were in a
state of Sin and Misery. Christ was promised forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;
<hi>the Seed of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Woman shall break the Serpent's
Head,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. As soon as this Promise was given
and made, the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> expired, then began
the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and so was in succeeding Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
more and more revealed, till Christ came and
fully revealed it. This is called the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi>
(as hath been said before) because it proceeded from
mere Grace and Favour, and because a more abundant
Grace and Love are discovered in this Covenant for
Man's restoring, than in the other for preserving him.</p>
                     <p>Now a Covenant being a mutual Contract and Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of both Parties (as hath been suggested) this
Covenant as well as the other, was made up of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on God's part, and something on ours. As God
is tied to Man, so Man is tied to God. God promised
to send his Son to take our Nature, and to make known
to us the Will of his Father (thus he is a <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </hi>), and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65397:190"/>
also to satisfy God for our Sins, and by this means to
redeem us from Hell and Eternal Damnation, and to
obtain for us forgiveness of Sins, and the favour of God,
and Eternal Life and Blessedness. Sinners are justified,
pardoned, and restored to what they lost by <hi>

they are reinstated in the Right and Privilege they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Apostacy. This is done by Chrrist's Death;
thus he is our Priest, he offers himself a Sacrifice for
our Sins. Further, he inables us to discharge our Duty,
by sending his Holy Spirit into our Hearts; he rules and
governs us, and so is our King. This is the Covenant
on God's part. On ours it is to hearken diligently to
our Prophet, and to be desirous and ready to learn his
Will; to accept of, rely upon, and apply unto our
selves the meritorious Satisfaction of our Priest; and to
be ruled by him as our King, to submit to him, and to
obey his Laws; which briefly are these, that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
his Soveraignty over us, that we believe in
him, and that we repent and forsake our Sins. These
are the Conditions of the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> on Man's
part. Or take the whole in a briefer way thus, To
give <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to believe and repent, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Acts of Holiness, is the New Covenant on <hi>God</hi>'s
part: But <hi>personally</hi> to do these (by virtue of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Power) is the New Covenant on <hi>Man</hi>'s part, which
yet God alone can make effectual.</p>
                     <p>It is said by some, that Faith and Obedience are not
the Conditions of this Covenant on Man's part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are promised in the Covenant; for the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant must be a distinct thing from the
Covenant. But this is a mere Nicety, for tho in the

to do them, they are rightly stiled, and really are

                        </hi> of Faith

<hi>freeness of the Gospel-Grace</hi> (as is objected,) for God
promised pardon of Sin and Eternal Life <hi>freely;</hi> and it
is the same <hi>free Grace</hi> which first appointed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
accepteth of these Conditions. It is mere Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Good-will that God was pleased to give Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Everlasting Happiness by Christ, on condition
of believing and obeying him.</p>
                     <p>But you will say, it is the Language of <hi>the Covenant
of Works, Do this, and live;</hi> whereas the Gospel saith,
<hi>Believe, and be saved.</hi> I answer, The Covenant of
Grace (as well as the Covenant of Works) requires
<hi>doing,</hi> and so in effect saith, <hi>Do this, and live:</hi> But yet
there is this threefold difference between them, (which I
request may be well weigh'd, because it will be of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

use to rectify our Notions about the matter in
hand, and to give us a true insight into the <hi>Nature of
the Covenants.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>1. The Covenant of Works saith, <hi>Do this</hi> by thy
own natural strength and power; and if thou dost so,
thou shalt <hi>live.</hi> For this is certain, that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he <hi>First
Covenant</hi> the Conditions were to be performed by <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve</hi> (and us in them) by a natural Strength given
in the state of Innocency. They were created with a
sufficient Power to do what God required of them: By
their own Free-Will they might have stood. But the
Covenant of Grace saith, <hi>Do this</hi> by a supernatural As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
by that Grace which is given through Christ
Jesus. No Man is naturally born with an ability to do
God's Will, and to please him. There is a new Birth
whereby he is impowred to do this; there is a Divine
Principle superadded to his Nature, and by virtue of this
he believeth, repenteth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the first diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65397:191"/>
between the <hi>doing</hi> under the Covenant of Works,
and under the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>2. The Covenant of Works saith, <hi>Do this,</hi> and <hi>for
doing</hi> thou shalt <hi>live:</hi> But the Covenant of Grace saith,
<hi>Do this,</hi> and for <hi>Christ's Merits and Satisfaction</hi> thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall be accepted of God; for <hi>his</hi> sake thou shalt <hi>liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi>
and be happy. There is another Cause, you see, <hi>viz.</hi>
the meritorious Righteousness of the Son of God, which
makes an infinite difference between the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This we must remember, that the Covenant of
Grace is that whereby Man is recovered and restored to
happiness by the undertakings of <hi>another;</hi> whereas by
virtue of the Covenant of Works, a Man attain'd to
Life and Happiness by his <hi>own</hi> Works and Obedience.
His personal Righteousness entitled him to Heaven by the
tenour of the first Compact; but now the terms are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
that which procures Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>believing</hi> is the principal thing under the New Covenant,
and therefore we find this chiefly urged by our Saviour

we find in the Evangelical Writings, that both Faith

the Benefits of the Gospel-Covenant? Doth it not

God hath appointed, that none shall reap this
Fruit of the Covenant of Grace, unless they first believe
and repent. This is a fix'd and establish'd Order, and
without observing and performing of this latter, we
shall never have any Advantage of the former. It is
evident then, that believing, and repenting are Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

Duties required of us in order to the participation and
enjoyment of the full end of the Covenant, it is the
Truth that is asserted,</hi> i. e. they are properly conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And thus in some respect the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi>
may be said to be a Covenant of Works, i. e. so far as
it requires certain <hi>Conditions</hi> to be performed by us,
tho not in the same manner that the Covenant of Works
required them; for they are not to be look'd upon as a
meritorious and impulsive Cause, as they were then,
but only as an Instrument or Means in order to Eternal
Happiness. But otherwise (as hath been said) there is
a <hi>vast difference</hi> between the Covenant of Works and of
Grace; for the tenour of the former was, that our First
Parents, and in them all Mankind, should, without the
least defect and transgression, perform the Law which
God gave them; and that upon the sole account of this
performance they should purchase Happiness: But if they
were deficient in their Duty, they should perish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any hope of Mercy. There was no provision of
Forgiveness in case they should break God's Law; there
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65397:193"/>
was no promise of being receiv'd into God's Favour
again. But the terms of the latter were, that God
would not be exact with us, and require an Obedience
void of all sin; but that for the worth of Christ's sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Obedience, for the value of his perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we should be rewarded with Life and Bliss. And
this Covenant allows of hearty Repentance, after we
have transgress'd the Divine Law, and assures us that we
shall be reconciled unto God, and be restored to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
For the sake of our Blessed Mediator, our Sins
and Failings shall be forgiven us, if we sincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of them, and betake our selves to the practice of
the contrary Duties. This is the way and method of
Salvation under this Covenant: Instead of exact Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<hi>i. e.</hi> wholly living without Sin, God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of our doing according to the utmost of our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and our acting with sincerity and uprightness:
And the defect of this personal Righteousness and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
is supplied by the meritorious Righteousness and
Obedience of Christ Jesus. Thus you see how these
two Covenants differ, and that they answer to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
states of Man's <hi>Innocence,</hi> and of his <hi>Fall;</hi> and
that the Second Covenant was made, because we cannot
observe the strict Conditions of the First.</p>

the Book of the Covenant, and read it in the ears of the
people,</hi> Exod. 24. 7. which refers to <hi>all the words of the
Lord which</hi> Moses <hi>wrote,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>i. e.</hi> all those Laws,
Precepts and Judgments which God gave to the People,
and which they unanimously accepted of, and promis'd
Obedience to. But the <hi>Decalogue</hi> was the Sum of this
Covenant, as appears from <hi>Deut. 4. 13. God declared
to you his Covenant, which he commanded you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
even ten Commandments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some hold that this Covenant made with the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
was the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> the same as to the
main which was made with <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall. I
grant there was a kind of a <hi>going back</hi> (as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
before) a seeming reviving of the <hi>Old Covenant
of Works;</hi> and so the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> was, as it
were, <hi>after the Covenant of Grace;</hi> or rather the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace and Works seem'd to be at the same
time. But this was not so in reality, but only in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance:
There was an Evangelical Promise to <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Abraham,</hi> viz. that they should be justified by the
<hi>Messias;</hi> and there was a Promise also to the <hi>Iews,</hi> that
they should <hi>live,</hi> i. e. be saved, if they performed the
Law. But these two Promises were not inconsistent,
neither did the latter of these abrogate the former, as
the Apostle speaketh in <hi>Gal. 3. 17. The Covenant of
Grace, which was confirmed before of God in Christ, the
Law, which was four hundred and thirty years after,
could not disannul, that it should make the Promise</hi> (or
Covenant) <hi>of none effect.</hi> But, as the Apostle sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins,
<hi>The Law</hi> (which look'd something like the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works) <hi>was added to it because of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
until the Blessed Seed should come,</hi> ver. 19.
The Law was to be serviceable to the Covenant of Grace,
and to be a Schoolmaster to bring them to Christ.
Hereby they were to be convinced of Sin, and of their
inability to keep the Commandments. And the same
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65397:194"/>
Law denouncing Wrath and a Curse, stir'd men up to
fly to Divine Mercy, and to beg Forgiveness, and the
Assistance of the Spirit, and so prepar'd them for the
Gospel. God gave that People Precepts about Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Rites of Divine Worship, and also Judicial Laws
for their Commonwealth: And besides these, he writ
in Tables the Moral Law, and caused it to be promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
All which he closed with those solemn Sanctions,
<hi>This do, and live: and cursed is every one that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
not in all things that are written.</hi> Here was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great resemblance of the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and
the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> seemed to be laid aside: Or there
might seem to be <hi>two Covenants</hi> on foot together. But
the Design of Heaven was only this, that hereby the
<hi>Iews</hi> might be brought to see their great Guilt and
their deplorable State, that they might be sensible that
they lay under Wrath and a Curse, and that thence
they might be provoked to look for a Remedy; or,
when it was of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed to them, to accept of it. This
was the Reason why they were <hi>under the Law,</hi> which
had some affinity with the <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi> But
the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> made with <hi>Adam</hi> soon after his
Fall was not laid aside, but still prevailed, and no other
but that. Even under the <hi>Law</hi> they were not justified
by Works, but by Faith; they obtain'd not Salvation
by their own perfect Obedience, but by virtue of the
perfect Righteousness of the <hi>Messias</hi> who was to come
in the fulness of time. It only seem'd good to the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
God to obscure and disguise this <hi>Covenant</hi> in part,
that they might be fitted for the insuing Dispensation of
the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and that this Dispensation might appear
more bright and glorious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now</hi> it was that the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> most signally
display'd it self: By Christ's coming, and by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel, it was fully and amply manifested,
tho it had been in being ever since the Restauration of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65397:195"/>
                        <hi>Adam.</hi> Now at last the actual fulfilling of the Grand
Promise of this Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the Incarnation of
Christ, was accomplished. He came on purpose to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that Covenant which had been made and renew'd
before between God and Man. Never till this time was
there any compleat discovery of this blessed Agreement
and Contract between God and us. In the Writings of
the <hi>New Testament</hi> alone we find this set forth. Here is
plainly discover'd the Mediator of this Covenant, <hi>Iesus
Christ</hi> the Righteous, the Eternal and only begotten Son
of God, who vouchsafed to assume our Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to clothe himself with Flesh, to converse in the
World above thirty Years, to instruct Mankind by his
Heavenly Doctrine, to confirm and establish us in it by
his Divine Miracles, to direct us to the practice of it by
his Holy Life and Spotless Example, and at length to
die for us to satisfy for our Sins. As the publick and
most solemn Covenants which we read of in the<note n="1" place="bottom">Gen. 21. 27. Exod. 24. 6, 7, 8.</note> Old
Testament, were made with killing and sacrificing, and
effusion of Blood, (by Divine Appointment without
doubt): So here the Blessed <hi>Messias,</hi> who was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> shed on the Cross his most
precious Blood, which therefore is call'd<note n="2" place="bottom">Heb. 10. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>the Blood of
the Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, in the Scriptures of the New Testament,
are plainly and expresly set forth the <hi>Terms</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> what God hath promised to do,
and what Obligations are upon us. Here Christ and
his Apostles, and Evangelists, proclaim Remission of
Sins, the peculiar Benefit and Privilege of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace; and Immortality and Eternal Life are
brought to light by this Gospel; and the performance of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65397:195"/>
all the precious Promises which concern this Life and
another, is ascertain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d to us here. And as it assureth us
that God will fulfil his Promises, so it urgeth upon us
the performing of our Ingagements. Christianity is
an Obligatory Covenant, and this Obligation is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.
God will discharge his part, we must see that we
perform the Conditions which are required on our side.
The Gospel acquainteth us, that if our Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
be not made, it is our own fault wholly;
we will not leave our Sins, and thereby we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rustrate the
Agreement and Contract of the Gospel. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
calls upon us to undertake the Counter-part of the
Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be holy in all manner of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to deny all Ungodliness and wordly Lusts, and to
live Soberly, Righteously, and Godlily in this present
World; to adorn the Gospel by a strict and circumspect
walking, and to bring forth much Fruit to the Glory of
our Heavenly Father. In the Evangelical Writings the

the Nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the peculiar Virtue of it
are explain'd in that manner which they were never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
for that by <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> we are saved, but
that by <hi>Faith alone</hi> we are <hi>justified,</hi> is the Doctrine

and it is establish'd by the other Apostles:
which shews the great discrimination between the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works, and the Covenant of Grace. The

Covenant and Law of Grace; it ascertains us that we

of Mankind, and was pleased to make <hi>a Second
Covenant</hi> with him and his Posterity after they had
broke the <hi>First.</hi> This Second Covenant, tho it was
made with <hi>Adam</hi> presently after his Fall, yet it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
not to its height and perfection till the coming

                     <p>The Answer then to that Problem, <hi>How the Old and
the New Covenant differ?</hi> is easily resolved from the
Premises: for if you understand (as some do, but how
fitly you will judg from what I shall suggest by and
by) by the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> the Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi>
and by the <hi>New</hi> one the Covenant of <hi>Grace;</hi> I have
plainly and distinctly set down the Particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they differ. Or, if you mean by the <hi>Old Covenant</hi>
the <hi>Mosaical</hi> and Legal Dispensation, and by the <hi>New
Covenant</hi> the Dispensation of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> (which both
are but <hi>One Covenant</hi>) I have given ample Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Question, by shewing wherein these two
differ; and by letting you see that the Covenant of
Grace <hi>began</hi> with Mankind soon after the Fall, and
afterward was continued in the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Dispensation,
and at last was compleated by <hi>Christ</hi>'s coming.</p>

                        <pb n="375" facs="tcp:65397:196"/>And here further to illustrate the Point, I will clear
the Acception of these Terms, <hi>the Old</hi> and <hi>the New
Covenant,</hi> which so frequently occur in Holy Writ;
and I will make it evident to you, that in the whole
Book of the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ures, the Old Covenant is never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> but is a part or degree
of the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> This then we are to know,
that the Covenant of Grace is twofold, <hi>Obscure</hi> or
<hi>Manifest.</hi> The first was from <hi>Adam</hi>'s Restauration to
our Saviour's coming; the second is ever since. The
former is called the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> the latter the <hi>New
Covenant,</hi> and yet they are but one Covenant. This
you will find to be the stile of Sacred Scripture, if you
consult those two famous places, the one in the Old
Testament, and the other in the New, which treat of
the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Covenant.</hi> The former is <hi>Iew.</hi> 31.

a <hi>better Covenant,</hi> tho it be the very <hi>same</hi> as to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
The Apostle proceeds, <hi>Vers. 7, 8. If the first

but the same in other Circumstances. For the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

varied as to some respects when Christ came, it is
represented as a <hi>Double Covenant,</hi> and accordingly

in so much that the latter is <hi>eminently</hi>

                        </gap>ore they are but
One Covenant. This is the truest Notion of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
tho some of the Antient Writers, but more
of the Moderns, have mistaken this Point, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi>
and making them to be the same, which hath been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with very gross Errors. For tho it is true,
the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> may be call'd the <hi>Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
because it was first, yet we now confine our selves
to the stile of the Holy Scriptures, and are declaring what
is call'd the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> in the Language of those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Writers; and there you will never find it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> but always to the
<hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> under the Old Dispensations: and
the New Covenant always refers to that Covenant, as
it was renewed and made better by the <hi>Evangelical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi>
And because the Covenant of Grace under
<hi>Moses</hi> was dark and imperfect, but when Christ
came was clear and entire, therefore the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
them as two distinct Covenant, a <hi>First</hi> and
a <hi>Second,</hi> a <hi>worse</hi> and a <hi>better.</hi> Thus you have the

                     <argument>
                        <p>Tho we could assign no Reason why the Christian
Oeconomy was so late, and why our Saviour
arrived no sooner in the World, this is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to satisfie us, that it was God's Pleasure it
should be so. But for the sake of the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
such Reasons and Considerations as these
are offer'd: 1. It must be remembred that
Christ appear'd in the World even in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
times of the Patriarchs. 2. The Benefits of
Christ's Redemption were imparted to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
before he actually appear'd in the flesh. 3.
The World was not fit to receive him sooner.
4. He delay'd his Coming to make the World
sensible of their Misery. 5. That the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of his Coming might be prized. 6. It
was congruous that so great a Prince should not
arrive without solemn Harbingers and Heralds
of his Coming. 7. The necessities of Mankind
call'd for him at that particular time and junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
when he came. The Jewish Church grew
worse and worse. An enumeration of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sects and Factions which they were divided
into, viz. Essenes, Pharisees, Sadduees,
Herodians, Samaritans, Galilaeans. 8. God
proceedeth in a gradual Order and Method. The
most perfect things are reserved till the last.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>II. I Am to acquaint you with the Reasons why the
<hi>Christian Dispensation,</hi> as to the actual exerting of
it, took not place in the World before, and (which is the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65397:199"/>
foundation of this) why <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> the <hi>Messias</hi> and
<hi>Saviour</hi> blessed not Mankind with his Coming till that
precise time wherein we are certified by the Evangelical
Records and other Testimonies that he was born, and
why he came neither sooner nor later. Indeed I might
say here (as before) that we are to rest satisfied with God's
managing this matter, altho we were not able to assign
a particular Reason. The Wisdom and Equity of God's
dealing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> are undeniable: He must be le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t to dispense his
Benefits when he pleaseth: and most certainly that is the
best time which he chooseth. <hi>It is the Glory of God</hi> (saith
the<note n="1" place="bottom">Prov. 25. 2.</note> Wife Man) <hi>to conceal a thing,</hi> to hide the Causes
and Reasons of his Actions from Men, especially of the
particular circumstance of <hi>Time,</hi> which is not of such
Concern to us as the Things themselves. Therefore we
ought not to be very inquisitive and scrupulous, but
finally to resolve all into God's good Will and Pleasure.
Thus when the Primitive Christians were asked in a cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
way by the Pagans, why Christ came so late, they
ingenuously answer'd,<note n="2" place="bottom">Non imus in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <q>We deny not that we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the Reason of it: we cannot see and tell
God's secret Will, and how he orders his Affairs. He
alone knoweth <hi>What</hi> is to be done, and <hi>How,</hi> and at
<hi>what Time.</hi>
                        </q> And again, thus <q>In an Eternal and
Infinite course of Ages, where there is no beginning
nor end, nothing can be said to be soon or late.</q> And
St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Answer to those that ask'd why <hi>Christ</hi>
came not before, was this, <q>
                           <note n="3" place="bottom">Quia nondum venerat plenitudo temporis, moderante illo per quem facta <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65397:199"/>
appointment of Him by whom all Times are: for it
was best known to him when Christ ought to come.</q>
And in another place he gives the like Reason, why
Christ came just at that time, and no other,<note n="4" place="bottom">Novit quidem Dominus quid quando faciat, qui in mensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(for so it should be rendred) <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 3. When <hi>these</hi>

And many of the <hi>Fathers</hi> were of opinion that Christ

Chap. 3. 25. <hi>the Form of the fourth Person</hi> (who was

by some of the <hi>Eternal Son of God,</hi> who used
to visit the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and now visibly bore the <hi>three
Children</hi> company in the Flames. And from several
other places in the Old Testament it may be gather'd
that <hi>Christ</hi> appear'd to the Holy Men in those days upon
extraordinary occasions. So then he appeared sooner
than is imagined: his Incarnation was not the first time
of his Appearance in the World: he actually manifested
and shew'd himself before his Birth. His early visiting
of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> was a Forerunner of his
more signal Appearing in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2. If you consider that all the <hi>Benefits</hi> which accrued

to Mankind by a <hi>Saviour,</hi> were imparted even before
Christ was made Flesh, you will not think that his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in the World was late. He (as you have heard)
was the Lamb slain from the beginning of the World.
The Covenant of Grace, that he who repenteth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth

Man's Fall: the Merit of the <hi>Messi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </hi> his Undertakings
was valid from that very time, and therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Mercy in Christ are contain'd, tho obscurely, in
the Books of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> The Gospel is antient:
the Design of God in <hi>all Ages</hi> tended to the <hi>consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
of this: which may take off our marvelling at its
being no sooner. It was in being long before as to the
grand Efficacy and Virtue of it. Have then this right
Notion of the true Date of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and you will not
ask why Christ appeared not before.</p>
                     <p>3. Perswade your selves of this, that Christ would
have actually appeared sooner, and that in our Flesh, if
the World had been fit to receive him before. God
acteth according to the Nature of things, according to
the Capacities and Faculties of Mankind, according to
the Condition and Frame of Men. Hence his dealings
with them are different and various, his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
and Methods are not alike: but they are always
most sutable and agreeable to the present Circumstances.

and in several other Instances he let Men understand
that he was highly incens'd against Sinners; which
should have been a Warning to them, and was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by God, that they might tremble at his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and abandon their evil ways. When God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the obstinacy of Mankind, he was pleased to make

others did) might serve and worship him in a
more solemn and pure manner, and that their exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Lives might have influence on the rest of the World.
He writ Laws with his own hand to deliver to them, he
rais'd up Seers and Prophets among them who daily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish'd
them of their Duty, and by frequent dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Mercies and Judgments he strove to make them
sensible of it, and to keep them firm to it. When for
their crying Sins they were sent into Captivity, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
them again, and placed them in their own Land;
but they soon forgot his singular Kindness to them, and
this extraordinary Favour of God was not powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with them to restrain them from the commission
of the most abominable Sins, and to cause them to have
regard to that Holy Religion which strictly forbad all
such practices.</p>
                     <p>In every Age they grew worse and worse, and at last
they arrived to the heighth of Impiety, and their Sins
seemed to be consummated. In <hi>Iudaea,</hi> the Seat of
this once beloved People of God, all Licentiousness,
Lewdness and Villany prevail'd. The greatest <hi>Iews</hi>
were <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Epicures,</hi> and not ashamed to profess
themselves such, as well as to live like Persons of that
Character. And the<note place="bottom">In Tract. Sanedrim.</note> 
                        <hi>Talmud</hi> might well say, <hi>When
the Messias shall come, wise Men shall be very rare in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
but Impostors, Inchanters and Magicians shall be
many;</hi> this Sign having been exactly verified before the
Coming of Christ, the design of whose being manifested
was to destroy those works of the Devil. The Disorders
and Wickednesses of the <hi>Iewish Clergy</hi> were very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
before our Saviour's Coming. The Antient Order
of <hi>Priests</hi> being extinguished by <hi>Herod,</hi> in their places
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65397:203"/>
were put none but obscure, contemptible and unworthy
Persons, who made Religion a cloak for their Covertous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and devoted themselves wholly to Gain and Interest.
The Temple was turn'd into a place of Merchandize: the
<hi>High Priests</hi> Places were bought, and a couple of that
Order at a time were set up because they both had been
<hi>Simoniacal;</hi> which shews likewise that the <hi>Iewish Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy</hi>
as well as the <hi>Ministry</hi> was corrupted. There
were great Corruptions among the <hi>Iewish</hi> Students and
Doctors, who neglecting the weighty things of the Law,
began to hunt after Niceties and Subtilties, and strove to
cherish Disputes and Controversies. Hence were the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Schools of <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Shammai,</hi> which were divided
into two formal Parties, like <hi>Scotists</hi> and <hi>Thomists.</hi> Of
whose different and disagreeing Decisions concerning the
<hi>Law of Moses</hi> the <hi>Mishnah</hi> pretends to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> were divided into three Religious Sects es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,
the <hi>Essenes,</hi> the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and the <hi>Sadduces.</hi>
These were unknown before the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity:
but after that, and the building of the <hi>Second Temple,</hi> they
sprang up both Names and Things: but the two latter
Sects began especially to appear, and to be taken notice
of about a hundred Years before Christ's Nativity; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the Regal Power was in the Native Jews) to their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,

4. They were not forward in persecuting of Christ.
For these Reasons they are not spoken of by any of the
Evangelists.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who were a busie Sect, and lived
in the heart of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and were fierce Opposers of our
Saviour's Doctrine, are frequently mention'd in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Writings. Our Blessed Lord often encountred
them, and openly detected their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

as also their fond Superstition in enjoining Fastings,
Washings, and other Ceremonious Practices of their own
invention. These were the Men who wretchedly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the <hi>Law,</hi> holding that it enjoyned only external
Obedience, and that by that outward Observance of the
Law Men merited Remission of Sin, and were just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and Heirs of Eternal Life. Their constant
Custom was to corrupt the true meaning of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
by their false Interpretations and Comments, as
you may see in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Sermon on the Mount, where
he explains the Moral Law, and vindicates it from the
corrupt Expositions which they had made of it, whereby
they had almost extinguished the true Sense of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.
They had <hi>taken away the key of Knowledg</hi>
by depraving the true Doctrine which was contain'd in
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65397:204"/>
the Written Law and the Books of the Prophets, and by
adhering to that which they call'd the <hi>Oral Law,</hi> the

(of whom I am now speaking) there were but
few of this Sect, saith the<note n="7" place="bottom">Antiq. l. 18. c. 2.</note> forecited Author, but they
were generally Persons of Wealth and Quality. This
was it which was faulty in them, that they curtail'd the
Holy Writings, and rejected all the Books of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
but <hi>Moses:</hi> the only Canonical Scripture with
them was the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Ierom</hi>
and other Writers of good Account acquaint us. Tho I
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65397:205"/>
find<note n="8" place="bottom">Scaliver, Cunaeus, Hottinger.</note> some Men of Note among the Moderns, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to consute this, and to prove that they received
the whole Scripture, but they are not very successful in
this attempt. Moreover, they most impiously denied
the Resurrection of the Dead, and held that Mens Souls
were mortal, yea they generally denied the Existence of
<hi>Spirits,</hi> Mat. 22. 23. These Men won some People
to them, because they were contrary to the strict and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
<hi>Pharisee;</hi> they took off the burdensom Rites
and Ceremonies which the others laid on. These two
prevailing Sects, the superstirious <hi>Pharisee</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<hi>Sadducee,</hi> differing so much from one another
both in Opinions and Manners, caused great Feuds and
Contentions, and unspeakably hindred the Practice of
Religion among that People.</p>
                     <p>To these famous Sects might be added the <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
(call'd <hi>the Leaven of Herod,</hi> Mark 8. 15. by Christ)
they were of the Religion of the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on <hi>that</hi> account (as Doctor<note n="9" place="bottom">Annotat. on Mat. 22. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Hammond</hi> observes)
may be said not to be a distinct Sect from them. See
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 6. &amp; 22. 16. <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 15. &amp; 12. 13. But
they were singular in this, that they were much devoted
to <hi>Herod</hi> and his Government, and consequently that of
the <hi>Romans:</hi> they were great upholders of <hi>Casar</hi>'s Interest
against the Pharisees and other Jews, who look'd upon
<hi>Casar</hi> as an Usurper. Thus they were a <hi>different Sect</hi>
or Faction. Some thought and held that <hi>Herod</hi> was
the promised <hi>Messias:</hi> these were the <hi>Herodians</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Tertullian, Chrysostom, Epiphanius,</hi> and other
<hi>Fathers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Samaritans</hi> were another Sect among the <hi>Iews,</hi>
and had been a long time: these had their Name from
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:65397:205"/>
                        <hi>Samaria</hi> the chief City of the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> which
fell off from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and took <hi>Ieroboam</hi> for their
King. When the <hi>Iews</hi> were carry'd captive into
<hi>Assyria</hi> by <hi>Salmanasser,</hi> a Colony of <hi>Assyrians</hi> was placed
in this City, who being molested by wild Beasts desired
an <hi>Israelitish</hi> Priest to teach them the Religion of that
Countrey where they were planted, whereupon a Priest
came and instructed them, and they partly observed
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, and partly follow'd their own Idolatry and
Superstition. From these came the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who
were reckon'd as rank <hi>Schismaticks</hi> by the generality of
the <hi>Iews.</hi> Accordingly the <hi>Iews had no dealings with
them,</hi> Joh. 4. 9. but maintain'd an irreconcileable quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
against them. Several Reasons concurr'd to keep up
this Feud and Antipathy, 1. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> were of
the Race of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> who carri'd the <hi>Iews</hi> captive.
2. They oppos'd and obstructed the rebuilding of the
Temple when the <hi>Iews</hi> undertook it, after the return
from the <hi>Captivity,</hi> Ezr. 4. 4. 3. They possess'd a
part of the Land which of Right belonged to the Jews.
4. They receiv'd only the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and rejected the
other Books as Uncanonical; for when the <hi>Iewish Priest</hi>
(mention'd before) was sent to them, the <hi>Cannon of the
Bible</hi> consisted chiefly of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Writings, for all the
<hi>Historical Books</hi> were not extant at that time, and 'tis
certain none of the <hi>Prophets</hi> were. 5. They sacrificed
not in the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but on Mount <hi>Geri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi>
where they had a king of a Temple peculiar to
themselves, and was to them as that at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was
to the <hi>Iews.</hi> It was built at first for them by<note n="1" place="bottom">Joseph. Antiq. l. 11. c. 8.</note>

Herod,</hi> when he rebuilt <hi>Samaria,</hi> made a <hi>Temple</hi>
in it, but the <hi>Samaritans</hi> worship'd not in it, but on

Mount <hi>Gerizim.</hi> 6. They were averse to many of the
<hi>Mosaick</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, and differ'd from them
in several parts of Worship: Some say they were inclined
to Idolatry. 7. They, as well as the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> held
there was no Resurrection or Future Life, which was
directly contrary to the firm Belief and Perswasion of the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Church. For these Causes they were extremely
hated by the <hi>Iews,</hi> and were not admitted to Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Worship with them. Whence that common Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>He that eats Bread with the Samaritans is as if he
eat Swines flesh.</hi> And another in use among the Jews
was this, <hi>If a Samaritan pronounce a Blessing, it is not

a State-Party or Faction than a <hi>Sect.</hi> Their Principle
was, not to submit to the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, for they

Some think they were the Followers of <hi>Iudas the Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laean,</hi>

this, and tells us that they were as to the main <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi>
but this they had peculiar to themselves, that they
most impetuously desired <hi>Liberty,</hi> believing that <hi>God</hi>
alone is to be esteem'd and call'd a <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Prince:</hi>
they underwent the most exquisite kinds of Punishments,
rather than they would recede from this Opinion, and
rather than they would give any mortal Man the Name
of <hi>Lord.</hi> It may be observ'd that the Ringleader of this
Party is call'd <hi>Simon</hi> by the foresaid Jewish Writer in his

                     <p>Thus and much more was the <hi>Iewish Nation</hi> divided
into Sects and Factions, thus it was disorder'd and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
Their Priests and People, their Church and
State, their Doctrine, Discipline, and Manners were all
depraved. Religion was decayed every where, Vice
and Wickedness were predominant in all places among
them. And this was but a <hi>Specimen</hi> of what was more
Catholick and prevailing in the <hi>Empire</hi> at that time, to
which the <hi>Iews</hi> were Tributary: for with the <hi>Empire</hi>
came in all Vice and Debauchery: nothing was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of but Sensuality and Intemperance, and all Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancy;
and the Virtue, Modesty and Sobriety of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Rome</hi> were laid aside. When the World was thus
out of Order, and was like to be worse, <hi>CHRIST</hi> the
Redeemer arrived: he came to bless us with greater
Discoveries of God's Will, to inform and amend the
erring and sinful World, to give Rules of exact Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to commend Religion and Virtue by his own
Example. And besides, the World was at that time
engaged in Wars and Tumults, and frequent Battels, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

nothing but Disorder, Outrage and Slaughter insested the
Earth: and lo! at such a time as this the Prince of Peace

and Repose, and created a great Calm and Serenity in
the World. This shews how seasonable the Incarnation

certain Steps and Degrees. And this may satisfie us
why the <hi>Christian Dispensation</hi> took not place till other
Dispensations had gone before. God erected not this

leisurely and by degrees. The World began with a

                           </gap>s without form, and void,</hi> but in <hi>six days</hi>
time it grew to what it is. So was it with <hi>Religion,</hi>
its first day was in <hi>Adam,</hi> the second in <hi>Noah,</hi> the
third in <hi>Abraham,</hi> the fourth in <hi>Moses,</hi> the fifth in the
<hi>Gentile Oeconomy,</hi> and the sixth and last in the <hi>Messias:</hi>
thus it gradually clear'd up, and had its Consummation
in <hi>Christ.</hi> Observe as God in the <hi>Creation</hi> proceeded
from things more imperfect to those that are perfecter;
Trees and Plants and all Vegetatives were created before
Beasts that have a sensitive Life; and at last he came to
what was perfectest, Man, who hath a reasonable Soul,
and is the most excellent of all God's Works in this low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
World; Man, the worthiest Piece of the Creation,
was made last of all: So there was the like Order and
Method observed by God in framing and fashioning his
Church; it was set up first with weak and imperfect
things. The Laws and Constitutions given to the Sons
of Men, were mean and low, and went no further than
Natural Religion: it was like their feeding upon <hi>Herbs</hi>
and <hi>Plants</hi> only. But afterwards Religion was inhanced
by extraordinary Revelations and Discoveries, by posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Laws and Precepts: and by the <hi>Offering of Beasts,</hi>
and other such Legal Observances, the Sensitive and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Life (as I may so say) the External and Bodily part
of Religion was chiefly maintain'd. But at length Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was inspired as it were with a Rational Soul, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Manly, Spiritual and Refined: by the Gospel it
came to be a <hi>Reasonable Service</hi> indeed, an inward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
a Law of Liberty and Love. <hi>Christianity</hi> is the
last, but is the perfectest Dispensation in this Life.</p>

                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:65397:207"/>What the <hi>Platonists</hi> hold concerning the several Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Faculties of Mens Souls, that in due time and
place they orderly awaken into act, and when a lower
Power is extinguish'd, a more extended and enlarg'd
Capacity succeeds it, a more divine Faculty and Life
spring up and are envigorated; what these Philosophers
(I say) hold concerning human Souls, is true of <hi>Religion,</hi>
and its several <hi>Dispensations.</hi> There is a gradual Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>everal Oeconomies, and upon the Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and Extinction of one that is inferiour, a more
Sublime and Perfect one arises in its Room: and it is
God's Will and Pleasure that these divers Administrations
shall take place in their Order, and that one shall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
the other. It seems good to the All-wise Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to reveal the knowledg of himself by degrees, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his Will as it were by parcels. God dispenseth
not all his Favours together, not all at once: but the

                        </gap>estations of his Will grow greater and greater suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively.
He gradually instill'd into the World the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>Messias:</hi> the Prophetical Promises concerning
him were higher and higher: by little and little the Sun
of Righteousness arose, and shined more and more unto
a perfect Day. This is the Divine Method, he proceeds
from imperfect to perfect things, from the Shadow to
the Substance, from Types to Realities, from lesser to
greater Discoveries. He thought good to train up his
Church in this manner, and by meaner Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to make way for the most compleat delivering of his
Will. Still all along one Administration <hi>exceeded</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till at last <hi>Christianity</hi> arrived, which was <hi>Highest</hi>
of all.</p>
                     <p>Those words of the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are very
remarkable to this purpose: those under the Law, saith
he, <hi>received not the Promise</hi> (i. e. the full extent of it
in the Coming of Christ) <hi>God having provided some bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thing for us, that they without us should not be made
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65397:208"/>
perfect,</hi> Heb. 11. 39, 40. He gives here the Reason
why the <hi>Iews</hi> under the <hi>Legal Oeconomy</hi> had not the
Promise compleated, why Christ came not in those days,
<hi>viz.</hi> because the Church was to be perfected by Degrees.
The condition of the Church before Christ was not to be
compleat. They had their <hi>good things,</hi> but we were to
have some <hi>better thing,</hi> that it might be seen that God
proceeds in a gradual and successive Way; and that he
will have things done in their due Season and Course:
that we may take notice of this, that the Frame and
Fabrick of Religion shall be reared by little and little to
its Perfection, that God intends to reserve the best things
till last; in short, that after <hi>Christ</hi>'s Coming, Religion
was to be at its full Age, and that this <hi>Glorious Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi>
should crown all. Thus by the different Stages
and Progressions, the divers Courses and Periods of the
Church in successive Ages, God hath thought fit to shew
himself a God of Order, and not of Confusion. And so

was not design'd to be perpetual, is
proved from, 1. The Prophesies concerning <hi>the enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Church,</hi> together with the nature of the
<hi>Jewish</hi> Observances. 2. God's <hi>dispensing with</hi> the
Mosaick Rites and Laws. 3. Their being <hi>neglected</hi>
sometimes by the Holiest Men. 4. <hi>God's disregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them. 5. The Confession of the <hi>Jewish Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies.</hi>

Prophesies which seem to relate to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church

It is not necessary that there should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Reason</hi> of a Law ceases, the Law it self ceaseth.
But yet, it is shew'd from sundry places in the New
Testament, that the Ceremonial Law is formally and
expresly abrogated. We are assured of the <hi>Truth
of the Christian Religion</hi> from <hi>Humane Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>

is proved by several Arguments, 1. God's Method

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Truth and Certainty of the Christian Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
and consequently of Christianity it self,
evinced. That the Mosaick Dispensation
was not design'd to be Perpetual, is proved from
1. The Prophesies concerning the enlarging of
the Church: together with the nature of the
Jewish Observances. 2. Gods dispensing
with the Mosaick Rites and Laws. 3. Their
being neglected sometimes by the Holiest Men.
4. God's disregarding them. 5. The Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Jewish Rabbies. An Objection,
viz. that it is said, the Mosaick Law shall be
for ever, distinctly answer'd. Prophesies which
seem to relate to the Jewish Church are to be
interpreted concerning the Christian one. It
is not necessary that there should be a Formal
Abrogation of the Ceremonial Law, because
when the Reason of a Law ceases, the Law
it self ceaseth. But yet, it is shew'd from sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Places in the New Testament, that the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law is formally and expresly abrogated.
We are assured of the Truth of the Christian
Religion from Humane Testimony. The
Testimony of the Outward and Bodily Senses
is made use of and appealed to in the New Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,
as an Argument of the truth of
Christianity. St. John's Words, 1 Ep.
1 Chap. 1, 2, 3. ver. commented upon. There
is no Certainty in Religion, esp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>cially in the
Christian, if the Testimony of Sense be not
allow'd of. The Apostles and those who heard
and saw the things done by our Saviour were
Credible Persons. The four Evangelists and
other Writers of the New Testament were
Competent Witnesses of what they relate.
Their Personal Qualities (which are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
reckon'd up) render their Testimony wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all acceptation. The Christians that
succeeded them faithfully deliver'd things to us.
Their Lives are a proof of their Integrity.
Their Sufferings and Death are an undeniable
Argument of their testifying the Truth to us.
An Heap of Evidences that we are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon by them. The very Jews bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Truth of Christianity. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their Congratulating our Saviour
at his riding into Jerusalem particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd.
Heathens attest the Truth of the
Christian Religion. So do Infernal Spirits.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="418" facs="tcp:65397:216"/>
                        <pb n="419" facs="tcp:65397:216"/>111. I Am to shew the <hi>Truth and Certainty of the
Christian Oeconomy,</hi> and therein of the <hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Religion.</hi> And here first we must grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with the tenacious and stubborn <hi>Iew,</hi>
for <hi>his Dispensation</hi> being so Antient and Authentick,
he is loth to quit it. I must prove therefore (before
I go any further) that it is nulled, abrogated and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated.
We need not say much of the <hi>Iudicial
Law:</hi> It is the <hi>Ceremonial one</hi> which makes <hi>Iudaism</hi>
properly, and is the most opposite to the <hi>Christian
Administration.</hi> The <hi>Iudicial Laws,</hi> so far as they
make for Peace and good Order in the Government,
and so far as they are sutable to the present State of
Affairs, may be observed still; but then they oblige
not as part of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, but as they are good
Rules of Government in themselves. But the main
Part of the <hi>Iudicial Law</hi> is not at this Day practicable
amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves; they being dispersed,
and no longer in a Body, that Law cannot be made
use of, and consequently doth not oblige them. And
any one may see plainly that that Polity and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was not to last for ever, as they foolishly dream.
For it was not fitted for the Tempers of all People,
not proper for all Countries, but was in most things
calculated for the <hi>Iewish</hi> Meridian only, and for the
present Circumstances that People were in at that
time, and therefore it is evident that it was to be
changed afterwards.</p>
                     <p>I do not lay any stress on what may be observed of
the <hi>different Manner</hi> of delivering the three <hi>Laws,
Moral, Ceremonial,</hi> and <hi>Iudicial,</hi> but only let it be
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65397:217"/>
an occasion to suggest to us a right Notion concerning
the different Nature of them. The <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
or <hi>Moral Law</hi> was delivered on the top of the
<hi>Mount,</hi> in the face of the World, as it were to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
that it was of universal Influence, and obliged all
Mankind. But the <hi>Ceremonial L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>w</hi> was received by
<hi>Moses</hi> in private, in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> which may hint
to us that it was of a peculiar Concern, it belong'd
to the <hi>Iews</hi> only, it was to cease when the <hi>Tabernacle</hi>
was down, when the Veil of the Temple was rent.
And as for the <hi>Iudicial Law,</hi> it was neither so publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and audibly given as the Moral Law, nor so pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
as the Ceremonial, which may intimate to us
the Nature of that sort of Law: it is of an indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
kind, and may be kept up or not according as
its Rules sute with the Place and Government. It is
then the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> wherein the <hi>Religion of the
Iews</hi> (as distinct from other People) chiefly consisted,
which I am ingaged more especially to speak of at
present.</p>
                     <p>The first thing that I will undertake is this, to
shew that the <hi>Mosaick Oeconomy</hi> was not designed to
be perpetuated, but that it was to be changed, and
to give way to the <hi>Evangelical one.</hi> If this be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
it is a good step towards the main Point, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical Oeconomy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. That the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Dispensation was not to last
always, is clear from the many Promises in the Old
Testament of <hi>inlarging Religion,</hi> and of extending
the <hi>Church</hi> to the uttermost parts of the World.
Which is no ways consistent with the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
for according to the <hi>Law</hi> all the Males were to
assemble at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and to worship there thrice a
Year. But when upon the <hi>Messias</hi>'s coming all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were to imbrace the true Religion, how was it
possible for the remotest Nations of the World to
come and sacrifice at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and constantly to
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65397:217"/>
meet there at solemn Feasts? <hi>Ierusalem</hi> could not
hold them, the Temple would be too little for the
Worshippers. This is a Sign that God intended not
to confine his Church to <hi>Iudea,</hi> but that he designed
a Religion which should be Universal, and oblige the
whole World. According to the <hi>Law</hi> Sacrifices
were to be no where but at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> But it is said
in <hi>Isa. 19. 19, 23. There shall be Altars and Sacrifices to
the Lord in</hi> Egypt <hi>and Assyria:</hi> and in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 11.
<hi>From the rising of the Sun even unto the going down of
the same, my Name shall be great among the Gentiles, and
in every place Incense shall be offer'd unto my Name, and
a pure Offering.</hi> Therefore the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was
not to be the only Seat of solemn Worship and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but upon the coming of the <hi>Messias</hi> Oblations
were to be all the World over. God saith of his
<hi>Church,</hi> which is his <hi>House,</hi> that <hi>it shall be called a
House of Prayer to all Nations, Isa. 56. 7. Mark</hi> 11.
17. That is, the Church shall be open to all without
respect of Persons or Countries: which must needs
be (and was always acknowledged) a Prophesy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the spreading of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and its being
imbraced by some of all Nations under Heaven.
Therefore it is said by the same Evangelical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>in the last Days all Nations shall flow unto it,
Isa.</hi> 2. 2. So in <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 3, 4, 5. we find that <hi>Strangers</hi>
and <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> Persons uncapable by the <hi>Mosaick Law</hi>
of being of the Communion of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church,
shall be admitted into it.</p>
                     <p>And that is yet more remarkable which you read
in the same Prophet <hi>Chap.</hi> 66. where after it was
plainly foretold that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should have a Holy
Church, and that <hi>there should be an Offering to the Lord
out of all Nations, ver.</hi> 20. this is added in the next
Verse, <hi>I will also take of them for Priests and for Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
saith the Lord.</hi> Observe it, there shall be
<hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> taken from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which is
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:65397:218"/>
absolutely against <hi>Iudaism,</hi> for the <hi>Priesthood</hi> amongst
the <hi>Iews</hi> was tied to that certain Nation, yea to a
certain House and Family amongst them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is evident that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion was Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
and was to cease. This is obscurely inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s <hi>Model of the Temple, Chap. 40. &amp;c.</hi>
There never was any such thing, no such Dimensions
and Platforms: it is a vast unwieldy thing: his <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
is as big as all <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the Ground allotted
the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> equals all <hi>Canaan.</hi> It is likely
therefore that this prefigureth the <hi>Christian Temple,</hi>
or the Church under the Gospel, which was to be
capacious and large. But I need not make use of these
obscure and mystical Places, after I have produced
so plain and evident ones as those before mention'd.
It is undeniable that those several Prophesies could not
be accomplished if the Old State of the <hi>Iews</hi> was to
be perpetual: <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was too little, the Land of
<hi>Iudea</hi> could not serve for those purposes which are
there spoken of.</p>
                     <p>Here also it might be observ'd that the <hi>Passover,</hi>
their great and most famous Ordinance, was a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
of a particular Deliverance vouchsafed to the
<hi>Iewish</hi> People, and therefore was proper to them,
and appertained not to other Nations. Hence it was
that the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves did not require of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selites</hi>
a Conformity to this Law, nor indeed to any
other of the like peculiar Nature. Yea, themselves
were not obliged to observe some of the Mosaick
Laws if they were in other Countries, as those of
<hi>First-fruits, Tithes,</hi> and the <hi>Sabbatick-year,</hi> the <hi>Iubilee.</hi>
In <hi>Canaan</hi> only these and other Constitutions were to
be kept, as is confess'd by their own Writers. Their
Laws concerning <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Incense,</hi> and <hi>Feasts,</hi> are
ceas'd at this day amongst them, because they were
confin'd to that place, and were not to be observ'd
any where else. Thus a considerable part of the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:65397:218"/>
                        <hi>Iewish Laws</hi> are now abolish'd by their own Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
they being dispersed into other Countries. This
might convince them that <hi>Iudaism</hi> was to give place
to <hi>Christianity,</hi> which is large and fitted for all the
World, which hath God, the Church, Religion, and
Salvation all in common. This is a great Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of <hi>Christianity</hi> that it is Universal, and excludeth
no People or Nations, whereas the Religion and
Worship of the <hi>Iews</hi> was narrow and scant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to themselves; which is a Demonstration that it
was Temporary, and that there was to be a change
of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law and Administration.</p>
                     <p>2. This appears if you consider likewise that <hi>God
dispensed with the Mosaick Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> and
did not always exact the observance of them: which
he would have done if they had been perpetual Laws,
and were designed to continue to all Ages. Thus
God dispensed with <hi>Circumcision,</hi> not only as to the
Time which was punctually assigned by the Law,
<hi>viz.</hi> the eighth Day (for when the Infants were sick,
Circumcision was put off till they were well) but he
dispensed with the very Act, and Performance it self.
All the time the Israelites were in the Wilderness,
(which was forty Years) they neglected to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their Children (and indeed there was no occasion
for it, because they then needed not to be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the <hi>Nations,</hi> being not mingled with them,
and besides, it was inconvenient in their Marches and
Removals) as may be gather'd from <hi>Ios. 5. 2. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
again, &amp;c.</hi> and more plainly from what follows,
v. 5. <hi>The People that were born in the Wilderness by the way,
as they came forth out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>them they had not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised.</hi>
All that time the Celebration of the <hi>Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
was omitted in the Wilderness, or it was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but once in those forty Years, <hi>Num. 9. 1, 2. Ios.</hi> 5.
10. All the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Oblations,</hi> tho commanded
and appointed them the first Year they came into the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:65397:219"/>
Desert, were omitted all the time they were there,
excepting some <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> and <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> which
you read of in <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 29. But the <hi>daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
was not offered, and the constant use of all sorts of
Sacrifices prevailed not. And afterwards, when
they came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> God dispensed with the
Law<note n="*" place="bottom">Lev. 16. 21.</note> concerning <hi>Sacrificing only in the Tabernacle:</hi> for
<hi>Elias</hi> sacrificed at <hi>Carmel,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> at <hi>Mishphat,</hi>
(unless we shall say that the <hi>Law</hi> had not reference to
these <hi>Extraordinary Sacrifices</hi>) and more Instances
might be produced of that kind. As to the <hi>Resting
on the Sabbath-day</hi> (which was a direct Injunction of
the Law) it was not observed when they besieged
<hi>Iericho</hi> on that day. And other punctual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory
Commands of the Mosaick Law were not
observed.</p>
                     <p>And I could add, that many things commanded in
the <hi>Iudicial Law</hi> were dispensed with by God, for he
who enjoyned them had Power to do it. <hi>A Bastard
was not to come into the Congregation,</hi> Deut. 23. 2. Yet
<hi>Iepht<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ah</hi> who was of that Character was prefer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d,
and that by Gods own Order, to be Judge of <hi>Israel.</hi>
So the Judicial Law was violated by letting <hi>Saul</hi>'s
Sons, who were hang'd up, remain so long a time on
the Gibbets. Hence it appears that the Obligation
of the <hi>Mosaick Laws</hi> is not perpetual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing
and dispensing made way for annulling them,
and were a certain vindication that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Laws
were to be laid aside.</p>
                     <p>3. You may take notice that as God himself dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with these Laws, so the best Men were often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
very neglectful of them. Thus <hi>Gideon, Mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
and <hi>David</hi> sacrificed not according to the strict di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Law. And the last of these eat the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:65397:219"/>
                        <hi>Shew-bread</hi> when he was press'd with extream hunger:
and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ordered the <hi>Passover</hi> to be celebrated
otherwise than it was written in the Law, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
30. 18. So careless were they of precisely observing
the <hi>Cermonial</hi> Injunctions. And here it might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
how the holy Men and Prophets despised the
service of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and all the other Duties of the
<hi>Law</hi> in comparison of inward Goodness, Vertue and
Holiness, and spiritual Exercises and Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Religion. The Psalmist speaks to God after
this manner, <hi>Psal. 51. 16, 17. Thou desirest not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
else would I give it thee; thou delightest not in Burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering.
The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit: a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and a contrite Heart, O Lord, thou wilt not despise.</hi>
The Son of this Royal Prophet is plain and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in this matter, <hi>to do Iustice and Iudgment is more
acceptable to the Lord than Sacrifice,</hi> Prov. 21. 3.
Whom <hi>Philo</hi> that worthy Jew follows, saying,<note n="*" place="bottom">

is not delighted with the Flesh and Fat of Animals,

were but a secondary sort of Service, they were
not in their own nature good, nor required for their
own sake; but the primary and main part of divine
Service and Worship, are Prayer, Repentance and
Obedience. As for <hi>Circumcision,</hi> it was not esteem'd
to be of absolute necessity, and accordingly was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
perform'd by them. Some <hi>Iews</hi> lived all their
days uncircumcised, yea some of their very <hi>Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

at the Altar tho they were never circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
For if the first, second and third Son died of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:65397:220"/>
(as sometimes happen'd) the Sons that
were born afterwards were not circumcised, and yet
were accounted true Israelites and true Priests, as
Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> informs us. For, as one of their <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi>
saith, Israelites are not bound to perform the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Precepts where Death will certainly follow; for
'tis said, <hi>ye shall keep my Statutes and my Iudgments,
which if a Man do, he shall live in them,</hi> not die in
them.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Observe how God himself despiseth and vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
rejecteth and hateth these legal Rites and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances
in themselves consider'd, and as abstracted
from real Vertue and Piety. The Psalmist brings in the
Almighty speaking thus,</hi> Will I eat the Flesh of Bulls,
or drink the Blood of Goats? offer unto God Thanksgiving,
and pay thy Vows unto the most High, <hi>Psal. 50. 13, 14.
Hear what the Lord saith by the Prophet</hi> Isaias, To
what purpose is the Multitude of your Sacrifices unto me?
saith the Lord.—Who hath required this at your hand?
Bring no more vain Oblations: Incense is an Abomination
to me, <hi>Isa. 1. 11, 12, 13. and so in chap. 66. ver.</hi> 1, 3.
Thus saith the Lord, He that killeth an Ox is as if he
slew a Man; he that sacrificeth a Lamb as if he cut off a
Dogs Neck: he that offereth an Oblation as if he offer'd
Swines Blood: he that burneth Incense, as if he blessed
an Idol. <hi>God by another Prophet upbraids the Jews
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Sheba,</hi> and the sweet Cane from a far Country? Your
Burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your Sacrifices
sweet unto me, <hi>Jer. 6. 20. and again, chap. 7. ver. 22.</hi>
I spake not to your Fathers, nor commanded them in the
Day that I brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices. But this thing
commanded I them, saying, Obey my Voice, and I will be
your God, and you shall be my People: and walk ye in all
the ways that I have commanded you. <hi>That in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy
of</hi> Hosea <hi>may be here inserted,</hi> I desired Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:65397:220"/>
and not Sacrifice; and the Knowledg of God more
than Burnt-offerings, <hi>chap. 6. ver. 6. Acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Mercy are prefer'd by God before the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
Performances of the</hi> Mosaick Law. <hi>But that in
the Prophet</hi> Amos <hi>is much higher,</hi> I hate, I despise
your Feast-days, and I will not smell in your solemn
Assemblies. Tho ye offer me Burnt-offerings and your
Meat-offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Peace-offerings of your fat Beasts. But let Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
run down as Waters, and Righteousness as a mighty
Stream, <hi>Am. 5. 21, 22, 23. Hither are to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Words of the Prophet</hi> Micah, Wherewith
shall I come before the Lord, and bow my self before the
High God? Shall I come before him with Burnt-offerings,
with Calves of a Year old? Will the Lord be pleased with
thousands of Rams, or with ten thousands of Rivers of
Oil? He hath shew'd thee, O Man, what is good; and
what doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly, and to
love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? <hi>Mic. 6.
7, 8, 9. From all which places it appeareth that
the</hi> Ritual <hi>Service of the</hi> Iews <hi>was</hi> in it self <hi>of no
Worth and Value: else it is certain God would not
have thus slighted and disregarded, yea loathed and
abhorred it. And if the</hi> Ceremonial <hi>Observances had
no intrinsick Goodness in them; if Sacrifices, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
difference of Meats,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were not enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for themselves; if the Matter of these Laws were
not really good, we may thence arrive to such a
Conclusion as this, that there is no such Excellency
in the</hi> Iewish Religion <hi>as to give it a</hi> Perpetuity, <hi>and
that it is most reasonable to believe that these Rites
and Constitutions were to be repealed and cancelled
in due time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. And Lastly, many of the learnedest <hi>Rabbies</hi>
hold that the Law is mutable. All Sacrifices shall
cease in the Ages to come, but the Sacrifice of Praise
and Thanksgiving shall never cease, saith <hi>R. Kimchi</hi>
                        <pb n="428" facs="tcp:65397:221"/>
on the 100 <hi>Psalm.</hi> It was a Tradition amongst the
Jews, saith <hi>Abarbanel</hi> in <hi>Rosh Amanah,</hi> that in the
times of the <hi>Messias</hi> the Jews should feed upon Swine,
as well as other Animals. The <hi>Talmud</hi> it self acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
that the Ceremonial Law is to last no longer
than till the <hi>Messias</hi>'s coming, and that then Swines
Flesh shall be lawfully eaten. Again, they confess
<note n="*" place="bottom">Omnia praecepta quae terrae Israelis sunt alligata, non nisi in terra Israelis sunt observanda. Kidushin, cap. 1.</note> that all those Precepts which more immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the <hi>Iewish Nation</hi> (which make up the greatest
part of their Law) shall not be observed in any other
Country. Further, they say,<note n="†" place="bottom">

                        <hi>David</hi> came and contracted them to eleven, then
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Isa. 33. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Isaias</hi> brought them down to six, afterwards

                        <hi>Micah</hi> reduced them to three,<note n="††" place="bottom">Isa. 56. 1.</note>

                        <hi>Amos</hi> contracted all the Law
into one. Thus they were willing to abate of the
number of the Laws: they saw there was no need of
that Multiplicity of Precepts and Injunctions, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
concerning external Rites and Ceremonies. And
many other Sayings and Intimations there are in the
<hi>Rabbies</hi> which confirm this, and which plainly shew that
they were of the Opinion that the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Rites were
not immutable, but that the time should come when
they shall be abolish'd.</p>
                     <p>But we are accosted with this <hi>Objection,</hi> The Sacred
Scripture it self declareth that the legal Ceremonies

the Temple it self and its Gates were fixed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent

signifies a Finite, tho a long time. Wherefore those
places before refer'd to, which speak of the Mosaick
Rites being <hi>for ever,</hi> must not be understood of an
endless Duration, but they only signify that that
Administration should last a very considerable time,
and so it did.</p>
                     <p>2. These legal Rites and Ceremonies, as to any
alteration from the <hi>Iews,</hi> were to be <hi>for ever. They</hi>
were not to change them in the least, none but <hi>God</hi>
could alter them, who designed to do so in due time:
for he intended those Mosaick Precepts should conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to such a certain period of time, and no longer.
These Words of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> are very observable, <hi>Chap.</hi>
3. 16. <hi>It shall come to pass in those days, saith the Lord,
they shall say no more, the Ark of the Covenant of the
Lord, neither shall it come to mind, neither shall they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it, neither shall they visit it, neither shall it be
magnified any more;</hi> i. e. The <hi>Mosaick</hi> Rites and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Ceremonies of the Law shall not be in request,
as they were before, Men shall not prize and value
them as they used to do, yea they shall lay the use of
them aside: but this they must not do till they have
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:65397:222"/>
Authority from God. And God revealed to the
Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> that he would alter the <hi>Law</hi> after a
certain Revolution of Years: <hi>The Messias shall cause
the Sacrifice and Oblation to cease,</hi> Dan. 9. 27. But it
was unalterable in respect of the Jews themselves.</p>
                     <p>3. The Promises and Predictions in the Old Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament
(which are very many) concerning the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Duration of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the
<hi>Iewish Worship,</hi> and their Polity and Government, are
to be understood of the Perpetuity of <hi>the Church of
Christ</hi> and his <hi>spiritual Kingdom.</hi> And to this purpose
you may observe that in the Writings of the Old Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,
where the Times of the Gospel are foretold,
the Evangelical Worship and Service of God are set
forth by sacrificing, and other the like Observances
commanded in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law. By the Ritual Worship
of the Jews is express'd the reasonable and spiritual
Service of the Gospel; and by those Expressions which
seem to denote the Perpetuity of the former, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the latter is signified and ascertained to us.</p>
                     <p>This is a most certain Truth, and the observing of
it will lead us to a right understanding of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Texts which speak of the <hi>Iewish Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as if they were to continue for ever, without any
Limitation and Restriction. We are to know that those
places, especially the Prophesies in <hi>Isaiah</hi> concerning
the glorious things that shall befal <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the
<hi>Iews,</hi> are to be interpreted of the State of the
<hi>Christian Church:</hi> they are to be understood of the
Spiritual Kingdom of the Messias, and the Times of
the Gospel. <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> signify Spiritual
Oblations and the Gospel-Church: for the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Prophet is to be understood in an Evangelical
Sense. The Angels Words concerning <hi>Christ</hi> in
Luke 1. 32, 33. <hi>The Lord God shall give unto him the
Throne of his Father David, and he shall reign over the
House of Iacob for ever, and of his Kingdom there shall
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:65397:222"/>
be no end,</hi> are a plain Comment on all those places in the
Old Testament, where the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of the Mosaick
Laws and the Jewish Oeconomy and Government is
promis'd. They shew that they are all meant of
<hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom, i. e.</hi> his Church both here and
hereafter, which was prefigured by <hi>David's Kingdom.</hi>
From what this Heavenly Messenger saith here, we
learn that the Prophesies concerning the endless conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the <hi>Throne of David,</hi> of <hi>raising up to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

David their King,</hi> Jer. 30. 9. of <hi>raising up the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of David,</hi> Am. 9. 11. of God's <hi>setting up his
Servant David,</hi> Ezek. 34. 23. are all accomplish'd in
<hi>Christ.</hi> And indeed the Jewish Commentators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
acknowledg that the <hi>Messias</hi> is often stiled <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
in these and other Prophesies of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
nor are they backward to confess that by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
<hi>Throne</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> is meant the <hi>Messias</hi>'s <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
as is plain from <hi>Psal. 132. 11. 2 Sam.</hi> 7. 12.
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 10. where God promised <hi>David</hi> that
<hi>Christ</hi> should sit on his Throne: which is taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, and applied not only in the forenam'd place in
St. <hi>Luke,</hi> but in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 30. For <hi>Christ</hi> is represented
by <hi>David,</hi> and the Evangelical Dispensation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in Terms which relate to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
and Government. So that it is no wonder
this is said to <hi>be for ever,</hi> for it shall last to the end
of the World, and afterwards <hi>Christ</hi> shall reign in
the Kingdom of Glory to eternal Ages. This, if
duly considered, cannot but yield a satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the foregoing <hi>Objection,</hi> as well as give light
to several Prophesies of the Old Testament.</p>
                     <p>But here it will be asked, where hath God <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally

answer, it is not necessary he should do this, for the

                        </gap>fly to prefigure <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Gospel of
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:65397:223"/>
which he was the Institutor: and therefore they are
now ceased, <hi>Christ</hi> being come, of whom they were
but Figures and Shadows. The <hi>Abrogation</hi> then of
those Mosaick Rites wherein the Religion of the
<hi>Iews</hi> was placed, may be proved by this one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> was designed by the legal Rites,
that the Ceremonial Law was a Prefiguration of the
Gospel-Dispensation. Here it might be shew'd that
the Evangelical Oeconomy was prefigured by certain
Persons, as <hi>Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Ioseph, Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi>
(about the last of whom the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
spends a whole Chapter:) these were <hi>Typical</hi> Persons
as well as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and some others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
And not only <hi>Persons</hi> but <hi>Things</hi> were <hi>Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
as the <hi>Pillar of a Cloud, the Red Sea, the Manna,</hi>
and <hi>the Rock,</hi> which two last were Symbols of the
Evangelical Sacraments, the Eucharist and Baptism,
1 <hi>Cor. 10. 1, 2, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>lifting up of the brazen
Serpent</hi> signified Christs Crucifixion, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                     <p>But if I should speak of those that are <hi>properly Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Rites and Vsages,</hi> it is yet further evident that they
were Representations of our Saviour, and of the
grand things of the Gospel. As for <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> I have
treated of them already, and made it appear that
they foresignified the expiatory Sacrifice of Christ on
the Cross. As for the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and all the appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of it, I have particularly display'd their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical
Nature, and how they all pointed to this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
I am now speaking of. I might proceed to
make this good concerning the Ceremonious <hi>Washings</hi>
and <hi>Purifications</hi> under the Law, that they typified
some greater Purity, they signified the Spiritual
cleansing and sanctifying of the Soul, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit. The
Apostle acquaints us that the difference <hi>of Meats and
Drinks, observing of a Holy Day, or of the New Moon,
or of the Sabbath Days, were a shadow of things to come,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:65397:223"/>
but the Body</hi> (of this Shadow) <hi>is Christ,</hi> Col. 2. 16, 17.
The Truth, the Solidity, the Substance are to be
sought for in some higher things than those were,
even in Christ Jesus, and in the Benefits of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
Yea he tells us that the whole <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law is
but <hi>a shadow of good things to come,</hi> Heb. 10. 1. All the
things contained in it are but rude and imperfect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineations
of that compleat Frame of Religion which
the <hi>Messias</hi> was to introduce.</p>
                     <p>This was the thing designed all along; the Ritual
and Ceremonial Law with all its external Rites tended
to this pure and uncorrupted Model of Religion. It
was appointed that the Law should adumbrate the
Gospel, that that Oeconomy should prefigure this.
Therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>the Law was our School-master
to bring us to Christ;</hi> which shews the inferiour
Nature of the <hi>Law,</hi> and that it was to indure but for
a time, for the Authority of a <hi>School-master</hi> over
those whom he teacheth is but Temporary. The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Pedagogy was to cease, and Christ was to be <hi>the
end of the Law to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10.
4. It is then evident from the Premises that the
<hi>Iewish Law</hi> is disannul'd: for when the <hi>Reason</hi> of a
Law ceases, that is sufficient to change the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as it commenced upon <hi>Reason,</hi> so when that
is taken away, the Law it self is abolish'd also.
This is the present Case: the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Rites and
Types were designed to represent and foresignify
Christ and the Evangelical Benefits: Wherefore
Christ being come, and having brought with him
those Benefits, the former mystical Representations
and Figures ought to have a Period. So that the
Reason and Occasion of these Ceremonious Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
being removed, this is sufficient to repeal and
reverse those Laws, especially when you consider
that Christ's <hi>Miracles</hi> (of which I shall speak after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
were plain Evidences of God's Intention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
the Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="434" facs="tcp:65397:224"/>But (to close this Point) we are not destitute of a
<hi>Formal Abrogation</hi> of the Jewish Laws, for such we
may justly reckon our Saviour's Words to be in <hi>Iohn</hi>
4. 21, 23. <hi>The hour cometh when ye shall neither in this
Mountain, nor yet at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>worship the Father.
The hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worshippers
shall worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> Where
first he acquaints us that the publick Worship of God
shall not be restrain'd to one particular place: which
very thing is a cancelling of the <hi>Mosaick Law,</hi> which
gave Directions chiefly concerning the <hi>Temple-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi>
They shall not, saith he, be confined to Mount
<hi>Gerizim</hi> where the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had fix'd the Seat of their
worshipping, or to Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> in <hi>Samaria</hi> where
<hi>Shiloh</hi> was, the place where the Tabernacle and Ark
rested from the beginning of <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s time till <hi>Samuel;</hi>
nor shall they be confined to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whither the
Tabernacle was afterwards brought, and at length
converted into a Temple: nor in any other place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively
shall Men worship God, but every Place and
Country shall be alike, and God shall have Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
in every part of the World. This utterly
makes void the <hi>Iewish Ceremonial Service,</hi> which was
tied to a certain place. And our Saviour adds this
(which doth yet further evacuate it) that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
under the Gospel must be <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi> in
contradistinction to the <hi>legal</hi> Worship which was
made up of <hi>carnal Ordinances,</hi> and mere <hi>Shadows</hi>
and <hi>Types,</hi> which were but Representations of that
which is true and real. Thus he plainly erases and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes
the Mosaick Service, and calls those that worship
God in the Evangelical Manner the <hi>true Worshippers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, the greatest part of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
is a direct and downright repealing of it. Nay, we
want not the <hi>formal Words</hi> of <hi>Abrogation,</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.
18, 19. <hi>There is verily a disannulling of the Commandment
going before,</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Iudaical Oeconomy,</hi>
                        <pb n="435" facs="tcp:65397:224"/>
which he calls <hi>a carnal Commandment,</hi> ver. 16.) <hi>for
the Weakness and Unprofitableness thereof: for the Law
made nothing perfect.</hi> Here is an <hi>express disannulling</hi> of
the Mosaick Law. And moreover the Reason of it
is rendred, <hi>viz.</hi> because it was weak and imperfect,
and had little Power to amend and reform Mens
Lives. You will find it also formally repeal'd in <hi>Heb.</hi>
8. 7, 8, 13. where the Apostle treating of the Old
and New Covenant (by which he means the Law
and the Gospel, as I have before shew'd) he thus
concludes: <hi>If the first Covenant had been faultless, then
should no place have ben sought for the second. For find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fault with them, he saith, Behold the Days come, saith
the Lord, when I will make a New Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In
that he saith, a New Covenant, he hath made the first
Old. Now, that which decayeth and waxeth Old is ready
to vanish away, or</hi> (according to the Greek) <hi>it is near to
vanishing.</hi> Certainly this <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> speaks as much,
if not more, than <hi>Abrogating.</hi> And in<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 10. 5, 9.</note> another
pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce, where he speaketh of the <hi>legal Worship</hi> which
consisteth chiefly in Sacrifices, and Offerings for Sin,
and not in inward Holiness and sincere doings of
God's Will, (which is the Evangelical Service) he
applieth the Psalmist's, or rather our Saviour's words,
<hi>Sacrifice and Offering thou wouldest not: Then said I,
Lo, I come to do thy Will:</hi> this is infer'd, that <hi>he taketh
away the first, that he may establish the second;</hi> i. e. the
<hi>Messias</hi> abolisheth the <hi>Iudaical Service,</hi> that the may set
up and perpetuate the <hi>Evangelical one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It can then be no longer questioned, whether the
<hi>Iewish Law</hi> was <hi>abrogated,</hi> and that in <hi>formal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Terms. Those carnal Ordinances</hi> (as the Apostle
speaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10.) <hi>were imposed upon them only until
the time of Reformation, i. e.</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> When
that came, they were made <hi>void, null,</hi> and <hi>dead:</hi>
                        <pb n="436" facs="tcp:65397:225"/>
And this <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews</hi> seems to be the <hi>Sermon</hi>
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached at their <hi>Funeral,</hi> or the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Burial</hi> on that occasion. Here is <hi>Ashes to Ashes,</hi>
and <hi>Dust to Dust,</hi> a fatal Period put to the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Rites,
the <hi>Law</hi> interred and intombed, never to rise again;
but the <hi>Gospel</hi> springs out of those Ashes, a new and
a more noble Dispensation succeeds in its room.
And thus I have abundantly proved what I undertook,
that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> consisting in Ceremonies was
not to continue, but was in time to be nulled and
dissolved, and that by the coming of Christ they
are accordingly nulled, dissolved and abrogated.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto I have in a more <hi>remote manner</hi> proved the
<hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical Oeconomy,</hi>
and consequently of <hi>Christianity it self.</hi> But now I
will approach <hi>nearer,</hi> and proceed to a more <hi>positive</hi>
and <hi>particular Proof</hi> of the Authority of the Gospel-Dispensation.
Christ succeeds <hi>Moses,</hi> the Gospel fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the Law: but <hi>quo jure?</hi> There must be as great
Testimony for the one as there was for the other, or
else it cannot be received on good Grounds. Let us
see then how <hi>this Dispensation</hi> will acquit it self. There
are two kinds of Evidence, <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> the
Testimony of Man, and the Testimony of God:
The first creates a humane Faith, the second a divine
one in us. Both of these we have in the present Matter.</p>
                     <p>First, we are furnished with <hi>Humane Testimony, i. e.</hi>
we are assured of the Truth of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi>
by a sufficient number of credible Persons, who have
been either Ear or Eye-witnesses, or both, of all the
Transactions relating to Christ and Christianity.
And here I will shew, 1. That this sort of Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is frequently made use of and appealed to in the
<hi>New Testament,</hi> as a sufficient Argument and Proof of
Christianity. 2. That the Testimony of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and other Christians who lived in our Saviour's
time was the Testimony of credible Persons, and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:65397:225"/>
therefore ought to be reckoned by us a valid and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Proof of Christianity.</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Testimony</hi> of credible Persons who have
heard and seen what Christ did, is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ten made use of
and appealed to as a good Argument of the <hi>Truth of
Christianity.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the beginning of his
Gospel, to conciliate a Belief of what he was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
declares he design'd to record nothing but what
was delivered to him by such as<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 1. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>from the beginning
were Eye-witnesses, and Ministers of the Word,</hi> i. e.
not only those who saw Christ, and what he did, but
were personally and actually concerned in many of
those things, as <hi>walking on the Sea, casting out of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
&amp;c. those who had a part in these great and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Actions, those who were not only Spectators
but Actors. These I take to be the</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> 
                        <hi>Ministers of the
Word</hi> here meant, as the Original importeth. So you
see this Evangelist lays his Foundation on the <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Sense,</hi> he deems it good Ground of Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that what he writes concerning Christ and his
miraculous Doings is attested by those who were Eye-witnesses
of them, and who most sensibly convers'd
with our Saviour, and shared in some part of the
things done by him. This he knew would cause them
to be <hi>most surely believed among</hi> the Christians, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.
So to the Testimony of Sense St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
appeal'd, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 20. When the <hi>Rulers of the Iews</hi>
sent for them, and commanded them to preach no
more in Christ's Name, their peremptory Return was
this, <hi>we cannot but speak the things which we have seen
and heard.</hi> As if they had said, Gentlemen, what is
this that you require of us? It is most strange that
you would have us to deny our Senses, and to give no
Credit to our Ears or Eyes. All of you, as well as
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:65397:226"/>
our selves, can attest the things that have been said
and done by <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> Our Ears have heard
his heavenly Doctrine, and our Eyes have seen the
Wonders he wrought in Confirmation of that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
Would you have us believe and act contrary
to our Senses? This was never required by any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Men, for they always thought that the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Sense is valid and fully satisfactory.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> likewise in his Sermon, in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. builds
upon this Rock, <hi>We are Witnesses</hi> (saith he) <hi>of all
things which he</hi> (i. e. Christ) <hi>did both in the Land of the
Iews and in</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>whom they slew and hang'd on a
Tree: Him God raised up the third Day, and shew'd him
openly, not to all the People, but to witnesses chosen before of
God, even to us who did eat and drink with him after he
rose from the dead,</hi> ver. 39, 40, 41. We Apostles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
Christ our Master when he went about
doing Good, and working Miracles; we were no
idle and remiss Spectators of the marvellous things he
did in all places where the Jews inhabited. And tho
they maliciously put him to death, and thought that
then they had made an end of him, and that he should
never appear again; yet we are Witnesses that the
same <hi>Iesus</hi> who died on the Cross rose again within
three Days, and appear'd publickly to us all: we
familiarly convers'd with him, we saw him and we
heard him; and when one of our number was back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to believe his miraculous Return from the dead,
he bid him approach nearer to him, and feel and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
him, that by that as well as other Senses he might
be satisfied of our Saviour's Resurrection. We are
certain therefore of it, and by consequence of all
the other Doctrines which we preach. We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to sensible Demonstration: This clears us of all
Imposture. And hear what the same Apostle saith
in one of his Epistles, <hi>We have not followed</hi> (saith he)
<hi>cunningly devised Fables, when we made known unto you
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:65397:226"/>
the power and coming of our Lord Iesus Christ, but were
Eye-witnesses of his Majesty</hi> (2 Pet. 1. 16.) <hi>i. e.</hi> l, and
<hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn saw</hi> such things at Christ's Transigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which are an undoubted Proof of his Divinity.
And in the next Verse but one he adds that they were
<hi>Ear-witnesses</hi> also, for speaking of the Voice which
came to Christ from the excellent Glory, he saith,
<hi>This Voice which came from Heaven we heard, when we
were with him in the holy Mount,</hi> ver. 18. As much
as to say, you have no cause, Brethren, to fear any
Imposture from us, you may be easily convinced that
we come with no Fables and Forgeries, because we
give you assurance of what we say from our own
Eyes and Ears; we go upon sure Ground, our very
Senses report to us what we declare to you: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you may be confident of the truth of it.
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as well as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> makes his Appeal to the
Verdict of Sense, in the matter of Christ's Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>He was seen of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and then of the Twelve: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he was seen of above five hundred Brethren at once;
after that he was seen of</hi> James, <hi>then of all the Apostles,
and last of all he was seen of me also,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 5, &amp;c.
He proves that Christ rose from the dead, because the
<hi>bodily Sight</hi> gave Evidence of it: This is one good
Argument, or rather Demonstration of the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the thing.</p>
                     <p>Many other places there are to the same effect, but
I will mention but one more, and that is of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
1 Epist. 1 chap. 1, 2, 3. ver. <hi>That which was from the
beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with
our Eyes, which we have looked upon, and our Hands have
handled of the Word of Life (for the Life was manifested,
and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto
you that eternal Life which was with the Father, and was

declare we unto you, that ye also may have Fellowship with us.</hi>
Take this short Gloss upon the whole, <hi>That which was
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:65397:227"/>
from the beginning,</hi> those things that were destined from
Eternity, and were of old all along prefigured, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
and foretold by <hi>Moses<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> and the Prophets, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Christ and the Gospel; <hi>which we</hi> (who are
Apostles) <hi>have heard</hi> from God the Father, testifying
and audibly speaking from Heaven, and by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of his Son Christ Jesus; <hi>which we have seen with
our Eyes, viz.</hi> Christ's many Miracles, and all the
strange and wonderful things that happen by his
coming, these we have beheld with our bodily Eyes,
with our own Eyes, not relying on others; <hi>which we
have looked upon,</hi> what we have narrowly pried into,
what we have often viewed, and not slightly and
perfunctorily; <hi>and our Hands have handled:</hi> Here the
third Sense, the <hi>Touch,</hi> is concern'd. Before Christ's
Death, and after his Resurrection we discern'd him to
be a true Man even by the Sense of <hi>Feeling:</hi> And in
many other things which happen'd this Sense was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested,
as in the Earthquake at Christ's Passion, and
in the shaking of the House where the Apostles were
met, and in sundry other Occurrences. Thus our
<hi>Senses</hi> have been exercis'd and employ'd about the
Matters which belong to <hi>the Word of Life, i. e.</hi> Christ,
who is called <hi>the Word,</hi> and <hi>the Life,</hi> and here (<hi>ver.</hi> 2.)
he is called <hi>the Eternal Life which was with the Father.</hi>
Or <hi>by the Word of Life</hi> are meant the things relating
to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which sheweth us the way to eternal
Life. <hi>For the Life was manifested, viz.</hi> by Christ's
assuming our Flesh, and conversing with Men on Earth;
and the Grace of God in the Gospel hath appeared,
and manifested it self to all Men by his coming. <hi>And
we have seen it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which we have seen and heard declare we unto you.</hi> By
all these ways the Doctrine of the Gospel is cleared
and manifested, and proved to be true. We have
found it to be so by the Testimony of our Senses, and
accordingly we preach, we pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:65397:227"/>
declare these things to you, and not only to you, but
to all the World, that they may be ascertained of the
<hi>Truth of the Christian Religion,</hi> and come into the same
<hi>Fellowship</hi> with us, and heartily imbrace the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Apostles, tho divinely inspired, appeal'd
to the rational Evidence of <hi>Sense,</hi> for they knew that
this was satisfactory to all sober and intelligent Men,
and that the highest Evidence that can be desired for
Proof of Matter of Fact is the Testimony of those
Persons who were Eye and Ear-witnesses of it; and
that if the Testimony of the bodily Senses by not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
there is no Certainty of Religion, or of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation by which Religion was convey'd, for
this was by the Ministry of the Senses, especially
Hearing and Seeing. Nay, the Veracity and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God may justly be call'd in question if you take
away this Evidence, for how can we attain to Truth
unless God communicates it to us? But how can he do
that if our Senses (being rightly disposed, <hi>viz.</hi> when
the Organ is sound, the Medium fitly qualified, and the
distance of the Object duly proportion'd) be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if when we are really perswaded that we see
and hear such things, we do not see them or hear
them? Must we not hence conclude that <hi>God</hi> deludes
us, and that in a Matter which concerns his Glory
and our own Happiness, and consequently that his
Sincerity and Truth are impaired? Into this Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
must they needs run who deny the Truth of the
Senses given us by God. And upon this it will follow
that there are no <hi>credible Ear or Eye-witnesses,</hi> and so no
certain Testimony of Matter of Fact. If the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our Senses be not to be made use of, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
as authentick, then all the Passages recorded
in the New Testament, concerning Christ's Birth,
Life, Miracles, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension
are of no Credit: For these are to be proved, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Matters of Fact are, by Testimony of Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:65397:228"/>
who heard or saw those things. In short, if
our Senses be false, the whole Gospel is a Lie and a
Cheat, for ought we know: For it is impossible we
should have any assurance of the truth of any thing
there unless God hath given Men Senses which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of discerning one thing from another, and
unless the Persons likewise who attested those things
from the Verdict of their Senses were Men that might
be credited. And this is the present Case which we
are concerned in, as I shall make evident by the next
Particular.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Testimony</hi> of the Apostles and other Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
who lived when our Saviour was upon Earth,
and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> heard and saw the things done by him, is the
Testimony of <hi>credible Persons,</hi> and consequently is an
unquestionable Proof of the Truth and Reality of
those things which they attest. That they were <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Persons</hi> will appear if you consider;</p>
                     <p>1. They had sufficient Means to acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
certainly whether the things which they attested
were true or no. This is the main thing which is to
be cleared, and therefore I will chiefly insist on this.
That they were furnished with sufficient Ability to
know what they related, methinks should not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by any one who considers that they were no Fools
or Children, they were not mad or senseless, they
had a share of Understanding as well as others, and
their Ears and Eyes were as good as other Mens.
The things which they related might evidently be
known by them, being Objects of common Sense,
and of general Cognizance. Can there be any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
then to think that these Persons were not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Judges, as well as others, of these Matters? But
as they were naturally capable of judging in these
things, so I will make it evident that they had all
Means and Opportunities of informing themselves
throughly concerning those things which they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:65397:228"/>
Some of them were Eye-witnesses, others
Ear-witnesses of what they report, and sometimes
both: or else they certainly informed themselves of
the truth from others who saw or heard those things.
What St. <hi>Luke</hi> professeth of himself is true of all the
Evang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lical and Apostolical Writers, <hi>they had perfect
understanding of all things from the very first,</hi> Luke 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>As for the four <hi>Evangelists,</hi> two of them, <hi>Matthew</hi>
and <hi>Iohn,</hi> were of the number of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who
were Persons particularly chosen out by Christ on
purpose to be Eye-witnesses of his Actions: and some
have infer'd from <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 21, 22. that it was a necessary
Qualification of an <hi>Apostle</hi> to be an <hi>Eye-witness.</hi> It
is certain that these two forenamed Persons were such:
They lived with their Master, and were<note n="*" place="bottom">

his Miracles, and saw what they writ. The latter
of these especially was made more than ordinarily
conscious to Christ's Words and Actions, and was his
Familiar and Intimate. The other two Evangelists
were not Apostles, but they inhabited and convers'd
in the same Regions where Christ did these things,
and at the same time when he acted them. <hi>Herodotus,
Plutarch,</hi> and other Historians writ of things done in
former Ages, and afar off in other Countries and
Kingdoms, which makes their Relations to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
sometimes. But these Men lived in the Places
and Times, where and when the things were done,
and therefore they could easily attain to a true and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Account of them. I cannot say, with<note n="†" place="bottom">Praesat. in Matth.</note> 
                        <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
that St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> did not see our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
but I grant that most of the things related by
them were not within their own sight or hearing.
Yet this is certain, that they receiv'd what they writ
from those who were both Ear and Eye-witnesses.
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:65397:229"/>
St. <hi>Mark</hi> was a Disciple of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
acquainted with Christ's Actions, and could
inform him concerning every Particular of his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
Life and Death. St. <hi>Luke</hi> had St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
and St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Writings to direct him. And he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
moreover (<hi>chap.</hi> 1. 1, 2.) that he receiv'd all
he writ from those very Persons who were <hi>Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</hi>
Besides, he was a constant Companion of
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had all those things revealed to him by
God in Heaven, which is as much as if he had seen
and heard them. As for the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> St.
<hi>Luke</hi> could not but give a full and perfect Account of
the Actions related there, because he was an insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Attendant and Associate of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> about whom
most of that Book is spent. <hi>The Epistles</hi> contain chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
holy Doctrines, divine Counsels, seasonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs,
and pathetick Exhortations, but they are
not wholly destitute of Matter of Fact. They were
writ either by those that were properly stiled <hi>Apostles,</hi>
as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Iames,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> and St. <hi>Iude,</hi> who
therefore could not be ignorant of what they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning Christ and the things he did: or they
were writ by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was an <hi>Apostle extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
immediately called and sent by God to preach
the Gospel, being first fully instructed in all Matters
relating to Christ and it by divine Revelation.</p>
                     <p>It might be yet further made evident that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the New Testament had perfect knowledg of
what they writ, and that they were sufficient Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of what they relate, because the Matters of
Fact were so frequent, and so often repeated, as also
because they were done near them, and not far off,
and so they could easily know the truth of them:
moreover, because they were done publickly, and in
the open Light, and not in a Corner: because they
were done before so many Witnesses, before Apostles
and Disciples, and thousands of the People, who
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:65397:229"/>
were Spectators and Auditors of what happen'd.
I might add that the <hi>Evangelists</hi> publish'd the Stories
of Christ and his Doings when thousands were alive
who knew the Facts, and might have oppugned them
if they would: but they did not. Especially St.
<hi>Matthew</hi> publish'd his History while yet the Persons
lived on whom Christ's Miracles were wrought, and
innumerable others who were Witnesses thereof were
then surviving. Hence it appears that it was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for the Evangelical Writers to conspire and
combine together in a Lie, and to deceive the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if they had had a mind to it. They might soon
have been confuted if the things they attested had
been false. The Cheat was easily to be found out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
so many Witnesses, and in things so often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and in the Face of the World. Therefore it is
morally impossible that there should be a Cheat and
Delusion, these things being thus.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Personal Qualities</hi> of the Evangelical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and other Christians who attested these things
argue that they were <hi>credible Witnesses,</hi> and that their
Testimony was worthy of all acceptation. This is
clear from such Considerations as these, <hi>viz.</hi> that most
of them were <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>unlearned</hi> Men, and so were
not fit Persons to devise these things. It is no ways
probable that they could invent such high and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
matters, yea indeed no humane Wit was able to
do it. This shews that they were not deceivers, and
that they did not voluntarily deliver a falshood.
Likewise, it is to be remembred that they were no
idle and loose Persons, but were of an honest condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and way of Life, they were poor Tradesmen and
Fishermen that lived on their work and lawful callings,
and therefore it is altogether improbable that they
were designing Men, and that they made it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to cheat, and impose upon the World. Again,
their Integrity, Candor, and Simplicity, appeared
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:65397:230"/>
most signally in their Writings, seeing they relate
their own failings, and impartially set down the
grossest miscarriages of their Brethren, as <hi>Thomas</hi>'s
Infidelity, <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying of his Master, the Apostles
flying from Christ at his Passion, and many other
things: which none but Honest, Plain and True-hearted
Men would have recorded and transmitted to
Posterity. Further, what they did was not out of
Ambition and Love of Honour: for Pride, self-seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
vain Glory, over-valuing of Men, crying up <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> were Vices and Practices which
they both preach'd and writ against. And to let you
see that this was not counterfeit, their Lives answer'd
to what they professed: in their Carriage and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
none were more humble and self-denying;
which proves that they acted not out of Applause,
and Affectation of Honour from the People, but were
sincere and faithful in what they did. Nor could they
speak or act for Gain and Wordly Profit, for they
were Men that despised Riches as much as Honour:
They lived meanly and poorly, and were beholden
to the Charity of others for a subsistence. Which
shews that they had no design to enrich themselves,
and to grow great in the World. They foresaw,
and knew, and perswaded themselves of this before-hand,
that their Profession would expose them to the
greatest Dangers and Hazards, and that Bonds, and
Imprisonment, and Death it self would attend them;
yet notwithstanding this they resolved to preach the
Gospel, and to follow their Master whatever befel
them. And lastly, to give you an irrefragable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of their Integrity and Sincerity, most of
them laid down their Lives to testify and confirm
what they had deliver'd: they sealed the Gospel with
their Blood, they died for what they preach'd and
writ. This is a sign they were in earnest. Thus if
you consider the Personal Qualifications of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:65397:230"/>
and Evangelists, who were Witnesses of Christ's
Actions, you must necessarily grant that they were
Persons to be believed, that their Evidence is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,
and we have no reason to think they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
themselves, or deluded us. For the Proof of
<hi>Fact</hi> consisteth chiefly in <hi>Witnesses,</hi> who must be <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>honest Men.</hi> This makes them to be <hi>credible
Persons;</hi> and such were the Relators of those things
which concern our Saviour. Wherefore, to have them
attested by a sufficient number of Persons of that
Character, is enough to assure the <hi>Truth</hi> of them. We
have no cause to dispute whether those things were
so or no: but on the contrary we have good Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a firm Assent to them.</p>
                     <p>But tho the Disciples and Apostles did not cheat us,
yet perhaps we are deluded by <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>se that came after
them.</hi> It may be <hi>they</hi> have not truly deliver'd things
to us. How can we depend on their Words? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
are oftentimes false. There are untrue Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of things which are very near to us: much
more may there be of Actions which are so far off,
and were so long ago. How then shall we credit His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and Tradition, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church's delivering
these things to us? I answer, we may and we ought
to believe the Persons who receiv'd these things from
the Apostles, <hi>viz.</hi> the pious Teachers, Fathers and
Bishops of the Primitive Church, and the Godly and
Faithful Christians of those days; we ought (I say)
to credit these as well as the Apostles themselves: for
we have the most cogent Reasons to perswade us that
they truly and faithfully delivered down to us those
things. This I will make good from the Consideration;
1. Of the <hi>Persons</hi> that transmitted these things. 2. Of
the Evidence of the <hi>Cause.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, as to the <hi>Persons,</hi> I will consider both their
<hi>Lives</hi> and their <hi>Deaths.</hi> Their Lives are sufficient
proofs of their Integrity in delivering the Scriptures
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:65397:231"/>
of the New Testament to us, and of their confident
belief of the Truth of all that is contain'd in them.
The Primitive Christians lived after another rate
than we do now: They did not wrangle and quarrel
as we do, they did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight, and devour one another,
as the manner of too many is of latter times, but they
were remarkable for their mutual Love and Concord,
for their Humility, Meekness and Condescension to
one another: and they were admired for their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
Sobriety, Self-denial and Patience; they were
eminent for their Piety towards God, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and Righteous dealing with all Men. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
practised what they preached, and the People
were ambitious to imitate their Preachers; and both
were singularly Good and Virtuous. This was it
which gain'd so many Proselytes to Christianity in
those first times, this brought them to a perswasion
of the Truth and Reality of Christ's Doctrine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when <hi>Origen</hi> had excellently proved the Truth of
Christianity to <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> that noble Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
ingenuously confessed that he was more convinced
of the Truth of that Religion by the humble and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carriage of Christians than by all <hi>Origen</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The exemplary and blameless Conversation
of those Primitive Professors argued that the Doctrine
and Principles of their Religion were real and certain.
For how can it enter into any sober Mans thoughts
that such holy and upright Men (true followers of
the Apostles and Disciples of Christ) would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
confessed and owned the Christian way, unless
they had been throughly convinced of the Truth of
it, and that it was the very same which was confess'd
and acknowledg'd by the Apostles themselves? These
Holy and Godly Men made Conscience of a Lie, and
counted it a heinous Crime to falsify: yea, they
esteem'd it no less than a damnable Sin to disbelieve
or misreport those things concerning Christ and the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:65397:231"/>
Christian Doctrines. They were really perswaded
in their Minds that their Salvation lay at stake, that
their Eternal Welfare or Everlasting Ruin were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in these things: And can you imagin then that
they would report them falsly, and impose upon the
World by delivering things which were counterfeit?</p>
                     <p>Again, as the <hi>Lives</hi> so the <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of
the Saints in the Primitive Days, and in the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ages are an undeniable Argument of the Truth of
what was deliver'd to them, and of what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to us. They underwent the most exquisite
Pains and Torments with ineffable Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
and nothing could prevail with them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Christian Religion: insomuch that when
the Pagan Adversaries in those days would express
any thing to be <hi>impossible,</hi> they did it thus,<note n="*" place="bottom">

Doctrine.</hi> This was a thing not to be effected; for
those Persons first of all forsook their worldly Goods,
and then parted with their Lives to hold fast their
Religion. This patient Suffering and undaunted Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of so many thousands is an unquestionable Proof
of the Truth of Christianity. For those enlightned
and sanctified Men would never lay down their Lives
to maintain a Falshood, and to perpetuate a Lie.
No: they knew whom they believed in, and for whom
they suffer'd, and that made them so couragious.
We may conclude then that the Christian Doctrine is
confirm'd by the Blood of those Worthy Men: those
expiring Saints did <hi>testify the Truth of Christianity,</hi> and
therefore they are stiled <hi>Martyrs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>Evidence of the Cause</hi> is an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Argument of the <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of these
things which I am speaking of. There is this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heap of Evidences. 1. A <hi>great Presumption,</hi> arising
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:65397:232"/>
from just Causes and Circumstances, yea and from a
multiplicity of them: which in all Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is of considerable weight and value with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Judges. This first, but lowest sort of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
the <hi>Christian Church</hi> since our Saviour hath not
been destitute of, for there were never higher <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions</hi>
in any Cause under Heaven than there were
in this. But we need not mention this, when we
have, 2. The <hi>Notoriety of the Facts, i. e.</hi> when the
things in trial are openly and commonly known,
when they are avouched by publick Fame, and the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Vogue of Men. And that this was the case of
<hi>Christianity</hi> ever since Christ left the Earth, cannot
be denied by any Man of Modesty and Truth.
3. The <hi>Succession of Christians and Churches</hi> in the
World is a plain Proof that they verily believed
those things which made them Christians and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Hereupon they deliver'd to us those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
which they receiv'd from the Hands of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
and Apostles: by their transmitting them
to Posterity they shew that they believe them to be
sacred and certain Verities. 4. <hi>The Succession of
Bishops and Pastors</hi> is an other Evidence, for it
was their Office to read publickly the Scriptures
of the New Testament, and to preach the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
contain'd in them, and consequently to own
them to be Truth; which is a good Motive to us
to do the same. 5. The frequent <hi>Disputes</hi> which
Christians in all Ages have held with those who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the Scripture and Christianity, are no mean
Testimony in this Cause. 6. To these may be added
the <hi>famous Writings</hi> of the Christians in the several
Centuries, their <hi>Apologies, Dialogues, Sermons, Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Orations, Commentaries, Histories:</hi> All which
proclaim their serious and firm Belief of what they
have convey'd down to us. 7. All Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
have deliver'd to us certain <hi>Symbols</hi> or <hi>Articles of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:65397:232"/>
Belief,</hi> which they reckon'd to be the Standards of
Evangelical Faith and Truth. 8. The <hi>Constant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church,</hi> and <hi>the publick Worship of God</hi> in
the solemn Assemblies of Christians ever since the
days of the Apostles, the setting apart a Day for
that Worship, the reading of the Scriptures at such
times, the instructing the People out of them, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating
the Lord's Supper, the constant custom of
openly rehearsing and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>essing the Christian Belief,
the Prayers and Praises offer'd to God in the name of
Christ, the yearly Commemoration of the Birth,
Death, and Resurrection of our Saviour, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Baptism which acknowledgeth the <hi>Father,</hi>
the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> 9. The sundry <hi>Decrees
and Canons of Synods and Councils</hi> held in the Christian
Churches. Lastly, the many <hi>Laws and Edicts of
Christian Emperours and Princes</hi> in defence and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of our most holy Religion.</p>
                     <p>These and all the rest before-named are clear
Proofs and Evidences that the Evangelical Writings,
which contain the Doctrine and Actions of our blessed
Lord, were rightly and truly convey'd to us, and
that we are in possession of the same Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which <hi>Christ</hi> himself founded, and deliver'd to
his Apostles and Disciples. The <hi>Tradition</hi> of these
things is true and certain, and we may safely rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. For tho the Authority of divine Truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not wholly on the Testimony of the Church
(for then the Authority of the Scripture would not
be Divine but Humane, and consequently not the
Word of God, but of Man) yet the Church doth
yield its Testimony to the Scripture, and that Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
or Tradition is a good Ground of Belief.
For <hi>Tradition</hi> is one way of communicating Matters
of Faith and Fact to us. By it we have them trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to us, but this is neither the grand Motive, nor
the Rule of our Faith: yet it is the Medium or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
to convey the Belief of such things to us: and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:65397:233"/>
we are to use it and prize it as such, and to thank
God that we have this (among other Means) to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
us in the Truth of the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto I have consider'd the <hi>Testimony of Friends.</hi>
I will shew you in the next place that even <hi>Strangers</hi>
and <hi>Enemies,</hi> viz. <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> bear witness to
the Truth of Christianity.</p>
                     <p>First, as for the <hi>Iews,</hi> if Christ had not been
thought by them to have been some extraordinary
Person, yea to be of the Holy Ghost miraculously,
why did they not prosecute <hi>Mary</hi> for an Adulteress?
The Sin of Adultery was severely punish'd by their
<hi>Law,</hi> and it was a very reproachful Crime. You
may be sure they would have urged this hard, to the
disgracing of the Son through the Mother. But
tho <hi>Ioseph</hi> denied him to be his Son, and consequently
she fell under the Law, yet you read no where that
the <hi>Iews</hi> made use of this against her: which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
their tacit approving of Christ, and that his
Birth was extraordinary and divine.<note n="*" place="bottom">On the Word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Suidas</hi> tells
us that Christ was chosen one of the Priests of the
Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> upon the death of one of the
two and twenty, for his singular Piety and excellent
Doctrine. <hi>Iosephus</hi> his Testimony of <hi>Christ</hi> is well
known; and St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> his forerunner, is
made mention of by most of the <hi>Hebrew Writers</hi> with
exceeding Praise and Admiration of his Holiness.
But I will con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ine my self to those Instances which are
recorded by the Evangelists. St. <hi>Luke</hi> observes that
when <hi>he taught in their Synagogues, he was glorified of
all,</hi> Luke 4. 15. And in the following Verses he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
a particular Instance of his preaching in one
of their Synagogues at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and then adds, <hi>all
bare him witness, and wonder'd at the gracious Words
which proceeded out of his Mouth,</hi> ver. 22. Even some
of the Jewish People who believ'd not in Christ, cried
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:65397:233"/>
out, <hi>he is a good Man,</hi> John 7. 12. Others said, <hi>of
a truth this is the Prophet,</hi> ver. 40. And others, <hi>this is
the Christ,</hi> ver. 41. And the Jewish Officers who were
sent by the High Priests to lay hands on him, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his wise Deportment and excellent Discourse,
and freely declared that <hi>never Man spake like this Man,</hi>
ver. 46. No one ever spoke Matters of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and concern, and with that Simplicity and
Plainness, that Authority and Efficacy which he did.
When <hi>Herod</hi> harangued the People, they cried out,
<hi>It is the Voice of God:</hi> But it was only the flattering
Voice of the Multitude which made his such. Here
it was otherwise, it was the real Voice of the true
God, and his very <hi>Enemies</hi> attest the unparallel'd Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of it.</p>
                     <p>Christ was confessed and owned by the <hi>Iews</hi> in a
most signal manner when he rid into <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on an
Ass, and when they strewed the way with <hi>Palm-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
and when all the People applauded him, and
treated him as some great Conqueror or mighty
Prince, <hi>Mat. 21. 8, &amp;c.</hi> For they were wont to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
the coming of such Persons to a place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that manner. So the valiant <hi>Simon</hi> was receiv'd
after his Military Success, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 13. 51. So the
<hi>Old Grecians</hi> in their <hi>Olympick</hi> Games after Victory
wore wreaths of <hi>Palms,</hi> as a reward of Conquerors.
And sometimes they bore the Branches of <hi>Palm-Trees</hi>
in their Hands as the Emblem of <hi>Victory,</hi> because the
Branches of this Tree grow streight and stately, as
<hi>the</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Palma,</hi> whence the Tree hath its name.</note> 
                        <hi>Hand extended;</hi> and tho they be loaded with
much weight, yet they bear up against it, and shoot
upwards. Hence it was that this Honour of <hi>bearing
Palm-branches</hi> (and sometimes Branches of other
Trees besides the Palm) was given to Princes in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.
Thus <hi>Heliodorus</hi> saith that <hi>Hydaspes</hi> the King
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:65397:234"/>
sent before him Harbingers of his Victory, <hi>shaking
Boughs of Palm in token of it.</hi> Hence he that was
generally applauded, and received publickly with
the Acclamations of the People, was called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
because they did not only strow <hi>Boughs</hi>
but <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> in his way: which sort
of Honour was stiled <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.
Nor were they contented with this sign of Favour,
but they used to affix on the <hi>Doors</hi> of great Men
the <hi>Boughs of Palm</hi> especially: which Honour<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. In Rhetor, doctore.</note> 
                        <hi>Lucian</hi>
takes notice of, telling us that green Palm-branches
were set up at the Doors of the Rhetoricians. Many
more Testimonies might be alledged to this purpose.
And I could add also that this bearing of Branches
was used in the <hi>Worship</hi> of the Pagans, it being a
Testimony of Honour to their Gods. How fitly
then did it come to pass by the over-ruling Hand of
Providence that the <hi>Messias,</hi> who was truly <hi>God and
King,</hi> was receiv'd by the People with <hi>Palm-branches?</hi>
He came in this <hi>triumphant</hi> manner into <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
was saluted with Cries of <hi>Hosanna,</hi> and with that
Gratulatory Benediction, <hi>Blessed is the King of</hi> Israel
<hi>that cometh in the name of the Lord</hi> (John 12. 13.) to
testify that his <hi>Kingdom</hi> was come, that he was to be
<hi>victorious</hi> over Death and Hell, and that he was to be
a mighty <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Deliverer.</hi> I will briefly add
two or three other Testimonies of the <hi>Iews: Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi>
the High-priest <hi>prophesied of Christ,</hi> John 11. 50,
51. One of the Thieves on the Cross (if he were
a <hi>Iew,</hi> which some have question'd) acknowledg'd
Christ, and cleared him; <hi>This Man,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath
done nothing amiss,</hi> Luke 23. 41. And even <hi>Iudas</hi> who
betrayed our Saviour confess'd his Innocency, <hi>I have
sinn'd in betraying innocent Blood,</hi> Mat. 27. 4.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:65397:234"/>
Secondly, <hi>Heathens</hi> bear witness to Christ and the
Truth of the Christian Religion. He was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
and ador'd by the <hi>wise Men</hi> that came from
the <hi>East.</hi> Tho he was condemn'd by <hi>Pilate,</hi> yet he
was first acquitted by him, he declaring that <hi>he found
no fault in him at all,</hi> John 18. 38. And his Wife sent
to him, when he was on the Bench, <hi>to have nothing to
do with that just Man,</hi> Mat. 27. 19. When a Title
was to be set over the Cross, <hi>Pilate</hi> wrote Christ
<hi>the King of the Iews,</hi> and would not alter it tho he
was told of it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 22. The <hi>Centurion</hi> who
had at that time the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> place, and was to see the
Execution perform'd, when he saw what happen'd
utter'd these words, <hi>Truly this was the Son of God,</hi>
Mat. 26. 54. He being a <hi>Pagan</hi> did not mean that
Christ, the Person who then suffer'd, was the Son of
God by eternal Generation. It is not the same Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
with that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> concerning Christ, <hi>of a
Truth thou art the Son of God,</hi> Mat. 14. 33. nor of the
Disciples, <hi>we believe that thou art Christ the Son of the
living God,</hi> Mat. 16. 16. But he meant he was a
brave and excellent Person, a holy and good Man,
unworthy of that which he underwent, one who had
deserved nothing of what he suffered. And that this
is the meaning is plain from St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who relateth
this Passage of the Centurion thus, <hi>certainly this was
a righteous Man,</hi> Luke 23. 47. So he explains St.
<hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pliny,</hi> a Heathen Governour under the Roman
Emperour, speaks honourably of the Christians, and
he hath left a particular Testimony of their fair and
peaceable Demeanour, as well as of their early De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
in a Letter which he writ to <hi>Trajan.</hi> The
Publick <hi>Archives</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the known Writings
and Monuments of the <hi>Heathens</hi> preserv'd the Memory
of many notable things relating to Christ. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Apologies</hi> for the Christians often
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:65397:235"/>
appeals to these, and bids them consult the <hi>Censual
Tables</hi> and other publick Records which testify of
those things. In brief, <hi>Profane History</hi> relateth many
things of our Saviour, his Person, his Actions, his
Death, the Prodigies that accompanied it, the great
Changes made by that Religion in the World, and
many other things appertaining to it, of which I
shall largely speak in another place. Thus God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
the Hearts of <hi>Enemies</hi> to testify the Truth of
the Gospel. And certainly this sort of Testimony
is very considerable and convincing:<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <hi>The Confession
of Adversaries</hi> is ever look'd upon as such, this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly thought to be authentick.</p>
                     <p>Nay, I could proceed further, and shew you that the
<hi>Infernal Spirit,</hi> who is emphatically stil'd <hi>the Adversary,</hi>
and hath shew'd himself the most implacable <hi>Enemy</hi> of
Christ and his Cause, hath yet born witness to the
<hi>Truth</hi> of them. Our Saviour is attested by Satan: the
Devils acknowledg and confess him to be <hi>the Son of
God,</hi> Mat. 8. 29. and at another time they confess they
<hi>know who he is, the Holy One of God,</hi> Mark 1. 24. The
very impure Daemons set forth the Praises of Christ's
Followers, <hi>Acts 16. 17. These Men,</hi> say they, <hi>are the
Servants of the most high God, who shew unto us the way of
Salvation.</hi> We read that one of the <hi>Pagan Oracles</hi>
owned the <hi>Child Iesus:</hi> and if that were true which
some think, that the <hi>Sibyls</hi> were acted by an <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi>
there is further proof that the <hi>Devil</hi> bears <hi>Testimony</hi> to
the <hi>Holy Iesus,</hi> and that that lying Spirit voucheth the
Truth of the Gospel. But here I must confess I have
digressed, and not observed the Bounds which I set
my self, for I propounded to speak only of <hi>Humane</hi>
and <hi>Divine Testimony.</hi> The former I hope I have
finish'd to the satisfaction of sober and considerate
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:65397:235"/>
Persons. I have evinced the <hi>Truth of Christianity</hi> by
all these Proofs and Evidences, <hi>viz.</hi> by the attestation
of our Senses, by History, by Tradition, by Tongues
and Pens, by Speeches and Writings, by the Church
and the World, by Friends and Enemies, and by all
things that prove any other Relations, or give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
concerning any other matters of Fact. So much
concerning <hi>Humane Testimony,</hi> which is able to create
in us a Moral Certainty and the strongest Humane
Faith imaginable, and which is very serviceable to
sit and prepare us for the <hi>Divine Testimony,</hi> which I
am next to speak of.</p>

                        <p>All the ways of Divine Revelation under the
Mosaick Dispensation were made use of under
the Christian one. Voices. The Testimony
of Angels. Visions. Dreams. The Holy
Spirit. The fulfilling of the Prophesies of the

of the Truth of the New Testament. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
concerning the Birth of our Saviour.
Isa. 7. 14. cleared from the Cavils of the
Jewish Expositors. It is shew'd how these
Words may have reference to something in
King Ahaz's Days, and yet belong to Christ's
Birth. Prophesies in the Old Testament that
relate to Christ's Life and Actions. Others
that refer to his Sufferings and Death. Some
that foretel his Resurrection and Ascension.
Other more general Predictions concerning him.
Several prophetick Passages concerning the
Branch proved to be spoken of Christ. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Word for the Branch is refer'd to in the
New Testament. The two Zacharies agree.
The Iews Objection, viz. that the Messias was
to be another kind of Person than what
Jesus of Nazareth was, answered. Another
Objection, viz. that the Messias was to bring
universal Peace, answer'd. A third Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Iews, viz. that their Sins have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the Messias's coming at the promised
time, answer'd. The Objection raised from
2 Sam. 7. 13. removed by clearing the sense
of the Text. Other extravagant Fancies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Messias caus'd by their mistaking
the Prophesies of the Old Testament concerning
Christ's coming. The Conclusion, that all
the Prophesies concerning the Messias are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd

of the Truth of Christianity.</p>

the whole Institution of the Gospel are confirmed
by <hi>Divine Testimony.</hi> We are certain that the Christian
Religion is from God, and consequently is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>true,</hi> because it is attested, 1. By all the ways
of Divine Revelation used heretofore. 2. By the
fulfilling of all the Prophesies of the Old Testament.
3. By the exerting of Miracles. 4. By the strange and
stupendous prevailing of the Gospel. 5. By the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which God inflicted on the Enemies of it.</p>
                     <p>First, I will shew that by all the ways whereby
God spoke under the <hi>Mosaick Dispensation,</hi> he spoke
likewise under the <hi>Christian one;</hi> and this being <hi>after</hi>
that, it will at the same time convince the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their Dispensation is abolished, and confirm <hi>Christians</hi>
in the belief of the Divine Authority of the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they are now under. The <hi>Revelations,</hi> I
say, under the Gospel are of the same kind with those
before. I will reduce them to these following Heads.</p>
                     <p>1. The Jews had their <hi>Bath Kol, i. e.</hi> an Audible
and Articulate Sound or Voice from Heaven, and so
have we <hi>Christians.</hi> Our Saviour had this Divine
Testimony thrice, first at his Baptism, <hi>Lo, a voice
from Heaven saying, This is my beloved Son in whom I
am well pleased,</hi> Mat. 3. 17. God the Father again by
a <hi>Voice</hi> bore witness to him when he was on the
Mount with <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and was there
transfigured; <hi>Mat. 17. 5. Mark 9. 1. Behold, a
Voice out of the Cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son
in whom I am well pleased: hear him.</hi> Of which you
will find St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaking in <hi>Epist. 2. Ch. 1. v.</hi> 17.
And thirdly, at his Passion, when he was praying to
his Father, <hi>there came a Voice from Heaven,</hi> and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that his Prayer was heard: <hi>and the People that stood
by and heard it, said that it thunder'd: others said, an
Angel spake to him,</hi> John 12. 28, 29. Thus Christ
was signally glorified by his Father, and declared by
him to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Son of God, by a <hi>Voice from
Heaven,</hi> attended with a kind of <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nder.</hi> To this
we may annex <hi>God's speaking in a rushing mighty wind,</hi>
on the day of Pentecost, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 2. And Christ Jesus
himself, being in Heaven, spake to <hi>Saul</hi> thence by a
<hi>Voice,</hi> saying, Saul, Saul, <hi>why persecutest thou me?</hi> Acts 9. 4.
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> makes frequent mention of
a <hi>Voice</hi> speaking to him, and revealing great things to
him: where it is observable that <hi>Thunders</hi> and <hi>Voices</hi>
go together, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 5. and 8. 5. Thus the New
Testament as well as the Old had the benefit of that
Divine Oracle which the <hi>Iews</hi> stiled <hi>the Daughter of a
Voice, i. e.</hi> a Voice from Heaven declaring the Will
of God to Men. Afterwards, we are told in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:65397:237"/>
History that those who were set on work by
<hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, to rebuild the Temple at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
were defeated by <hi>Thunder,</hi> and a <hi>TERRIBLE
VOICE</hi> that accompanied it from Heaven, thereby
bearing witness to the Cause of Christianity.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Iews</hi> had the Testimony of <hi>Angels,</hi> and so
have <hi>Christians</hi> to confirm this Oeconomy. By these
Heavenly Messengers <hi>Zacharias</hi> had notice given him
of the approaching Birth of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, and the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had tidings brought her of the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Conception of the Holy Babe Jesus in her Womb:
and these were the Heralds that proclaimed the News
of his Birth to the Shepherds. One of this Celestial
Order appeared to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and warn'd him to flie into
<hi>Egypt</hi> with the Blessed Infant. These glorious Spirits
gave notice of Christ's Resurrection: and when he
ascended up to Heaven, another of this Celestial Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy
address'd himself to the Apostles, and assured
them that in the like manner Jesus should come again
to Judgment. Another of these Ministring Spirits
came to the devout <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and bid him send for
<hi>Peter</hi> that he might be the great and happy Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of converting him to the Christian Faith. The
<hi>Angel of God</hi> stood by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Night, when he
was on his dangerous Voyage, and ascertain'd him of
his safety, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 23. And sundry other instances
there are of <hi>Angels</hi> making known the will of God
unto Men in those early times of the Gospel, and
thereby attesting the Truth of Christianity.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Iews</hi> had the Mosaick Dispensation attested
by <hi>Visions,</hi> and we have the same way of Revelation
to ascertain us of the Truth of Christianity. Thus
<hi>Zachariah saw a Vision in the Temple</hi> relating to the
forerunner of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 22. The Apostles who
were at our Saviour's Transfiguration had the same
manner of discovery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 9. The Lord spake
to <hi>Ananias in a Vision,</hi> Acts 9. 10. You read of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:65397:237"/>
                        <hi>Vision,</hi> whereby he was taught not to despise the
Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 10, &amp;c. <hi>A Vision appeared to</hi> Paul
<hi>in the Night,</hi> Acts 16. 9. And again, the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
him in a Vision, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 9. Of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>
it is said that <hi>he looked up stedfastly into Heaven, and saw
the Glory of God (the Divine</hi> Shekinah) <hi>and Iesus standing
at the right hand of God,</hi> Acts 7. 55. And we read in
the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> had frequent
<hi>Visions.</hi> And hither may be refer'd those visible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
spoken of in the New Testament, as
the Holy Ghost's descending on Christ in the shape of
a Dove, after he was baptized: The appearance of
Cloven Tongues, like as of fire, over the Apostles
heads: The Light from Heaven which shone round
about St. <hi>Paul</hi> at his Conversion. All these appertain
to the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> the Glorious Presence and Lustre of
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Heavenly Majesty. And hither may be refer'd
the <hi>Radiant Presence</hi> of Christ, the bright and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Manifestation of his Person, which is often
mention'd by the Evangelists, <hi>Mat. 17. 2, 5. Mark</hi>
9. 3. and <hi>Rev. 1. 16. He dwelt among us</hi> (he was the
true <hi>Shekinah) and we behold his Glory, as the Glory of
the only begotten of the Father,</hi> John 1. 14.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Dreams</hi> were another sort of divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among the Jews, and these also were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to confirm the Truth of Christianity. For we
read that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was warned once and again in a
<hi>Dream</hi> concerning <hi>Mary</hi> whom he had espo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sed, and
concerning the blessed Babe, <hi>Mat. 1. 20. chap.</hi> 2.
12, 13, 19. And <hi>Pilate</hi>'s <hi>Wife suffer'd many things
in a Dream</hi> because of Christ, who was then standing
at the Bar before her Husband, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 19. But
because these Operations on the Imagination by
Dreams are more liable to mistakes than Visions and
other kinds of Revelation, we have but few Instances
of this. However, we are not wholly destitute of this
Testimony under the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="462" facs="tcp:65397:238"/>5. There was among the Jews that which they
signally call'd <hi>the Holy Spirit, viz.</hi> when Men were
wonderfully and extraordinarily stir'd up to deliver
the Will of God, to make some divine Discoveries
to the World, and to assert their holy Religion. This
was in <hi>Christ</hi> himself, <hi>Luke 4. 1. Acts</hi> 1. 2. &amp; 10. 38.
and in the <hi>Apostles, Acts</hi> 2. 4. &amp; 5. 8. &amp; 6. 3, 5. &amp; 7. 55.
&amp; 11. 24. &amp; 19. 6. and in all the holy Men that were
sent by him to preach the Gospel. By this they
were enabled to speak <hi>without any premeditation before
Rulers and Kings,</hi> Mark 13. 10, 11. for our Saviour
tells them, <hi>it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</hi>
With this the Apostles were all fill'd when they met
together on the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and utter'd such
divine and heavenly things. By this Prophetick
Afflation or Inspiration the Evangelists penn'd the
Scriptures of the New Testament: for tho these
Writings may be said to be humane Testimony as
they were writ by <hi>Men,</hi> yet these Persons being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and not speaking of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but by extraordinary Assistance, their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and Testimony are Divine. This is part of
that <hi>more sure Word of Prophesy</hi> spoken of by St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Ep. 2. ch. 1. ver.</hi> 19. which in the next Verse he
calls <hi>the Prophesy of the Scripture.</hi> By this Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
the Prophets and Apostles saw and foretold
what should come to pass afterwards. By this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Afflation the Apostles, tho mean and illiterate
Persons, preached the Gospel with that Authority
and Evidence which some of their most implacable
Enemies were not able to resist. These are the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Witnesses</hi> of the Truth of the Gospel-Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and of the Christian Religion.</p>
                     <p>Yea, even at this Day, and to the Worlds end, this
last Testimony, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is useful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
I do not mean any Miraculous gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but a special and peculiar assistance of it, such as all
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:65397:238"/>
regenerate Persons have experience of. That we may
be throughly certain that this or that was deliver'd
by God, that we may assuredly know that such things
were of Divine Revelation, there is need of this help
of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the internal Testimony of the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> such a hidden but powerful Operation of that
giver of all Grace whereby a firm Faith and certain
perswasion of the Truth of those things are wrought
in us. For, that we may be certain of Divine Truth,
first it is requisite that we be outwardly helped, that
we make use of Moral Arguments and Evidences,
that we attend to Reasons and Proofs; that we weigh
especially the several particular Testimonies in the
Word of God, the Scriptures of Truth. These in a
moral way will make it evident to the mind that this
or that which is propounded to us is Divinely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd,
and can proceed from no other but God. But
then besides these outward means, we must have our
minds inwardly illuminated by the <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> for it
is this alone which can inable us effectually to see and
discern the Light, and to take the force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which prove the several Truths, and to turn the
Moral Evidence into Divine Demonstration.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as I mention'd among the divers ways of
Revelation under the former Dispensations, the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Impulse,</hi> whereby Persons were instructed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to undertake and atchieve great things, so at the
erecting of the Gospel there was not wanting this way
of communicating the Divine will and pleasure. By
such an <hi>Impulse</hi> as this, Christ himself whipped the
buyers and sellers out of the Temple; by this
powerful <hi>Afflation</hi> his Apostles and Followers were
stir'd up to do strange and extraordinary things, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of which are mention'd in the <hi>Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
and many more in Ecclesiastical History, which
nothing but this Divine Motion could legitimate, it
being immediately from the Spirit, whereby they
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:65397:239"/>
were instructed as well as enabled to effect these won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The next <hi>Divine Testimony</hi> of the truth
and certainty of the Christian Oeconomy and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the <hi>fulfilling of the Prophesies of the Old Testament,
which had respect to the New.</hi> I have already in another
place (when I proved the <hi>Authority of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>)
insisted upon the fulfilling of the Prophesies of
the <hi>Old and New Testament</hi> as they are an attestation
of the <hi>Truth of those Sacred Writings.</hi> But at present
I am to mention only the Prophesies of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and among them only those that relate to the
<hi>Messias,</hi> and the circumstances which more nearly and
peculiarly appertain to him. And the producing of
these, and shewing how they were exactly fulfill'd,
will be a clear and demonstrative Argument of the
<hi>Truth of Christianity.</hi> For though <hi>Spinosa</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
Men that all the Prophesies in the Bible were
the mere result of a brisk Fancy, that there was no
foundation in the things themselves, but that Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
made all, yet surely the bold and impious Man
would not have gone so far as to have asserted that
the <hi>actual fulfilling of the Prophesies</hi> is nothing but Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
No certainly, he could not have the face to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that the completion of those Predictions is some
real thing, and not founded on Imagination. For
here is matter of fact, which carries reality and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
with it, and therefore is a convincing proof,
not only of the Truth of those Prophesies, but of
Christianity it self. This then is that which I will
now enter upon. The Prophets of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
speak frequently of the <hi>Messias,</hi> they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
and characterized him: nothing almost was
done by Christ but they predicted it: every particular
act, circumstance and accident of Importance that
should happen about him was foretold. Now all
these were actually <hi>verified</hi> and <hi>fulfilled;</hi> as namely
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:65397:239"/>
what related to his Birth, his Life, his Death, his
Rising again. First, what related to his <hi>Birth,</hi> as
that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> should be his Forerunner, and make
way for him. <hi>Behold! I will send my Messenger, and he
shall prepare the way before me,</hi> Mal. 3. 1. And <hi>ch.</hi> 4.
<hi>v. 5. Behold, I will send you</hi> Elijah <hi>the Prophet before
the coming of the great and dreadful Day of the Lord.</hi>
Compare these places with <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 10, 14: <hi>Mark</hi>
1, 2 &amp; 9. 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 17 and 76. &amp; 7. 27. and you
will not question their Accomplishment.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Birth it self,</hi> and the <hi>Conception</hi> which was
in order to it were plainly prophesied of many Ages
before. As that in <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 22. is thought to be a
Prophesy concerning the Conception of Christ, <hi>the
Lord hath created a new thing in the Earth, a Woman
shall compass a Man.</hi> Some indeed have interpreted it
thus, the Church tho weak as a Woman shall compass
and besiege her Enemies, and take them Captive.
But this is very flat and frigid, especially if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Preface to the Prediction, <hi>the Lord hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
a new thing in the Earth.</hi> It is no <hi>new thing</hi> that
the Church gets the better of her Enemies: there are
many Instances of this in the History of the <hi>Israel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities.</hi>
So that something else is justly thought to be
the meaning of the words. And what should it be
but this, that <hi>Christ</hi> who was <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> should
be incompassed and shut up by her in her Virgin-Womb?
Her <hi>compassing a Man</hi> expresses the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him. The word Sabab <hi>circumdedit</hi> agrees
very well with it, for the Mother encompasses round
the <hi>Faetus</hi> with her Womb. And the Greek <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers

<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 31. The plain meaning then is, that
a <hi>Woman (Nekebah,</hi> not <hi>Ishah)</hi> one that is no Wife,
but a Virgin, <hi>shall conceive a Man-child in her Womb.</hi>
And the <hi>Woman</hi> here meant is the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
and the <hi>Man</hi> is Christ, who is God and Man. See

to one of the other Sex, but it properly

to whom <hi>Power</hi> more peculiarly and eminently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.
It is no wonder therefore that the <hi>Fathers</hi> of

For (as an<note n="††" place="bottom">Origen. contr. Celsum.</note> antient Father observes) what wonder
had it been for a young Woman, not a Virgin, to
conceive? And indeed the <hi>Old Rabbins,</hi> who believ'd
the <hi>Messias</hi> was to be born of a Virgin, have signali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
this word in the Hebrew. In the <hi>Cabala,</hi> and
<hi>Ionathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum</hi> you will find that it is written with
a <hi>Men Clausum</hi> in the middle, to signify something
extraordinary here meant, to intimate that it was
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:65397:241"/>
a <hi>Virgin, shut up,</hi> to denote the wonderful <hi>Mystery</hi> of
the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi>'s Conception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be said (what <hi>R. Kimchi</hi> and other Modern
Jews suggest) that this 7<hi>th Chap.</hi> of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and this
Verse more particularly refer to the Times of King
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> and so belong not to the Birth of <hi>Christ</hi> which
was about 700 Years afterwards, I answer by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Consequence: For this Chapter and Text
may have reference to King <hi>Ahaz</hi>'s Days, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
point at something done a long time after that.
The reason of this Assertion is because there is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a double Sense in Scripture. Any one that is
conversant in the holy Book is not ignorant of this,
and the Jews themselves acknowledg a literal and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Sense of Scripture. So then these words <hi>a Virgin
shall conceive,</hi> were verified in the first and literal Sense
in <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s time, a Virgin bringing forth a Child it may
be in the presence of the King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> to be a
Sign and Assurance of the deliverance of <hi>Iudah</hi> from
the Oppression of the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi>
This Virgin it is likely was afterwards <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s Wife,
and at that time betrothed, or to be betrothed to
him, and is the same with the <hi>Prophetess</hi> spoken of in
the 8<hi>th</hi> Chapter. Of this Child it is said, <hi>Butter and
Honey shall he eat, that he may know how to refuse the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and chuse the Good. For before the Child shall
know to refuse the Evil, and chuse the Good, the Land
that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her Kings,</hi>
ver. 15, 16. That is, this Child shall be nourish'd
and brought up as <hi>Children</hi> are used to be (Butter and
Honey being the Food of these little ones, to <hi>eat</hi> these
is as much as to be used as a Child: Whence the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
gave these to Children at Baptism to taste of,
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Ierom</hi> testify) this Child shall fare
as other little ones are wont to do, and we shall all of
us in this Land live in Peace and Plenty, and shall not
be disturb'd by the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> or <hi>Israel:</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:65397:242"/>
the Child shall know to refuse the Evil, and
chuse the Good, in as short a time as this or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Child shall be grown up, they shall both of them
forsake this Land, which they now threaten, and
they shall die in their own Kingdoms. This you
shall see happen before the Child comes to Age, or
Years of Discretion (that is meant by <hi>refusing the
Evil and chusing the Good.</hi>) And accordingly it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
the two Kings <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> were destroy'd
before that Child came to Years of knowledg, 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
15.</p>
                     <p>This is the simple and first Sense of the words.
But there is also another and mystical Sense (or it
may be called a <hi>secondary literal</hi> Sense) of them, and
so they are meant of <hi>Christ;</hi> and the Holy Ghost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that this Prophesy should be applied to <hi>him,</hi>
But how could the Birth of Christ, which was
some Ages after, be a <hi>Sign</hi> of that which was to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
then? I answer, the <hi>Sign</hi> doth not always go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the thing signified, as you may satisfy your selves
from perusing <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 12. and 37. <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 43.
<hi>Ier.</hi> 9. 10. &amp; 51. 63, 64. from which Instances it is
undeniably plain that things to come are <hi>Signs,</hi> and
given as so, to encourage Persons to something for
the present. It is not necessary then that this <hi>Sign</hi>
should precede the deliverance from <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah:</hi>
It might come after it; and so it did when a Virgin
conceived, and bore Christ. The Virgin then in
<hi>Isaiah</hi>'s time was a Type of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and her
<hi>Infant</hi> a Type of <hi>Christ</hi> born of the Virgin: and her
<hi>being delivered</hi> was a Sign and a Type of the spiritual
<hi>Deliverance</hi> by Christ. <hi>The Lord shall give you a sign,
and behold, a Virgin shall conceive,</hi> &amp;c. as much as to
say, you think that God is not powerful enough to
deliver you from these two Oppressors and Invaders,
<hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah:</hi> but you are deceiv'd; for God will
give to your Posterity a far greater Argument and
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:65397:242"/>
Proof of his Power, for he will bring it to pass by
his miraculous and omnipotent Arm that the <hi>Messias</hi>
shall be born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and he shall be a Mighty
Saviour and Deliverer, he shall rescue you from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Enemies than those Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> he
shall save you from your Sins, he shall deliver you
from Satan, from Death and Hell, and Eternal
Destruction.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, what relateth to <hi>Christ's Life</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi>
was foretold in the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi>
and exactly fulfill'd in the <hi>New,</hi> as his flying into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and his returning thence, <hi>Isa. 16. 7. Hos.</hi> 11. 1.
the Murder of the Infants in <hi>Bethlehem, Ier.</hi> 31.
15. the presenting of him in the <hi>Temple, Mal.</hi> 3. 1.
his working of Miracles, and particularly his healing
of Diseases, <hi>Isa.</hi> 35. 6. his Preaching and Doctrine,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 21. his riding

impossible this Prophesy should be interpreted of any
but him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the things relating to his <hi>Sufferings</hi> and
<hi>Death</hi> were predicted by the Prophets of the Old
Testament, and are found accomplish'd in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Writings, as those Affronts and Abuses put
upon our Saviour by the <hi>Iews, Isa.</hi> 53. 3, &amp;c. his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betray'd by his Disciple and pretended Friend,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 41. 9. their selling him for thirty pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 12. the scoffing of him when he hung
on the Cross, <hi>Psal. 22. 8. Mat.</hi> 27. 43. the piercing
of his Hands and Feet, <hi>Zech. 12. 10. Mat.</hi> 27. 35.
That of the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 22. 16. can be applied to
none but <hi>Christ,</hi> for in those Days in which <hi>David</hi>
lived there was no such custom of Punishment wherein
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:65397:243"/>
they <hi>pierced the Hands and Feet,</hi> from whence <hi>David</hi>
could borrow that Phrase. And as for what <hi>Calvin</hi>
saith, that it is a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Expression of <hi>David</hi>'s
Sufferings and Calamities, it is not worth attending
to. For <hi>David</hi> here (as in some other <hi>Psalms</hi>) speaks
in the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> and utters such things as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
not fully with his own particular Condition: as
when he addeth, <hi>ver. 18. They parted my Garments
amongst them, and upon my Vesture did they cast Lots.</hi>
Which is a prophetical account of that part of the
History of Christ's Sufferings which is recorded by the
Evangelists, <hi>Luke 23. 34. Iohn</hi> 19. 24. This like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Calvin</hi> saith is a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> and only signifies that
<hi>David</hi> was a prey to his Enemies, and was despoil'd
and robbed of all. But this is the usual course of
this Learned Writer, as I have observ'd elsewhere:
All or most of the places in the Old Testament which
are mystically meant of <hi>Christ,</hi> and which were so
understood by the antient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church, are
interpreted by him in a literal Sense only, which is a
great fault in this learned and worthy Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ormer, for
in thus doing he extreamly favours the <hi>Iews</hi> in those
Texts, and is thereby a Patron of <hi>Iudaism.</hi> Christ's
thirsting, and their giving him Gall and Vinegar were
foretold, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 21. and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> particularly takes
notice of its being fulfilled, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 30. his being
crucified among Thieves was the accomplishment of
what was said in <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 12. and therefore is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
taken notice of in <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 28. that his Legs
should not be broken (as those of the Malefactors
that suffer'd with him) was foretold in the Law of
the <hi>Paschal Lamb, Exod.</hi> 12. 46. and is accordingly
applied in <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 36.</p>
                     <p>The whole 53<hi>d</hi> Chapter of <hi>Isaiah</hi> is a Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Messias</hi>'s <hi>sufferings:</hi> which though the Jews
usually interpret concerning the People of <hi>Israel</hi>
afflicted with Captivity and then delivered, yet any
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:65397:243"/>
one may see that the expressions cannot agree in any
tolerable way to the Jewish People and their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But they are most easily appliable to <hi>Christ,</hi>
and to none else: and it is certain that the <hi>Antient
Rabbins</hi> understood them of the <hi>Messias.</hi> So all of them
conclude that he was to be put to death, from
Dan. 9. 26. <hi>After the threescore and two weeks shall</hi>
Messiah <hi>be cut off, but not for himself.</hi> And that this
and other Texts before named foretold Christs suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
is taken notice of by himself, <hi>Luk. 24. 26. Ought
not Christ to have suffered these things?</hi> and again, <hi>v.</hi> 46.
<hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer.</hi>
Briefly, the Death and Passion of our Saviour were
evidently <hi>predicted,</hi> and as plainly <hi>accomplished,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 8.
<hi>Those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of
all his Prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</hi>
And concerning St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we read that <hi>he said no other
things than those which the Prophets and</hi> Moses <hi>did say
should come, that Christ should suffer, and that he should be
the first that should rise from the dead,</hi> Acts 26. 22, 23.
Which is the next thing you are to take notice of.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Then, <hi>Christs Resurrection</hi> and the happy
Consequences of it were long since foretold: <hi>David
speaketh concerning him, thou wilt not leave my Soul in
Hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
Psal. 16. 10. Acts 2. 25, 27. The Apostle tells
us that Christ not only <hi>Died</hi> and was <hi>Buried,</hi> but also
<hi>Rose again the third Day according to the Scriptures</hi>
(1 Cor. 15. 4.) <hi>i. e.</hi> according to this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
now mentioned, and according to the History of
<hi>Ionas</hi> his being <hi>three Nights and three Days in the
Whales Belly;</hi> which was a Type and Presignification
of our Saviours lying in the Grave part of three Days.
The <hi>Ascending of Christ</hi> into Heaven, was the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of his rising from the Dead, and that also was
foretold, <hi>Ps. 68. 18. Thou hast asc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hast led Captivity Captive,</hi> &amp;c. which you will find ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to our Saviour in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. And so his <hi>sitting
at the right hand of God</hi> (which is another effect of his
Resurrection) is expresly spoken of by the Psalmist,
<hi>Ps. 110. 1. The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my
right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool:</hi> which
St. <hi>Peter</hi> takes notice was fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 34. And
indeed the <hi>Antient Rabbies</hi> generally interpreted the
110th <hi>Psalm</hi> of the <hi>Messias.</hi> And that they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to do so is plain from Christs Question to the
Pharisees, <hi>Matth. 22. 43. How doth</hi> David <hi>in spirit
call the</hi> Messias <hi>Lord?</hi> which would have been frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and to no purpose if this <hi>Psalm</hi> were not to be
understood of the <hi>Messias,</hi> yea, if it was not so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> They might have denied that
Hypothesis of his, and have reproved him for misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
the Psalmist's words. But you see they
were so far from doing so that they sneaked away in
silence, <hi>being not able to answer him a word,</hi> ver. 46.
they knew full well that they were gravelled with our
Saviour's Query, and that that <hi>Psalm</hi> was one of the
clearest <hi>Prophesies</hi> of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and his Kingdom and
Offices, that is in all the Old Testament. Thus all the
remarkable Passages concerning our Saviour were
foretold, his Birth, Life, Doctrine, Conversation,
Miracles, Death, Burial, rising again, and ascending
into Glory: and we cannot deny but that they were
as punctually fulfill'd, and thereby the <hi>Truth of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity</hi>
is abundantly declared.</p>
                     <p>Many <hi>other Predictions</hi> concerning Christ might be
mentioned, as that first and most early one of all, in
<hi>Gen. 3. 15. The Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
Head:</hi> which in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Language is no other
than this, <hi>that the Son of God was to be manifested to
destroy the works of the Devil,</hi> 1 Ep. <hi>ch. 3. v.</hi> 8. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
that Message of the Angel to <hi>Abraham</hi> (in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18.) was a Prediction concerning Christ, <hi>in
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:65397:244"/>
thy Seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed,</hi> which
cannot be understood of any but the blessed Jesus,
who is a <hi>universal</hi> Blessing, a <hi>Catholick</hi> Benefit to the
World. Of his coming <hi>Moses</hi> his words are to be
understood, <hi>Deut. 18. 15. The Lord thy God will raise
up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
like unto me, unto him ye shall hearken.</hi> There

                        <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>

particulars. Yea, <hi>Christ</hi> far exceeded <hi>Moses</hi> in all great
and <hi>miraculous Actions,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Doctrine.</hi> This
latter is spoken of in Isa. 2. 3. <hi>Out of</hi> Sion <hi>shall go forth
the Law, and the word of the Lord from</hi> Jerusalem; sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
that Christ was to change the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as
to many considerable things, and to establish one which
should be more excellent, and more lasting.</p>
                     <p>That also is a most pregnant place, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9.
<hi>I will shake all Nations, and the desire of all Nations</hi>
(i. e. the Messias) <hi>shall come, and I will fill this House</hi>
(this second Temple) <hi>with Glory, saith the Lord of
Hosts. The Silver is mine, and the Gold is mine, saith
the Lord of Hosts</hi> (with these I could adorn and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
the Temple, but it shall be dignified with some
greater thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the appearing of the <hi>Messias</hi> in it:
upon this account) <hi>the Glory of this latter House shall be
greater than of the former, saith the Lord of Hosts, and
in this place will I give Peace, saith the Lord of
Hosts.</hi> Here it is plain that the <hi>Messias</hi> was to come
before the second Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by the Romans, for the second Temple is
said to be <hi>more glorious</hi> than the first (though in it self
less glorious) because <hi>Christ</hi> came into it in the days
of his Flesh, and honour'd it with his Presence. If

compare it with the first Temple built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> it
was far less glorious than that. It was not so rich

things which were in the other, as the <hi>Ark</hi> with the
<hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> and <hi>Cherubims,</hi> the <hi>Holy Fire</hi> from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

Thus they are reckon'd up in the <hi>Talm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

say some of these were not lost in the Captivity, as

                        </gap>terwards. However,
(granting this to be true) the loss of those other
things rendered this Temple much inferior to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
one. Therefore for <hi>this</hi> reason alone it is that
the <hi>Glory</hi> of the second Temple is greater than of the
first, <hi>viz.</hi> because of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Presence there.</hi> This is
expresly mention'd by the Prophet <hi>Malachi, the Lord
whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple,</hi> Mal.
3. 1. And further you may observe that it is said
here, <hi>the desire of all Nations</hi> (i. e. <hi>Christ</hi> or the <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as)

the Gentiles, and under the power of their Kings and

                     </p>
                     <p>I answer, as for the Character they frame of the
<hi>Messias,</hi> of being a great Secular King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is
clearly against the Description of the <hi>Messias,</hi> whose
Humility and Sufferings we read prophesied of. The
Old Testament represents him as a Person <hi>despised,
rejected of men, a man of Sorrows</hi> and <hi>acquainted with
Grief,</hi> &amp;c. he was indeed a <hi>King,</hi> but he tells us that
<hi>his Kingdom was not of this World,</hi> it was a spiritual
Dominion and Soveraignty which he came to erect;
he came to rule in the Hearts and Consciences of
Men: And thus his Kingdom reached <hi>even to the ends
of the World,</hi> the Gospel being preached, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>2. It is <hi>objected</hi> by the Jews that the <hi>Messias</hi> is not

be the fruit of his coming, <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but these things are not fulfilled, Quarrels
and Divisions have not left the World since Christ
appeared, yea rather they have been augmented;
therefore the <hi>Messias</hi> is not arrived. I answer briefly,
first these Predictions were literally and historically
fulfill'd at our Saviour's coming into the World; for
there was an Universal Peace at that time. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Augustus,</hi> under whom he was born, had hush'd
and still'd the Civil Wars and Commotions at home;
and all Nations abroad submitted to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<hi>Egypt</hi> became a Roman Province, <hi>AEthiopia</hi>
sued for Peace, <hi>India</hi> enter'd into League with <hi>Caesar,</hi>
the <hi>Parthians</hi> trembled at him; the <hi>Cantabrians, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
Pannonians, Germans</hi> yielded to his Arms.
When he had thus by Victory or Terror purchas'd
Peace, when all the World lay submissively at his
Feet, he shut up <hi>Ianus</hi>'s Temple, which was a sign
of a general Repose and profound Peace; and then
<hi>the Prince of Peace</hi> came into the World. Yea, in
those Countries which at that time were not under
the Power of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> all was quiet and still.
In <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> and those other Northern
Regions, there were no Wars, no Enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.

the Prophesies were accomplished. Secondly, the
<hi>Design</hi> of the Gospel which Christ and his Apostles
preached was to introduce Peace: The Christian
Religion dictated no less, and directed Men how to
practise it. Therefore observe the Reason adjoined
to the Prophesy concerning Peace, Isa. 11. 9. <hi>They

and the excellent Rules of it are in themselves subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient

time shall come when this Promise shall be compleately
fulfill'd. Tho it is spoken of the time of the <hi>Messias,</hi>
yet it is not said that it shall presently be fulfilled,
and that in the heighth of it. Christianity hath
brought Peace into many Kingdoms and Countries,
and hath expell'd Wars thence. This cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied:
there is History enough to make it good; which
might be a sufficient answer to the Objection. But
moreover, the Gospel of Christ in due time will have
a greater and larger Effect; and universal Peace,
Amity and Concord shall obtain in all the Churches
of Christ, as I shall prove when I come to treat of the

have confessed that according to the Prophesies
of the Old Testament the <hi>Messias</hi> was to come before
this time, they reply (in way of <hi>Objection</hi>) that their

In answer to which sorry Shift, first I ask <hi>what Sins</hi>
have they committed these Sixteen hundred Years,
for which this Promise and Appointment of God are
still delayed? They were grievous <hi>Idolaters</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and consequently were the worst sort of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and yet this Guilt did not hinder the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
of other Prophesies and Predictions in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which concern'd them. How comes it to pass
that all this time, in which they have not been (in
their own opinion) so great Sinners as they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
the fulfilling of the most important Promise
that ever God made is defer'd? Besides the <hi>Sins</hi> of
the Jews were so far from being a hindrance of the
performing this Promise, that they should rather have
hastned it, for the end of the <hi>Messi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>'s coming was
to take away Sin, <hi>to finish the Transgression, and to make
an end of Sins,</hi> as that Prophesy in <hi>Daniel</hi> expresly
foretels: Therefore it is groundlesly alledged by the
Jews that the coming of the <hi>Messi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> is delayed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their grievous Sins. Again, if their <hi>Sins</hi> have
for so many Ages hindred the <hi>Messias</hi>'s coming, if
God hath defer'd that Blessing merely because of
their Iniquities, why may he not put it off for ever
for the same reason? And by consequence there shall
be no coming of the <hi>Messias,</hi> which some Jews have
not been backward to say. Further I add, who ever
thought that the Prediction or Promise concerning
the <hi>Messias</hi> was <hi>conditional,</hi> that is, wholly depended
on the Qualifications of the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

plied in the <hi>Objection:</hi> Nay, the Jews freely confess
the fulness of time was come for the sending of the

the other the Son of <hi>David,</hi> who is to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
and shall be a great Conqueror, and lead them
into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and be their King there. Tho the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of these be come, yet the latter <hi>Messias,</hi> whom
they are most concern'd for, is not come: but they
daily expect him, and even languish with looking for
him so long. This <hi>Messias,</hi> when he comes, invites
all the Jews to a Feast, the greatest and most sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that ever was, and according to their Bill of Fare
<hi>Behemoth</hi> and <hi>Leviathan</hi> are the two main Dishes.
Thus these poor People cheat themselves with the

themselves by keeping up the imagination and hope

                        <hi>Sabbatai Sevi</hi> who appear'd in the Year 1666, was
the twenty fifth Pretender to the <hi>Messiaship,</hi> as it
stands in their own Records. He was the Son of
<hi>Mordecai Sevi,</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
to an English Merchant in that place. His Son
<hi>Sabbatai</hi> addicted himself to study, and became a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Proficient in Hebrew and Metaphysicks, and at
length gave out to those of his Nation that he was
the <hi>Messias, Nathan</hi> another Jew having a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proclaim'd himself <hi>Elias.</hi> What became of this

threw down his Pretences to the <hi>Messiaship,</hi> and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Turk before the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> And still the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of these People grow higher, and they are
ready to imbrace any bold Impostor who will lay
claim to the Title of <hi>Messiah.</hi> And thus it will be as
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:65397:251"/>
long as they mistake the Prophesies in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning his coming, and will not be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the time of it is past. But shall we take the
meaning of <hi>Scripture</hi> from <hi>Them</hi> from whom God hath
taken away for so many Ages all Understanding and
Knowledg? Shall we give credit to them who are
blinded and besotted, and have abandoned their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who are most palpably erroneous in Chronology
and History, (as the Learned <hi>Isaac Vossius</hi> hath shew'd)
and who in giving the Sense of Scripture are most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
deluded? No surely, nor are we to mind
what they say when they tell us that<note n="*" place="bottom">Maimonid. H. Melachim. c. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>no Man ought to
be so bold as to compute the time of the coming of the</hi>
Messias. We know the reason of this; the <hi>Iews</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
indure now to have the <hi>Prophesies</hi> look'd into, and
the times of the <hi>Messias</hi>'s arrival reckon'd up. Since
<hi>Christ</hi> is come, they see that the Times spoken of by
the Prophets concerning him are past, and therefore
they <hi>anatbematize</hi> all that undertake to compute them.
They wish that those who curiously enquire into
them may<note n="†" place="bottom">Rumpatur prae tumore spiritus eorum qui computent sines temporum. Buxtorf. Lex.</note> perish. But the Curse will rather light
upon themselves, because they wilfully <hi>discern not the
Times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may then, notwithstanding all the Objections,
Cavils, Evasions, and perverse Interpretations of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> hold fast our Proposition, that <hi>all the Prophesies
in the Old Testament concerning the</hi> Messias <hi>are really ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</hi>
Yea, the Prophesy concerning the <hi>Iews</hi> not
believing these Prophesies is accomplis'd: for it was
prophetically set down as<note n="‖" place="bottom">Isa. 53. 1, 2, 3. compared with Mark 9. 12. John 12. 37, 38.</note> one Mark of the <hi>Messias</hi>
his coming, that the Jewish Nation should refuse and
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:65397:252"/>
reject him. So that you see the Jews Incredulity and
Obstinacy are one great Argument that Christ is the
true <hi>Messias.</hi> We have abundant reason then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in the <hi>Spirit of Prophesy,</hi> which is the <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Iesus,</hi> Rev. 19. 10. This bears witness to
him, and to the Truth and Certainty of Christianity.
This <hi>Spirit of Prophesy</hi> witnessed concerning Christ
four Thousand Years before he came, for so long it
was from the first Promise in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Many other
things were foretold concerning him three Thousand
Years before, some two Thousand, and some a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
before he was manifested in the Flesh. Now,
our Argument runs thus, he that was so many Years
before foretold to come as the <hi>Messias</hi> or <hi>Saviour</hi> is
certainly the <hi>true Messias</hi> and <hi>Saviour:</hi> But <hi>Iesus</hi> was
so foretold, therefore he was certainly the <hi>true Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
and <hi>Saviour.</hi> The first Proposition is built on the
Truth and Faithfulness of God, and is granted us by
the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves. The second is that which we
have been indeavouring to prove, and I hope I have
effectually done it; for I have plainly demonstrated
that it was <hi>Christ our Lord</hi> who was foretold so many
Years before in the Old Testament, and that it can
be no other than him. Therefore it cannot be ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by any rational Person whether he was the
<hi>true Messias</hi> who was to bring Salvation to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see <hi>Christianity</hi> is founded on the <hi>Old
Testament;</hi> here it is prophesied that <hi>Christ</hi> should
come in such a manner; and the very manner we
find particularly recorded in the <hi>New Testament; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi>
and <hi>Matthew</hi> join hand in hand, and so do the
rest of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Evangelists:</hi> Therefore we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Christianity. The truth of it is proved from
the <hi>Prophesies</hi> concerning the <hi>Messias.</hi> If we believe
these (as we cannot but do, because they are divine
and from Heaven) we must believe Christ is come:
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:65397:252"/>
for they are an absolute Demonstration of this grand
Point, that Jesus, the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom
the Jews put to death at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was the Son of
God and the true <hi>Messias.</hi> Whereupon it will irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably
follow that the Faith and Doctrine which he
introduced are from Heaven, and that the <hi>Christian
Oeconomy</hi> wants not <hi>divine Attestation.</hi>

I will confine my self to those <hi>Miracles</hi> which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
did in his Life, at his Death and afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
One of the first he exerted was at <hi>Galilee,</hi> when he

fast forty Days and forty Nights in the Wilderness,
(<hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 2.) which is to be reckon'd as a <hi>Miracle</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
thought good to demonstrate his Divine Power
at a Feast, and to chear and refresh the Guests with
no less than a <hi>Miracle.</hi> Then (but I shall not observe
the exact <hi>Order</hi> of his Miracles) we read that about

                        <hi>Meat</hi> (as well as <hi>Drink</hi>) he exercised his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Virtue: for when the multitude which followed
him wanted food, he had compassion on them, and
satisfied four Thousand Men with seven Loaves and
a few Fishes, at which time seven Baskets of Fragments
were left, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 34. At another time he fed
five Thousand, besides Women and Children, with

<note n="†" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Ader,</hi> in Enarrationibus de morbis Evangelii.</note> Writer who maintains that all the <hi>Diseases</hi> which
Christ cured were naturally incurable. Whether
they were all so, I will not nicely enquire; but it is
probable that most of them were so: for we read
that he cured such as laboured under those Diseases
which bassled the Art of the best Masters of Medicks,
he usually incountred the <hi>Opprobria Medicorum,</hi> the
Distempers which puzled and non-pluss'd the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Thus, <hi>a certain Woman which had an Issue of
Blood twelve years, and had suffered many things of many
Physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:65397:254"/>
bettered, but rather grew worse,</hi> was sorthwith cured
by Christ, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 25, 26. Another Woman, <hi>which
had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and could in no wise lift up her self, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
loosed from her infirmity, and made streight,</hi>
Luke 13. 11, 12.</p>
                     <p>Nay, the same Omnipotent Arm cured <hi>a Man who
had an infirmity thirty and eight years,</hi> John 5. 5. From
which duration of the Disease we may infer that it
was naturally past Cure: it was impossible by Art to
master an infirmity so Old and Chronical: the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
might plead Prescription after so many years.
And in the 7<hi>th v.</hi> you may observe the poor Mans
Case was so much the sadder, because he was not in a
capacity to further and promote his recovery, such
was his impotency and inability. He <hi>lay at the Waters,</hi>
and was there <hi>tantalized,</hi> disappointed, and wholly

                        </gap> daily Hopes and Wishes. And there
perhaps he lay repining at his Destiny which had
given him some hopes, only to make his Infirmities
the more insupportable. He was condemned to live,
and to bear the Burden of a lingring Disease. You
may suppose that oftentimes out of hope of regaining
his Health he almost lost his Life in the Press and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
Crowd. The good Angel that used to
trouble the Waters of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>thesda</hi> would not step aside
to take him in: and he had no Friend there that
would make way for him to the Pool. His Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
that brought him to the place in expectation
of a Cure, proved in the Event cruel to him, and
preserv'd him only to torment and vex him. At last
he met with the <hi>Angel of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

away. The holy <hi>Iesus,</hi> I say, beholding this Person
in so forlorn a Condition had compassion on him, bid
him rise forthwith, and take up his Bed, and walk;
which immediately he did.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour likewise restored sight to the Blind
(even those that were born so), hearing to the Deaf,
sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ch to the Dumb, strength to the Lame. He cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Fevers, Palsies, Leprosies, and all manner of
Diseases whatsoever, whether Acute or Chronical.
No Distemper overcame his Power, but he heal'd
those that were most difficult and obdurate, and that
could be removed by no humane Skill. Among his
other <hi>Miracles,</hi> we must not forget his wonderful
<hi>Dispossessing of Devils,</hi> nay of a <hi>Legion</hi> of them at one
time. He cast out Deaf and Dumb and Blind De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
<hi>i. e.</hi> those evil Spirits which made the possessed
so: and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 22. 'tis recorded that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a possessed Person who was <hi>both</hi> Blind and Deaf.
Thus he expel'd Diseases and Devils together. On the
Sea as well as on the Land he displaied his <hi>Miraculous
Power;</hi> he commanded the Inhabitants of that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to surrender themselves at his pleasure. He
sent <hi>Peter</hi> to fish for Poll-money, and accordingly he
found it in a Fishes mouth. Seeing from a Mount,
where he was praying, his Disciples at Sea labouring
with a Tempest, he came to them walking on the
Waters, and gave St. <hi>Peter</hi> power to walk there safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and then coming into the Ship, he presently silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Wind, allay'd the Storm, hush'd the Tempest
which threatned no other than sudden Ship-wrack.</p>
                     <p>He did things far greater than all these, he raised
the dead, which is the heighth of Miracles, and is the
most remarkable Attestation of Divine and Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Power. Thus he rais'd <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Grave,
he call'd to Life again the Daughter of <hi>Iairus</hi> the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the Synagogue: Afterwards in the Town of
<hi>Naim</hi> he restored to Life the only Son of a Widow.
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:65397:255"/>
These Persons, say some Atheists, were not dead,
but only in an Extasy. But we say that they were
really dead, or else there is no way in the World to
<hi>know</hi> and <hi>judg</hi> when any are so. And if this be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(as it needs must) we have more reason to assert
the Affirmative than they the Negative. <hi>Paracelsus</hi> phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophically
attributes this Resuscitation to the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a certain heat in the corrupted dead Matter;
as Frogs (saith he) are generated of Slime by the
heat of the Sun. This is his Blasphemous Nonsense,
which all Men of sober Reason deride, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
acknowledg that the restoring of the dead to
Life is an Act of Supernatural and Divine Power,
and that the Key of the Grave (as the Jews say) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to God only.</p>
                     <p>And now to approach towards our Saviours Death,

had once before done, <hi>i. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Sellers out of the Temple, which may be justly
reckoned amongst his Miracles, for he could not have
expell'd so many Men out of that place, which they
had made the place of their Merchandize and Gain,
without an extraordinary and omnipotent Arm. And
by the same Almighty Power he struck to the Ground
those that came to apprehend him. Afterwards,
when he was on the Cross he converted one of the
Thieves even just before his leaving the World, which
was a <hi>Miracle,</hi> and a great one. At the same time he
caused a <hi>miraculous Eclips<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="498" facs="tcp:65397:256"/>
forerunner of our Saviour's Resurrection, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
soon after. He that raised others raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the dead the third Day, which was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of all his former Miracles. And after he
had visibly convers'd with his Disciples for a time,
he ascended up to Heaven, and convey'd himself
through all the Regions of the upper World even to
the Mansions of Glory. These were some of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
of our Saviour: But there were innumerable
more which are not recorded; which occasioned
that great Hyperbole used in <hi>Iohn 21. ult.</hi> Indeed,
Christ did so <hi>many</hi> and so <hi>great Miracles,</hi> that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
and Obstinacy of the <hi>Iews,</hi> notwithstanding
all of them, may seem to be as great a Wonder and
Prodigy as any thing that happen'd.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the <hi>Apostles</hi> as well as our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
exerted many <hi>Miracles,</hi> the holy Spirit being
sent to them, according to Christ's Promise, to ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them to do them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hey cured all manner of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased
Persons that were brought before them; yea,
they could cure at a distance, and by proxy. By
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Shadow and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Handkerchief a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native
Virtue was conveyed to the Sick, and their
Diseases departed from them, <hi>Acts 15. 15. Acts</hi> 19.
12. This was a Gift which was equally wonderful
and useful, by virtue whereof Maladies were cured
without any cost, and the poor Patient needed not to
fear a Relapse soon after from the sight of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary's
Bill. If it be <hi>objected</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimus</hi>
at <hi>Miletum</hi> sick, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 20. and he cured not
<hi>Timothy</hi> of his weak Stomach without drinking Wine,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 23. Therefore the Apostles had no absolute
Gift of healing: I answer, 1. The Gift of healing
was for the Confirmation of the Truth, and for the
Conversion of Heathens rather than for the recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christians, and therefore it is no wonder that
they could not work this Miracle always, and that
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:65397:256"/>
some were heal'd, not all. 2. <hi>Miracles</hi> were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to make Men immortal on Earth. Sicknesses
and Diseases were not always to be cured, for then
none should die: But it was sufficient that sometimes
the Power of Healing was exerted, that thereby it
might be seen that the Apostles were inabled from
Heaven, and that a divine Power went along with
them. But it pleased God that at ordinary times
Diseases should be cured by the use of Means, and
that an extraordinary Power should not be made use
of. 3. Those very Instances (or any the like) are
a great Proof that God bore witness to the Apostles:
for hence it appeared that this Power was at Gods
pleasure and disposal, and not at their own, they could
not do what they pleased, there was a certain Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which shews it was absolutely a divine and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Power by which they healed Diseases.</p>

of Tongues, to another the interpretation of Tongues,</hi> i. e.

another was enabled to interpret them, and make

this time in the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they were both of them the effects of a supernatural
Power. And by this Miraculous way the Apostles fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>dispossessed Devils,</hi> who in those days tormented
the Bodies as well as Souls of Men. They had power
also to <hi>raise the dead,</hi> which was seen in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

did were greater than <hi>Christ's:</hi> and so he himself
had promised, <hi>Iohn 14. 12. He that believeth on me,

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> am to shew that these Miracles of our Saviour
and his Apostles were really true, and not counterfeit
Miracles. Here I have two things to do. 1. To
shew you what are true Miracles, and how they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from ralse ones. 2. To prove that the Miracles
of our Saviour and his Followers were such. First,
Let us enquire into the <hi>true Nature</hi> of a <hi>Miracle,</hi>
These are the five grand Properties of it.</p>
                     <p>1. It is such an Act as is <hi>above natural Force and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y,</hi>
and is done wholly by virtue of an omnipotent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
There is a Physical Virtue and Agency given to
all Creatures at their first Creation: Their natural
Properties and Affections are settled in them by God
at first, and according to these they constantly act
except he who created them changes their course,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:65397:257"/>
immediately influencing on them. When the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
thus alters their natural Course and Agency, and
when the Effects are contrary to their natural Power,
there is a Miracle wrought: for <hi>Miracles</hi> are Actions
that are against natural Efficiency. This is opposed
by Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who holds that there are no real Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
because all is by natural Causes: only they seem
to the Vulgar to proceed from extraordinary and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Causes. On this ground he endeavours to
vilify the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by <hi>Christ.</hi> And <hi>Spinosa</hi>
would fain thrust upon us this Proposition, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Scripture affirms to have been done, did
necessarily come to pass according to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and no otherwise; and consequently that those
things which go under the Name of <hi>Miracles</hi> have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
natural Causes, tho unknown to us. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
this to be a sufficient Reason of what he saith,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Tractat. Theologico-Polit. cap. 6.</note> that God and his Decrees are unchangeable,
and therefore the Laws of Nature can't be alter'd,
and so there are no Miracles, because these are said to
be Interruptions or Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lations of the course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But if the altering the course of Nature be
contain'd in the divine Decrees, as most sure it is,
then what will become of his Argument? It is a mere
Fallacy, and contradicts several Discoveries which
God hath made of himself and his doings in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Writ; where we find that there are such Actions
as cannot be done by the mere Power and Energy of
Men or Angels (either good or bad) or of any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Beings. It is of the Essence of a <hi>Miracle</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
all natural Power: A <hi>Miracle</hi> always supposes
the Virtue by which it is produced to be Divine.</p>
                     <p>2. This is another property of a <hi>Miracle</hi> (which
follows necessarily on the former) that it is <hi>Vnaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi>
We cannot solve it, we cannot shew any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:65397:258"/>
why it is so. It is above our apprehension, for it
being a thing above natural Power, it is impossible
that natural Reason should tell how it is done. A <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi>
is such a work of which no Physical Cause can
be assigned: therefore it is no wonder that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
our Conceptions, and that we cannot apprehend
how it is performed.</p>
                     <p>3. It is also something done <hi>rarely</hi> and <hi>unusually.</hi> It

other acts, and these are <hi>unusual</hi> and <hi>extraordinary,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>4. It is the qualification of a <hi>Miracl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

to be something <hi>visible,</hi> at least very <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible.</hi>
The Egyptians saw <hi>Moses</hi>'s Miracles, the
Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> saw what <hi>Elijah</hi> did. And whatever
Miracles are really done, are done in the sight of
People, or the effects of them are to be plainly seen.
The reason is because they are exhibited to the
World on purpose that they may be observed and
taken notice of. Wherefore a <hi>Miracle</hi> is such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Work as is evident and apparent, and thence
this kind of Operations are frequently call'd <hi>Signs, i. e.</hi>
outward and open representations of the Almighty
Power of God.</p>
                     <p>5. And lastly, they deserve the name of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
because they stir up Mens minds to <hi>admire</hi> them:
they cause amazement and wonder: they are such
works of God as create astonishment in all that seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
consider them. And this proves what I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>viz.</hi> that it is against the nature of a <hi>Miracle</hi>
to be constant and lasting, and always continuing:
for if it were so, it would not be wondred at, and
then it would cease to be a <hi>Miracle.</hi> These are the
inseparable properties and qualification of true and
real <hi>Miracl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s:</hi> but the first is the main, and the only
essential one; for some other things are unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
(we being ignorant of the extent of Nature's
Sphere) and unusual, and wonderful, but they are
not against and above the power of natural causes,
therefore they are not properly <hi>Miracles:</hi> for a <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
is a thing that cannot be done but by Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Divine strength.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="504" facs="tcp:65397:259"/>Consequently, a <hi>Miracle</hi> cannot be done by the
Devil, or any of his Ministers and Agents. These
indeed can do <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>wonderful</hi> things, that is,
either such as are really so, but then they rise only
from <hi>occult natural</hi> causes and means; or such that
seem to be so, they appear only, and are not, and
then they are mere Jugglings and Tricks of Art.
Thus far evil Spirits and their Agents are able to go,
and no further, they can counterfeit Miracles, but
they cannot work one true Miracle. Thus the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Magicians</hi> did <hi>wonderful things,</hi> they did not only
make their <hi>Rods</hi> to appear, like that of <hi>Mercury,</hi>
with <hi>Serpents</hi> twining about them, but (which is
greater) they by their Inchantments turned their
Rods into Serpents, or seem'd to do so. That the
worst Men may have power to work such signs and
wonders is plain from <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

try Men whether they will adhere to God, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake

Stedfastness or their Hypocrisy. We have it from
the mouth of our Blessed Saviour, that <hi>there shall arise
false Christs and false Prophets, and shall shew great signs
and wonders,</hi> so great <hi>that (if it were possible) they shall
deceive the very elect,</hi> Mat. 24. 24. And St. <hi>Panl</hi> lets
us know that <hi>the Man of sin, the Son of perdition, shall

signification: for as this may be one meaning of them,

such are these here mentioned which false Prophets

Causes tho they be hid to us; or else they are mere
Cheats, Deception of Sight, and Delusions of the
Senses, and so they are only seeming Miracles and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wonders. This is an undeniable Truth, that tho
Evil Spirits and wicked Men are permitted to do
things prodigious and strange, yet they cannot work
true Miracles: for a Miracle is something above, yea
contrary to the course of Nature. Now God alone
can alter this established Order: This is proper to
him only; no Creature can effect it. The Author
of Nature can only change it: He that first made all
things of nothing can alter the Propriety of things.

Power wholly.</p>
                     <p>Having shew'd you what is the <hi>true Natural Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
I am to prove that those Acts of our <hi>Saviour</hi>
and his <hi>Apostles</hi> which we call <hi>Miracles</hi> are <hi>really such,</hi>
and are not counterfeit, but true. This is evident
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:65397:260"/>
from what I have said already, for those things
which they did were above the power of Nature, as
healing all sorts of Diseases, tho in themselves incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
feeding Thousands with a small Portion of
Food, and yet so that they carried away more than
was first provided; restoring People to Life after they
were really dead, and the like. These things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Virtue of natural and created Agents, and
therefore must be acknowledg'd to be Divine and
Heavenly, and by consequence were true and proper
Miracles. But moreover, I will prove that these Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of Christ and his Apostles were accompanied
with such <hi>peculiar Circumstances</hi> as spake them to be
of divine Original. As,</p>
                     <p>1. The simple and plain way of doing their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
is very remarkable. Christ cured some by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Hands on them, others by prayer and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his Father, others by a mere touch of his
Hand, as the Leper, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 3. Others by their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touching the Hem of his Garme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whole, <hi>Mat. 14. 36.</hi> Multitudes were cured
of their Diseases with a bare word; yea, with a
word he raised the Ruler of the Synagogue's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
only saying to her, <hi>Maid, arise, Luke</hi> 8. 54.
He cured a Noble Man's Son, so likewise a Centurion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Son at a distance, <hi>Iohn 4. 46. Mat.</hi> 8. 5. which could
not be with application of Medicines, or using of
any Means. Other Methods he made use of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
as when a blind Man was to be cured, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
his Eyes with Clay macerated with Spittle,
and also bid him wash in the Pool of <hi>Siloe.</hi> The ten
Lepers were not presently healed, but he bid them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to the Priests, and as they went they found their
Cure. At the raising of <hi>Lazarus</hi> he shed Tears,
groaned in his Spirit, and call'd him out of his Grave
with a loud Voice. But these and all his other <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
were wrought without Formality and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:65397:260"/>
without any superstitious Rites and Observances,
without either Natural or Artificial Applications,
which is a great Argument that they were true Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and no Impostures; for these latter are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
done with Ceremony and Pomp, with strange
words, and as strange Gestures and Actions.</p>
                     <p>2. The Miracles of Christ and his Apostles were
not obscure, but evident, not done in a corner, but
in the open light; and so if there had been any Cheat
and Forgery in them, they might have been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
and they would most certainly, for Christ and
his Apostles had subtil Enemies about them, who
were busy in prying into all the Circumstances of
their Actions. When Christ cured the Man that had
had an Infirmity thirty eight Years, it was at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Meeting, at the great Feast, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 33. He
dispossessed a Man of a Devil in the midst of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 45. The Man was cured of the
Palsy before the Multitude, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 8. the Widow's
Son was restored to Life before much People, <hi>Luke</hi>
7. 12 and most of his other Miracles were wrought
publickly, so that there were many Spectators and
Observers of them. And it is certain that among
these neither Wit nor Malice were wanting to find
out the Errors and Deceits, if there were any. Yet
we know that the Miracles of Christ were published
by the Evangelists, especially St. <hi>Matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

yet the Persons were alive upon whom they were
wrought, and whilst innumerable Persons, who were
Witness of those things, were surviving.</p>
                     <p>3. Whereas <hi>one or two</hi> are said to have been cured
in the <hi>Heat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many,</hi> and the number of other Miracles which he
did was exceeding great. The Multitude of them is
an argument of their Truth and Reality, for it shews
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:65397:261"/>
that it was not a thing by chance; besides, when so
many Miracles were done, there can be no suspition
of doing them in a fraudulent manner, for it had
been easy at one time or other to discover it.</p>
                     <p>4. Christs Miracles were not only many and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but often repeated, and done several times over.
Both he and his Apostles did those extraordinary
things daily, and one Miracle was wrought by them to
confirm another: which gives us further Assurance that
they were not counterfeit and false, for then by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>reiterating</hi> them they would have been found out.</p>
                     <p>5. Miracles were done in all parts of the World,
and not confined to <hi>Iudea</hi> only. The <hi>Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
relate what Miracles they exerted in several
Countries where they went; and afterwards the
whole World was visited by one or other of them;
and yet we never read that they were proved to be
Impostors. But on the contrary, we are credibly
informed that their Miracles were owned and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of not in one place only, but in all places
where they came.</p>
                     <p>6. These Miracles were wrought, these Cures
were done, and the strange Languages were spoken
amongst them for many years together, whereas
<note n="*" place="bottom">Ficta citò in naturam suam recidunt, Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>7. These Miracles were not control'd and check'd
by any greater, as the Wonders of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers
were by <hi>Moses.</hi> You may observe that those
<hi>Magicians</hi> could not plague Men and Cattel with
<hi>Boils,</hi> they could not restore the <hi>Waters</hi> to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
quality: tho they could gather the <hi>Frogs</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet they were not able to kill them. They
could not counterfeit the Miracle of <hi>Fleas</hi> and <hi>Lice,</hi>
tho they did those of the Serpents, Blood, and Frogs.
Here was some restraint; the Devil was overpower'd:
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:65397:261"/>
But that was not all: They had not been suffer'd to
effect so much as they did but that <hi>Moses</hi> was there
ready to countermand them, and to baffle their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions.
They turned the Rods into Serpents, but
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Rod devoured theirs, <hi>i. e Moses</hi>'s true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
devour'd the Magicians counterfeit Ones. But
Christ and his Apostles wrought Miracles, and there
was none to countermand them, which shews that
they were real Miracles. Thus true Miracles may
be known by their <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>circumstances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, These may be known to be such from the
<hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> which Christ and his Followers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to themselves in exerting them. First, True
Miracles are always for the Confirmation of the
Truth, but seeming and counterfeit Ones are wrought
on purpose to maintain some false Doctrine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if a Pretender to Miracles teacheth any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to Providence, and to the Nature of God
and Religion, we must look on him as an Impostor;
for Miracles that are true never contradict the Divine
Testimony, and the Truth recorded in Holy Writ.
This then you must know, that as Miracles confirm a
Doctrine, so they are authorized by the Doctrine.
We must not rest in Miracles alone, but <hi>to the Word
and to the Testimony</hi> we must appeal. Christ saith,
<hi>the Works I do bear witness of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> John 5. 36. but he
adds, <hi>ver. 39. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           </gap> Scriptures: they are they which
testify of me.</hi> By this then we may ascertain our selves
of the Authority of those <hi>Miracles</hi> which our Saviour
and his Apostles wrought when they were upon
Earth: They were done to attest a Doctrine, which
as it contradicted no part of Moral Religion, nor the
natural Notions of Reason, so it was conformable to
the written Word of God, and all the Truths in the
Old Testament.</p>
                     <p>In the second place, <hi>True Miracles</hi> tend to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
of Satan's Kingdom in the World: they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:65397:262"/>
confirm and abet Sin and Prophanation in those
that do them, or in any one else. As we observ'd
before from <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1. that God some times permits
false Prophets to work Signs and Wonders among his
People, so the Verses following tell us how we may
know them to be <hi>lying Wonders, viz.</hi> if the Prophet
makes use of them to <hi>entice Persons to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> after other
Gods, and to serve them.</hi> If the Signs and Wonders
were intended to seduce them to a false Worship, to
perswade them to Idolatry, and forsaking the true
God, they were not to be credited, they were to be
look'd upon as no true Miracles, but counterfeit ones.
For it is not a sufficient proof for the truth of Miracles
that they are for attesting the Orthodox Faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they also uphold a Holy Life.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, Our Saviour's Miracles were
such as were <hi>beneficial</hi> to others, and was for the good
of Mankind. He procured Food for Multitudes of
Persons, when they were almost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>amished; he cured
the Lame and the Blind, he ejected troublesom De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
out of Mens Bodies, he relieved the most impotent
and distressed. But the Signs and Wonders which
are done by Impostors are rather harmful than advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous.
It is not unworthy of our Remark (what
was partly suggested before) that the <hi>Egyptian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>

to the Greek is exactly thus, <hi>for it was not the time
of Figs (yet</hi> being redundant in our English Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<hi>i. e.</hi> it was not the time of Figs with this
Tree. Tho according to the time of year other
Fig-trees bore Fruit, yet this degenerated from them,
and had no Fruit at all on it, only Leaves; whence
our Saviour took occasion to curse it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="513" facs="tcp:65397:263"/>And this he did for the sake of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that
they might look on the Tree, and be admonished
that they might be sensible of the danger of their
<hi>Vnfruitfulness</hi> at such a Season, when the greatest
furitfulness was required of them. Or, according
to a<note n="1" place="bottom">Dr. Henry More's Mystery of Godliness.</note> worthy Person, the meaning of Christ's cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Figtree was, that the acceptable Fruit of
everlasting Righteousness was not then found in the
Judaical Dispensation: this Tree did not bring
forth such excellent Fruit, but only the fair Figleaves
of an external and ceremonial Righteousness, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Morality. Christ therefore came to exprobrate
to them the want of more perfect Fruit, and to put a
Period to the Dispensation of the Jews, so that it
should quite wither away and be null'd. Thus you
see there is ground for what our Lord did: which
makes me a little wonder why that Learned <hi>Critick</hi>
whom I named last, and some other Expositors are
so much concern'd at Christ's cursing <hi>the innocent
Tree,</hi> as they call it. I do not see any cause why
they should be so, for if we could assign no Reason
at all of this Action of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> we ought to be
fully satisfied with it, because he was arbitrary as to
this, and all other Actions of the like nature: by
virtue of his Sovereign Power he could in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do as he pleas'd. But we need not insist upon
this, because I have offer'd a sufficient Reason why he
thought good to shew a <hi>Miracle</hi> on a fruitless Tree,
which had nothing but leaves to be destroy'd by his
Curse.</p>
                     <p>As to the latter Instance, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's suffering
the <hi>Gadarens</hi> Swine to be driven by the Devil into
the Sea, I answer, 1. It was not so much our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
<hi>Act</hi> as his <hi>Permission,</hi> for so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="514" facs="tcp:65397:264"/>
sometimes imports. 2. It was not done of his own
accord, but upon the importunate Outcry of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
Friends, whom Christ saw it was best to lodg
in the <hi>Deep.</hi> 3. The Persons who sustain'd this Loss
deserved it, as we may gather from their carriage
towards our Blessed Lord. Here then was no unjust
thing done by this miraculous Power of our Saviour,
nor was it a hurtful thing to punish Offenders accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their deserts.</p>
                     <p>But further, it may be <hi>Objected,</hi> If Christ design'd
to benefit People by his Miracles, why did he not do
them when they most desired them, as in the Case
of <hi>Herod;</hi> and when there was the greatest need of
them, as when our Saviour hung on the Cross? For
the first, we read indeed that <hi>Herod was desirous to see
Christ of a long season, because he had heard many things
of him, and he hoped to have seen some Miracle done by
him,</hi> Luk. 23. 8. Yet when Christ came before him,
and was question'd by him, <hi>he answer'd him nothing,</hi>
ver. 9. he spake not one word, he did not one Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
The Reason was, because <hi>Herod</hi> had sufficient
opportunities before of hearing Christ's Sermons,
and seeing his Signs, but he was negligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
yea, he slighted and despised those things.
This is evident, because otherwise he would have
gone to our Saviour, or sent for him, and treated
him with Respect and Reverence. This great Man
having thus neglected the Season of Grace, he is
justly debarr'd for the future by Christ himself. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
are denied him after a wilful refusing both of
them and other means.</p>
                     <p>As for what we read in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 42. that the chief
Priests and Scribes declared they would <hi>believe in
Christ if he would come down from the Cross;</hi> and yet
our Saviour would not gratifie them by his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
descending thence: Here I have these three
things to say, 1. We may gather hence that <hi>Miracles</hi>
                        <pb n="515" facs="tcp:65397:264"/>
are a certain and infallible Argument. All Men are
agreed to be concluded by this: the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi>
declare that on these Terms they would believe in
Christ, and take him for the <hi>Messias:</hi> they desire no
better Proof than a <hi>Miracle.</hi> 2. I say this, <hi>Miracles</hi>
(the mighty and extraordinary Works of God) are
not lavishly to be thrown away. The Persons had
Miracles enough before, but they disregarded them.
and the Author of them: they must not therefore
now, when they think sit, call for those divine Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies
from Heaven. It is not meet that Heaven
should be thus at their beck, and that Miracles must
be done when they please. 3. The main thing I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
is this, that a <hi>greater Miracle</hi> than this which they
now call for was shew'd within a little time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
(for rising from the Dead was more than co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
down from the Cross) and yet they were not
wrought upon by it. So that if our Saviour had
come down from the Cross, they would not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:
which He who knew all things knew full
well, and therefore would not comply with their
unreasonable desire. We may then, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
these Instances alledged, assert that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
intended the Good and Welfare of Men by the
<hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi> which he wrought, and that all
the exertments of his miraculous Power were for
the Benefit and Advantage of the World: which
is one Difference between <hi>True</hi> and <hi>False Miracles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, if we inquire into the <hi>Persons</hi> who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
wrought these <hi>Miracles,</hi> we shall be fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that they were <hi>True.</hi> Not to speak now ofour <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
the Apostles and Primitive Christians, who were
the mediate Authors of them, were Men of great Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity:
they approved themselves to be void of all
secular and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igns, much more of all mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and mischievous purposes. They were plain
honest Men, who did not these things for vain Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:65397:265"/>
and Applause, for Credit and Repute in the
World, not out of Pride, Arrogance, or Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And it is as clear that they did not act for
worldly Gain and Profit: otherwise they would not
have left all, and followed Christ. It is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
also that the Persons who wrought these Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were Just and Charitable, Holy and Good
Men; and even by the confession of their Enemies
they lived well, and were of exact Conversations:
whereas false Boasters of Miracles were infamous for
some Vice or other, and by this it might be known
and discerned that they were Cheats. Thus from
the consideration of the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of
the Miracles recorded to have been done in the New
Testament, and likewise of the <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> of
them, and of the <hi>Quality of the Persons</hi> who did them,
we may conclude that they were True and Real Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
Thus you may distinguish between the
Wonders wrought by the Infernal Spirits, Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Antichrist, and all sorts of Impostors, and
those Wonders and Miracles which were done by
<hi>Christ,</hi> and by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and other <hi>Christians</hi> in
the next succeeding Ages of Christianity. Thus you
may know the former to be Lies and Forgeries, and
the latter to be the sole effects of Divine Power.</p>
                     <p>By virtue of the Premises we may also correct the
Lies and Blasphemies of those Wretches who have
defamed the Miracles of Christ and his Followers.
The <hi>Pharisees</hi> could not deny the Miracles themselves;
and so afterwards, <hi>Porphyrius, Celsus, Hierocles, Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho,
Iulian</hi> did not deny the Reality of those Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
recorded by the Evangelists, they confess'd the
Matter of Fact, and pretended not to boggle at it.
But tho they acknowledged these things to have been
really done, yet they maliciously calumniated them.
It was most impiously said by the Pharisees in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
time that he did his Miracles by <hi>Belzebub the
Prince of the Devils.</hi> And it hath been ever since
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:65397:265"/>
constantly affirmed by the <hi>Iews</hi> that Christ wrought
those great things<note n="2" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                        </note> by <hi>Magick Art.</hi> Or, others of
them (to mitigate this) attribute his working of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
to the <hi>Cabalistick Art;</hi> for they hold that in
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters, Points, Accents, Numbers,
Names, the signification of the greatest things is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
even the Nature of all things Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
By this all Wonders are wrought; <hi>Moses,</hi>
and <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> did all by virtue of this. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
words include in them all Proprieties of things,
and those that are skill'd can tell all things by them:
especially the knowledg of the Virtue of the <hi>Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammaton</hi>
is effectual to produce the greatest Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the World; and by the Power of that Name
<hi>Christ,</hi> they say, did all his Miracles. The Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Pagans</hi> against Christ's Miracles was something
like this, as we learn from an<note n="3" place="bottom">Magnus fuit, clandestinis artibus omnia ille perfecit. Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorum ex adytis Angelorum potentium nomina &amp; remotas fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus est disciplinas. Arnob. adv. Gent. l. 1.</note> Antient Writer,
who acquaints us that the sense of the <hi>Heathens</hi> was
that Christ was a Sorcerer, and performed all by
clandestine Arts, that he stole from the Mysteries of
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> the Names of some powerful Angels,
and made use of the most abstruse and mystical Rites
of that People for the effecting of his Miracles. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
(as we learn from <hi>Origen</hi> against him) attributed
the Apostles Miracles to Magick, and pretended
that they had Magical Books from Christ to that
purpose. <hi>Iulian</hi> declared that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was the most
skilful Magician that ever was; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to him was addicted to that Art, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> Books 3, &amp; 9. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,
Pomponatius, Cardan,</hi> and others Atheistically
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:65397:266"/>
disposed, impeach not Christ of <hi>Diabolical Magick</hi>
(for perhaps they holding no God, deny all Devils)
but they declare that his Miracles were done by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Magick.</hi> Some imputed the Miracles of the
Apostles and other Christians to the force of their
<hi>Imagination,</hi> to their exalted <hi>Fancy.</hi> Thus <hi>Avicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
a great <hi>Arabian</hi> Philosopher and Physician, was
of the opinion that an <hi>Intense Thinking</hi> operated all.
At other times they assert that Christ wrought all his
Miracles by the virtue of the <hi>Stars</hi> and the <hi>Heavenly
Positions,</hi> or by the Power of <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> or of
<hi>Precious Stones,</hi> or by a particular Temper of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
made to heal; that is, his Body was composed
of some particular Ferments, the <hi>effluvia</hi> whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
the Temperament of debilitated parts, envigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the Blood, dissipated all heterogeneous Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and so the Cure was wrought.</p>
                     <p>But any unbiassed Person may perceive that all
these are mere Fetches and Artifices to give some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to their Atheism, and to uphold their obstinate
prejudices against the Divinity of Christ and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Christian Religion. For from what
hath been said before it is evident, that the Miracles
mention'd in the New Testament surpass all finite
Power, not only that of <hi>Man</hi> but of all <hi>other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
And therefore it is plain that the wonderful
Things by which Christ did prove his Divinity, and
the Truth of the Christian Religion, they being Works
not only above, but against Nature, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are not effected by a created Being. And as for
those who ascribe Christ's Miracles to <hi>Diabolical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi>
our Saviour himself hath answer'd them long
ago, <hi>Every Kingdom divided against it self is brought to
desolation. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided
against himself: how shall then his Kingdom stand?</hi> Mat.
12. 25, 26. Christ, as appeared by his Doctrine
and all his Actions, design'd the overthrow of Satan's
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:65397:266"/>
Kingdom, therefore it cannot be believ'd that Satan
would joyn with Christ to ruin himself; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he must do if he helped him to work <hi>Miracles,</hi>
which were the great Confirmation of the <hi>Christian
Religion.</hi> Besides, Magical Cures and other such
Operations were always done with Charms and
Spells, with the use of Herbs and Drugs, with much
Ceremony and ridiculous Words and Actions. But
our Saviour's Miracles were effected without any of
these: they were simply and plainly performed,
which evidenceth that they were no Magical Prizes.
It might be added that <hi>Diabolical Wonders</hi> do not use
to be done by Men of Holy and Godly Lives, who
are Enemies to the Devil and all his Works. And
such was our Blessed Master, and such were his Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles:
therefore it is impossible that their Miracles
should be from a Diabolical Power, and that they
should do those Wonders by familiarity with Evil
Spirits. The cursed Daemons will never help and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
such Persons as they were.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>other</hi> Objections and Cavils scarcely (even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the judgment of some Persons who are no
Friends of Miracles) deserve any Reply. All sober
Men, who are not affected with the Dreams and
Dotages of the <hi>Iews,</hi> look upon the pretence of the
<hi>Hebrew Alphabet,</hi> or even of the <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> as
a mere Sham, as having no shew of Reason or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to support it. For to say that Christ turn'd
Water into Wine by the help of some <hi>Constellation,</hi>
or that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was enabled by the <hi>Stars</hi> to walk
safely upon the Waves, are assertions that are only
to be hissed at. As for <hi>natural Magick,</hi> it is gross
folly to alledg that here, seeing I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that True Miracles surpass the Power and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Nature.</hi> To impute them to <hi>Imagination</hi> is
yet more wild and extravagant, as if <hi>Fancy</hi> could fill
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:65397:267"/>
above five thousand hungry Peoples bellies with five
Loaves and two Fishes, or as if it were possible to
raise the Dead by merely imagining such a thing</p>
                     <p>From the Premises likewise we may be taught how
to return Answer to those Instances of Cures and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wonderful things done by some <hi>Pagans,</hi> which
seem to vie with the Miracles of <hi>Christ</hi> and his
<hi>Apostles. Plutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> tells us that
he cured some Diseases, especially the Spleen, by
touching the respective Parties with the Toe of his
right Foot. But what great matter is this? Here is
no sign of a <hi>Miracle,</hi> for the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and
those of <hi>France</hi> too, are thought to have a Virtue
to cure the <hi>Scrophulous</hi> humour with a Touch. And
with these Royal Touchers may be reckoned the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Stroker, <hi>Valentine Greatareck,</hi> who had a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of chasing Pains and Aches out of the Body
through the Toes and Fingers ends. Here is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is <hi>Rare</hi> and <hi>Vnusual,</hi> but I have suggested
before that this is not sufficient to make a <hi>Miracle:</hi>
it must be something that transcends human Power,
and that can be no way effected by it. Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said of these above named Instances, for in
the former sort the Fancy being envigorated by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Honour of a Touch from a <hi>Great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
Foot, or from the Hand of a <hi>Great Monarch;</hi>
and in the latter a Laborious Friction and Stroking
being used, and that for a considerable time, and in
some particular Pains only, are sufficient to solve the
<hi>Phaenomenon</hi> without having recourse to a <hi>Miracle.</hi>
Especially if you consider that the Cures reached but
to some Persons, and to some Times, as well as to
some Maladies: which ought not to be compared
with the healing of all Diseases, in all Persons, and
at all Times without the least failing.</p>
                     <p>But stranger things are attributed to <hi>Vespasian</hi> by
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:65397:267"/>
                        <note n="4" place="bottom">Histor. lib. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Tacitus</hi> and<note n="5" place="bottom">In Vespasiano cap. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Suetonius.</hi> These tell us that at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
he cured the Lame and Blind, by the direction
of <hi>Serapis</hi> a famed God among the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> This
makes a great noise among some Men, and therefore
we must give some account of it. There are some
very worthy Persons who think this Relation of the
foresaid Historians is true, <hi>i. e.</hi> that <hi>Vespasian</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
do those Cures, and that by an extraordinary
and divine Assistance. In those Cures, saith<note n="6" place="bottom">Vol. 1. Book 1. chap. 23.</note> Dr.
<hi>Iackson,</hi> there was the Finger of God pointing out
<hi>Vespasian</hi> to be Christ's Right Hand appointed for
some extraordinary and peculiar Service, even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
the Plagues foretold by him upon those <hi>Iews</hi> who
had reviled and crucified the Lord of Glory for the
like and other infinitely far greater Miracles wrought
among them. And<note n="7" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> Annotat. on Mat. 23. 3.</note> another Great Man goes yet
further, telling us that <hi>Vespasian</hi> was a Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of our Saviour, and thence his Coming to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> is often called <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Coming.</hi> And
he endeavours to shew in several particulars the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
between <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Titus Vespasian,</hi> and between
the Coming of one and the other. And thence it is
thought probable, that what the foresaid Historians
say of <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s healing the Blind and Lame was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
true; for he being such an extraordinary Person,
it is not incredible that he was blest with the Gift of
Healing.</p>
                     <p>But, with submission to the Judgments of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Men, I think we need not take this course,
and exalt this Pagan Emperor to such an heighth,
merely because a couple of Historians, his own
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:65397:268"/>
Countrymen, tell us such things of him. I rather
choose to satisfie my self and others about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by such offers as these.</p>
                     <p>1. It is not improbable that it was in flattery to
<hi>Vespasian</hi> that this was reported of him: for you
will find that these very Authors flatter this Prince
in as high a strain on another account. They<note n="8" place="bottom">Tacit. Hist. l. 5. Suet. in Vespas. cap. 7.</note> tell
us that the Prophecy which was abroad of one to
come out of the <hi>East,</hi> who should rule over all the
World, was meant of this Emperor, and <hi>Apollonius</hi>
the <hi>Tyanaan</hi> (as <hi>Philostratus</hi> relateth) labour'd to
perswade him of the same. And truly they might be
pardoned for so doing, when<note n="9" place="bottom">De bello Judaic. l. 7. c. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus the Iew</hi> out of
servile Flattery did the like, and would in a manner
perswade him he was the <hi>Messias.</hi> Thus you
may easily be induced to believe that in a fawning
way they gave out that this Great Prince could cure
the Blind and Lame: and this would fill the Peoples
heads with a Conceit of the Divinity of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
which they were very ambitious of.</p>
                     <p>2. Supposing there is <hi>some</hi> thing of Truth in the
matter of Fact, yet there seems to be in it an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Imitation of our Saviour; for as he restored a
blind Man to his Sight by using of spittle, so the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi>
would attempt to heal a blind Man with spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on his eyes, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> testifies. This looks
like a fond aping of our Lord, which renders the
thing suspicious, and shews the Cure to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</p>
                     <p>3. It is observable that there was only this <hi>one blind
Man</hi> on whom the pretended Cure is said to be
wrought: and they tell us but of <hi>one lame Man</hi> that
was heal'd by this Emperour: which shews the vast
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:65397:268"/>
difference between this and our Saviour's Cures,
which were many and frequent, and daily expos'd
to view; which is no small Argument of their being
real and true: whereas Cheats dare not venture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
once or twice for fear of a Discovery.</p>
                     <p>4. It is to be remembred that <hi>Vespasian</hi> was a great
Favourer and Friend of <hi>Apollonius</hi> of <hi>Tyana;</hi> and they
were both together present at the same time at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
when this Cure is said to be done, saith <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratus.</hi>
Hence I gather that <hi>Apollonius</hi> did the
Feat, tho it was ascribed to the Emperour for the
Reason aforesaid. If any wondrous thing was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
it was by that <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s Art: therefore of
him and his Pranks I will speak next.</p>
                     <p>This Person, who was a Grecian Philosopher, and
of the Pythagorean Sect, is much celebrated in His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
and his Exploits are exceedingly cried up by
<hi>Philostratus,</hi> who writ eight Books of the History of
this Man, and by <hi>Damis</hi> who was his perpetual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
and wrote his Life. <hi>Hierocles</hi> took this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi>
to be as Sacred a Person as <hi>Christ,</hi> and in his
Writings compares him with Him, yea exalts him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Him. But the admirable <hi>Eusebius</hi> hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
baffled this <hi>Hierocles,</hi> and those two others
who writ the Legend of <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s Life. He freely
grants that this <hi>Apollonius</hi> was a Great and very
improved Philosopher, and that he had brave and
excellent Notions, and talk'd above the Rate of a
common Philosopher. But then he gives him his
Due on the other hand, he shews how foolish, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
and ridiculous most of his Actions were. In
answer to <hi>Damis</hi> and <hi>Philostratus</hi> he lets them know
that their Testimonies of him are Fabulous and Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
as namely when they write that he perfectly
understood Languages which he never learn'd, that
he cur'd all Diseases, that he knew Mens Hearts and
Thoughts, and foresaw all Futurities. They should
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:65397:269"/>
not, saith he, have said so high things of him, if
they would have been believed: they have outdone
the thing they undertook, for since they hold <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi>
to be no more than a Philosopher, they had
no Reason to ascribe such Great and Prodigious
things to him. Whereas it was reported that this
<hi>Apollonius</hi> fetch'd a Woman to Life, as she was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to be buried, <hi>Philostratus</hi> himself thinks she was
not dead. It is incredible even to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he only saith, she<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> lib. 4. c. 16.</note> seemed to be dead. In brief,
<hi>Eusebius</hi> sheweth that most of the Prodigious and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous
things related concerning this Man are Cheats
and Forgeries, and the rest are the effects of Magick
and Witchcra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t. <hi>Philostratus</hi> doth not deny that it
was reported he studied Magick, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
convers'd with the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Gymnosophists
and <hi>Indian</hi> Bracmans in his Travels. And tho he
endeavours to disprove it, yet there is enough in
that very History to make it appear that <hi>Apollonius</hi>
gave his mind to that sort of unlawful Study, and
was a great Wizard and Necromancer. He was a
Person so noted over all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire for his
Magical Enterprizes, that <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Hammond</hi> think
These are spoken of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. To his Magick
we must impute not only all the great Wonders he
did in his Life, but what happen'd in the close of it:
for (as those forenamed Authors write) when he was
arraigned before <hi>Domitian</hi> (who hated him as much
as <hi>Titus</hi> loved him) he bragg'd that he was not to be
hurt, and that he was Immortal: and soon after
that he vanished in the midst of the Court, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
of the Emperour and the rest of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
Thus this great Sorcerer made his Exit. Now,
from what I have laid down before, it is evident
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:65397:269"/>
that these strange and wonderful Actions of his were
not <hi>True Miracles:</hi> for I have proved such cannot be
done by the help of Devils and Evil Spirits. Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Wonders are to magnifie the Author of them,
the Devil, and to promote Superstition and Idolatry
in the World, as these did: therefore they cannot be
from God, and consequently they are no Real Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
for such are always exerted by a Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, we may from the foregoing Discourse
judg of the Miracles which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to. There is great Reason to determine that
they are so far from being True Miracles, that they
are downright Forgeries and Impostures. For I.
Some of them are no other than what <hi>Impostors</hi> in all
Ages were permitted by God to do, as appears from
what hath been delivered. 2. Many of them are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Seeming Wonders,</hi> and such as <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians
are full of, but never thought them to be the
effects of Divine Power.<note n="2" place="bottom">Lib. I. cap. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> hath
gathered some of them together. 3. Many of the
Popish Miracles are frivolous and impertinent, vain,
trifling, and ridiculous; witness the fantastick and
Romantick Stories of the Exploits of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
St. <hi>Francis,</hi> St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and several others.
Any unprejudiced Person that reads them will say,
that they are unworthy of a Divine Author, and
therefore they must be excluded from the number of
True Miracles. Once upon a time<note n="3" place="bottom">Lib. Conformitat.</note> when St. <hi>Francis</hi>
was preaching in the fields, there came an Ass, and
made some disturbance among his Auditors, which
caus'd St. <hi>Francis</hi> to speak thus to the Brute, Brother
Ass, be quiet till I have ended my Sermon: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:65397:270"/>
upon the Ass presently came and laid him down very
peaceably at the Preacher's feet: to tell the World
they must all be such Asses, and come and crouch to
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and lie prostrate at the Priest's
Feet. 4. There is ground to believe that several of
the Miracles of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are the effects of
Diabolical Magick. <hi>Platina</hi> and others who have
writ the Popes Lives tell us very plainly, that some
of them studied and practised Magical Arts, and
were very great with the Devil: or else some of
them had never arrived to the Triple Crown.
Whilst that Church lays claim to <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> they
are no strangers to the Practices of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> It
is well known that sundry of their Priests deal with
the Diabolical Spirits, and thence we may justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that many of their pretended Miracles are
Specimens of the Black Art. 5. Let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that it is foretold in 2 <hi>Thess. 2. 9.</hi> that their
Friend <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall do Miracles. Such are theirs,
yea they are the very same, and are permitted by
God to be done among them for the same purpose,
viz. <hi>That they should believe a Lie,</hi> (i. e. their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
and <hi>that they all might be damned who believe not
the Truth,</hi> i. e. the Christian Religion in its Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Purity. 6. Seeing Miracles are for begetting
<hi>Belief,</hi> and they look upon us as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who with
them are as bad as <hi>Infidels,</hi> why do they not come
among us, and before our faces work Wonders and
Miracles? Let them not be done in <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi>
or <hi>Italy,</hi> but openly here in <hi>England,</hi> or in some other
<hi>Protestant</hi> Country, where we may behold what they
do. That Miracle-working faculty which operates
only at so great a distance from us, will gain little
credit. Or, let not a sorry Friar, but the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
do some Great Miracle where he is. Till then
we have cause to look upon them as Counterfeits.</p>
                     <p>Again, 7. This is to be thought of, that their own
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:65397:270"/>
Authors give them the Lie; as for Example, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they talk and write of <hi>Xaverius</hi>'s Miracles in the
<hi>Indies,</hi>
                        <note n="4" place="bottom">De salute Indiarum, 1. 6. c. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Acosta</hi> the Jesuit acknowledgeth that they
did no Miracles there, and he adds that there was
no need of any. Nay, <hi>Xaverius</hi> himself in his <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
which he wrote concerning his Travels and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings
in these Parts, makes no mention of them.
So some of the Miracles attributed to <hi>Ignatius Loiola</hi>
are confess'd by those that write his <hi>Life</hi> to be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and incredible; and by others of the <hi>Roman</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they are said to be forg'd after his Death, as
Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> (now Bishop) shews in his <hi>Enthusiasm
of the Church of Rome,</hi> p. 118, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And even St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>'s
Miracle of the <hi>Five Wounds</hi> imprinted on his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
was look'd upon as a Fable by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Ninth. We may then justly disbelieve the Stories of
<hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Xaverius</hi> and St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Miracles, and
of the rest of that Perswasion, and be convinced that
they were Falshoods, to magnify the <hi>Cause,</hi> and to
extol <hi>their Church.</hi> 8. Many of these <hi>Popish</hi> Miracles
have been actually discovered to be Cheats. It hath
been manifestly proved (and there are several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of it extant) that they were the mere contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of their Priests: And such particularly were
some of those Miracles which were pretended to be
done by the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Loretto,</hi> and by St. <hi>Iames</hi>
at <hi>Compostella.</hi> I could shew that the Miracles of the
Papists are question'd by themselves, their Truth
is doubted of by <hi>Cajetan de Concept. Virg. Espencaeus</hi>
in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. and others of that Communion. 9. We
may with Reason suspect the <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles, because
our Religion was proved and confirmed by Miracles
long before. It is not requisite they should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
and reiterated afresh. There is no more need
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:65397:271"/>
of <hi>New Miracles</hi> than there is of <hi>New Revelations.</hi>
They were wrought to confirm the Truth which we
hold at this day: therefore since we have the same
Truth that was confirmed by those Miracles of old,
what need is there of any farther Confirmation?
Lastly, the Popish Miracles are no True Miracles,
because they are exerted to maintain a false Religion;
for such is that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> consisting of
damnable Doctrines, Superstition, Idolatry, and all
manner of Ungodly, Lewd and Prophane Practices.
We cannot think then that God will by Miracles at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and allow of such Abominations. If then they
still insist on the Miracles wrought by some of them
among the <hi>Indians,</hi> as they pretend, I say this, that
if it can be proved they were done among those Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
it was to confirm the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> not the
<hi>Popish.</hi> Thus you see that these Boasters of Miracles,
and who make them a Note of their Church, are
found to be but Pretenders, and can lay no claim,
as they are of that Church, to those Miracles which
are Real, Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uine and True, and which only are
the certain Testimonies of the Truth of Christianity.
Which brings me to the</p>
                     <p>3<hi>d</hi> and last thing I undertook, <hi>viz.</hi> To evince that
these Miracles are, and ought to be look'd upon as
<hi>an Infallible Testimony of the Truth of Christianity.</hi> To
these Christ himself appealed as a Proof of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Messiahship, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 4, 5. To that Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Art thou he that should come, or do we look for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
the Answer was, <hi>Go and shew those things which
you hear and see; the Blind receive their Sight, the
Lame walk,</hi> &amp;C. So when the <hi>Iews</hi> were earnest with
him to declare who he was; <hi>If thou be the Christ,</hi> say
they, <hi>tell us plainly: Iesus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nswer'd them, The Works
which I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me,</hi>
John 10. 24, 25. These are a sufficient Attestation
of my Divine Authority. Therefore he saith in
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:65397:271"/>
John 15. 24. <hi>If I had not done amongst them the Works
which no other Man did, they had not had Sin,</hi> i. e. their
Unbelief had been no Sin: for if those Works were
not a Proof of my Divine Commission, they were
not bound to believe me. But on the contrary, those
miraculous Works being undeniable Evidences of his
acting by a Power from Heaven, it was a grievous
and damning Sin to disbelieve him. So the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
when their preaching the Gospel was opposed and
contradicted, thought they sufficiently disproved the
Gainsayers by shewing <hi>that Iesus of Nazareth</hi> (whom
they preach'd) <hi>was a Man approved</hi> (or<note n="*" place="bottom">

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>of God among them by Miracles and Wonders, and
Signs which God did by him in the midst of them, as they
themselves also know,</hi> Acts 2. 22. Christ's Miracles
were a <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the Truth of <hi>his</hi> Doctrine,
and consequently of that of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> because it
was the same. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues the Truth of
Christianity from the miraculous Indowments and
Gifts of the Apostles, and declares to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
that it is extreme dangerous to neglect that Doctrine,
and that Salvation <hi>which at the first began to be spoken
by the Lord</hi> himself, <hi>and was</hi> afterwards <hi>confirmed unto
them by them that heard him, God also bearing them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
both with Signs and Wonders, and with diverse Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and Gifts of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Heb. 2. 3, 4.
Here is the just Method of the Progress and Proof
of the Gospel, here is first the Author and Founder
of it, <hi>the Lord</hi> Christ Jesus <hi>who at the first began to
speak</hi> and deliver it: Secondly, the Evidence of its
delivery, it <hi>was confirmed by them that heard it,</hi> i. e. by
the Apostles, who were Ear-witnesses of this Divine
Doctrine: Thirdly, the Truth and Certainty of the
Apostles Testimony concerning Christ and his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<hi>God bore them witness with Signs and Wonders, and
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:65397:272"/>
with diverse Miracles,</hi> which are as great a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what they deliver'd as can possibly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
                     <p>Yea, <hi>Miracles</hi> have been always accounted such,
even by those who were not very forward to imbrace
our Saviour and his Doctrine. The Common People,
<hi>when they had seen the Miracles that Iesus did,</hi> could
say, <hi>this is of a Truth that Prophet that should come into
the World,</hi> John 6. 14. This was the reasoning of the
Man that was born blind, and was restored to his
sight; <hi>Since the World began was it not heard that any
Man</hi> by his own Power <hi>opened the Eyes of one that was
born blind. If this Man were not of God,</hi> were not
assisted with an infinite Power, <hi>he could do nothing</hi> of
this nature, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 32, 33. And not only the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and illiterate, but the wise and learned argued
after this manner. <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a Ruler of the Jews,
came to Christ with this Acknowledgment, <hi>we know
that thou art a Teacher come from God, for no Man can
do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him,</hi>
John 3. 2. Here he confesses it as a known Truth
that <hi>Miracles</hi> are sufficient to attest a Person or
Doctrine to be from God: and consequently they are
good Arguments of the Truth of what our Saviour
taught, and they prove him to be the <hi>Messias.</hi> And
the Chief Priests and Pharisees could say, <hi>this Man
doth many Miracles: if we let him thus alone, all will
believe on him,</hi> John 11. 47, 48. This strongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that <hi>Miracles</hi> are able to create <hi>Belief,</hi> and so
unawares they acknowledg that the Miracles which
<hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> wrought are good evidence
that their Doctrine was from God, and that it was
to be believed and imbraced. The <hi>Iewish Rabbins</hi> in
their Writings speak much of the <hi>Miracles</hi> the <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
shall do; which is an Argument that those Men
were really perswaded that Miracles are a Proof of
a Divine Commission, and that they are to seal the
Truth of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="531" facs="tcp:65397:272"/>This was the very Notion and Sense of the <hi>Pagan</hi>
World, as is plain from that Passage recorded in the
<hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> chap. 14. 8, 11, 12. When <hi>Paul
cured a certain Man at</hi> Lystra <hi>impotent in his Feet, being
a Cripple from his Mothers Womb, who never had walked,</hi>
the People of the place seeing this Miracle presently
<hi>lifted up their Voices, saying, the Gods are come down to
us in the likeness of Men.</hi> Their natural Reason dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to them that this was done by Divine Power,
and could not be done otherwise. The <hi>Workers of
Miracles</hi> are by these poor Heathens reputed as <hi>Gods.</hi>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was taken by them for <hi>Mercury;</hi> he that could
give motion and nimbleness to the Lame Man of <hi>Lys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>
was thought to be the God with the <hi>winged Feet.</hi>
But the Reason assigned in the History why St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was taken for <hi>Mercury</hi> is because he was so <hi>excellent a
Speaker. Barnabas</hi> said little or nothing, and so
pass'd with them for Grave <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who had his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter.</hi>
And this was St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he was <hi>Mercurius,</hi>
a good <hi>Spokesman</hi> indeed, one of an admirable
Tongue that could perswade the Lame to walk, and
a Cripple to use his Feet. However these ignorant
<hi>Heathens</hi> were mistaken as to their making Gods of
Men, yet in the main they were in the right, <hi>viz.</hi>
that that miraculous Healing argued Divinity, and
that none could do such things but those who are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by Heaven.</p>
                     <p>And as this is the sense of Mankind, so indeed it
must be thus in the very nature of the thing it self:
for what is above created Power proceeds from God,
and what is from him is to some great end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
worthy of him; thus <hi>Miracles,</hi> exceeding the
Power of Nature, are the Attestation of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and are design'd to evidence that Truth, and to
authorize that Doctrine which is from God, which
are very great and excellent Ends, and becoming the
Author of them. Accordingly the <hi>Miracles</hi> which
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:65397:273"/>
Christ and his Apostles wrought were intended to
confirm and establish the Gospel which they preach'd,
and to demonstrate to the World that that Gospel is
true. For God would not throw away Miracles;
much less would he use them to confirm a false Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
We may be assured of this, that God's infinite
Wisdom and Goodness would not give up the World
to such an unavoidable Deceit, as such a Multitude of
Miracles would lead Men into, if they were used to
attest an Imposture, to confirm a Lie. If I cannot
know the <hi>Messias</hi> to be sent of God when he raised
the Dead, wrought all other sorts of Miracles, and
rose himself from the Dead, I have no possibility of
knowing who speaks from God, or whether I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
or no, or whether there be any truth and reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in things or no. This then we may build upon; there
being <hi>Truth</hi> in the World, <hi>Miracles</hi> undeniably point
us to it, for they being a Testimony from God, they
cannot attest Falshood, but must necessarily direct us
to and confirm us in that which is true. Our <hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity</hi>
being founded on Miracles cannot but be of
divine Allowance, it is impossible but that it should
be from God. Christ and the Apostles could not have
had Power to work true Miracles if their Doctrine
had not been true; for God would not, and cannot
maintain a Lie by a Miracle, for then he is no God.
We cannot then expect a more convincing Evidence
of Divine Authority than this, <hi>viz.</hi> that our Saviour
spoke great and excellent things, and that he wrought
Miracles to confirm what he said. What would you
have more? It was necessary, that he should confirm
the Truth of his Doctrine by his <hi>Miracles:</hi> and now
they are wrought, there is a necessity, in order to our
being <hi>Christians,</hi> that we heartily believe them.</p>
                     <p>I say, <hi>Miracles</hi> were <hi>necessary</hi> for confirming the
Gospel, because the Gospel was look'd upon as a thing
new and unheard of, as you may remember the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:65397:273"/>
of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philosophers against St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was that he delivered a <hi>New Doctrine, and brought
strange things to their Ears,</hi> Acts 17. 19, 20. They
were long accustomed to other Notions, and so there
was a vast Prejudice on their Minds: Wherefore <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
were necessary to gain Credit to the Christian
Faith, and to bring them off effectually from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sentiments. Again, many things in the Gospel
were above the flight of Humane Reason, and on that
account were not easily entertain'd: which made it
requisite that they should be declared to be true by
extraordinary Signs and Wonders. Likewise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Persons who preach'd and profess'd the
Christian Religion were poor inconsiderable Men, it
was necessary that they should bring Credentials
from God to attest what they deliver'd. When they
shew'd this Seal, this broad Seal of Heaven, none
could question their Commission. Besides, the World
was then full of Idolatry and false Religions, which
could not be rooted out but by such a strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
way as this, <hi>viz.</hi> the working of Mighty Signs
and Miracles, even such as outvie the Power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and the Pranks of Magicians.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law and Oeconomy having
been before establish'd by <hi>Miracles,</hi> it was neeessary
that the Evangelical Law and Dispensation should be
attested in the like manner. God himself had consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
several things before, which now were taken
away by <hi>Christ;</hi> therefore he taking them away ought
to shew his Authority, which he did by working of
uncontroulable Miracles. And to shew that the Law
was to give place to the Gospel, he and his followers
wrought far greater Miracles than any that were done
before to attest the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Religion. Therefore he
told the Jews that <hi>he did among them the Works which
none other Man did,</hi> John 15. 24. And as they were
greater, so they were more in number than those of
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:65397:274"/>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets:</hi> which was also necessary to
take away all scruple from Mens Minds, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
in them a hearty and full Belief of Christ's Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
For this was the end of their being wrought,
<hi>viz.</hi> to confirm the Belief of the Gospel, and to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Men, even us at this day, that God himself
bears witness to what Christ and his Apostles deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The use of these Miracles, I say, extends to us,
and to all Ages of the Church: tho we saw them not,
yet their Virtue comes down to us. All the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
done by our Saviour and his Apostles are as forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and convincing <hi>now</hi> as if they were done in our
Days: they are still, and ever will be an infallible
Proof, Evidence and Demonstration of the Truth of
Christianity. To shut up this head, if the Christian
Religion be founded on the Mighty Miracles of our
Lord and his Apostles, the Scripture is true, and our
Religion is true: but if these are not, take notice
(to confound the Folly and Sottishness of such Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers)
it is the greatest <hi>Miracle</hi> of all (if I may so
say) that Christianity was receiv'd and believ'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Miracles. So much concerning the <hi>Divine Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>

another proof of the Truth of it.
Some of the learnedest and wisest Jews convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Christianity. A Catalogue of knowing
and learned Pagans in the five first Centuries
that abandoned Gentilism, and embraced the
Christian Religion. Remarkable Instances of
the Power of the Christian Truth. The virtue
of the Gospel far exceeds that of Philosophy.
Examples of great and rich Men converted to
the Christian Faith. This prevail'd against
the rage of the most powerful Persecutors.
The more the Gospel was oppress'd, the more it
flourish'd and prosper'd in all Nations. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of God's remarkable Judgments on the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of Christianity, especially on the Nation
of the Jews. This latter insisted upon, and
shew'd to be an Argument of the Truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
Particular Inferences from this part
of the Discourse, viz. 1. Assent to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion. 2. Assert and defend it.
More General Inferences from the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Dispensation are such as these, 1. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the transcendent Excellency of it. 2. Be
thankful for it. 3. Learn hence our great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to Holiness and strictness of Life.
This enlarg'd upon. 4. If we live not sutably
to this Dispensation, our doom will be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable

of Men that this is not thought of.
5. We are to look upon this as the last Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
This is the meaning of Eph. 1. 10.
which Words are fully expounded. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
from the Gospel's being call'd the New
Testament. And from those Expressions
[the last times] [the last days]. Wherefore
we must not expect any New Dispensation.</p>

                        <pb n="535" facs="tcp:65397:274"/>Fourthly, THE <hi>wonderful prevailing of Christianity</hi>
is another Testimony no less than <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
of the <hi>Truth</hi> of it. Observe the marvelous
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:65397:275"/>
spreading and increasing of it; at first Christ began
with twelve Apostles and seventy Disciples: after his
Death, the number of the Names of the Disciples is
said to be <hi>about a Hundred and Twenty,</hi> Acts 1. 15.
Soon after; <hi>three Thousand</hi> were converted to Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. and afterwards <hi>five Thousand</hi>
more, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 4. Then we read that <hi>a great Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Priests were obedient to the Faith,</hi> Acts 6. 7.
And <hi>of honourable Women not a few believed,</hi> Acts 17.
12. And several more at other times, till Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in a short space of time got a considerable footing
in the World. The <hi>elder Pliny,</hi> who was <hi>Proconful</hi>
under the <hi>Emperour Trajan,</hi> and therefore knew very

last Christ's Gospel broke in pieces <hi>Gentilism,</hi> and
within much less than a Century cast the Empire into
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:65397:275"/>
the Lap of the Church. This quick Advance of the
Christian Church, this strange progress and success
of the Faith of the Gospel proclaim it to be from
God, and him alone.</p>
                     <p>This wonderful increase of Christianity in so short a
time was signified in our Saviour's Parable, in the <hi>13th</hi>
of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where the Kingdom of Heaven is
compared to a <hi>Grain of Mustard-seed,</hi> which increases
to a <hi>Tree</hi> in a short time. So the Gospel at first was
little and mean, a few contemptible Men came to
Christ and owned his Doctrine, but their Numbers
grew greater and greater, and in few years the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Religion spread it self over the World and all
the Kingdoms of the Earth. In the same Chapter
the Gospel is compared to <hi>Leaven,</hi> which spreads it
self through the whole Mass: so the Evangelical
Doctrine diffused it self of a sudden, and was seen
to be dilated into a very spacious Circumference in a
little time. Christianity so over-ran the Empire, that
those who before were named <hi>Ethnicks</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
were now call'd <hi>Pagans</hi> because they lived in poor
<hi>Country Towns</hi> only. The In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>idels were now but few
and of mean Quality: the chief Cities and Towns
were fill'd with those that profess'd the Christian
Religion, though (as was said) the Country was
not left empty of them.</p>
                     <p>But by what means was this done? Was it by deep
Policy or mighty Force? No. Christianity prevail'd
not as <hi>Mahomets Sect</hi> did: that got up by Military Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
by Sword and War, and force of Arms. But
the Christians never struck one stroke for their Cause,
unless you reckon that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> when he cut off
the High Priest's Servant's Ear: but then he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by his Master to put up his Weapon, and
they never drew it afterwards. Christianity was not
acquainted with Martial Discipline and the Law of
Arms: there was no use of these harsh Methods in
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:65397:276"/>
the propagating of it. Again, <hi>Mahometism</hi> prevail'd
in a rude and illiterate Nation: that Impostor was
witty, and knew how to cajole the ignorant People.
But Christianity grew up in the most civilized parts
of the World, where there was the greatest Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
and the most Arts: and we have Examples of
the profoundest Philosophers and Sages that imbraced
the Christian Faith. I wave the mentioning of <hi>others</hi>
besides <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who had a <hi>Martial</hi> or a <hi>Politick</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to help them in their Enterprizes, and to carry
on their designs. I only observe to you the <hi>marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Power</hi> and <hi>prevalency of Christianity,</hi> which is seen
in this, that tho it made no use of these Means, yet
it daily increas'd, and was every where propagated.
From low and mean beginnings it grew up to a vast
Proportion, and at length it arrived to the Sway and
Soveraignty over the greatest Kingdoms. Here I
will insist on these two Heads. 1. That in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
of Christianity the Ignorant prevail'd against
the Learned and Wise. 2. That the Weak prevail'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Strong and Powerful: both which are no
mean Arguments of the <hi>Truth of Christianity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, the <hi>Ignorant</hi> prevail'd against the <hi>Wise.</hi> For
what were the <hi>Apostles?</hi> Were they any other than
ignorant and unlearned, simple rude Men, not bred
up in the Schools of Learning, not acquainted with
Arts and Sciences, wholly Strangers to Philosophy
and the fashionable Learning of those days? What
were the <hi>Apostles</hi> but poor despicable Mechanicks, who
knew nothing but their sorry Boats and homely Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages?
And what were the Men that these illiterate
Persons opposed? They were the Learned <hi>Doctors</hi>
and <hi>Rabbins,</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who were the
wisest Clerks and Scholars amongst the <hi>Iews.</hi> Yet
we read that some of these knowing Men attended
to the Doctrine of the Gospel preach'd by Christ
and his Apostles: some of these owned Christ and
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:65397:276"/>
Christianity. When Jesus was presented in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Simeon,</hi> a Grave and Reverend Person, one of
singular Wisdom and Sanctity amongst the Jews, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
him publickly to be the <hi>Messias</hi> and <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi>
foretelling also many things of him. Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was favoured by <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> a wise
Counsellour, by <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Doctor of the Jewish
Law, and afterwards by <hi>Gamaliel</hi> another Learned
Doctor of the Law, who by the<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 5. 34.</note> advice he gave may
be thought to have been a Friend of Christianity.
<hi>Saul,</hi> a Man of great Learning and Abilities, brought
up at the feet of this or another <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi>
of <hi>Alexandria</hi> very knowing and powerful in the
Scriptures, were converted to Christianity, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themselves to the Faith of Christ. So in the
next Ages, altho the <hi>Iews</hi> out of malice and hatred
to Christianity (as<note n="†" place="bottom">Justin. Martyr. Dialog. cum Tryph.</note> one tells them to their Faces)
sent out their Emissaries, and those of no mean Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
into all parts of the World, to perswade Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
against that Religion, and to make them believe
that the Professors of it were guilty of Atheism and all
Impiety, yet this had but little effect upon them, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Men of good Understanding and Knowledg im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the Christian Faith, and lived and died in it.</p>
                     <p>And as some of the <hi>learnedest Iews</hi> were converted
by the preaching of the Gospel which they once coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
foolishness, so among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> some of the
wisest Philosophers and wittiest Orators and skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Artists (for the Arts as well as Empire were at
their heighth when the Gospel appeared, when Christ
came) acknowledged the Truth of Christianity, and
heartily espoused it. These Men, who were of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Learning and Parts, quitted their beloved
Sentiments and Principles, and freely imbraced the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:65397:277"/>
Evangelical Doctrine. The early Trophies of the

of <hi>Africa,</hi> who of a Civil Lawyer commenced a

Christianity, and was a zealous Defender of it, and

great Scholars, these Masters of Arts and Reason

the Gospel, and were captivated by it. These Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of great Endowments and Acquirements, and the

became greedy Proselytes to the Christian Faith,

as to <hi>see</hi> the great Convention at <hi>Nice,</hi> but as to be

ingaged the Enemies and Opposers of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

came on purpose to shew their Parts and Wit at that

with them with a marvellous and almost incredible
Vivacity: he beat back their Cavils, he baffled their
Sophistries, he defended the Christian Cause, and
gain'd upon some of its very Adversaries to own the
same. And particularly, when a famous Philosopher
disturb'd the whole Council with his Disputes, he
only standing up and barely propounding the main
Christian Truths to him, and bidding him in the
Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> attend to them, made him become
mute, and leave off his Logick and wrangling, and
confess before them that he believ'd those things to
be true, and that there came Force and Virtue out
of the Mouth of this aged Saint and Confessor which

he was not able to resist. Here was seen the <hi>Virtue</hi>
and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Christian Truth.</hi> By its own native
strength and efficacy it gain'd these mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.
It pretended not to Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
it boasted not of skill in Arts and Sciences,

                     <p>This is wonderful indeed: and therefore you read

of the promulgers of it, for it had no commerce

with human Arts and Sciences. Herein therefore
the mighty Power of God is most signally declared,
the Finger of the Omnipotent is most plainly seen,
and at the same time the Authority and Divinity of
the Gospel are ascertained to us. To this end Christ
chose Ignorant and Untaught Men to be his Apostles,

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Weak</hi> prevailed against the <hi>Strong
and Mighty.</hi> For what were the Apostles and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llowers
of Christ but poor weak contemptible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?
Were they not pitiful Fishermen and Tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,
and such sorry Traders as these, who made
no Figure in the World? Nay, some of them were
taken out of the number of the vile and infamous, as
<hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Zacheus,</hi> a couple of <hi>Publicans</hi> or <hi>Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers,</hi>
which was a scandalous Employment at
that time, as <hi>Celsus</hi>
                        <note n="4" place="bottom">Origen contr. Cels.</note> objected to the Christians.
And what were the Persons who were Enemies to
Christ and his Followers? They were Men of the
greatest Note, Persons of Repute and Honour; they
were Rich and Wealthy, Great and Mighty. But,
as I proved before under the former Head, that <hi>the
foolishness of God is wiser than Men,</hi> so now, according
to the same Apostle, I will let you see that <hi>the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God is stronger than men. The Son of Man</hi> with
his poor despised Apostles prevail'd against those
who were of the greatest Power and Authority. This
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:65397:281"/>
was made good in the wonderful Conversion of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to Christianity: for as we presented you before
with a List of <hi>Converted Philosophers,</hi> so here we
might produce a numerous Catalogue of the <hi>Great
and Rich Men</hi> who were converted to the Christian
Faith. For tho the Apostle saith, <hi>not many Wise Men
after the flesh, not many Mighty, not many Noble are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
1 Cor. 1. 26. i. e. the Number of these is far
short of those who are call'd of another Quality; yet
I have shew'd you already that some <hi>wise Men after
the flesh</hi> have been called and converted; and now
I will mention some of those <hi>Mighty</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi> who
were call'd to the same Faith in Christ.</p>
                     <p>There was <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> an <hi>Honourable

of the <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Mighty</hi> who were converted to

in the succeeding Reigns, and at last the Christian
Cross was set upon Imperial Crowns. Here the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Christianity is to be seen, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of these Persons who were the most averse to
the Religion of <hi>Iesus,</hi> for they were generally more
addicted to Sensuality than others, and therefore it
was the more difficult to bring them to so Strict and

them to the Christian Faith.</p>
                     <p>But I proceed further to make good my Assertion,
that in planting and propagating the Gospel the
Weak prevail'd over the Strong. This is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evident from what we learn from the <hi>History of the
Church,</hi> viz. that Christianity prevail'd against the
rage and fury of the most powerful Persecutors.
From <hi>Nero</hi>'s time to the end of <hi>Dioclesian</hi>'s Reign,
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:65397:282"/>
abating some Intervals, the Christians in all parts of
the World whither the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire extended, were
miserably harassed, severely punished and tortured,
and underwent all manner of cruel Deaths; yet all
that time the Cause of Christ flourished, and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
prevail'd against the Power of Princes and
States, against the utmost Violence, Persecution and
Bloodshed. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors could subdue the
mightiest Kings, and make the <hi>Persians, Scythians</hi> and
<hi>Armenians</hi> stoop to their Power, and they erected
many <hi>Trophies</hi> as Demonstrations of this their Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Prowess; yet these great Ones could not baffle the
attempts of the poor weak Servants of <hi>Iesus:</hi> but
the more Christianity was persecuted, the more it
increased, the more it flourished; and in the midst of
all Disadvantages, Oppositions and Oppressions it
gained Ground. Thus<note n="5" place="bottom">Nec quicquam proficit exquisitior quae<expan>

                     <p>Here is to be discern'd the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of
Christianity, and from thence we may infer the <hi>Truth</hi>
of it. For, as<note n="8" place="bottom">Nullum est efficacius testimonium inter mortales quàm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thousands of Martyrs have confirmed the
Truth of it with their Blood. And that Blood was
the Advancement of Christianity; this thriv'd and
prospered upon it, and Proselites were continually
gain'd to it by their observing the patient Sufferings
of the Servants of Jesus. Thus it was even in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beginning, great multitudes of People flock'd to
the Baptismal Waters, and entred themselves into
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:65397:283"/>
Christianity, because they beheld the undaunted
Courage of the Professors of it even at their dying
hour, and were moved thence to imbrace the Faith
which they saw them so zealously maintain even unto
death. These were <hi>the baptized for the dead,</hi> whom
St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. as I have shew'd in

of those <hi>Martyrs</hi> who died in defence of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Cause. They were so far from being discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
that they were excited to Christianity by their
beholding the deportment of the suffering Saints.
And thus it was afterwards, the Blood of the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
brought in great numbers of Converts to the
Evangelical Faith, and thereby the Cause of <hi>Iesus</hi>
was mightily advanced. They are remarkable words

And certainly it is one of the greatest Proofs of the
Verity of the Christian Religion, and therefore is
made use of by the generality of the Antient Fathers
of the Church: and particularly by St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in

establish'd notwithstanding the universal Opposition
it met with, and that at last the Patience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy

triumphed over all. Thus I have shew'd

<hi>Titus</hi> thither, who bent all the Force of the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Capital City, and closely besieged it.
Yet, as the<note n="9" place="bottom">De Bello Jud. in Prolog. <hi>Iewish</hi>
                        </note> Historian himself acknowledges,
this merciful Prince acted this Tragical Part unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly:
he all the while pitied the <hi>Iews,</hi> and testifi'd
it by his Tears; he deferred from time to time the
Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and kept up the Siege the
longer, that the <hi>Iews</hi> might repent of their Doings,
and submit themselves to his Arms. But when he
saw they were obstinate, and would by no means
make good use of his Forbearance, he resolv'd to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
their Incorrigibleness, and accordingly he fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them with an unusual severity, and wofully sack'd
and destroy'd the City, and burnt both it and the
Temple to the ground. No less than eleven hundred
thousand were kill'd by Fire, Sword, Famin, and
civil Discord in the time of the Siege; and ninety se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thousand were taken Captives at the sacking of
it, there being then a vast confluence of <hi>Iews</hi> from all
parts to celebrate the <hi>Passover:</hi> for as this was the
time when our Saviour was crucifi'd, so at this very
Season the <hi>Iews</hi> were remarkably punish'd for cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
him. An innumerable company of that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant
Nation, which sold Christ for thirty pieces of
Silver, were exposed to sale at a far cheaper Rate;
for (as this Author affirms) the Market ran so low that
twenty <hi>Iews</hi> were sold for a penny. The whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Temple were utterly demolish'd to the ground.
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:65397:287"/>
And this was done by him who was stiled <hi>the Darling
and Delight of Mankind,</hi> as if the <hi>Iews</hi> were not of
<hi>Human Race.</hi> And further it is remarkable, that this
People endeavour'd in the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Reign
to restore and reedifie their Temple, but were forced
to desist from it. And afterwards when <hi>Iulian</hi> out
of hatred to the Christians set them about that Work,
as they were laying the Foundation, an Earthquake
shatter'd all they had done, and Fire flash'd out of the
ground wherewith many thousands of the <hi>Iews</hi> were
destroyed, as is testified not only by several<note n="1" place="bottom">Greg. Naz. Orat. 4. cont. Julianum. Chrysostom. Hom. 4. in Matth. Sozomen Eccl. Hist. l. 5. cap. 21. Theodor. lib. 3. cap. 17.</note> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

Providence of God towards the <hi>Iews</hi> is long since

the remarkable Example of Divine Justice and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
such as no Story can parallel. <hi>Tully</hi> is not to

But now these Persons, who were the Dear Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of those that were the Darlings of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
the Beloved of the Lord, his Chosen People,
his peculiar Charge, and the singular Care of Heaven,
have been for sixteen Centuries forsaken of God and
all Men, and are the very Offscowring of the World.
This utter Extermination of the <hi>Iews</hi> is an unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Argument against them, and shews that they
lie under the Curse of God for their rejecting the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

                     <p>And truly this must be said that the total dispersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Iews</hi> can never in all its Circumstances be
reconciled with the Providence of God, his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Wisdom, and Promises, if they continue the
People of God still, and are in favour with him. For
can it be imagined that God would leave his Beloved
People so long, and wholly disown them? Is it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of God, and agreeable to his Wisdom and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which are interested in the Salvation of Men, to
let the <hi>True Religion</hi> (so they count <hi>Iudaism</hi>) fall to
the ground and be utterly abolished, and to set up
another, a False one (so they reckon <hi>Christianity to
be</hi>) in its place? This is plain and convincing, I think:
It is harsh and incredible that the God of Order and
Righteousness should deal thus, that he should cause
this Confusion in the World, and throw down and
even break in pieces a Religion which is the only
True one, according to them. It cannot enter into
any Reasonable Mans mind that God would let his

own Religion and People be thus confounded. It is
evident therefore that the <hi>Iewish Religion</hi> was but for
a time, and that the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> was to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
that, and that this is the <hi>True Religion;</hi> likewise
that God sent this severe Punishment on the <hi>Iews</hi> for
their refusing of Christ the True and Only Messiah,
and for their Opposing and Persecuting, and at last
Crucifying this Holy One. Thus the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is attested and vouched by the <hi>dreadful Plagues
and Iudgments on the Persons and Nations that opposed
it.</hi> Vengeance hath pursued the Enemies of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, from the <hi>Excellency of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and of all the Principles, Doctrines and Truths
that belong to it, I gather the <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi>
of it. This is another Divine Testimony which
might be enlarg'd upon. Never was Holiness so
strictly urged as now, never was there an Institution
that was so Heavenly and Sublime as this; never was
there any that directed Men to such Noble Ends, and
afforded them such Joys and Solaces. Wherefore it
cannot proceed from any but God. A Religion that
so immediately leads to him must needs come from
him. Since Christianity doth fit us for Heaven, we
have Reason to believe that it came from thence.
But because I had occasion to insist largely upon this
Particular when I undertook to assert the <hi>Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scriptures,</hi> and afterwards when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
the <hi>Excellency and Perfection of them,</hi> I
will say no more of this last Argument of the <hi>Truth
of Christianity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus you see the firm Basis of it. These ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
the Testimonials to prove the Truth of our Religion,
and that it is a Dispensation different from all the
rest. These are the Proofs whereon we found this
Oeconomy, and there is no other evidence that a
Reasonable Man can desire. I say, <hi>no other,</hi> becaus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="564" facs="tcp:65397:289"/>
here are all kinds of Evidience; <hi>Christianity</hi> is proved
by the Witness of credible Men, and by the Attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God himself. It is proved by Natural and
Supernatural Arguments, by Reason and by Faith.
We have the Certainty both of Human and Divine
Testimony, which may be call'd a <hi>Demonstration:</hi> for
a thing is demonstrated when it appears that there is
an absolute Impossibility that the thing should not be
thus, and when there is a Contradiction involved in
the Matter otherwise. So here is a Moral Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that it should be otherwise: take all things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and it is not possible but that it should be thus;
and the contrary implies a Contradiction to Sense,
Reason, and Scripture.</p>
                     <p>I should now proceed to <hi>the last Thing</hi> I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

is truly a Science, and surpasseth all others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Ground of it is supernatural Light, and the
very Testimony of God himself. Particularly the
Articles of <hi>Christianity</hi> are founded on Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,

of the Gospel is built on this Rock, this Stable
and Impregnable Rock. <hi>The Foundation of God stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

<hi>Christian Theology</hi> is founded on a sure Bottom;
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> the Son of God (and who is himself
God) having fixed it. Heaven and Earth shall pass
away, but this Word shall not pass away.</p>
                     <p>With relation to this, Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Treatise <hi>of the
Excellency of Theology compared with Natural Philosophy</hi>
is well worth our perusal. That admirable Person,
so well skill'd in the Study of Physiologie, shews the
Preeminence of the Study of Divinity above it on this
account, that Theological Truths are evidenced by
Divine Testimony, and therefore we may firmly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in them, and require no further or greater
Proof (as indeed there can be no greater) tho, as I
have shew'd, they are not destitute of other Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The <hi>Evangelical</hi> Truths especially are the True

                        </gap>clared the Divinity
of the Son of God, which is the Noblest and Sublimest
Point of Christianity, and is matter of pure Faith,
and Divine Revelation. Be convinced then of the
True Grounds of your <hi>Christian Belief,</hi> of the solid
Foundations and undeniable Evidences which <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
is built upon. Know this, that God could not
have done more for the begetting of a strong Faith
and Assurance.</p>
                     <p>2. Assert and defend, maintain and hold fast your
Religion, and let nothing shake your Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.
Indeed it is a wonder that such strong Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
of the Christian Religion should be struck at
by any: but so it is, <hi>Hereticks, Iews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> of
old, and high-flown <hi>Enthusiasts, Deists, Atheists,
Lewd</hi> and <hi>Dissolute Christians</hi> of late, have endeavour'd
to shake these Foundations. Be you therefore the
more Zealous in the defence of Christianity, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it is no Shadow or Phantom, it depends not
on Imagination and Conceit, but is certainly True,
beyond all the subtile evasions and subterfuges of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters.
It is an Excellency in a Man's Life to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sure Grounds, and consequently to know what
to do. You have this Advantage in the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
it being something which is certain and fixed:
and therefore this should make you constant in the
Profession and Exercise of it: this should make you
steady in your Resolves and Actions. Your Religion
being so Firm and Certain, you ought to stand to it,
and to suffer none to rob you of it, but to part with
all for it.</p>
                     <p>These are the two <hi>Particular Inferences</hi> from this
last thing I have discoursed of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Truth and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the Christian Religion. There are <hi>more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:65397:290"/>
Deductions</hi> to be made from the <hi>whole Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and they are these:</p>
                     <p>1. Let us take notice of and admire the transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Worth of the Christian Religion. I have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Religion through all its several Stages, I have l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t
you see the whole intire Progress of it: and you
cannot but observe that all the former <hi>Dispensations</hi>
made way for this of <hi>Christianity.</hi> It must then be a
very admirable Thing to which all that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in God's own Oeconomies was but a Prelude, a
Preface, a Preparative. All before were but rude
Draughts and imperfect Models. They were a Foil
only to set this off, they were but as the dusky Twi-light
to the brighter Day. All that went before was
but Infancy and Childhood: This is Manhood and
full Age. This one Consideration is sufficient to
convince us of the Greatness and Majesty of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ under the Gospel. Tho the <hi>Law</hi>
(which immediately preceded it, and was the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
of all the former Dispensations) had some Lus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
in it, yet in comparison of the <hi>Gospel</hi> it had none:
its Glory vanished as the Light of the Stars when the
Sun appeareth. They saw in a Glass darkly, they
had but short and dim Representations of things:
they had none of that Clearness and Certainty which
we under the Gospel have attained to. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
what was said before, that they had many
Ways and Rules to judg of True Prophets by, and to
know them from False ones, yet this must be added
that it was very difficult. Prophecy might be easily
counterfeited: Fancy and Imagination made strong
Impressions, and deceived many: they frequently
had delusive Dreams and Visions. In most of the
<hi>Differences</hi> between the True Prophetick Spirit and
the Enthusiastick Impostures of Pseudo-Prophets, as
they are set down by the <hi>Iewish</hi> Writers, I find lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
satisfaction, nor can any one who looks for Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:65397:291"/>
and Solid Accounts. But the Prophecies and
Revelations under the Evangelical Dispensation are
Satisfactory and Certain. We have now <hi>a more sure
Word of Prophecy.</hi> The excellent Discoveries made
to the World by the Sacred Oracles of the Gospel
are Plain, Evident, and Undeniable.</p>
                     <p>Let us then be sensible of the Goodness of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and of the Eligibility of it before that of
those who lived before this fulness of time came.
Whereas the Jewish and Gentile Religion were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
and corrupted, and Ignorance and gross Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
had invaded Mens minds, and the True Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God was enervated and destroy'd by Atheism
and Superstition, God was pleased to restore and
new model Religion, and to give Men a perfect and
exact Rule whereby they might reform their Lives,
and be conducted to Blessedness. And this is the
<hi>Christian Institution,</hi> which every way surpasses both
Judaism and Philosophy; it discovers the most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Worship of God, and dictates the most accurate
Precepts of Morality, and directs us to the only
Means of Salvation. This is the sole Prerogative of
<hi>Christianity,</hi> and we owe it to the immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>overies made by God himself. Most
Men that stile themselves <hi>Christians,</hi> know little or
nothing of the Excellency and Preheminence of the
<hi>Dispensation</hi> that bears that Name. But let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be of the Number of those who both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and admire the superlative Excellency of the
<hi>Christian Oeconomy</hi> which we are under.</p>
                     <p>2. Let us not only understand and admire it, but
let this most Blessed Dispensation stir up our most
thankful Resentments. Behold with grateful minds
how our Condition is unspeakably better than that of
the Persons who lived under other Dispensations, and
particularly than that of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were under
the Dispensation which was immediately before ours.
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:65397:291"/>
We have cause to thank the Merciful Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth that our Lot is cast into such Times,
that we were reserved for this <hi>Best of Dispensations,</hi>
that we are blessed with a most Excellent and Worthy
Religion, a Religion that is in it self Reasonable, and
every ways adapted to our rectified Faculties and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
Minds, a Religion that hath the most live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Principles to actuate and inform us, the comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Rules to guide and direct us, and affords us the
most effectual and powerful helps to Virtue and
Godliness: a Religion that holds forth the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
Punishments to deter us from Vice, and assures
us of the Highest Rewards to animate and as it were
to bribe us to Virtue: a Religion that comprehends
in it all the Excellent Things which the most impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Philosophers talk'd of, and innumerable more
not to be parallel'd by any Model of Religion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
a Religion that contains nothing in it but
what is of great Moment and Importance, and is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
serviceable to the best and most advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Purposes. Let us account it an unspeakable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Favour that we are the Disciples of so worthy
and excellent an Institution. Let us la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d the Divine
Goodness that we have these Infallible Oracles to
guide us, that we are taught of <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>Iesus
Christ</hi> is our Instructer. This is sufficient to raise our
Esteem and Value of this Dispensation. By this we
have the Advantage of all that went before us, and
this it self is the greatest Advantage. For now the
<hi>Word hath been made Flesh,</hi> and hath pitch'd his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
on Earth, and <hi>hath dwelt amongst us,</hi> and all
the Benefits and Privileges of his Coming are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to us. It seemed good to God to confer this
singular Honour upon <hi>Vs:</hi> We see Christ's Day, and
hear his Gospel; we have the Completion of all the
Mosaick Types and Representations, and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
and Promises are fulfill'd before our Eyes.
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:65397:292"/>
We cannot complain that our Religion is harsh and
difficult like that of the <hi>Iews,</hi> for all those trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Observances are removed, and no burdensome
Service, no intolerable Homage is required of us.
Our Service is perfect Freedom: wherefore we are
engaged to <hi>stand fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath
made us free.</hi> Now since the <hi>Woman the Church is
clothed with the Sun, she hath the Moon,</hi> the old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Laws and Ceremonies (which shined with a
faint and borrowed Light) <hi>under her feet.</hi> Let us
disregard those old dark Types and Shadows in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the clear Light of the Gospel, and let us
heartily bless God for so great and matchless a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
as the New Dispensation of Christ Jesus.</p>
                     <p>3. I infer as the Meliority of our Condition, so
our greater Obligation to Holiness and strictness of
Life. Old things are pass'd away, and behold all
things are become New under the Gospel-Dispensa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tion.
Let not our <hi>Lives</hi> be the only exception to it.
Let the Manners of <hi>Christians</hi> speak the Transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of the Gospel above Philosophy. Let us live
better than the wisest Heathens, in as much as our
Rules of Living excel theirs. Let it never be said
that the Behaviour of Pagans outstript that of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and that the Gentile Religion made better
Men than the Gospel doth. It is true,<note n="8" place="bottom">Semper adversus sua vitia facundi — Non eloquimur magna, sed vivimus. Minut. Fel.</note> the Pagan
Moralists spoke highly against Vice, and always
rhetoricated in their Declamations against it; but
the Business of <hi>Christians</hi> is to live those Great things
which they discours'd of. Let there be observed not
only a great Elogium of Virtue in our Words and
Professions, but let us take care that all Men may read
the Excellency of our Religion in our Lives, and
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:65397:292"/>
thereby discern plainly the vast difference that there
is between a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Philosopher.</hi> Let us urge
it on our Minds and Consciences, as our indispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Concern, to yield impartial Obedience to our
Master's Commands, and to govern our Lives by the
unerring Rules which he hath given us. Let us not
bear the Noble Title of <hi>Christians</hi> without the true
Badges of Christianity. Let us not prophane this
Name by acting contrary to it. Either let us lay
aside this glorious Character, or do things worthy
of it. We have a Holy Religion, therefore our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations
should be so too. Here our Saviour's
words are to be remembred; <hi>Vnless our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees,</hi>
of the most strict Pretenders to Judaism as well as
Philosophy, unless we live more Heavenly Lives, and
under a greater Sense of Religion, we must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<hi>to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> we shall never
attain to Happiness. For the <hi>Gospel-Oeconomy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
greater strictness than that of the <hi>Law,</hi> as well
as of any <hi>other Dispensation,</hi> because the Means of
Grace and the Methods of Salvation are much more
powerful now: and we ought to find and feel that
Power in us.</p>
                     <p>Let us then think, speak, and live as those who
have such clear and plain Discoveries of God's Will,
such Divine and Heavenly Truths made known to us,
with a prospect of such glorious Things hereafter as
may effectually encourage us to embrace those Truths,
and to frame our Actions according to them. How
shameful will it be that so admirable a Religion should
produce nothing but empty Shews and Formalities,
fair Words and goodly Appearances? that it should
make us <hi>Christians</hi> only in Title and Profession, and
leave us worse than <hi>Infidels</hi> in our Manners? Is our
Religion the best? why are not we so too? If it sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
all others, why do not our Lives ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>el those
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:65397:293"/>
of others? If we have so Holy a Doctrine, why do
we not reduce it to Practice? If our Religion be so
excellent, why do we not obey its Laws, and why
do we not discern the Advantages we have above all
others to do well and worthily? If in the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s
time<note n="9" place="bottom">Rom. 13. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>the night was far spent, and the day was at hand</hi>
(i. e. the times of Ignorance were gone, and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
was come) then surely now the night is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and it is broad Day, and we are obliged <hi>to walk
as Children of Light.</hi> I pray seriously consider of the
great Change of Affairs in Religion by the Coming of
our Saviour: remember that it is now unspeakably
Advanced and Exalted, in so much that that which
was reckon'd Religious and Pious in the Jewish Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
is not accounted the same in this great Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things. If you weigh this you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that you are obliged to a stricter Life and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
than what would have served under the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Law. At that time Men stumbled and stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd,
they made imperfect Discoveries of Truth
and of their Duty: they could not see distinctly, and
they were excusable because the Medium was defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
the Judaick Shadows and Mists hindred their
sight. But the Day-spring from on high hath visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us, all is clear and conspicuous, all Truths as
well as Duties are plain and intelligible, all the parts
of our Religion are fixed and determined: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
mistake unless we will, and if we are Vitious it
is not from Ignorance, but our wilfulness and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borness.</p>
                     <p>But we who have this redundant Light are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to walk worthy of it, and to conform our Lives
and Manners to it. Certainly this is our proper
Duty, and we must first extinguish our Reason before
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:65397:293"/>
we can disown this to be our Interest. It is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
undeniable that a greater accuracy of Life, a
more exact Course of Virtue is required of us than
of those who lived under the former Dispensations,
and were unacquainted with the Laws of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

If we excel Hereticks, Pagans and Jews

a Light so Great, so Powerful, that tho we shut our

in the ways of Sin, and mind not the Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries

John 15. 22.</p>
                     <p>That this is little thought of in the World we may
gather from the Behaviour of Men. How Strangely
do they forget themselves and their Duty, the End
both of their Creation and Redemption? They run
counter to all the Undertakings of Christ Jesus, they
confront all his Designs, and labour to undo all that
he came to do. They disparage the Wisdom of God
in finding out the way of our Salvation, they despise
his Goodness in offering them the Means of being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
They uphold and maintain that which Christ
came to destroy; for whereas the purpose of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Manifestation was to beat down Satan's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
they set it up as fast as they can. Which is a
plain contradicting of Heaven, and a bidding defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the Almighty. He that views the Lives and
Manners of Men at this day, and takes notice of their
open Prophaness and Debauchery, would be apt to
perswade himself that they really think that <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Coming into the World was for no other end than
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:65397:295"/>
to indulge them in their Follies and Vices, and to
give them a Licence to be as lewd as they pleas'd.
So fond and groundless are the Imaginations of a
great part of the World, that they fancy a Superse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
given to a strict and severe life by the merciful
Appearing of the <hi>Messias:</hi> they make bold to turn
the Grace of God into wantonness, and abound in
all manner of Vice, because the Divine Goodness and
Favour have abounded towards Mankind. It pleases
them hugely that they are enfranchis'd from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and Severity of the Legal Dispensation, and
that now under the Gospel a Court of Chancery is
erected, and nothing but Equity and Mercy, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
and Indulgence take place. The bare Name
of <hi>Christians</hi> is, they think, a sufficient Amulet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Vengeance of Heaven, and the Cross of
Christ is a powerful Charm against Hell and the
Devil.</p>
                     <p>O when shall these vile mistakes, these wilful mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations
of the Design of Christ's Coming and
Appearing in the World be rooted out of Mens
minds? When will they understand themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and be convinced of the heinousness of sinning
against the <hi>Gospel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Dispensation?</hi> Why do they not
ponder those words of the Apostle which I before
mention'd? <hi>If every Transgression and Disobedience</hi>
(under the Law) <hi>receiv'd a just recompence of Reward,
how shall we</hi> (under the Gospel) <hi>escape if we neglect so
great salvation?</hi> Heb. 2. 2, 3. If God did so severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
animadvert on those that disregarded the Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Injunctions, what severity will he shew towards
them that live in the constant violation of the
Evangelical <hi>Law?</hi> They must needs be inexcusable
that wilfully offend against this, because it is a more
excellent Institution than the other, because by this
we have a greater knowledg of God's Will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
greater Conviction of Sin, because we have
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:65397:295"/>
greater evidence of God's willingness to forgive our
Transgressions through the Merits of the Messias up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our hearty Repentance, because the equity and
reasonableness of Evangelical Faith and Obedience
are greater than those of any Duties under the Law.
Upon these and several other accounts the <hi>neglecting
this so great Salvation</hi> is the greatest Sin (except the
unpardonable one) that can be committed against
God, and consequently the heaviest Penalty attends
it. Heretofore it was said, <hi>Tribulation and Anguish
upon every Soul of Man that doth Evil, of the Iew first,</hi>
Rom. 2. 9. but we may now say <hi>of the Christian first:</hi>
for he of all Persons under Heaven is the most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Criminal, because there is this high Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Guilt, that he sins against the Evangelical
Laws. I wish the Christian World would attend to
this, and understand their true interest, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be very
exact and circumspect in their Lives, for God expects
we should live according to the <hi>Dispensation</hi> we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
according to the proportion of that Grace which
is bestowed upon us. We must remember that <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
engages us not only to root out all false Notions,
but to banish all vicious and ungodly Practices, and to
live according to the admirable Rules of the Gospel.
Our Knowledg and Judgments should influence upon
our Conversations, and our Manners ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to our Light. Otherwise it is certain
our Knowledg will increase our Guilt, and our abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Light will thrust us into utter darkness.</p>
                     <p>5. Be ascertain'd that this is <hi>Last Dispensation,</hi>
and expect no other. <hi>God spake at divers times, and
in sundry manners,</hi> he reveal'd himself by degrees, and
successively; whereas now he hath discover'd to us all
at once, that is, all that is substantial, all that is
essential to that Religion which he requires of us;
for otherwise (as you shall hear afterwards) this
Oeconomy admits of considerable <hi>Digrees.</hi> Since
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:65397:296"/>
God hath spoken his Will by his Son, since the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is left on Record, we must not look for any <hi>other</hi>
Discovery of Divine Truth. No more is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to the end of the World, I mean as to any
New Doctrine concerning the way of Salvation: tho
Revelations concerning some things which may be
for the safety and welfare of the Church, or of some
choice Persons in it, may perhaps be communicated by
God on great occasions. Besides, I deny not that
clearer Discoveries may be made of some Points af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards:
the same Truths which we now have may
be more illustrated; but no New Doctrines, no New
Precepts are to be thought of. We have so much of
saving Truth discover'd as was intended should be
sufficient for us till the Consummation of all things.
Now our Religion is fixed: the Faith hath been <hi>once
deliver'd to the Saints,</hi> and it shall never be deliver'd
again with Additions or Alterations. God added to
the Discoveries which he made to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and to the <hi>Iews:</hi> but now he
hath done adding. All our Duty is taught us: All
things that are to be believed or to be done by us are
revealed by Christ and his Apostles. You hear him
thus declaring to his Disciples, <hi>All things that I have
heard of my Father, I have made known unto you,</hi> John
15. 15. The Apostle St. <hi>Peter</hi> peremptorily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
that <hi>there is not Salvation in any other: for there
is no other Name under Heaven given among Men where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we must be saved,</hi> Acts 4. 12. And the other great
Apostle is as definitive when he thus pronounceth,
<hi>Tho an Angel from Heaven</hi> (if you can suppose such
a thing) <hi>preach any other Gospel unto you than that we
have preach'd unto you, let him be accursed,</hi> Gal. 1. 8.
The same Apostle tells us that the <hi>Church is built upon
the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,</hi> Eph. 2. 20.
and the <hi>Foundation</hi> of a Building is not a thing to be
removed. Therefore he calls the Gospel <hi>the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:65397:296"/>
which remaineth</hi> or endureth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11.
This is the <hi>Everlasting Gospel,</hi> Rev. 14. 6. because it
is never to be alter'd, never to be amended by a
more complete Body of Laws. So that the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Gospel</hi> answers to <hi>Everlasting Righteousness,</hi> or
<hi>the Righteousness of Ages,</hi> (Dan. 9. 24.) which shall
admit of no Change. Religion was perfected and
consummated by Christ: he hath in the <hi>Gospel</hi> given
us all that he ever intended to give. This is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest
Rule, this is the last System of Religion.</p>

becomes one <hi>Family</hi> or <hi>Houshold</hi> as it were: all the
Inhabitants of the World, who were scatter'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

Governour, one Supreme Catholick Ruler, as St.

before by false ways, are now united in Christ the
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:65397:297"/>
Way and the Truth. He brings all the Severals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
One, and makes up a full Church, Militant and
Triumphant, whereas before there was a dispersion.
Thus Heaven and Earth are happily joined. Again,
the Greek word sometimes signifies <hi>to restore</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,</hi>
and accordingly is rendred by the<note n="4" place="bottom">Instaurare.</note> 
                        <hi>Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin:</hi>
and then the meaning of the Apostle is, that all
things in Heaven and Earth are restored and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Christ and his Coming. There is a happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration
of Man's Nature by the Incarnation of the
Blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> the former State of Integrity is now
renewed, and Man is in a far better Condition than
he was at first. And as for <hi>Angels,</hi> their State also is
much amended, they are now confirmed in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
and Happiness. Thus, according to <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>'s
Interpretation of the place, the things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and on Earth are Restored, Renewed, Reformed
by the Evangelical Dispensation.</p>
                     <p>But there is a third, and that the most probable
Interpretation of the words, which is this, (and the
Margin in our <hi>English</hi> Translation takes notice of it)
that in the Dispensation of the fulness of Time, or
the Dispensation of the Gospel, God was pleased to
<hi>sum up</hi> all things in Christ. Which may refer to
<hi>Arithmetical</hi> Computation, or bringing all <hi>Numbers</hi>
into One; and so here is signified that all the former
Dispensations being cast up and briefly collected, are
reduced to this of the Gospel. This is the Sum to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<hi>Christ is all and in all,</hi> Col. 3. 11. Or it may refer
(as St. <hi>Ierom</hi> on the place thinks) to the way of
<hi>Orators</hi> and <hi>Pleaders,</hi> who in the close of their
Speeches and Declamations <hi>briefly repeat</hi> and <hi>recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>

                        <p>The several Ages of Christianity. It was in its
Infancy in our Saviour's time. The Apostles
knew little concerning his Sufferings and his
Resurrection. The effusion of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was but mean in respect of what it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
The Church was in its Childhood in
the times immediately after our Saviour. There
are no Errors and Mistakes in the Writings of
the New Testament. Some necessary Points of
Christianity deliver'd in the Apostolical Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
that are not in the Gospels and Acts.
Some relicks of Judaism remain'd in the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
times. An Explication of the Decree of
the Council at Jerusalem. It is particularly
proved that the Prohibition concerning the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Blood is not obligatory under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
Yet in the first times of the Church many
observed it. The difference of Dispensations
as to Abstinence from some sort of Food. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism
and Christianity were mingled together
in the primitive Ages. An enumeration of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Extraordinary Gifts that were in the
Christian Church at first. The Youth or riper
Years of Christianity described. The cessation
of extraordinary Gifts argues the Progress and
Growth of the Christian Church. Miracles no
part of this subordinate Dispensation. The
non-Appearance of Angels is a Proof of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Christianity. The usefulness and
necessity of attending to the different Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of Religion, especially the Christian.</p>

                        <pb n="586" facs="tcp:65397:300"/>THe fourth and last thing I undertook, was to shew
you <hi>the several Degrees of this Evangelical Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</hi>
This Gospel Period, which began at Christ's
Coming, and continues to the end of the World, hath
four distinct Partitions, which differ much from one
another, 1. The primitive Partition or Period,
which is past. 2. The Period ensuing that which is
now present. And there are two Periods yet to
come. I might divide them according to the several
<hi>Ages</hi> of Man, for there are, as of <hi>Man,</hi> so of the
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> four distinct Ages. It had its <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Childhood</hi> at Christ's first Coming, and some
years after: its <hi>Youth</hi> since that, to the present times.
It shall have its <hi>Manhood</hi> or <hi>full Strength,</hi> which is to
come in a short time, we hope: and there shall be the
<hi>Old Age</hi> or <hi>Declension</hi> of Religion a little before the
World's end. I have not met with any Writers that
have duly observ'd this <hi>Distinction</hi> in the Gospel Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy:
the neglect of which hath caused several <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>alse
Notions about this <hi>Last Administration of Religion.</hi>
But the Inquisitive and thoughtful Reader will find
that these things which I have suggested, and shall
now proceed to explain, are absolutely necessary for
the framing of a right Idea of the Evangelical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="587" facs="tcp:65397:300"/>1. I begin with the first and tender Years of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
in which are comprehended, 1. The Time
when our Saviour was on Earth: 2. The Times
which immediately succeeded that.</p>
                     <p>First, it is evident that in the days of our <hi>Saviour</hi>
the Christian Church was in her <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and that she was not grown up to a sufficient
Knowledg and Understanding. When Christ first
preached concerning the Calling and Converting of
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (Luke 13. 29. Mat. 22. 9, 10.) his Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
and Disciples understood not his meaning. They
knew not that both <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Iews</hi> should be
preach'd to under the Evangelical Dispensation:
and therefore afterwards St. <hi>Peter</hi> was convinced of
it by no less than a particular Revelation, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.
14. Even the <hi>Apostles</hi> were ignorant of the spiritual
Kingdom of the <hi>Messias</hi> and look'd for an outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
glorious and magnificent one. When Christ told
his Disciples, as he was on his journey with them to
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> what grievous things he was to suffer,
they, notwithstanding this Admonishment, thought
he was going thither to be made King; and the Sons
of <hi>Zebedee</hi> made their Suit to him by their Mother
that they might have the first Place in the Kingdom,
which the other Apostles took ill; <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 20.
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 11. St. <hi>Peter</hi> the prime Apostle, was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Method of Man's Redemption by the
Sufferings and Death of Christ; which appears
from this, that he would fain have prevail'd with
him to <hi>spare himself,</hi> and not to suffer at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
Mat. 16. 22. And the rest of the Apostles were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the same common error and mistake.
They perswaded themselves that they should enjoy
Halcyon Days, and that their Master should be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Great Earthly Prince. You read therefore in <hi>Luke</hi>
18. 31. that when Christ spoke to them of his <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
they were at a loss, <hi>they understood none of these
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:65397:301"/>
things; and this Saying was hid from them, neither knew
they the things which were spoken,</hi> ver. 34. In so great
Darkness and Ignorance were the Disciples for a
time, such Prejudices had they on their minds that
they could not conceive the meaning of our Lord, and
they durst not ask him concerning those things. It
was not as yet reveal'd to them by what means the
<hi>Messias</hi> was to deliver them: they dreamt of an
Earthly Kingdom (as the blinded <hi>Iews</hi> at this day)
they promis'd themselves much temporal Prosperity
and Grandeur in the World.</p>
                     <p>Neither could the Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Resurrection</hi>
gain assent with them; for we read that when he spake
of it to the three Apostles before whom he was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured,
<hi>they questioned one with another what the rising
from the dead should mean,</hi> Mark 9. 10. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when he told the other Apostles as well as
these, that <hi>he should rise again the third day, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not that saying,</hi> Mark 9. 31, 32. That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Friends believ'd not his Resurrection, appears
from their dressing his dead Body with Aromatick
Gums and Spices, which were design'd to preserve it.
It had been vain to use these glutinous Gums and
Persumes if they thought he was in a short time to rise
again. And when he was risen, they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, as appears too plainly from that Speech of
<hi>Cleophas,</hi> one of those whom Jesus talk'd with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after his Resurrection, tho then he pass'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito,
<hi>We trusted</hi> (saith he) <hi>that it had been He who
should have redeemed Israel,</hi> Luke 24. 21. Still he
doubted, tho he had heard of the Lord's Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
in saying, <hi>we trusted,</hi> he discover'd his distrust,
and impli'd that <hi>Iesus</hi> could not be the <hi>Messias</hi> who
was to redeem <hi>Israel.</hi> Tho the Apostles were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
of Christ's Resurrection by those that saw him,
yet <hi>their words seemed to them as idle Tales,</hi> (Luke 24.
11.) and they would not be perswaded till they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:65397:301"/>
saw Christ among them. Nor did they know
that he was to <hi>ascend;</hi> for just before he left them they
put this question to him, <hi>Wilt thou at this time restore
the Kingdom to Israel?</hi> Acts 1. 6. Wilt thou repair
the <hi>Iewish</hi> State, and recover its pristine Splendour,
yea raise it to a higher Dignity than ever it arrived
to, as we expect should be done by the <hi>Messias?</hi> So
likewise it might be proved that some of them were
in an Error about the <hi>End of the World,</hi> for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
it would be about that time. By these and
other Instances, their Ignorance and Mistake were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
discovered: they had very false apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and conceptions of things, and some of the chief
Articles of the Christian Belief were not credited by
them.</p>
                     <p>Here I might add, that in our Blessed Saviour's time
there was not such an effusion of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> as
there was afterwards: <hi>Iohn 7. 35. The Holy Ghost
was not yet given, because that Iesus was not yet glorified.</hi>
For this Reason several things were not disclosed to
them, but were reserved till a further communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Spirit: for tho Christ had said, <hi>All things
which I have heard of my Father, I have made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you;</hi> yet he adds, <hi>I have yet many things to say unto
you, but you cannot hear them now. Howbeit, when the
Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth,</hi>
John 16. 12, 13. As much as if he had said, there
is no new Truth or other Doctrine to be preach'd to
you than what you have receiv'd from me already;
but the time is coming when there shall be a greater
Manifestation of those things to you: tho the Truths
as to the main shall be the same, yet your Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Capacities shall be greater; you shall then
comprehend those matters which before you could
not, <hi>as the calling of the Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Messias,</hi> &amp;c. And moreover, the <hi>Holy
Spirit</hi> shall increase your Love and Zeal to God and all
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:65397:302"/>
Truth, so that you shall be enabled not only to
preach it to all Nations, but undauntedly to suffer

                        </gap>cution, and even to lay down your Lives in the
defence of it. By this it is evident that Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was revealed <hi>by degrees,</hi> as well as the other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Dispensations of Religion. Their knowledg in
the Christian Institution was <hi>gradual:</hi> they were not
to know all together: neither were their Zeal and
Courage of the same proportion that they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in the Times and Ages immediately
succeeding our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s being upon Earth, the Church
was but yet in its <hi>Childhood</hi> and State of <hi>Infirmity,</hi>
It is true, they were much increased and advanced
in their knowledg of spiritual Truths, this being
the Accomplishment of our Saviour's Promise as well
as Prediction, that the <hi>Holy Spirit should guide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

plain from their using them on<note n="3" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6. 2, 3. &amp; 15. 51, 52.</note> other occasions. We
have no Reason then to think that the Apostles were
deceiv'd about the Day of Judgment, or any other
matter that they writ of and deliver'd to the World.
Here is no weakness, no defect as to any thing of
this nature.</p>
                     <p>Nay, there was a great Advance and Accession in
respect of what there was before, in the foregoing
part of this Dispensation, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time that our
Saviour lived upon the Earth. For the Doctrines of
the Gospel (of which I speak now) were gradually
deliver'd, and consequently the <hi>Apostles</hi> attain'd now
to more than was discover'd in <hi>Christ</hi>'s time, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not thought fit then to communicate all in so
evident and plain a manner as we find it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
done. Therefore that late<note n="4" place="bottom">The Reasonableness of Christianity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> Writer is under
a great mistake who declares that the <hi>Apostles Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi>
are only occasional, and that we can find no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Points of Divinity deliver'd there which were
not deliver'd before in the <hi>Gospels</hi> and <hi>Acts;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Truth is, the <hi>Epistles</hi> contain the most perfect
and complete Doctrines of the Gospel, for by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
the Evangelical Truth display'd it self. All
the necessary and fundamental Articles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
are explain'd here, the grand Points of the
Christian Belief are here set forth in a clearer Light
than before: they are proved and confirm'd in these
Writings. Yea, several great Truths and weighty
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:65397:303"/>
Doctrines of the Christian Faith are mention'd and
illustrated here, which neither the <hi>Gospels</hi> nor the <hi>Acts</hi>
speak of. Especially St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles</hi> (which are
thrice as many as any of the other Apostles writ) are
fraught with extraordinary Discoveries of Divine and
Heavenly Mysteries. And we could not expect less,
for this Apostle was the only Person of them all that
had the Privilege to be taken up into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Seat of Glory, where he was in a more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial
manner enlightned, and had those sublime
Points of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> &amp;c. (as his Writings abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
testifie) reveal'd and open'd to him (so far as the
matters were capable of it) which the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and
<hi>other Apostles</hi> knew but little of: which makes his
Writings more eligible and valuable than all the rest.
This is so plain and obvious, that it is wonderful that
any Man who hath read and perused his <hi>Epistles</hi> can
contradict it, and (which is worse) undervalue <hi>them</hi>
as if they were writ only <hi>by the by,</hi> and were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
indited to instruct us in the most necessary
Articles of our Religion. We cannot believe this
when we consider the extraordinary Revelations
which this Apostle was honoured with, and when we
observe the <hi>gradual Discovery</hi> of the Truths of the
Gospel.</p>
                     <p>But still the Gospel was in its <hi>Childhood</hi> and <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
State,</hi> which is the thing I have now undertaken
to make good. This Dispensation of Christianity,
under which the <hi>Apostles</hi> were, was not arrived to a
very considerable Pitch. There were some Relicks
of the <hi>Iewish Oeconomy</hi> still remaining: they had not
quite laid aside the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> and <hi>Mosaick</hi> Rites.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or writ to
them, as to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> declared against all Mosaick
Observances whatsoever: but the other Apostles
when they were among the <hi>Iews,</hi> did no such thing:
yea St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, to comport with the <hi>Iews</hi> or
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:65397:303"/>
                        <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as he saw occcasion, used or used not the
Jewish Ceremonies. Thus he circumcised <hi>Timothy,</hi> but
not <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>itus.</hi> And so without doubt the other Apostles
behav'd themselves according to the people they
dealt with. They kept the first Day of the Week,
the true <hi>Christian</hi> Sabbath, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 7. &amp; 20. 7. &amp; 25.
66. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. and they observed likewise the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
one, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 14, 42. &amp; 16. 13. for they found
it convenient to comply with some because of their
weakness; therefore for the sake of the converted
<hi>Iews</hi> they observ'd the seventh day Sabbath, tho with
the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> they celebrated the first Day
of the Week.</p>
                     <p>We find that two or three <hi>Iewish Ceremonies</hi> were
kept up by the Apostles when all the rest were abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
<hi>Acts 15. 28, 29. It seemeth good to the Holy
Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these
necessary things; that ye abstain from meats offered to
Idols, and from Blood, and from Things strangled, and
from Fornication.</hi> Here St. <hi>Iames</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> Apostles, and others
of the Church determine what the <hi>Gentile Christians</hi>
shall do in <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia</hi> as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Rites and Ceremonies. They are not
to be <hi>Circumcised</hi> but it is required of them (as of all
<hi>Proselytes of the Gate</hi>) that they observe the Precepts of
<hi>abstaining from things offered to Idols,</hi> &amp;c. This is the
<hi>Decretal Epistle,</hi> or you may call these the <hi>Canons</hi> of
the <hi>Apostolick Council.</hi> And these things are enjoin'd
for no other end but to comply with the <hi>believing
Iews,</hi> that in some Observances those <hi>Gentile Converts</hi>
might agree with them. Besides, as<note n="5" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi> de Legib. Hebr. l. 2. c. 3.</note> One observes,
these things named in the Decree, and forbidden by
it, were such as the <hi>Pagan Idolaters</hi> chiefly observ'd and
practised. They are four grand Marks of <hi>Gentilism,</hi>
                        <pb n="594" facs="tcp:65397:304"/>
and therefore those <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were converted to
Christianity ought to renounce all those things as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous.
Especially as to <hi>Fornication,</hi> they were bid
to abstain from this, not as if it were of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and as indifferent in it self as the other things
mentioned, but they are joined together, because the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> thought <hi>Fornication</hi> or <hi>Whoredom</hi> an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
thing, and they usually allow'd themselves in it.</p>
                     <p>A<note n="6" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> Hor. Heb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> Learned Man of our Nation is of Opinion that
by <hi>Fornication</hi> is meant <hi>Poligamy,</hi> a sort of Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as he calls it) among the <hi>Iews</hi> which seem'd to
them lawful: and <hi>marrying within the prohibited degrees</hi>
is, he thinks, here forbidden likewise. But if we
remember that what the Synod decrees here is for
the sake of the Converted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not the <hi>Iews,</hi> we
shall rather believe that <hi>Fornication properly so call'd</hi> is
here forbid, especially if we consider that the <hi>Pagans</hi>
had no positive Laws among them against this, tho
they had against Adultery. Wherefore this Practice
which was look'd upon as an indifferent thing among
them, is here directly caution'd against, and hence
you see the Reason why this is ranked with the rest.
And the abstaining from these things is mention'd as
<hi>necessary;</hi> not as if they were all unlawful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their own nature (for <hi>Fornication only</hi> was
so) but the rest were for that time and juncture <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</hi>
(Otherwise they are call'd <hi>a burden,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not morally good, and consequently not <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
in themselves.) Yet they were, I say, <hi>Necessary,</hi>
tho not to all Christians, yet to all Proselytes of the
Gate, and for that time only, because it was requisite
to symbolize with the <hi>Iudaizing</hi> Christians who ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
some Ceremonial Observances: and this was the
way to unite both converted <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who
then were mixed together. But when Christianity
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:65397:304"/>
prevailed, and there was no fear of giving offence to
the weak, the Obligation of this Decree ceas'd, and
these things were not observ'd in the Church.</p>
                     <p>But one of these, viz. <hi>abstaining from Blood,</hi> hath not
so soon and so easily been laid aside as the others. The
Reason of which I conceive was this, this was an early
Prohibition, this was a Law given to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9. 4.
<hi>Flesh with the life thereof, which is the Blood thereof, ye shall
not eat:</hi> and thus having the start of the <hi>Ceremonial
Law of Moses,</hi> they might think it forbad something
which was morally Evil, and that as it obliged before
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, so it ought to do afterwards, and that
therefore there lay an obligation on <hi>Christians</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it. But several things I will here suggest: 1. It
should be consider'd there were <hi>Ceremonial Laws</hi> and
Rites prescribed before <hi>Moses,</hi> that are universally
acknowledged to have no obligation under <hi>Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and therefore this may cease as well as they. 2. It
should be remembered that when this Law was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to <hi>Moses,</hi> the Reason annex'd to it was this, <hi>The
life of the flesh is in the Blood, and I have given it to you
upon the Altar, to make an Atonement for your Souls; for
it is the Blood that maketh Atonement for the Soul,</hi> Lev. 17.
11. Now, this Reason ceases under the Gospel,
since all the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sacrifices and Effusions of Blood
on the Altar are abolished. The Blood of Animals
was made typical and representative of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Blood;
but he being come, and having shed his Blood what
have we to do with the Blood of any Animals, what
reason have we to have regard to it? 3. In the Law
which forbids eating of Blood, you may observe that
Blood it self is not absolutely forbid, but <hi>living Blood,</hi>
i. e. the Blood of the Beast before it be quite dead:
therefore eating of the Blood of a Beast when he is
deprived of Life, is not unlawful according to that
Law. When the Blood is boiled, or roasted, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways so alter'd that the Life is gone from it, it may
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:65397:305"/>
be eaten notwithstanding that Law. 4. Let the Law
be understood of what Blood you please, our Great
and Infallible Law giver hath decided the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
by taking away all distinction of Meats. <hi>There is
nothing from without a Man that entring into him can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
him,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 15. Here the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
Rite of abstaining from the eating of Blood
is abolish'd by Christ; for if <hi>no food</hi> that enters into a
Man defiles him, then <hi>Blood cannot,</hi> and Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
'tis lawful to eat it. But for certain Reasons the
Apostles at the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> order'd this old
Rite to be continued for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> till the greatest
part of the <hi>Iews</hi> were converted; and then it was to
be laid down. And that it ought to be so, is not only
the Determination of Christ but of his Apostles, <hi>I
know and am perswaded by the Lord Iesus, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unclean of it self,</hi> Rom. 14. 14. And the same
Apostle declares it lawful to feed even on thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to Idols, if no weak Brother be offened by it,
1 <hi>Cor. 10. 25. Whatsoever is sold in the Shambles, that
eat, asking no question for Conscience sake:</hi> and ver. 17.
<hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink,</hi> i. e. it doth
not consist in using this or that particular sort of Food,
for under the Gospel all are alike. Therefore he saith
in <hi>Col. 2. 16. Let no Man judg you in meat or in drink.</hi>
And again, <hi>Every Creature of God is good, and nothing
to be refused, if it be receiv'd with Thanksgiving,</hi> 1 Tim.
4. 4. Thus tho it was not absolutely necessary that
we should hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> a particular revoking of the Law, for
it is enough that the Reason of it ceaseth; yet we find
that it is more than once revoked and repeal'd in a
very formal and express manner, and that <hi>after the
Decree</hi> of the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> So that now there
is no intrinsick Evil and Turpitude, no Unlawfulness
and Sin in eating of Blood.</p>
                     <p>But this was not practised in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, nor
universally obtained a long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> after, but they very
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:65397:305"/>
carefully refrained from eating of Blood for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> out of compliance and
condescension to the <hi>Iews</hi> who were turn'd Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
And for this Reason the Christians in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and Third Century generally observed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of this Apostolical Synod, and they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by several<note n="7" place="bottom">Con. Gangr. Can. 2. Syn. Trull. can. 67. &amp;c.</note> Councils. Particularly, that the
Christians of those days abstain'd from Blood and
things strangled, is attested by<note n="8" place="bottom">Dialog. cum Tryph.</note>

Tho it appears likewise that this was not a <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi>
Observance, but some did eat Blood whilst others
abstained. The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Churches to this
day abstain from things strangled, and from Blood,
by virtue of the Decree of that first Council in <hi>Acts</hi>
15. And among the modern Writers<note n="4" place="bottom">Christianus Becman in Exercitat. 26. Curcellaeus in Diatrib. de esu Sang.</note> some of no
mean Learning have espoused this Opinion and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and the Learned<note n="5" place="bottom">In Acts 15. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> seems to favour them.
These Persons were drawn into this Sentiment by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an eye to the Practice of the old primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and by not considering the true Reason why
that <hi>Canon</hi> of abstaining from Blood prevail'd in some
parts of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Christian
Church was not wholly gather'd in those Parts, and
several <hi>Iews</hi> (who abhorr'd Blood and things strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
might have been kept from imbracing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
if there had not been a compliance in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This was the occasion of this Canon of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
saith<note n="6" place="bottom">Cont. Faust. l. 32. c. 13.</note> St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and this he saith was the
Judgment of the Christians in his days. He adds,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:65397:306"/>
that there were but a few in his time that abstain'd
from eating Blood, and they were laugh'd at by the
rest as too nice and scrupulous. Nor did those Men
attend to the foregoing Reasons and Proofs of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
of this Decree: which if they had done, they
would have found it to be a temporary Injunction,
and that it was obligatory so long as any <hi>Gentiles</hi>
were mixed among the Churches, but that afterwards
it was to be quite cast off: for the observing of this
and other parts of the Decree were kept up only by
reason of the Churches Weakness.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Subject, let us sum up the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Dispensations, as to this particular of <hi>abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from some Food.</hi> At first there was a Restraint as
to this, nothing but the Fruits of the Earth were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be eaten, at least generally and usually.
But after the Flood their Commons were enlarged,
for Flesh was allowed; yet with this Restriction, not
to eat Flesh with the Blood or Life in it. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> a Law restrain'd them
from some sort of Food; some Animals only were
permitted, the rest being pronounced unclean. But
when Christ came, this Restraint was removed, yet
so as the Liberty did not totally prevail, for by an
<hi>Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>olical Council</hi> they were bid to abstain from
Things strangled and from Blood. And afterwards,
in some Christian Churches this Abstinence was yet
observed. But at last, the Christian and Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Liberty took all Restraint away, the <hi>Iewish</hi> Rites
and Usages having had time enough to wear off.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>other Instances</hi> in the Christian Church in those
first Times it might be proved that whilst they were
not all grown up to the like knowledg and perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,
both <hi>Iudaism</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> were often twisted
together. Even in the second Century the Christians
in the <hi>East,</hi> following the Example of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> and
St. <hi>Philip,</hi> observed <hi>Easter</hi> on the very time the <hi>Iews</hi>
                        <pb n="599" facs="tcp:65397:306"/>
did their <hi>Passover:</hi> but those in the <hi>West</hi> imitating
the Practice of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> kept <hi>Easter</hi> on
the Lord's Day, the Day on which Christ arose.
<hi>Victor,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> endeavoured to bring the
Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> to his Opinion, designing to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all those who disagreed with the <hi>Roman</hi>
Churches; but he was disswaded at last from prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that Design, and the celebrating of <hi>Easter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
free till the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> where the Western
Churches got the better, and they that refused to
keep that Feast on Sunday were branded with the
Name of <hi>Quartodecimani.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I might further prove this mixture of <hi>Iewish</hi> and
<hi>Christian</hi> Observances in the first Ages: <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
who flourish'd in the beginning of the third Century,
frequently joins <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Iudaism</hi> together;
and particularly in his <hi>Dialogue with Trypho</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi> he
declares there is Salvation in both. There were the
<hi>Coelicolae,</hi> (mention'd in the Code) those that <hi>worship'd</hi>
God as<note n="7" place="bottom">Ut coelitus pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ceperat.</note> he had commanded from <hi>Heaven,</hi> i. e. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Precepts and Rites of the <hi>Mosaick Law,</hi>
and according to the Precepts of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> for they
held that <hi>Heaven,</hi> i. e. God was the Author and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutor
of both, and intended that both should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
Thus the Mosaick Law and Ceremonies
were a good while going off, they gradually and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly
vanish'd away: for the Church was then but in its
Childhood, and was tenderly to be treated. It is
not to be denied that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Rites were nail'd with
Christ to the Cross, they died when he gave up the
Ghost. But tho they were dead, and were of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy,
yet Men were left free to use or not use them,
as they saw fit. After their decease they were not
presently buried, but (as one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> speaks)
were to have an honourable Interment. In brief, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism</hi>
                        <pb n="600" facs="tcp:65397:307"/>
staid some time with <hi>Christianity,</hi> and then took
its leave.</p>
                     <p>Here it must be observed in the next place that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gifts of the Spirit</hi> were peculiar to this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of the Christian Church, which is a certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the <hi>weak State</hi> of it, and that it had not
outgrown its <hi>Childhood,</hi> but that Knowledg and Faith
were feeble in many, and that Unbelief had wholly
possessed others, and there was need of some very
great Power, which was in those days exerted in a
wonderful manner. Among the extraordinary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of the Holy Ghost which were then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
<hi>Prayer</hi> was one, <hi>i. e.</hi> an infused and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Gift of Prayer was given to the Apostles and
primitive Christians, which is call'd <hi>Praying with the
Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 15. and those who were blessed
with this singular Gratuity, had Matter and Words
dictated to them by a special Afflation or Inspiration
from Heaven. <hi>Prophesying</hi> was also after an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and supernatural manner, as the fourteenth
Chapter of the <hi>first Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us. It was a Power to interpret and explain the
darkest Scriptures, to unriddle all sacred Mysteries,
to urge with great efficacy the Duties of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on the Consciences of Men, and sometimes to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
Futurities of great Importance: all which was
effected by the immediate Influence of the Spirit.
This Gift expired soon after the second Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
After which they tell us there is little or no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Prophetick Spirit</hi> in the Christian Church.
To which perhaps that passage of the Apostle relates,
and is Prophetick even of the expiration of Prophecy,
<hi>1 Cor. 13. 8. whether there be Prophecies, they shall fail.</hi>
And as there were in the first Times <hi>inspired Prayers</hi>
and <hi>Prophesyings,</hi> so there were inspired <hi>Hymns;</hi> which
is call'd <hi>singing with the Spirit,</hi> ver. 15.</p>
                     <p>But the working of strange and wonderful things

above the Power of Nature, which is most <hi>properly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Miracles,</hi> was a great part of the Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those Days. Not only the Apostles, but their
Followers in the Ages immediately succeeding, were
indued with this Power. Hence <hi>Lucius,</hi> King of this
British Island, hearing of strange things done by
Christians in many places, about the end of the second
Century sent to <hi>Eleu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Writings, it is evident that
<hi>Miracles</hi> were frequently wrought in the Church, and
these Persons appeal to them as things that were of

he must be understood of the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> use

<hi>Augustin</hi> (who lived in St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s time) bears

<hi>Father</hi>'s own words in<note n="1" place="bottom">De ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="602" facs="tcp:65397:308"/>
that Miracles were then at an end in <hi>some</hi> parts of the
Christian Church. The short is this, that for three
or four hundred Years, in one place or other, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were generally done in confirmation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> as long as the Church was in her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and childish Years.</p>
                     <p>And it may be observ'd further, that there was a
Power in the <hi>primitive</hi> Times bestow'd on the Church
of punishing the Disobedient in a strange and dreadful
manner, <hi>viz.</hi> by in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> Diseases, nay Death
it self sometimes upon Offenders, as is evident in the
Relation concerning <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> Acts 5. 1,
&amp;c. And some such thing as this it is likely is meant
by those <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> done by the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>les, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 43.
And indeed it was necessary that in those primitive
Times they should have such a power of inflicting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Judgments on Criminals, if you consider
the state of things then; for the Magistrates, being at
that time <hi>Heathens,</hi> did not animadvert on those who
offended against the Christian Laws, on which account
likewise the Condition of the Church was weak and
low. And it may be further observ'd that in order to
this Gift or Ability of striking with bodily Maladies
or Death those that were gross Offenders, there was
another Gift bestowed, <hi>viz. Discerning of Spirits, 1</hi>
Cor. 12. 10. by virtue of which the Apostles had an
insight into the Secrets of Mens minds, and could tell
whether their hearts were right towards God. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it was that they could make a discrimination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
true and counterfeit Professors of Christianity,
and thence accordingly receiv'd or rejected them, and
if they saw occasion, punish'd the latter. This was
a requisite Gift in those days, because it was suted to
the nature of that Dispensation at that time, wherein
Christianity was not grown to any perfection, and
therefore there was need of these extraordinary
Means to nourish and uphold it; it wanted these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:65397:308"/>
Aids to support its weakness.</p>
                     <p>2. The Christian Church proceeded from <hi>Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
to <hi>Youth.</hi> This is the <hi>Second subordinate Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Gospel,</hi> or the present Period we are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
This began when all the Legal Ceremonies and
Jewish Observances were laid aside, when the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Gifts of the Holy Ghost ceased, when imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Inspirations were withdrawn, and when Signs
and Wonders, and working of Miracles were out of
use. From the time of the cessation of these we are (as
I conceive) to date the <hi>Youthful</hi> and <hi>Stronger State</hi> of
Christianity. Then it began to be entire, when it was
no longer blended with Judaism, when there were no
more Typical Ceremonies in the Christian Service.
In the place of the Extraordinary Gifts of Praying and
Prophesying there succeed now in the Church those
Religious Exercises of Praying and Preaching which
(tho they are never rightly performed without the
help of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet) proceed not from immediate
Illapses and Inspirations. The Apostles and first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were extraordinarily taught of God: but we
must make use of the Means and Helps which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us in order to attaining the Knowledg of Him
and of our Duty. We must arrive to this by God's
Blessing on our Studies and Industry. Knowledg is
not purely infused now, but the Spirit of God coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
with our endeavours. Scholarship was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the first founding the Gospel, because the
effusion of the Spirit was then extraordinary. But
when this ceas'd, human Learning became necessary
in those who are to instruct others, and to confute
Gainsayers.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the Disputes between us and the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
and other Sects about these Matters, we must urge
this, that there is now an <hi>Oeconomy</hi> different from
that in the times of the Apostles. When they talk of
doing all by immediate Impulse of the Spirit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:65397:309"/>
outward Means and Helps, and cry that they
are above Ordinances, we must let them know that
they are forgetful of the <hi>different Dispensations of times,</hi>
and thence proceeds their Error. They do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that there are <hi>subordinate Oeconomies</hi> even in this
one grand Oeconomy of Christianity; and the want
of seriously attending to this, leads them into very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Opinions and Practices. When there were
extraordinary Gifts in the Church, a Fisherman, any
illiterate Person was as able as any one to preach. For
as in that time those were able to heal all Diseases who
had never studied Physick, so there were those that
could speak to the People with all Tongues who had
never been taught any. For the speedier propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Gospel, some of the commonest Christians
had Ability to do this. But it is not so since: those
supernatural Gifts are ceas'd, and now Learning is
requisite in a Minister of the Gospel: Schools and
Universities, Skill in Arts and Languages (which can
be gain'd only by Study) are become necessary. For,
as an antient Writer of the Church saith well,<note n="2" place="bottom">Coepit alio ordine &amp; providentiâ gubernari Ecclesia. Ambros.</note> After
the Apostles time the Church began to be govern'd by
another Order and Management of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
As for the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> we know it was
an immediate extraordinary Gift, whereby Persons
were divinely enlightned themselves, and had ability
to reveal things in an extraordinary manner to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
which was frequent among the <hi>Iews</hi> in the
Old Testament; but even that fail'd at last, there was
not a <hi>Prophet</hi> between <hi>Malachi</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi>
(whence it was that the People ran out of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
round about to see the <hi>Baptist,</hi> a <hi>Prophet</hi> being a
very rare Sight.) But <hi>Prophecy</hi> was restored by Christ,
and by his Apostles in a most eminent Degree after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
yea <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> who lived in the middle of
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:65397:309"/>
the second Century, tells us in his <hi>Apology</hi> for the
Christians that the Gift of <hi>Prophecy</hi> was then in the
Church: but after that there is no mention of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it ceas'd. And so as for other immediate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Revelations, as <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visions,</hi> and
such like ways by which God used to communicate
his Will unto <hi>Iews</hi> and Christians heretofore, they are
now laid aside, or are very rare and unusual. And the
Reason is, because Christianity is out of its <hi>Childhood,</hi>
it hath gather'd more Strength, it is <hi>youthful</hi> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous.</p>
                     <p>I know that others have different Notions of this
matter. The Learned<note n="3" place="bottom">De usu Patr. l. 1. c. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Daille</hi> expresly saith, <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
was in its heighth and perfection in the time of the
blessed Apostles;</hi> tho, so far as I can perceive, he himself
soon after partly retracts this Assertion. It is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thought and said that those extraordinary Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
before named in the Christian Church, are an
Argument of its Manhood and Perfection: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those Gifts in the primitive Times were so great
and venerable, far exceeding what we have at this
day, they reckon all Christians since those times to be
but puny Christians. But I cannot give my suffrage
to this, yea I look upon it as a great mistake; for if a
Man rightly considers things, he will find that these
splendid Gifts were bestow'd on purpose for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
of the Gospel at that particular time, and
that the Weakness and Unsettledness of the Church
were the only occasion of them. Christianity wanted
(at its first Rise) confirming and corroborating by
such wonderful Methods and Expedients as these.
And therefore if we understand the true Nature of
them, we cannot but confess that they were Proofs
and Evidences of the <hi>imperfect State</hi> of the Christian
Church in those days. Now those extraordinary Gifts
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

are vanish'd, the inspired Men are gone, but the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures which were written by Divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are left with us, to be the great Standard of
Truth, and the Rule of our Actions. God hath rais'd
up eminent Men to open and explain that Holy Book,
and to instruct us in all the great and necessary Points
of it. We have now a more setled Knowledg of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and there is a greater Progress in Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Oeconomy hath receiv'd some Alteration;
and we need not extraordinary Helps when God
vouchsafeth us those that are ordinary.</p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>Miracles,</hi> they are not of <hi>this part</hi> of the
<hi>Christian Dispensation,</hi> and therefore are not to be
look'd for now. Those mighty Wonders <hi>are for a
sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe
not,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 22. Therefore
they were proper in the first Ages, to convince the
unbelieving World, and for the propagating of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
But now they are become useless, and more
regular and ordinary Methods are used. The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
being sufficiently promulged among us, and the
Authority of it being proved by those mighty Works
which have been done, we are not to expect any more
of them. Ordinary Means now serve us, tho we have
the Benefit likewise of those extraordinary ones which
were before. I do not say <hi>Miracles</hi> are so creased that
there shall never be any wrought again: for a Power
of doing Miracles is indefinitely promised in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.
17. It may still remain, so as to be exerted on occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> when Heathens and Infidels are to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But that belongs not to <hi>this Part</hi> of the <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Dispensation</hi> which I am now speaking of, but to
that more perfect one which is to succeed, in erecting
of which perhaps God may enable his Servants, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the compleat enlarging of the Church, to work
Wonders. But at present this way of Divine Attes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is unnecessary, for Christians have sufficient
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:65397:311"/>
Means, with regard to all the ends of Religion and
Salvation, among themselves: there is no need of any
greater at present. Nay, the cessation of those extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
visible and sensible Means, is an Argument of
the meliority of our Condition. <hi>Blessed are they that
have not seen, and yet have believed,</hi> saith our Saviour,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 29. The meaning is they are <hi>more blessed,</hi>
i. e. their Faith is more excellent and laudable, and
they shall have a greater Reward. It is a more blessed
and eligible State to believe without such forcible
and violent Means than with them.</p>
                     <p>Other things might be here mention'd; as under
the Law and before that time there was scarce any
thing done without the ministration of <hi>Angels,</hi> so in
the first times of the Gospel the Appearance of these
glorious Spirits was common: but after Christ's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension,
and to this very time the Church is a Stranger
to this particular Dispensation, and is not to expect
the Attestation or Confirmation of any Truth in this
Way. The Reason is, because the Scriptures of the
New Testament being now given us, that former way
of Revelation, which was a Sign of an imperfect and
weak State, now ceases. There is no need of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Admonitors, seeing we have the Writings of the
Evangelists and Apostles which are a certain standing
Rule, and an infallible Direction to us. And in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other particulars (if it were requisite) it might be
shew'd that the State of Religion is alter'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
since our Saviour's time, and the times after
the Apostles.</p>
                     <p>And now in the close of this Head, we cannot but
take notice of the Usefulness and Necessity of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what hath been suggested concerning the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Administrations of Religion,</hi> and particularly of
the <hi>Christian.</hi> We cannot frame right thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Nature and Model of it, unless we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
observe the several Degrees and various Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:65397:312"/>
of it before mention'd: for tho there be the
same <hi>general Dispensation,</hi> yet there is an Alteration
as to the particular Scenes of it. That which we are
under at present differs much from those which were
in the first and early Ages of Christianism: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is unreasonable to require now the very same
things in the Church of Christ that were then. There
are some sober and well meaning Persons that, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
not to this, perswade themselves that there
ought to be as to every particular the same Face of
Administrations at present that there was at first, and
thence they look to the primitive State of the Church,
and examine every thing by that. But this is not
right, for there hath been a Change of things in the
Christian Church: and this Change was by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Superintendency and Disposal of the Divine
Providence and supreme Director. Hence it is that
we are not to expect that all things should be now as
they were in the Beginning, God himself having been
pleas'd to alter the Dispensation in part. Let us then
remember the <hi>particular Division</hi> of the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> we
are under, and let us be concern'd to do what is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and proper to it: and thereby we shall help to
promote and hasten the next and better one, which
I am now to speak of.</p>

                        <p>That Christianity shall arrive to Manhood or
Full Age, is proved by several Arguments, 1.
God's Method in the World. 2. The Low ebb
of Christianity hitherto. 3. The number of
those that perish. 4. The gradual Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all Arts and Sciences. The several Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
concerning the Decay and Senescency
of the World, made use of by Jewish, Pagan
and Christian Writers, fully answer'd. That
the World decaies not as to Learning and Arts,
is made good from the Improvements of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
the Inventions of Gun-powder and
Guns, of Printing, of Clocks and Watches,
the preparing of Sugar, the Advances in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
and Physick, Astronomy, Arithmetick,
Chymistry, Mechanicks, the Stile of Writers.
It is congruous to the Divine Providence and
Wisdom that Religion also should have its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements,
as well as Arts and Sciences, and
accordingly it hath been greatly advanc'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
by the Reformation. From the Increase
it hath had already, we may gather that there
will be farther Accessions afterwards. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile

of the Truth and Reality of such a State; by

expres'd this matter by, for he distinguishes between
the <hi>younger</hi> and the <hi>riper Years</hi> of Christianity: he
holds the former to be the first Ages of the Gospel,
the latter those that succeed. And yet as it is in the

of them be alter'd, yet the same <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
remain in the mature Years that were before: so

                           </gap>itting, saith he, that the heavenly Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
(for so he stiles the <hi>Christian Religion</hi>)
which was sowed in the Church by the primitive
Fathers, should afterwards grow up, flourish and
be cultivated by the Industry of their Sons, that
by process of time it should become more polish'd,
but yet that it should retain the same Plenitude,
Property and Integrity, that it had as to its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
at first.</q> Thus that excellent Writer. And
I was very glad to find my Notion of the <hi>last Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

confirmed by a Person of so much Judgment and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity,
and of so great Repute in the Christian
Church. The Sum of what he saith is, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
shall be improved by succession of Time, and
at last this Beauty shall receive its finishing stroke.</p>
                     <p>Now this I will endeavour to make good from <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and <hi>Scripture.</hi> It is reasonable to believe that
there shall be a better State of Religion, because this
is founded on the constant Method of God in the
World. We find that it is his Way and Course to
proceed in a gradual manner, and that not only in
the things of Nature (as at the Creation of all ranks
of Beings) but in those of Religion, as I have shew'd
in the several Stages of it since it began. Wherefore
it is reasonable to conclude that it will be thus in
<hi>Christianity,</hi> that as it hath had already its different
Steps, Measures and Gradations, so there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
yet to come, and that it shall arrive to the heighth
of its Glory in this World.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is reasonable to believe that great things
are to come, because so little is done hitherto. The
unbelieving part of the World is very vast and large.
The greatest Kingdoms of the Earth are those of the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> the <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Chinoise,</hi> the <hi>Persians,</hi> the
<hi>Turks,</hi> all wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch are Strangers to the Religion of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
Divide the World into three Parts, and it will
appear that two of them are inhabited even by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
<hi>Pagans.</hi> Or, if we divide it into six parts, we
shall find that five of them at this day know not <hi>Christ,</hi>
but are either Idolatrous <hi>Pagans,</hi> (which are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number) or <hi>Iews,</hi> or <hi>Mahometans.</hi> And of the
sixth Part, how few of those that outwardly make
Profession of <hi>Christ</hi> have true Faith, and deserve the
Name of <hi>Christians? Popery</hi> (which can <hi>scarcely</hi> be
reckon'd as a part of <hi>Christianity</hi>) hath spread it self
through the most flourishing Kingdoms in <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

hath got footing in <hi>Asia,</hi> and is not wholly a stranger
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:65397:314"/>
in some parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and hath found its way even
into <hi>America.</hi> Among the Churches which disown
<hi>Popery,</hi> some of them are grosly ignorant, erroneous,
and superstitious, as the <hi>Muscovian, Abyssine</hi> and
<hi>Greek</hi> Churches generally. And even among the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches</hi> what Divisions and Dissentions, what
unchristian Feuds and Animosities are there? What
variety of Opinions is there amongst them? How
unsetled are they in their Notions and Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
How little of the true Virtue of Religion and
Power of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iness is to be observed among them?
How is the Satanical Kingdom kept up and maintain'd
every where? How industriously is it recruited and
establish'd?</p>
                     <p>Whereas <hi>Christians</hi> should live better than all the
World beside, it is sad and deplorable that their
Words and Actions bid de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iance to every thing which
appertains to so Sacred and Honourable a Title.
They profess the best Religion in the World, and do
things that are the worst. Some that bear this venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Name are as wicked and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>est Enormities of
<hi>Barbarians</hi> are acted by them. It is too apparent a
Truth that many who go under the Name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
conspire against the Religion which Christ hath
set up in the World, as well as <hi>Iews, Turks</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</hi>
In fine, look where you will, and you will
have cause to say, how short is Christianity of its
full Arcomplishment? What slender effects are there
of it in the Lives and Manners of Men? How little
Progress hath it made in so many Ages? How nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is its Kingdom? How ineffectual are its Laws in
most places?</p>
                     <p>Whence it is rational to infer that there must be
some <hi>greater Work</hi> effected both in the Kingdoms of
the World which have no notice of Christ and the

Whence they gather that the World is decay'd,

                     <p>But such consequences are easily silenc'd, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
first that some of their own Authors are of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Credit or Repute, and many reports of Giants
are Poetical Inventions. So if you will believe <hi>Geoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and some other fabulous Writers,
<hi>Albion</hi> (now call'd <hi>Britain,</hi> the Isle which we inhabit)
was kept only by a Remnant of <hi>Giants.</hi> Secondly,
those Writers that we can depend upon, especially
the Sacred Penmen, tho they assure us that there were
such big and tall Men, yet they represent it as a very
rare and uncommon thing; they give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that the number of those huge Persons was very
small; whence we gather that tho there were none
such now in being, it doth not alter the case of the
World considerably. But thirdly, it appears that
since those times spoken of by antient Historians there
have been, and even at this time are some of that large
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ize. Modern Travellers of good esteem and credit
ascertain us that there are Giants in some particular
Countries; which overthrows the vain Conceit of
those that found the Decay of the World on a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
that none but the former Ages afforded Gigantick
Folks. But the truth of the matter is this, that tho
Countries differ as to their size of Men, nay tho some
are in the same Country of a large, others of a lesser
Proportion, yet the Stature of Men was not <hi>generally</hi>
higher and bigger heretofore than it is now. All Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are for the most part of the same heighth and
breadth that they were three thousand Years ago and
upwards, as is demonstrated by Doctor <hi>Hackwill</hi> and
others, from the <hi>Vrns</hi> and <hi>Rings</hi> and several other <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities,</hi>
which have been derived to after-Ages.
There is no Decay then as to this.</p>
                     <p>I might observe further, that some of the <hi>Christian</hi>

                        </gap>e he often declares that the World of Learning
grows old, and that there is a Decay as to Men and
Arts, and brave Accomplishments; and accordingly he
laments (but without tears) our Ignorance, and our
faint Imitation of the Antients, and our being but
an imperfect Copy of that exact Original. These
Gentlemen fancy that all things were best at first, and
that since all are grown worse and worse. It is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like that Philosophick Dream of a witty Author,
that there was at first nothing but <hi>Suns</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> that
there were no <hi>Earths</hi> or <hi>Planets;</hi> particularly that
this Earth which we inhabit, was once a glorious
Sun, but in process of time degenerated, and became
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:65397:318"/>
what it is, a dull opake Body. After the same rate
do these Persons talk, they tell us that Knowledg and
Arts were once very bright and gay, and shone forth
with a Lustre worthy of Mens eyes, but in these latter
times they are over-run with scum and crust, and are
miserably absorpt into Darkness and Barbarity. To
raise the Reputation of the past Ages, and to depress
that of the present, they cry out that we live in the
dregs of Time, in Natures Declension, in the old
Age and Dotage of the World. All was great and
brave heretofore, but now every thing is dwarfish,
mean and dwindling. Our Forefathers have exhausted
all the generous Wine, and left us nothing but Lees.</p>
                     <p>But we may justly think that such Apprehensions
as these favour more of Prejudice than Truth, and are
the Product of Imagination rather than Reason. For
let a Man, free from the steams of Melancholy and
the Tincture of Prepossession, consider things imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and he will find that there is no ground for such
Complaints. Indeed as to the <hi>Age</hi> of Men there is
some variation, for they lived much longer before the
Flood than they do now: but one would think this is
sufficient, that People live as long now as they did in
King <hi>David's</hi> time, (for he confines Man's Life to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
or eighty Years) and some Mens days are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to a greater length. Wherefore they that
maintain the Hypothesis of Nature's general Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
must hold that the World grew old betimes, that
it was aged in its Youth, which a Rational Man would
think harsh and absurd. And besides, if it began to
wax old so soon, it would have been quite decrepit
before this time, it would have been worn off its legs,
and wholly extinct. But seeing the contrary is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
we have Reason to think that the World doth
not decline in the least as to its natural Virtue, tho
there is, by the Will of Heaven, some defalcation of
Mens years. Nay, if Men can do as great, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:65397:318"/>
things now in a <hi>shorter</hi> time than they did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
this argues they are rather more vigorous now
than in past Ages. If any object the Loss of some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Arts and Inventions which were known hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
there cannot be a more satisfactory Answer than
this, that when any Invention hath been sunk, another
of as great usefulness hath succeeded in its place. <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cirol</hi>
tells us of some things <hi>found,</hi> as well as of others
<hi>lost.</hi> And we can inform our selves that tho some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
have been unhappily forgot or imbezled, yet,
for a compensation, there have been fresh ones that
have proved serviceable to the Life of Man. And as for
the latter Ages of the World, they have abounded in
useful Inventions, which were wholly unknown to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times; and they have marvelously improved
those Arts which were but then imperfectly begun.</p>
                     <p>If I spend some time in offering to the curious and
inquisitive Reader a short Demonstration of this, I
hope it will be excus'd as a pardonable Digr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ssion; if it
shall be thought to be a Digression when it is so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
and proper to my present, purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> To
shew that there is a great probability of the World's
increasing in Knowledg hereafter, because we see it
hath done so already. The thing then I undertake
now is, to shew that Learning hath been improved in
these latter Ages of the World, and that there is no
Decay as to ingenious Inventions. Even that very
Author before mention'd, who is the latest Defender
of the contrary Opinion, is himself a Confutation of
it. Whilst he argues on the other side, he pleads for
us; for his own vast Learning, flourishing Parts, and
all kinds of excellent Accomplishments disprove the
Doctrine of the World's Defection. Whilst he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fames
the Knowledg of the Age he lives in, he is one
of the greatest Glories of it himself. And if he had
been pleas'd to have look'd off of himself, and to
have taken a view abroad, he would have found that

latter have not wanted theirs which surpass them:
and moreover, we have added others of a different
Nature. It cannot be denied that we have been so
far from coming short of the foregoing Times in all
respects, that we have palpably exceeded them. And
because <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us that<note n="4" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Wisdom finds out the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of witty Inventions,</hi> it will not be unbecoming the
Sons of Wisdom to recount some of them, especially
when this comes so directly in our way; to shew that
the World decays not as to Knowledg and ingenious
Discoveries, and therefore we may rationally thence
hope that <hi>Divine Learning</hi> (which is the choicest of
all kinds of Knowledg) will be yet further advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                     <p>I will begin with the <hi>Sea-Compass,</hi> and the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wonderful Virtues and Use of the <hi>Loadstone</hi> to
<hi>Navigation,</hi> which was not the Attainment of the

have thought that it was known to the <hi>Tyrians</hi> of old,

of this King <hi>Solomon's</hi> Navy sail'd to the <hi>Indies,</hi> (some

They knew no great Sea but the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> they
travell'd no further than <hi>Hercules</hi>'s <hi>Pillars,</hi> or the
Streights of <hi>Gibraltar:</hi> and this they might perform
without the Invention of the Mariners Compass, for
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:65397:319"/>
they might coast along by the Shores. Some tell us
the <hi>Chinois</hi> had the use of the Loadstone and Compass
for Navigation about two thousand Years ago; but
this hath been proved to be false Antiquity, and it is
much like their having <hi>Writers</hi> among them antienter

                        <hi>Isaac Vossius</hi> reports. If I should

the virtue of the Loadstone so far as it directed them
to the North Point, and that the <hi>Saracens</hi> receiv'd

advanced, the Riches and Treasures of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
parts of the World are brought home to us, and
that Wealth which others knew not what to do with,
we convert to proper uses, and benefit Mankind by it.
Yea, Religion as well as Trade is promoted by this
Art: for hereby we not only come to be acquainted
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:65397:320"/>
with God's Works over the whole face of the Earth,
which administers abundant matter of Praising and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
the Divine Wisdom, Goodness, and Mercy; but
by the help of this Invention we have the Advantage
of propagating the Gospel, and spreading the saving
Knowledg of the True God, and of his Son Jesus
Christ throughout the World. The Improvement of
Navigation may be serviceable to this great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
End; yea, we hope it is partly so already, the
New Voyages and Discoveries being a happy Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to the Conversion of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> By means
of this Art a <hi>New World</hi> hath been the Invention of
the latter Age: for tho the Antients were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ignorant that there was such a Country <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
as this, witness the vast Isle <hi>Atlantis</hi> which the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests<note n="8" place="bottom">Plat. in Timaeo.</note> told King <hi>Solon</hi> of, and that vast
Island which the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had some notice of on the
West of <hi>Africa:</hi> yet these were but faint Attempts
and Essays. The Discovery of the <hi>Western World</hi> to
real purpose, and the being actually acquainted with
it, and taking possession of it, were reserv'd to be
the Atchievement of these latter times, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
it was first discover'd in the Year of our Lord
1492. by <hi>Christopher Columbus</hi> a Native of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
of <hi>Genoua.</hi> Tho, to speak the exact Truth,
it was (as <hi>De la Vega</hi> rightly informs us) one <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chez,</hi>
a Native of <hi>Helva</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> that first found out
those Regions. He used to trade in a small Vessel
from <hi>Spain</hi> to the <hi>Canaries,</hi> but it happen'd that by a
long and tedious Tempest he was driven upon those
Western Countreys: and at his Return he gave <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
or <hi>Columbus</hi> Information of what he had seen, and
died soon after he had done so of a Disease that he
had got by his dangerous Voyage. Afterwards, <hi>A
mericus Vesputius,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> made a farther Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:65397:320"/>
                        <hi>A. D.</hi> 1497. and gave the Country the Name
that it now bears. <hi>Ferdinando Magellan</hi> found out
the <hi>South</hi> Limits, <hi>A. D. 1520. Drake</hi> and <hi>Candish</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
more: <hi>Furbisher</hi> and <hi>Davis</hi> the <hi>East</hi> Side of it:
<hi>Willoughby</hi> and <hi>Burroughs</hi> made enquiry into the <hi>West.</hi>
And by the whole, unspeakable Advantages have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued
to Mankind, the World is made open and
wide, its State and Condition are well known, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Traffick are increas'd, Religion is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
and the Name and Worship of <hi>Iesus</hi> are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to those remote parts which knew nothing of
them before. Thus what hath been already found
out is very wonderful and surprizing, and we may
hope to be acquainted in due time with what is more
so; we may expect daily to hear of great discoveries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that vast Continent towards the <hi>Antarctick Pole.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Places</hi> I proceed to <hi>Things,</hi> and here the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Inventions are very considerable. The first
which I will take notice of is that of <hi>Gun-powder</hi> and
<hi>Great Guns:</hi> which tho<note n="9" place="bottom">
                           <hi>See</hi> Isaac Voss. de Artib. Sinarum.</note> some have thought was
known in <hi>China</hi> 1500 Years ago, and<note n="9" place="bottom">
                           <hi>See</hi> Isaac Voss. de Artib. Sinarum.</note> others have
asserted that the City of the <hi>Oxidrakes</hi> in <hi>India</hi> was
acquainted with it, yet there is little ground for any
such suggestions. It is more probable that it was
wholly a late Discovery, and that the use of <hi>Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
(the Ingredients of which are <hi>Brimstone,</hi> and <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriz'd
Charcoal,</hi> from whence it takes fire, and <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Petre,</hi>
whence come the force and noise) was found
out about 300 Years since by <hi>Barthold Swartz</hi> a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Monk.</hi> Some have fancied that this is meant by
<hi>Fire, Smoke, and Brimstone,</hi> Rev. 9. 17. which is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
to be used in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Armies; for by the
shooting of Gunpowder the Air is as it were set on
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:65397:321"/>
                        <hi>fire,</hi> and becomes of a <hi>Iacinth</hi> colour (for that also is
mention'd there) by reason of the blew <hi>Smoke,</hi> and at
the same time the scent of <hi>Sulphur</hi> is smelt: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Fire-Guns and Pistols are thought to be meant,
and the place is to be understood concerning these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times, wherein that Invention hath been used.
And by the by, here it might be observ'd that it is a
kind of an Imitation of <hi>Thunder,</hi> and that since the
Invention of it the Nature of that Meteor (which
hath those two properties, Light and Noise) is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explain'd; as on the contrary an inquisitive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hath well noted that<note n="1" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Brown's Vulg. Err.</hi> Book 2. cap. 5.</note> one Reason why the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
were so imperfect in the Doctrine of firy Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
was their Ignorance of Gun-powder and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
which best discover the Causes of many <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
thereof. Tho Gunpowder and Guns seem
to be Instruments of greater Cruelty than those
which were formerly used in War, yet if we consider
things aright, we shall not find them to be so. There
are not so many kill'd in Battel since these were made
use of as there were of old. This you may know by
the vast Numbers that were brought into the Field
then: and the Number of those that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lain was
proportionable. They went out to Battel with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
incredible Multitudes heretofore. King <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
brought <hi>eight hundred thousand chosen Men</hi> into the
Field, <hi>mighty Men of War,</hi> 2 Chron. 13. 3. And King
<hi>Abijah</hi> who fought with <hi>Ieroboam slew five hundred
thousand</hi> of these Men, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. You read in no Story
of such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>laughter in one Field. The <hi>Ethiopians</hi>
brought <hi>a thousand Thousand</hi> against King <hi>Asa's</hi> Army,
2 <hi>Chron. 14. 9. Iehoshaphat</hi> had <hi>eleven hundred and
threescore thousand in Arms,</hi> 2 Chron. 18. 14. <hi>Darius</hi>'s
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:65397:321"/>
Army which came to Battel in the Fields of <hi>Marathon</hi>
consisted of <hi>six hundred thousand.</hi> But <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Army
which he brought into <hi>Greece</hi> exceeded all that ever
we read of, for it consisted of two Millions of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men. But <hi>Herodotus</hi> makes the number some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
less, <hi>Seventeen hundred thousand</hi> on Land, and
<hi>two hundred and fifty thousand</hi> at Sea. And we read of
very great numbers in the Ages afterwards. <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
the <hi>Scythian</hi> came with <hi>nine hundred,</hi> some say
with <hi>twelve hundred thousand</hi> Men into the Field
against <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Grand <hi>Seignior,</hi> who had <hi>five hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thousand</hi> on his side; and in this Battel the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Tartar</hi> took not only <hi>Bajazet,</hi> but slew <hi>two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand</hi> of his Soldiers. But now there is no
need of such vast numbers of Men as heretofore: and
the numbers of the slain are not as they used to be of
old. We have a more compendious and speedy, a
more thrifty and frugal way of killing our Enemies
than by Bows and Arrows, by Javelins, Battel-axes
and Speers. The modern Mortar-pieces will end
the Quarrel sooner than the <hi>Roman</hi> Battering Rams.
A Tempest of Bombs and Granadoes will dispatch
the Business more easily than a Shower of Arrows.
A Broad Side will do quicker Execution on a Navy
than <hi>Archimedes</hi>'s Burning-Glasses did. Yea, we
have now the advantage by our late Invention of
Gunpowder either to <hi>beat down</hi> or <hi>blow up</hi> our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Seeing then there will be in this World, till
it be better, occasion of War, and Controversies
cannot be decided but by Blood, it is well that
there is now a way whereby Victory may be got
with less expence of Time and Blood than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
which is the Fruit of this Invention of Gun-powder
and the Engines that convey and discharge
it. Which things if <hi>Wencestaus</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had foreseen, he would not have caus'd the
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:65397:322"/>
ingenious Inventer (as it is said) to be executed.
We might add here that the <hi>Military Art</hi> is in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>initely
improved as to <hi>Sieges, Fortifications,</hi> &amp;c. which
are intirely the discovery of these latter times.</p>
                     <p>So was the Art of <hi>Printing,</hi> of which I will speak
next. For I attend not to what<note n="2" place="bottom">Maffaei Hist. Indic. l. 6. Vossius de Artib. Sinar.</note> some have sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
that this Art was known to the <hi>Chinois</hi> very
near two thousand Years ago. That which those
People had attain'd to then (tho it was of great
use to them) was inferiour to this <hi>Typographick</hi> Skill,
and is not to be the compared with it. <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>Holland,</hi> in the former <hi>Mentz,</hi> in the latter <hi>Harlem,</hi>
contend for the honour of this Invention. <hi>Iohn
Guttenberg</hi> of the first, and one <hi>Koster</hi> of the second
lay claim to it, but the former generally carries it.
Or if this latter first invented it (as some say he did
about <hi>A. D.</hi> 1430) the other was the first that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
and practis'd it in the Year 1440. Others
ascribe it to <hi>Iohn Faustus,</hi> a Goldsmith in <hi>Mentz,</hi>
others to <hi>Iohn Mentell,</hi> and others to <hi>Lawrence Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
But <hi>Guttenberg</hi> is the most celebrated; he was
born in <hi>Stratsburg,</hi> and was a Soldier by Profession
and Employment: yet it pleas'd God that this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Man was instrumental in discovering this peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Art, and at <hi>that time</hi> when it was so seasonable:
for Learning then ran very low, and was like to
decay yet more and more. All Books being in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript,
and the Monks and Friars having the
keeping and ordering of them, what could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but that they should be corrupted and depraved,
as without doubt they had been in great measure
already? For before the Invention of Printing, Books
used to be transcribed, and the Transcribers some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
out of mere carelesness and negligence, at other
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:65397:322"/>
times out of Ignorance, yea sometimes out of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
left out, or added something to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.
They writ not what they found, but what they
understood, and whilst they undertook to mend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men's Errors they shew'd their own. And hence
we have had innumerable Errors crept into the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Fathers, especially since the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
were started relating to the Doctrine of the Holy
Trinity, or to the Points of Popery. Those who
Patronized Arianism corrupted several Passages in
Books, and those who excessively doted on the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, and its Universal Bishop, and the Doctrines
and Ceremonies maintained by it, did the same by
altering, mangling, transposing, inserting, or leaving
out some Things in the Copies they transcribed.
And if you consider the Variety of MSS. and how
many Times, during the Space of several Centuries
of Years, they were Copied out, you must needs
conclude, that either by Design or Negligence many
Errors and Corruptions crept into the Text, and
Books varied very much from what they were at
first. This was the necessary and unavoidable Effect
of Transcribing of Authors, and Copying out their
MSS. which is now most happily taken away by the
<hi>Press.</hi> Now, after a little Care taken at first in
Correcting and Revising, many Thousands of Copies
are dispatched, and sent into the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ld, free from
Mistakes and Corruptions, and that in a lasser Time
than One of those Copies could have been Transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
The <hi>Seasonableness</hi> of this Noble Invention
may be discovered from this, That it was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably
Serviceable to the bringing on <hi>the Ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi>
For by the Benefit of <hi>Printing</hi> the World
was blessed with the excellent Labours of Learned
and Pious Men who lived in that Time; and thus
by this means the Popish Ignorance was laid open,
the Errors and Impieties of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:65397:323"/>
expos'd to view, and whereas before Learning was
lock'd up in Cloysters, now it spread it self over
all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Truth of the Gospel was Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
almost to a Miracle. Of such great use was
this Art, which hath been Improv'd of late to a
Wonder: For the first Inventors are not the most
exact, they that come afterwards far excell them;
for so it is oftentimes, they that are good at Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
are not so happy in Improving as others:
Thus we see in the Country where Printing was first
found out, there is the worst Printing, as well as
the worst Paper. But these Latter Times have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
Cultivated both, for which we have great
reason at this day to Bless God. In short, <hi>Learning</hi>
and <hi>Victory</hi> are now soon acquired, since <hi>Printing</hi> and
<hi>Guns</hi> have been found out.</p>
                     <p>That we may the better manage our Studies and
all other Business and Affairs, by <hi>Timing</hi> them
rightly, <hi>Clocks</hi> and <hi>Watches</hi> were invented. For
though Sun-dials and Hour-glasses, whether made
with running of Water or Sand, were of great
Antiquity, yet these <hi>Automatous Organs,</hi> or <hi>Horolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
by Wheels</hi> were lately found out, maugre the
groundless fancy of those Painters who Picture
St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> who lived in the 4th Century, with a <hi>Clock</hi>
by him. We are indebted to the excellent Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Wit of the <hi>Germans</hi> for this useful Contrivance,
whereby the Time is so Artificially divided that we
can know the just and precise Seasons of beginning
or leaving off our Work, of what Nature soever
it is; and the publick notice of the particular divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Time is imparted to the Eye-sight, and at
a greater distance communicated to the Ear.</p>
                     <p>If I would go abroad and observe what hath been
found out for the Use and Benefit of Mans Life, I
might take notice of that so Pleasant and Profitable
Commodity of <hi>Sugar.</hi> For whereas former Ages
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:65397:323"/>
knew the use of Honey only as the Universal Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
there is now discover'd a more convenient one,
by which a great part of our Food is made more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and many things in Physick are prepar'd, and
by which the whole work of Confectioning is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
It is true<note n="†" place="bottom">Nat. Hist. l. 12. c. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Pliny</hi> speaks of <hi>Sugar (Saccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum)</hi>
as it was taken out of the Canes, and saith it
was used in Medicines, but it was rare, and in small
quantities, and in <hi>Galen's</hi> time it was scarcely known,
and then it was used raw and indigested, and was
unserviceable to many Purposes. But at last this use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Condiment was Boyl'd and Bak'd, Dried and
Condens'd, and made up as now we see it. This is
an Invention not above 200 Years old. And the

much better and more exact than it was of

Anatomy have had the greatest Improvements of
late, of any Faculty whatsoever. Medicks are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
Cultivated, the Nature of Diseases is more
narrowly enquired into and understood, the Signs
and Symptoms of them are daily more manifested,
and the Therapeutick part is infinitely more inlarged
and advanced by a mixing of <hi>Galenical</hi> and <hi>Chymical</hi>
Medicines, by the vast variety of Observations and
Experiments, and by the Skill and Sagacity of those
that have lately labour'd in that Art; so that this
Age is grown Famous for Great and Wonderful
Cures, and the Health and Long Life of Man are
marvellously promoted.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Astronomy</hi> there are New Discoveries also. The
late Ages have been more knowing in the Heavens
than those that went before. Now we are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the <hi>Suns Spots,</hi> i. e. the Filth and Scum
which it sometimes contracts, the <hi>Mountains</hi> and
<hi>Shadows</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Lunulae</hi> or <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
                        <pb n="630" facs="tcp:65397:325"/>
mutually Eclipsing one another, and the <hi>Ansulae
Saturni.</hi> So that whereas heretofore there were but
Seven Planets known, now Six more are added, 4.
about <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and 2. about <hi>Saturn.</hi> We have found
<hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> to be Horn'd, and to be subject
to the other <hi>Aspects</hi> of the <hi>Moon.</hi> The Stars are
grown into Suns in our Days, for there are as many
<hi>Suns</hi> as <hi>Fixed Lights,</hi> and there is on difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these and that Luminous Body which we call the
<hi>Sun,</hi> but that they are further off from us than this.
There are New Hypotheses of the Heavens and the
Earth, and of the Rest and Motion of either; which
if they be not adjusted to exact Truth, yet serve to
illustrate and better set forth the Doctrine of the
Celestial Bodies, and their various Phaenomena, and
thereby to lead us to admire the Wonders of the
Creation, and to extol and praise the Great and
All-wise Contriver of this Mundane Fabrick. Nor
is <hi>Astronomy</hi> yet come to its Zenith, to its Meridian:
We on good Grounds expect that by the benefit of
the <hi>Optick Tubes</hi> and <hi>Telescopes,</hi> which are every
day growing more perfect, we shall penetrate farther
into the Nature of the Heavenly Bodies, and have
a more compleat insight into them. And it is not
to be doubted that we shall in time have a more
correct Account of the Suns Course, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Reformation of the <hi>Calender;</hi> and then that
Complaint will cease that the present Computation
is not exactly agreeable to the Natural Motion of the
Sun or Earth.</p>

                        <hi>Chymistry</hi> is all New; there was no such thing

Art, which was set on foot by <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
and by some other searching Heads, hath had
Prodigious Additions made to it lately. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymists
Retort and Alembick never were furnish'd
with such rare and excellent Secrets as they are now;
the Laboratories and Furnaces never afforded the
like Inventions. It is indeed a rough and violent
way of Philosophizing, it is an hectoring as it were
of Nature, it is puting her upon the Rack, and on the
Fieny Trial, to make her confess what-she never did
before. And truly she hath made a very ample
Confession and Discovery, whereby the knowledge
of Natural Philosophy is much increas'd and imbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
very Noble and Precious Medicaments (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting

<hi>Mathematicks</hi> who sees not the vast Improvements

among us of Old was thought to be Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>Roger Bacon,</hi> a <hi>Franciscan Friar</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was
reputed a Necromancer, and accused of Magick to
Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 4th. though his fault was only too
great skill in Mathematical Learning. They shew'd

and also a great number of Inventions that relate to
Traffick and Commerce, to all manner of Trades and
Occupations. In brief, all the Mechanical Artifices
which we have, and which tend to the Profit or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of Man's Life are in a manner New, and are
not the product of the older Times, but of these
latter Ones.</p>
                     <p>I will observe further, that <hi>Writing,</hi> and the
<hi>Style</hi> of Authors of all kinds, are extremely
improved of late. There is a choicer strain
of Language, and a better vain of Wit, than
were heretofore known among Writers. For aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Burlesque</hi> and <hi>Travestie</hi> (which are the great
Corruption of our modern Poesy, because by these
idle, frothy, Mock-Poems, the most Grave and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Writers among the Ancients are ridicul'd, the
majestick and lofty Genius of Poetry is abused and
perverted, and a vain and fantastick way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is propagated among us) abating, I say, this,
there hath been a great Reformation of the Pens of
Authors. They have agree'd to lay aside those little
trifling Things, wherein a great deal of time was
vainly spent. It is well known that <hi>Anagrams</hi> were
an old Piece of Wit, and were used by the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
as well as <hi>Latins.</hi> The oldest Anagrams among
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:65397:326"/>
the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets were made by <hi>Lycophron,</hi> who changed
the Name of his King <hi>Ptolemy,</hi>

                        <hi>Gratia,</hi> because he is said
to find <hi>Favour,</hi> Gen. 6. 8. <hi>Acrosticks</hi> were another
laborious way of being Ingenious heretofore, but
they were generally very sorry and contemptible
Things. And so were the <hi>Leonine</hi> and <hi>Serpentine
Verses;</hi> the Knack of them was, that every Word
was the very same backward and forwards. They had
Verses in the Shape of a pair of <hi>Wings,</hi> an <hi>Egg,</hi> an
<hi>Hatchet,</hi> &amp;c. But chiefly their Wit lay in <hi>Paranoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia's,</hi>
or Jingling of Words; which we find often
among the Epigrammatists. Yea, the Grave and
Serious <hi>Tully,</hi> disdains not this way of Flash: Speaking
of a very Silly Fellow that had cut his Hair close,
he saith, <hi>Idcirco capite &amp; superciliis semper est rasus, ne
unum pilum boni viri habere dicatur.</hi> And he Quibbles
after this rate in divers Places. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> was a
great Jingler, and Player upon Words, and delights
in the Cadencies of Syllables. And so among us,
Puns and Clenches were Wit in the last Age, yea,
and they passed for such in Sermons. But now the
Affectation of Quibble, and Equivokes, is abandon'd,
and there are no Remains of it but among old Nurses.
Now there is a more Manly and Generous way of
embellishing Mens Styles; now there is a better
Turn of Fancy, and such as will be Wit in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.
And particularly as to the <hi>Poetick</hi> Wit and
Fancy among us, these have surmounted those of
former Ages; for it may be observed here, that
the Copy proves perfecter than the Pattern. Though
<hi>Spencer</hi> made <hi>Cowley</hi> a Poet, (for the former's Poems
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:65397:327"/>
being casually lighted upon by the latter, when he
was a Boy, call'd forth his Poetick Genius) yet
<hi>Cowley</hi> hath outdone <hi>Spencer,</hi> not only in the choice
of his Words, but in the quickness of his Dispatch.
Nay, he hath outdone his Master <hi>Pindar,</hi> and (as
one saith) is <hi>more Pindarick</hi> than he. The same is
Remarkable concerning some other Poetick Wits,
Imitation hath strangely improved, and the Scholar
hath exceeded the Master; and there are some now
alive, that may (without flattery) be said in some
respects to exceed all that went before them. Thus
upon a free, unprejudiced, and impartial Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we have found, that as to divers laudable
Acquisitions we go beyond our Ancestors; for we
have not only what they found out, but what we
have added our selves, which is much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This is a sufficient Confutation of that
<hi>vulgar Error</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Hackwell,</hi> who opposes it, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
styles it) that the World waxes old, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

as well as Naturals. We see the contrary, the
World is upon the thriving Hand; it doth not go
back and decline, as to the Knowledge of the Arts
and Sciences, but is still impregnating, and is still
teeming with them.</p>
                     <p>And shall we think that as to <hi>Religion</hi> only
there is a Decay? There is no Ground for such
a Surmise. Shall <hi>Divinity,</hi> which is the great Art
of Arts, remain unimproved? Shall we think that
all Knowledge, but that which is the best of all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
and prospers? No, we can prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
and thence entertain Hopes of greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
yet to come. The First Christians (as hath
been observed) did not understand some Parts of
their Religion, and the Nature of it, so well as
they did afterwards, or so well as it shall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
They were not exact in Points, but

Augustin, Chrysostom, Hilary, Ambrose, Theodoret, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophylact,</hi>
and the rest, have done excellently towards
the explaining of the Holy Scriptures; but the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns,</hi>
especially since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> have wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
added to them. And yet the greatest Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
of Truth is yet to come; not for discovering
any New Doctrines, but for explaining the Old ones,
and penetrating further into difficult Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Who sees not what a vast difference there is
between these and the former Times, in point of
Divine Knowledge? How little was there of it
heretofore, among those who ought to have had a
large Stock of it? I mean the Clergy, whose Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the Holy Scriptures, and in the Doctrines
of Christian Theology was scandalous, and even ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.
Indeed some of them were versed in
School-Divinity; but this was for the most part so
far from making them more knowing, in the Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Practical Doctrines of Christianity, that it
rather darkned and confounded them. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Days of Popery, <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> (the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
in which the Bible was wrote) were meer
unintelligible Jargon, to the Generality of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
And as for the People, their Ignorance and
Blindness were yet grosser, and they were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to make any Enquiry into Religion. Then
that Politick Maxim prevail'd, <hi>Keep Men in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and thereby enslave them.</hi> It was an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
Crime for Men to think their own Thoughts,
much more to speak or write them. <hi>Ramus</hi> having
published some new Notions of <hi>Logick,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who was at that time in
great Credit, was murder'd among the <hi>Calvinists</hi> in
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:65397:328"/>
the <hi>Parisian</hi> Massacre. The poor Man was a Martyr
for Logick; it is no wonder then that so many were
for Divinity. There was no liberty for Scruples in
those peremptory Times; for the Roman Doctors
cut out Mens Belief, and then forced it upon them.
A strange kind of Casuists, that solv'd all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
in Religion, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did the Gordian-Knot,
by the Sword, by meer Violence. Thus
Mens Souls and Bodies were injur'd, the former
were <hi>blinded,</hi> the latter <hi>enslaved:</hi> They might be
truly said to be bound in <hi>Chains of Darkness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we, by the Divine Blessing, are free'd from
that Ignorance and Bondage; which we owe to the
<hi>Reformation,</hi> whereby that Darkness was dispell'd,
and that Vassallage removed. And now we are no
longer tied up in the dark, we both see and walk,
and we daily make progress in Divine Learning.
An undeniable eviction of which, are the Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Writings of those of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
especially of Divines; for from these we may
gather the vast Improvements in Sacred Knowledge.
They generally argue with close Reason, they talk
great Sense, they shew a deep Insight into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Writings, they cloath their Matter with fit
Words, they use an intelligible and easy Method,
they are happy in applying of Divine Truths; in
brief, their Notions are amended, and all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Doctrines of Christianity are more plainly
and clearly delivered than before. And the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Knowledge is proportionable; they hear with
Judgment, they discourse with Understanding, they
try the Spirits whether they be of God, they are
able to confute Gain-sayers. In the Countries where
<hi>Protestantism</hi> hath taken good Footing, there is scarce
any difference between the Clergy and Laity, in the
knowledge of the <hi>Chief</hi> and <hi>Practical</hi> Points of our
most Holy Religion. These are understood by the
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:65397:328"/>
inferior and most ordinary People, as well as by
Gentlemen, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other Sex study, read, and discourse of them. Thus
humane Minds are enlightned, and enfranchised.
The Elastick Power is restored to them; they act
without Restraint, and fill the Earth with Knowledge
and Truth.</p>
                     <p>Judge now, whether the World grows old, and
decays, and is sunk into a degenerate Posture. Say
rather that it is much amended, and is like to be
improved yet further in future Times. For from
what hath been already, we may infer what shall
be afterwards. We see Divine Knowledge and
Learning have been continually in the <hi>Increase,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
only for some Interruptions that were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and lasted not long) and yet we are sensible
they are not come to the <hi>Full;</hi> whence therefore we
reasonably conclude, that there are to be farther
and greater Augmentations in succeeding Ages.
And where the Knowledge of Divine Things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails,
there Religion will get sure Footing, and
Vertue and Piety will be powerfully advanced, and
the Church edified and inlarged. These are the
Grounds I lay of that Expectation which I have of
a more compleat and improved State of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church here on Earth, before the Conclusion
of all Things.</p>

under the Gospel, and is spoken and prophesied of
so often in the Sacred Writings. But though they
are to be blamed for this, that they strive to make
all Scriptures speak their Opinion, and accordingly
force them to do it; yet it is most certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that this Future State which I am now
speaking of, is foretold in many Places of Scripture
in plain and intelligible Terms; and particularly in
some of those Places where Christ is mentioned as a
<hi>King,</hi> and his Administration under the Gospel is
called <hi>a Kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But first I will produce some other Texts, where
this New and Last Dispensation is spoken of. It is
probable that this is meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>Mat. 24. 3. th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Consummation</hi> or <hi>End of the Age, i. e.</hi>
of this Age or Dispensation we are now under; for
this is the proper Signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
in this Chapter is foretold by our Saviour
what shall happen in the <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Conclusion</hi> of this
<hi>Dispensation,</hi> and what are the Signs and Forerunners
of the following Scene of Things in this World, as
well as of the Day of Judgment in the close of it.</p>
                     <p>Some think this is meant by the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>Mat. 19. 28.</hi> for they join this Word with those that
immediately follow, <hi>When the Son of Man shall sit on
the Throne of his Glory,</hi> and read the whole thus;
<hi>Those who have followed me</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> all Persons who
are true Christians and Followers of me) <hi>shall in the
Regeneration, when the Son of Man shall fit on the
Throne of his Glory, fit also upon Twelve Thrones.</hi> This
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:65397:329"/>
shall happen in that last and blessed Dispensation of
Christianity, which is fitly called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as
it was used by the Ancient Philosophers, both <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists</hi>
and <hi>Stoicks,</hi> to signify the Renovation of all
Things, their happy Restitution to their former
State. In this Time of the <hi>Regeneration</hi> or <hi>Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of the World, Christ properly <hi>Reigns</hi> here
on Earth, shewing vengeance on his Enemies, and
rewarding his sincere Followers, as you read in the
next Verse, <hi>Every one that hath forsaken Houses, or
Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or
Children, or Lands, for my Name's sake, shall receive
a hundred-fold,</hi> viz. <hi>in this present Time,</hi> as 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 30. the parallel Place to it.
Which implies that the former Passage relates to
Christ's Reigning upon Earth, or <hi>sitting on the
Throne of his Glory</hi> in this World. But I confess
there are <hi>some</hi> Things that occur in the Context, and
in another parallel Text, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 30. which may
induce us to think, that these Words are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
meant of the matter now before us, and
therefore I will not urge them. But <hi>the Times of
the Restitution of all Things, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21.</hi> seem to look
this way; for we may observe, that <hi>the Times</hi> (in
the plural) denote several Ages and Successions of
Time, and so may be well applied to the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium:</hi>
And moreover it is remarkable, that in
those Days there shall be a Restitution of <hi>all Things,</hi>
not only of all Persons, but of <hi>all Things;</hi> there shall
be an universal Restauration of the World, a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Change in the whole Creation, which must needs
point to that Time which I am speaking of, and
not to the Day of Judgment, as some would have
it. But it will be Objected that 'tis said here, <hi>the
Heaven must Receive Christ until those Times,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must be meant of the Last Day. The Answer
in brief is, That the meaning of the Place is, that
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:65397:330"/>
Christ shall not return until those Times of Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be come and perfected; till there be <gap reason="foreign">

an universal, total, and compleat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of the World, and then soon after this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the Final Judgment.</p>
                     <p>This is included in that <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
(or <hi>Manifestation,</hi> as our English Translators
render it) <hi>of the Sons of God which the Creature ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
expects;</hi> longing and <hi>groaning to be delivered
from the Bondage of Corruption, into the Glorious Liberty
of the Children of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 19, 20. If you take <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>the Creature,</hi> for <hi>the Gentile World,</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
and some others do) it may be fitly applied
to the present purpose: For according to what God
hath determined, and in the Scriptures foretold,
concerning their future Conversion, (of which I
shall speak anon) they may be said to <hi>expect,</hi> and
have been long <hi>expecting</hi> this joyful Revelation;
they <hi>earnestly look for the Manifestation of the Sons of
God; viz.</hi> when they and all other Infidels shall be
converted to the Faith, and thereby become <hi>the Sons
of God;</hi> or when the <hi>Iews</hi> particularly (who were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
the <hi>Children of God)</hi> shall embrace the Gospel.
But we may take the Word in a larger Sense; for

in the Sacred Style, and so I apprehend it is
to be understood in <hi>Mark 16. 15. Preach the Gospel
to every Creature, i. e.</hi> to every Rational Creature,
<hi>viz.</hi> Men. And so in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and other <hi>Rabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi>
Writings, the Word <gap reason="foreign">

is accompanied with <hi>Freedom:</hi> And it is styled, <hi>the
Redemption of our Body; i. e.</hi> it is as it were a Relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
us from <hi>Captivity,</hi> a perfect Deliverance from
all Servitude and Misery. There could not be a

which I am now treating of, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
from the particular Account which I shall spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
give you of it.</p>
                     <p>It is no improbable thought, that this is meant
by <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap> the <hi>Gospel</hi> was preached. And I
have observed before, that this manner of speaking
is borrowed from the Style of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were
wont to call the Time of the Messias <hi>Gnolam habba,
the World or Age to come.</hi> But as these are <hi>general</hi>
Terms, to signify <hi>the Time of the Messias,</hi> so they
are taken in a more <hi>restrained</hi> Sense for <hi>the last and
concluding Part of this Time; viz.</hi> when Christianity
shall be at its Heighth. That properly and peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is this <hi>World to come,</hi> that particular State of the
Gospel when all Persons, Jews, Gentiles, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:65397:331"/>
shall imbrace the Christian Religion; when all
the Nations and Kingdoms of the World shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Kingdoms of Christ.</p>
                     <p>This New <hi>Evangelical World,</hi> this New Kingdom
of the Gospel, is likewise comprised in the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>,
<hi>the Time of Reformation</hi> mentioned by
the same Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. for he uses this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
with reference not only to the <hi>Mosaick
Law,</hi> which was to be <hi>corrected</hi> and retrenched, but
in regard of the <hi>Gospel</hi> itself, which was designed
to <hi>amend</hi> and <hi>reform</hi> the World, and to <hi>set it right.</hi>
Now this was not to be a Mock-Reformation, but it
was to be to Purpose, and throughly to be carried
on, which I call the <hi>Heighth</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Dispensation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may have been signified when St. <hi>Paul</hi> would
have the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and with them all Christians
in future Ages, <hi>wait for the Revelation of our Lord
Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 17. And when St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Converted <hi>Iews</hi> whom he wrote to, (and
with them all holy Men in succeeding Times) <hi>to
hope for the Grace that is to be brought unto them at the
Revelation of Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 13. He had been
speaking in the foregoing Verses of the former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations
in the Church of God, together with
the Evangelical one which was then present; and
now he acquaints them that there is to be a <hi>higher
Degree</hi> of this last Dispensation: The Time shall
come when the Effects and Fruits of the Gospel shall
be more Conspicuous and Eminent, when the Grace
of God which bringeth Salvation shall produce
greater Things in the World, to the Astonishment
of all the Enemies of the Church, and to the Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
even of Holy Christians themselves. This is
<hi>the Revelation of Iesus Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This last Condition of the Church is also expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by <hi>New Heavens, and a New Earth,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 13.
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:65397:331"/>
For this is the Style of the Evangelical Prophet,
<hi>Isa. 65. 17. 66. 22.</hi> where by <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and a
<hi>New Earth,</hi> he sets forth the State of the Gospel;
and therefore the Heighth of it deserves these Titles
much more. Whence it is probable, that this is
<hi>the New Heaven and the New Earth</hi> which St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
saw, <hi>Rev. 21. 1.</hi> For it is observable, that he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
makes use of the same Expressions and Phrases
which are found in the Prophetical Writers. And
though, it is true, some Learned Expositors under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this <hi>New Heaven and New Earth,</hi> in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>

call'd a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and set forth by <hi>Reigning.</hi> It is
not to be question'd that <hi>David</hi>'s Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was a Type and Earnest of this: And those
<hi>sure Mercies of David,</hi> Isa. 55. 3. are the Faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
made by God to <hi>David,</hi> concerning the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>

of Christ which I am speaking of. Of this we often
read in the Prophet <hi>Daniel;</hi> as in Chap. 2. ver. 44.
<hi>In the Days of those Kings</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Monarchs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

was one, under whom <hi>Christ</hi> was born) <hi>shall the God
of Heaven set up a Kingdom which shall never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</hi>
That is, <hi>Christ's Kingdom</hi> then began to be
erected, which afterwards shall more eminently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that Name; <hi>viz.</hi> when it shall arrive to its
Perfection. It is said here expresly, that <hi>it shall
break in pieces all these Kingdoms,</hi> that is, the Four
Monarchies: Of which we are further ascertain'd
in the next Verse, for <hi>Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> is that <hi>Stone which
was cut out of the Mountains without Hands, and
was to break in pieces the Iron, the Brass, the Clay, the
Silver, and the Gold.</hi> This Famous <hi>Stone</hi> was to beat
down all the <hi>Four Metals;</hi> Christ was to destroy the
Four Monarchies; that is, when these cease, Christ's
Kingdom immediately succeeds. It is true, it did
succeed in part when the <hi>Pagan Roman Empire</hi> expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
(and so in some measure this Prophecy was
fulfilled) but there shall be a more illustrious and
eminent Succession than this, upon the compleat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
of the <hi>Fourth General Monarchy.</hi> Wherefore
when we see this quite at an end, we may conclude
that Christ's Reign approacheth; <hi>i. e.</hi> that the happy
Condition of the Christian Church in this World
draws near. This Fourth Monarchy, the <hi>Roman,</hi> is
now wearing off; being translated to the <hi>Germans,</hi>
it is but a meer Name and Title. The <hi>Wings</hi> of
this <hi>Imperial Eagle</hi> have been plucked, its Plumes
are fallen, its Feathers are gone, its whole Body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
consumed. <hi>Rome</hi> itself, and <hi>Italy,</hi> are not so
much as the poor Remains at this Day of the <hi>Roman
Empire.</hi> This <hi>Image</hi> is now on its last <hi>Legs,</hi> and
those are infirm; for the Holy Spirit tells us, that
<hi>the Feet are of Clay and Iron,</hi> which Two Materials
will not well cement, and hold together long.
Therefore another State of Things is approaching;
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> or Empire here prophesied
of, the Reign of Christ Jesus here on Earth, or,
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:65397:332"/>
which is the same, a more illustrious Manifestation
of Christianity, a more Visible and Glorious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing
of its Vertue and Power, than ever yet was
in the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of this</hi> Kingdom of the Son of Man, <hi>you have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
express Prediction in Dan. 7. 14.</hi> There was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all
People, Nations, and Languages should serve him. His
Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, which shall not pass
away, and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroy'd.
<hi>Again, ver. 22.</hi> The Time came that the Saints possessed
the Kingdom: <hi>Agreeably to what was said, ver. 18.</hi>
The Saints of the most High shall take the Kingdom,
and possess the Kingdom for ever. <hi>This Kingdom is

Ezekiel,</hi> and the <hi>Lesser Prophets,</hi> which speak
of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Messias,</hi> but they are (it is
true) generally interpreted by Expositors of Christ's
Coming in the Flesh, and the prevailing of the Gospel
afterwards, and even to this very Day, but they are
not thought by them to reach any further. This,
I conceive, is a Mistake from the narrow Thoughts
which Men are apt to have of those great Things
spoken of by the Prophets; which we shall find,
upon diligent comparing of Things, to have a very
large and comprehensive Meaning. Most of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick</hi>
Expressions of this Nature, have reference not
only to the first Times of the Gospel, and these at
present, but to those that are to come. Ultimately
and completely, and in their highest Signification,
they cannot but be interpreted of these last. For if
those Prophetick Passages before-mentioned, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others in the Writings of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
only of the past or present Times of the
Gospel; it is certain that the Interpretation will
not answer the Greatness and Heighth of the Words,
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:65397:333"/>
much less the Weight and Dignity of the matter
spoken of. If we attend to this, we shall discern the
full Design and Meaning of those notable <hi>Prophecies</hi>
of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> we shall apprehend those
many Glorious Things (both with relation to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Temporal Blessings) which they foretel
shall be in those last Days: But I shall have occasion
to alledge, and particularly to consider those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
<hi>Passages,</hi> when I come to shew distinctly
wherein this Dispensation consists, and how it differs
from all others.</p>
                     <p>The Places in the <hi>New Testament</hi> where this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ</hi> is spoken of, are not a Few. But that
we may not mistake, it will be requisite to observe
the different Significations of the Word <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as
it refers to the Times of the <hi>Gospel;</hi> (for we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not the Word now as it is applied to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State of Glory in the highest Heavens.) First,
By it is sometimes meant the Gospel-Dispensation
<hi>in general,</hi> the whole Time of Christ's Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his Church from first to last. Thus the
Angel's Words to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
Luke 1. 33. <hi>He shall Reign over the House of
Iacob</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> his Church, the true <hi>Israel</hi> of God) <hi>for
ever, and of his Kingdom there shall be no end;</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
shall more or less flourish till the World hath
its final Period and Consummation. In this large
and general Sense those Places are to be taken,

especially the <hi>Parables,</hi> where <hi>the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to understand by it that <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
time</hi> of the Gospel-Dispensation, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
succeeded our Saviours <hi>Resurrection,</hi> as is
evident from St. <hi>Iohn Baptist's</hi> Words, <hi>The Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand,</hi> Mat. 3. 2. and from the same
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:65397:333"/>
Words used by our Saviour himself, <hi>Mat. 4. 17.</hi>
and afterwards by his Apostles, <hi>Mat. 10. 7.</hi> For
none of these Texts could be meant of the time of
the Gospel when Christ was on Earth, or before his
Passion, but of some other succeeding time; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it could not be said <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand,</hi> but rather <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is present,</hi>
or is already come. Whence I infer that Christ
may be said not to be in his <hi>Kingdom</hi> (as it respects
the <hi>Gospel</hi>) he may be said not to <hi>Reign</hi> all the time
betwixt his Nativity and his Resurrection, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the time of his Humiliation: But as soon as he
rose from the Dead, having conquer'd Death and
Satan, then he set up his <hi>Spiritual Kingdom.</hi> This is
clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 132. 11. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 30.
<hi>Then he sat upon his Throne,</hi> as the Apostle here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
it. Wherefore he said to his Apostles, when
he was risen, <hi>All Power us given unto me in Heaven
and in Earth,</hi> Mat. 28. 18. And those Words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

<hi>Luke 7. 28. He that is least in the Kingdom of God is
greater than he, i. e.</hi> after I am Risen and Ascended,
the least Apostle or Preacher of the Gospel shall
excell <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> for then a clearer Light will
shine, the Spirit will lead into all Truth. Thus we
may understand our Saviour when he saith, <hi>I will

day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdom,</hi>

to take the Words as spoken concerning the time
after Christ's Resurrection, when he did Eat and
Drink with his Disciples, as is expresly Recorded.
This time is Signally and Eminently called <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> because this Commenced im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after he rose from the Dead; and it is
stiled <hi>the Kingdom of his Father,</hi> because soon after
his Resurrection follow'd his <hi>Ascension</hi> and <hi>Sitting at

Inauguration and Enstallment. This was the first
Year of his <hi>Reign,</hi> now he enter'd upon his <hi>Royal

not done before. Thus you see the Date of Christ's
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> as it is more <hi>specially</hi> and <hi>particularly</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
And moreover, from all that hath
been said under this Head, the truth of what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
asserted is made apparent, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are
certain <hi>Steps</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> in the Evangelical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Vengeance of Heaven on the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Nation in the Destruction and Devastation of their
City is call'd Christ's <hi>Kingdom, Mat. 16. 28.</hi> His
Triumphing over those obstinate People, whose
Forefathers had been his Murderers, was a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Instance of his Glorious <hi>Reign:</hi> Thence it is
that his destroying those his implacable Enemies is
said to be his <hi>Coming in his Kingdom;</hi> and it is call'd
<hi>the Kingdom of God coming with Power,</hi> Mark 9. 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Christ's Second Coming, <hi>viz.</hi> at the
Day of Judgment, when he shall visibly and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly,
in the Face of all the World, exercise his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Power, is call'd his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> thus it is said
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:65397:334"/>
                        <hi>Christ shall Iudge the Quick and the Dead at his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> By <hi>Christ's Kingdom</hi> is meant that peculiar
and special time of his Reigning which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Subject of our Discourse, when Christianity
shall arrive at its height, when the Church shall be in
its Meridian. That Petition in the Lord's Prayer,
<hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> seems to be meant of this, though
not solely of it. Then the Grace of God in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
will shine forth in its greatest splendor, and
<hi>God's will shall be done</hi> then <hi>on Earth as it is in Heaven,</hi>
which may perhaps be one reason why these Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are joyn'd together. It may be this is that
<hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> of which, and <hi>the things appertaining
to it,</hi> our Saviour Discours'd to his Apostles before
he left the World, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3. But in the Book of
the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> there are many clear Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which relate to this Perfect State of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church hereafter, and 'tis express'd by a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and by <hi>Christ's Reigning on the Earth.</hi> This New
Scene is mention'd after this manner in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10.
and again <hi>chap. 7. v.</hi> 15. and 17. and more plainly
in <hi>chap. 12. v. 10. Now is come the Kingdom of our
God,</hi> which is explained by the next Words, <hi>The
Power of his Christ,</hi> his effectual Reigning, whereby
he shews his Power in the Church more than ever.
We have not yet seen the Consequences of the
<hi>Seventh Angel's</hi> Sounding, when it was proclaim'd
with a loud Voice from Heaven, <hi>The Kingdoms of this
World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his
Christ, and he shall Reign for ever and ever,</hi> Rev. 11. 15.
which in <hi>v.</hi> 17. is call'd <hi>his taking to him his great
Power, and his Reigning.</hi> Which gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that he doth not at first exert his great Power
in the Evangelical Dispensation, he doth not fully
Reign, but that he will afterwards, and upon Earth.
This is <hi>taking to him his,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

There is one Text more which I will add, and I
request the Reader to consider of it, <hi>He</hi> (i. e. Christ)
<hi>must Reign till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. 25. The Apostle had mention'd the
Resurrection of the Saints at Christ's last coming,
<hi>v.</hi> 23. and thereupon adds in the next Verse, <hi>then
cometh</hi> (or, <hi>then</hi>

and Present State of things, <hi>when he</hi> (that is Christ)
<hi>shall have deliver'd up the Kingdom</hi> (the Saints who
are the chiefest part of his Kingdom) <hi>to God, even
the Father, when</hi> (i. e. <hi>after) he shall have put down
all Rule, and all Authority and Power,</hi> which oppose
him and his Kingdom: <hi>For he must Reign</hi> (i. e. in his
Church) <hi>till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet.</hi>
Now, it is plain and undeniable that this time is not
yet come, therefore it shall be hereafter. There
must be a time here on Earth, when Christ shall have
<hi>put all his Enemies under his Feet,</hi> when he shall Reign
without opposition. And this is the time I am
speaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Third Exertment of the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical

on which may be Founded and Built the Future Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
State of the Christian Church on Earth is the
20th Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where is expresly
foretold <hi>the Binding of Satan a Thousand Years,</hi> and

Delights, as if they design'd to revive the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean</hi>
Happiness, or to antedate the <hi>Mahometan</hi>
Heaven. <hi>Cerinthus</hi> is said to be the Author of this
Opinion, for being a Man addicted to Sensuality and
Pleasure, he founded an Happiness here on Earth of
such a Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> abounding with all Delights
relating to Meats and Drinks, Concupiscence and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy.
So saith an Antient Ecclesiastical Writer,
<hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> 1. 2. de. Promis. And <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
saith the same, <hi>Eccl. Hist.</hi> 1. 7. c. 19. But
this savours too much of the Flesh, besides that it
contradicts our Saviour, who said, <hi>His Kingdom

the Reigning of the Saints is not Worldly and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual,

                     <p>There were <hi>Others</hi> of Old who had a more Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Notion of the <hi>Millennary Reign,</hi> for they placed
it not in Sensual and Earthly Pleasures, and mere
outward Peace and Prosperity, though they held it
was not without these. There Opinion in short was
this, that after Six Thousand Years in this World
were compleated, the Saints should all rise, their
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:65397:336"/>
Bodies should ascend out of their Graves, or where
ever else they were, and their Souls should come
down from Heaven, and Christ also should descend
from thence and keep a Jubile with them, and Reign
with great joy a Thousand Years here upon Earth,
and that all Kingdoms should be made subject to
him, and that the Righteous should be Bless'd with an
abundance of the Good Things of this World, but
without any Intemperance, Excess or Immoderation
whatsoever. This they call'd <hi>the First Resurrection,</hi>
from which all the Ungodly are excluded. After

He and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Ierom,</hi> and others tell us, that
this Doctrine came first from <hi>Papias</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
who pretended he had it from St. <hi>Iohn</hi> (whose

                     <p>Or if we will be more exact in the Lineage and
Descent of it, we must begin it higher, and say,
that the <hi>Apostles</hi> set it on foot first, for they dreamt
of an <hi>Earthly Kingdom of Christ</hi> in this World, as I
have shewed before. Or rather we may trace it up to
<hi>the Iews before Christ;</hi> the <hi>Millennium</hi> was borrowed

                        <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and hath ever since been
look'd upon as an Heterodox Opinion, excepting
that some <hi>Anabaptists</hi> have made bold to revive it.
If we consider things aright we shall see sufficient
reason to condemn and explode this Doctrine, for
there are these two gross Errors in it, 1. That
Christ shall Personally Reign upon Earth. 2. That
the Saints shall come from Heaven and Reign with
him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Chiliasts</hi> are palpably mistaken in this,
that Christ shall come from Heaven, and <hi>Personally</hi>
Reign here, and that before the General Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Day of Judgment, as they also hold. This
is contrary to express Words of Scripture, which
saith concerning our Saviour, <hi>That</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 3. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>the Heaven must
receive him, until the times of the restitution of all things,</hi>
i. e. as I conceive, till the finishing of those times
of the restitution of all things, which will be a
little before the Day of Judgment. We are assured
that Christ from his Ascension to that time remains
in Heaven; <hi>From thence he shall come to Iudge the
Quick and the Dead;</hi> therefore he shall not come
down on Earth before that time, and consequently
he will not Reign here in Person, as those <hi>Mille<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
imagine. It is incongruous and against reason
that he should be said <hi>to come to Iudge</hi> the Men upon
Earth, and yet at the same time be on the Earth.
Nor is there any thing in this 20th. Chapter of the
<hi>Revelation</hi> which favours this Fancy of theirs. Had
a <hi>Personal Reign</hi> been intended here, it would have
been said, that <hi>Christ shall Reign with the Saints a
Thousand Years,</hi> which Words might fairly intimate
that Christ would descend from Heaven, and come
among them, and Reign in the midst of them so
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:65397:337"/>
long a time; but instead of this it is only said, that
<hi>they shall Reign with him a Thousand Years.</hi> Or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it were expresly said, <hi>Christ shall Reign,</hi> yet this
doth not prove that he shall Reign <hi>in Person.</hi> How
often doth <hi>the coming of the Lord</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. and in
other Places signifie <hi>Christ's Coming</hi> in way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Vengeance, not his Personal Coming? Why
then may not <hi>Christs Reigning</hi> be meant not of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Reigning, but of his Reigning in the Hearts
and Lives of the Faithful? He is with them Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
and they Reign with him after the same
manner, and no other. Therefore the Inquisitive
Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> who founds the Future Reign of Christ
upon Earth on his Chapter in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> saw
no Ground here for his Visible and Corporal Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Whence he hath left us these Words,<note n="†" place="bottom">Book 3. p. 79.</note> 
                        <q>The
presence of Christ in his Kingdom shall no doubt
be Glorious and Evident; yet I dare not so much
as imagine that it shall be a Visible Converse on
Earth; for the Kingdom of Christ ever hath been
and shall be a Kingdom, whose Throne and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Residence is in Heaven.</q> I quote this Passage
the rather, because some have entertain'd another
Opinion of this Learned Author. Besides, in this
Chapter, v. 8, 12. we read that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi>
intervene between the Thousand Years and the Day
of Judgment: Therefore the <hi>Personal Reign</hi> of
Christ is not before that Day, for the Heavens retain
him till then: Nor is it after that Day, for <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog,</hi> who come after the <hi>Millennium,</hi> go before the
Day of Judgment. I conceive this is an Unanswerable
Proof. And as for the several Quotations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which they bring to assert the <hi>Personal Reign,</hi> the
Answer in brief is this, that theywrest those Places
which speak of Christ's <hi>First Coming,</hi> and others
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:65397:338"/>
which speak of his <hi>Last Coming to Iudgment,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them to a <hi>Second Personal Coming</hi> of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the General Resurrection and Day of Judgment.
From this perverting of those Texts they set up the
Corporal Reign of our Saviour, which they so much
talk of.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That is another unpardonable Error,
that the Bodies of the deceased Saints shall be raised
from below, and their Souls be dismissed from above,
and that both shall be united here, that they may
Reign with Christ on Earth. First, this is against
the constant Discovery which is made to us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that <hi>Heaven,</hi> and signally the <hi>Highest Heavens,</hi>
are the Place of Glory, and the Seat of Blessedness,
prepared for the departed Souls of the Faithful.
Those Regions above, not this Earth below, are
the Receptacle of Glorified Spirits. Yet these Men
are pleased to alter the Constitution and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the All-wise God, and to make the Earth
the Habitation of Blessed Spirits, and the Seat of
Happiness. This is to abrogate the Laws of God's
Kingdom; this is to anticipate the State of Glory;
this is to confound Heaven and Earth. Again, How
absurd and ridiculous is it to assert, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Saints shall come to be subject (after all the
Joys and Ravishments of another World) to Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and bodily Evils? For <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> shall
besiege them, (as they must needs grant from v. 9.
of this Chapter.) Shall the Saints not only quit
their heavenly Mansions, and come down here on
Earth, but also turn Soldiers, and put themselves
into a Military Posture? For you read there of

                        <pb n="657" facs="tcp:65397:338"/>
must hold this, because they assert, that the Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Saints a Thousand Years is meant here of
their leaving of Heaven, and coming down to Reign
on Earth.</p>
                     <p>They pretend to prove this from several Passages
in this Chapter; as where it speaks of <hi>the Souls of
them that were Beheaded,</hi> and of their <hi>Living</hi> and
<hi>Reigning,</hi> and of <hi>the first and second Resurrection;</hi>
which argues, say they, that this <hi>Reigning</hi> is to be
understood of the Saints that were before in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and that there is one Resurrection a Thousand
Years before the Last Judgment, and another when
that comes: In the former, the Saints rise to Reign;
and in the latter, all other Men shall be raised. But
St. <hi>Iohn's</hi> Words in this Chapter signify nothing of
this Nature, as will appear from setting before the
Reader the entire Text with a brief Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. <hi>I saw the Souls of them that were Beheaded
for the Witness of Iesus, and for the Word of God, and
which had not worshipped the Beast, nor his Image, nor
had received his Mark upon their Foreheads, or in their
Hands; and they lived and Reigned with Christ a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years. But the rest of the Dead lived not again,
until the Thousand Years were finished. This is the first
Resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in
the first Resurrection; on such the second Death hath no
Power,</hi> ver. 4, 5, 6. It is generally agree'd, that by
<hi>the Souls</hi> of them that were Beheaded, are meant the
<hi>Persons</hi> that were Beheaded; for that is the known
way of speaking among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> whom St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
(who was one himself) here imitates. And by
<hi>them that were Beheaded for the Witness of Iesus,</hi> we are
to understand <hi>all Martyrs</hi> that were put to Death
for Professing Christianity; the same that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Rev. 6. 9. they that were slain for the Word of
God, and the Testimony which they held.</hi> This particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
manner of Death, <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="658" facs="tcp:65397:339"/>
it was most in use at that Time. This was
the capital Punishment that was frequent both among
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> (as<note n="*" place="bottom">Harmony on Acts 12.</note> Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath observ'd
and proved) and we read that <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> the
first <hi>Martyr</hi> for Christ, underwent it. And not
only those that suffer'd Death, but all other holy
Men, that had any other Punishment, of a lesser
sort, inflicted on them, are here intended; for one
kind of corporal Punishment is mentioned here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
all the rest, which is a way of speaking very
usual not only in the Holy Scriptures, but in other
Writings. <hi>They who had not worshipped the Beast, nor

                              <desc>•</desc>

who keep themselves unspotted from the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and do not in <hi>any kind</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
comply with them, or allow of them. These
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> saw, as well as the <hi>others</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And they lived,</hi> which may refer to this latter
sort of Persons only, and not to the former; that
is, to <hi>those who had not worshipped the Beast,</hi> not to
<hi>the Souls of them that were Beheaded.</hi> For you may
observe that it is expressed thus; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>and
whosoever;</hi> which shews, these are a distinct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
from the others mentioned before. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the latter must be applied those Words
(<hi>they lived</hi>) <hi>i. e.</hi> these Persons were free'd from
Persecution under the happy Reign of Christ which
was now come. Thus it is not absolutely necessary
that we should interpret this concerning the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Martyrs, <hi>the Souls of them that were Beheaded,</hi> but
only concerning the Saints then in being, <hi>those that
worship not the Beast,</hi> and consequently here is no
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:65397:339"/>
ground for the Resurrection of the Martyrs before
the Last and General Resurrection, (as a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
of their former Sufferings) as some Persons
imagine.</p>
                     <p>Or, suppose that [<hi>they lived</hi>] refers here to these
<hi>Martyrs,</hi> yet still we cannot conclude thence their
rising from the Dead; for it is only barely said <hi>they
lived,</hi> not <hi>they revived,</hi> or <hi>rose from the Dead.</hi> What
then was this <hi>Living</hi> here spoken of, which is the
Introduction to the Thousand Years? No other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
than this; that whereas many of the Faithful
Servants of Christ had been put to Death for the
Testimony of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and other Religious and Holy
Men had been as it were <hi>kill'd</hi> in former Times, (in
the same Sence that 'tis said, <hi>we are killed all the Day
long,</hi> Psal. 44. 22.) <hi>i. e.</hi> they were persecuted, injured,
and abused, now <hi>they shall live,</hi> now they shall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
now they shall be free'd from Persecution,
and enjoy Peace and Rest. Not that the individual
Persons that really lost their Lives shall thus live
upon the Earth; but the Church is here considered
as a successive Body, as is usual in this Book of the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> and elsewhere. The Meaning then is
this; though the Christians in the preceeding Ages
were cruelly and inhumanly treated by their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless
Persecutors, though the Church in those Times
labour'd under great and unspeakable Miseries; yet
upon the Entrance of the joyful <hi>Millennium,</hi> (for
there shall be on Earth such a <hi>Millennium,</hi> though
not of that Nature which the Ancient <hi>Chiliasts</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted)
all these troublesome and afflictive Things
shall cease, and the Faithful shall be put into the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of an undisturbed Repose and Serenity.</p>
                     <p>But because <hi>not living again</hi> is mentioned in the

                        </gap> here, is

                        </gap> there; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>they lived</hi> must be equivalent with <hi>they revived,</hi>
                        <pb n="660" facs="tcp:65397:340"/>
which is as much as <hi>they rose from the Dead.</hi> Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, it doth not follow that it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
Literally and Strictly, <hi>i. e.</hi> of a <hi>Real living
again after Death,</hi> or of the rising of their dead Bodies
out of the Grave. It is a Figurative way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and it is probable is an Allusion to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.
11, 14. <hi>Behold, O my People, I will open your Graves,
and cause you to come up out of your, Graves: And I
will put my Spitit</hi> (or breath) <hi>into you, and you shall
live.</hi> Which Words speak not of a Bodily Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
(as at the first Hearing they may seem to
do) but of <hi>Israel</hi>'s rising out of a low, captivated
Condition in <hi>Babylon. Your Graves shall be open'd,
and ye shall live; i. e.</hi> you shall be restored to your own
Land again, and there live in Plenty and Prosperity.</p>
                     <p>There is no Expositor of any Account, but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
the Words thus. And indeed there are several
other Texts which back this Interpretation; for in
<hi>Psal. 71. 20. 80. 18. Isa. 26. 19. Hos. 6. 2. Reviving</hi> and
<hi>Rising again</hi> are used to express a comfortable and
prosperous Condition.</p>
                     <p>So that one would a little wonder how it comes
to pass that some Writers, who have made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the future State of the Christian Church,
take this Place in the <hi>Revelation</hi> in a <hi>Literal</hi> Sense, and
perswade themselves that it speaks of a Bodily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the Saints, when it may so convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be taken in a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> and <hi>Mystical</hi> Sence; nay,
when they themselves at other Times are so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with this latter.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Cressener.</note> One of them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that the <hi>killing of the Witnesses,</hi> Rev. 11. 7.
and <hi>their Bodies lying dead,</hi> is not meant of a Literal
Death, and with great Diligence he labours to prove
it, and indeed performs that task very laudably;
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:65397:340"/>
and in many other Places in this Book he flies to a
<hi>Mystical</hi> Meaning. Why then may not <hi>the Living,</hi>
or <hi>Living again of the Saints,</hi> be understood here in
the same manner? The<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Burnet.</note> other is known to be a
great Asserter of an Improper and Figurative Sence
in Scripture. But see the Unhappiness of his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it; he that expounds the Third Chapter of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis</hi>
(which is a plain downright <hi>History</hi>) in a
<hi>Mystical</hi> and <hi>Allegorical</hi> way, to the enervating of a
great part of Revealed Religion, interprets this
Passage in the <hi>Revelation</hi> (where <hi>Mysteries</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>
are so common) in a <hi>Literal</hi> Sence. But I think
I have shew'd from the Tenour of this Place,
that a Real, Corporeal Resurrection, <hi>i. e.</hi> a retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of departed Souls into their Bodies again, is
not here meant; but that a Political or Civil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
is the Thing here spoken of; that is, the
Christian Church, after its great Troubles and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
shall revive, shall as it were rise out of
its Grave; and (as the Excellent Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
Paraphrases on the Place) there shall be such an
universal Profession of Christianity, as if all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
good Christians had been alive again, and
were come upon the Stage of this World once more.
Or the Reader may make use of the Apostle's Words
in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. to explain this Place in the <hi>Revelation;</hi>
for as <hi>Christ</hi> is said <hi>to be crucified among the Galatians,
i. e.</hi> they had been so clearly and fully taught and
instructed in the Nature of Christ's Sufferings, as if
Christ himself had been crucified in their Sight: So
in a resembling sort, the <hi>SAINTS</hi> are said <hi>to live
again, i. e.</hi> their holy Lives and Actions (whence
they are denominated <hi>Saints</hi>) are as evidently and
completely copied out in the Persons then upon
<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                           <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>

                        <pb n="664" facs="tcp:65397:341"/>
a kind of a Resurrection. <hi>On such the second Death
bath no Power; i. e.</hi> those who have the Honour to
be reserved to that excellent State of the Church,
which is called <hi>Reigning with Christ,</hi> being Holy and
Righteous Persons, they shall be rescued from the
<hi>second Death,</hi> which is no other than Everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
For as there is a Twofold <hi>Resurrection,</hi> as
hath been said, so in the same way of Allusion there
is a Twofold <hi>Death;</hi> a Death of Temporal, and a
Death of Eternal Destruction. This latter is called
the <hi>second Death,</hi> because it comes after the other,
and is a great deal more terrible than it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be free'd from this, is the greatest Mercy
imaginable: And this is that which all those who
live under the <hi>Heighth of the Evangelical Dispensation</hi>
shall be rescued from. At the end of those Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years, when the Books shall be opened, and
the Dead shall be judged out of them, they shall
escape everlasting Death and Damnation; and they
shall pass from Earth to Heaven, from the happy
State of the Church here, to endless Blessedness in
the Mansions above.</p>
                     <p>The short then of all is this, That <hi>the Living and
Reigning of the Saints with Christ,</hi> which is foretold in
this Chapter, is to be understood of the <hi>most Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
and Flourishing State of the Church of Christ here
on Earth,</hi> which is the Thing that I have undertaken
to prove and illustrate. Indeed it is not expresly
said, that this Reign shall be <hi>on Earth,</hi> but we may
most rationally infer as much from this Chapter.
The Angel who was to bind Satan <hi>came down from
Heaven,</hi> ver. 1. therefore the Scene of these Things
spoken of in this Chapter, was to be here below.
Afterwards, ver. 3. it is said that Satan was shut up,
<hi>that he might deceive the Nations no more.</hi> Now none
can deny but that these <hi>Nations</hi> were <hi>on Earth.</hi> And
in ver. 9. it is said of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> That <hi>they
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:65397:341"/>
went up on the Breadth of the Earth, and compassed the
Camp of the Saints about:</hi> The Saints then are <hi>upon
the Earth,</hi> as well as <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
yet further, from what follows in the same
Verse, <hi>Fire came down from God out of Heaven, and
devoured them.</hi> Therefore neither they, nor the
Saints, were then in Heaven, but on Earth, else the
Fire could not be said to come down from Heaven
upon the latter. It is out of question then, that
this Reigning of the Saints with Christ, is meant
of that happy Administration of the Church here
on Earth. Though the common Doctrine of the
<hi>Millennaries, viz.</hi> of the Saints and Martyrs leaving
Heaven, and coming down to Reign on Earth; and
so likewise of the Personal Reign of Christ with
them be a groundless Fancy, and built neither on
<hi>Reason</hi> nor <hi>Scripture;</hi> yet I have in some good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
shew'd, that <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>is</hi> which I am now speaking of,
is founded on Both. The former dictates to us,
that there shall be a more perfect State of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
than ever yet hath been; and the latter, in
several Places, speaks of this higher Degree of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
Though Christ will not come in Person,
yet he will come in the Spirit, to renew his Church,
and to exalt it to a greater Measure of Holiness and
Purity: And there shall then be such a joyful, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Season, as never was before, and never will be
again upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>It remains now that I speak particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
of the <hi>Duration</hi> of this Spiritual Reign. It
shall last a <hi>Thousand Years,</hi> which<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Augustin contr. Manich. l. 1. c. 24. Aquinas Sum. quaest. 77. art. 1.</note> some have thought

no more than the long Time of the Churches
Prosperity. St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> who takes the Thousand
Years in this Indefinite manner, holds, that they
began either at Christ's Birth, or his Passion, and last
to the Worlds end, or till a little before it, when
<hi>Antichrist</hi> is to come, and appear in the World.
Others say, they commence at Christ's Death, and
that as the Saints are said to Reign, so the Devil is
bound a <hi>Thousand Years, i. e.</hi> all the Time from
Christ's Passion to the Consummation of all Things,
excepting only that little Time when he is Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
But these are very extravagant Assertions,
and no considerate Men have undertaken to make
them good. Why therefore should I undertake to
confute them? I will only say this, to baffle their
Notion who take these Thousand Years Indefinitely,
that first it is <hi>expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y</hi> asserted in this Chapter, that
the Godly <hi>shall Reign a Thousand Years,</hi> and that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
shall be bound</hi> just so many Years, (which indeed
are but the same Time.) Again, The <hi>Thousand
Years</hi> are repeated no less than Six-times by St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
here, which clearly makes against and Indefinite and
Uncertain Number. Unless a Certain, Determinate
Portion of Years were here meant, this Definite
and Precise Number would not have been reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so often. For this reason both the Ancient and
Modern Expositors of this Chapter universally agree,
that the <hi>Thousand Years</hi> here are to be taken in the
most obvious and Proper Sence, <hi>viz.</hi> for that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
Determinate Number.</p>
                     <p>But then, there is a great Disagreement about
the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>Ending</hi> of these <hi>Thousand Years</hi>
                        <pb n="667" facs="tcp:65397:342"/>
thus precisely taken. Some say they began at Christ's
Nativity, and lasted till <hi>Pope Silvester the Second,</hi>
which was about a Thousand Years after; for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and all Superstitious Rights in the Church
broke out, and manifestly appeared under him first
of all. So our <hi>Wickliff</hi> and <hi>Bilney,</hi> and <hi>Aretius</hi> a
Foreigner thought. But others, as <hi>Bede, Primasius,
Pererius,</hi> fix the Date at Christ's Passion. Others
hold the Thousand Years began at the Preaching of
the Gospel, or about the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and ended when Popery first began Eminently to
prevail, which was, they say, about the Year of
Christ 1073. when <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> i. e. <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Seventh invaded the Chair; then Satan also was
loosed. This is Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>'s Opinion, as it was
also of our <hi>Broughton</hi> and <hi>Vsher,</hi> and of <hi>Pareus</hi> and
<hi>Iunius</hi> abroad. But surely it is harsh to say that
the Devil was <hi>bound</hi> all the time of the <hi>Ten Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
when he had Power given him to stir up those
Bloody Emperours and Tyrants to commit such
Outrages against the Innocent Christians: This is
sufficient to confute that Opinion. Therefore <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
hold the Thousand Years began under <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
the Great,</hi> when coming to the Empire he caused
the Persecutions to cease, and set up Christianity as
the Religion of the Empire, which was about the
Year of our Lord 310. and they ended at the rise
of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>the Papacy of
<hi>Boniface the Eight,</hi> who made the Sanguinary Laws
against the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> which was
about the Year 1300. Thus thought those Great
Men <hi>Willet, Forbes, Napier, Grotius, Hammond.</hi>
And <hi>Brightman</hi> likewise seems to hold that the
Reigning of the Saints, and the Binding of Satan
were from <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Fourteenth Century of therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="668" facs="tcp:65397:343"/>
But this could not be the time of the <hi>Saints Reign,</hi>
for we read in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. That the <hi>Woman,</hi> viz. the
Church, <hi>as soon as she should be delivered was to be in the
Wilderness</hi> (a State of Distress) how then could she
<hi>Reign,</hi> which denotes her Prosperity? And she was
to be in this State for the space of 1260. Days, <hi>i. e.</hi>
Years. This began according to Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> from
the time that <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> was taken up to
Heaven, for he is <hi>the Manchild caught up to God,</hi> v. 5.
and to him the Context referreth. Now reckon
from the Death of that Emperour, which was
A. D. 337. till the time that the 1260. Years are
expired, and you will find that the Thousand Years
ended later than he had set them, for instead of
ending in 1300. they could not according to this
Computation have their Period till the Year of
Christ 1597. Here you see one Prophecy of the
Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is so interpreted as to thwart
another, which is an Argument that his Calculation
is not right. And indeed what Considerate Person
can believe that the <hi>Thousand Years</hi> of Christ's Reign
and of Satan's Imprisonment are part? There hath
been nothing yet that hath look'd like it. When
was Satan so <hi>bound that he seduced not the Nations?</hi>
Or when was he <hi>loosed</hi> again, so that we may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the palpable difference between either? Do
we not know that when the Ten noted Persecutions
were expired, yet others were raised against the
Servants of God in this Period? And all this time
either Old Heresies were revived or New ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
Therefore I infer that the time of the
Thousand Years is not yet come, when <hi>the Angel is
to cast Satan into the Bottomless Pit, and to shut him up,
and set a Seal upon him, that he should deceive the
Nations no more.</hi> And as for <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> who
were to appear soon after Satans being loosed, where
are they at this time? If by those are meant th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="669" facs="tcp:65397:343"/>
                        <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Turk,</hi> then they make the date of <hi>Popery</hi> and
<hi>Turcism</hi> to be before Satans loosing, and the expiring
of the Thousand Years of the Saints Reign, which
is an Absurdity which they would willingly avoid.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> hath an odd fancy of his own, that
though the Reigning of the Saints a Thousand
Years be their Reigning all the Thousand Years
in which the Devil was bound (<hi>i. e.</hi> from
<hi>Constantine the Great</hi> to the Year 1300.) yet there
is <hi>another Reigning a Thousand Years,</hi> viz. from the
Year 1300. till a Thousand Years after that be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.
But if there be any good ground for this,
it is in this 20th. Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where
the Thousand Years of Christ's Reign are spoken of
expresly, and no where else. But here it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
that the <hi>Reigning</hi> and the <hi>Binding</hi> are in the
same Thousand Years, for it is said <hi>v. 7. When the
Thousand Years</hi> (viz. of <hi>Christ's Reign,</hi> expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
in the verse immediately before) <hi>are expired,
Satan shall be loose out of his Prison.</hi> Therefore the
Reigning of Christ and the Binding of Satan shall
both expire together, which proves also that they
both began together, the same Thousand Years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
both. The Opinion then of Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi>
and others, that the Thousand Years, of Christ's
Reign are past, hath no Foundation at all, but is a
mere imaginary and precarious Assertion. And yet
this Assertion was taken up and believed by very
Learned and Pious Men; the cause of which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
to be this, they were prejudic'd against the
Doctrine of the <hi>Old Millennaries,</hi> and look'd upon
it (and that justly) as a Groundless and Scandalous
Opinion, and thereupon were willing to resolve the
Thousand Years into some past Time rather than
into any that is to come, and thereby quash'd that
fond conceit of a <hi>Personal Reign.</hi> This was an ill
method they took, but their great dislike of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:65397:344"/>
Opinion occasion'd it, and therefore they are
on that account excusable. But if they had rejected
what is amiss in the Doctrine of the <hi>Chiliasts,</hi> and
had retain'd what is true in the General, <hi>viz.</hi> that
there shall be a Future State of the Christian Church
which shall be every ways better than its former
one, they had taken the right Course, and had asserted
a Truth which is founded on the Sacred Scriptures.
Thence any Unprejudiced Person may inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that the Thousand Years are so far from being
past (as some have thought) that they are not yet
come.</p>
                     <p>Only to assure us before hand that there shall be
such a thing, the Christian World hath had some
foretasts of it already. I cannot positively say with
<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. More. Mr. Cradock,</note> some, that the Thousand Years began at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
and that <hi>Luther</hi> was the <hi>Angel</hi> that had
the Key of the Bottomless Pit, and bound the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
I cannot fix the beginning just here, because
<hi>Wickliff, Ierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Huss,</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
others before <hi>Luther,</hi> did something of this Nature;
they in some measure restrain'd Satans Power and
Jurisdiction by Converting many Persons from the
Papal Impieties. So that if we say <hi>Babylon</hi> began
to Fall in those Times, and mean no other than this,
that those forenamed Worthies made way for
it, I grant the Assertion to be true; but it is to be
remember'd that I am not now treating of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives
and Forerunners of the Blessed <hi>Millennum,</hi>
but of that Determinate State and Time it self. I
grant that at the <hi>Reformation the Souls of those that
were Beheaded for the Witness of Iesus, and for the Word
of God</hi> might truly be said to <hi>Live,</hi> they were as it
were <hi>raised from the Dead.</hi> When <hi>Luther</hi> and the rest
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:65397:344"/>
of God's Faithful Servants appeared, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in Restoring and Reforming Religion, the Holy
Apostles and Martyrs, and all the Primitive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of the True Faith were then as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
and came upon the Earth again. This is a
Forerunner and Pledge of that which is call'd the
<hi>First Resurrection,</hi> this is a Previous assurance of the
<hi>Millennary Reign</hi> or Christ here on Earth, in that
Sence which I have before explain'd.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Mede's</hi> Conceit that the Thousand Years of
Christ's Reign shall not begin till the <hi>Day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is not worthy of so Learned a Person, and is
confuted from what you Read in this Chapter so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
made use of, where the<note n="*" place="bottom">Verse 8, 9.</note> Battel of <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog,</hi> and their Defeat are mentioned. Who
doubts that these Enemies of Christ, and of his
Servants, shall be subdued before the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
And if so, then Christ's Reign (all which
time his Enemies are subdued and disappear) and
the Last Judgment cannot be the same. I may add,
that according to Mr. <hi>Mede's</hi> Opinion the Day of
Judgment shall be before the General Resurrection,
which will hardly be allowed by any thinking Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
And in this very Chapter you will find that
this latter hath the Priority of the other, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13.
And 'tis no other than what the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> asserts
in 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 28. He shall deliver up the Kingdom to
his Father,</hi> viz. <hi>after the Resurr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ction,</hi> which he had
been speaking of all along before. How then can
he be said to come, and Reign on Earth, after he
hath delivered up the Kingdom? But yet we may
understand this Writer in the fairest Sence (and so
we ought to do all Authors) and then his Opinion
is not to be disliked; for, largely speaking, the
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:65397:345"/>
erecting of Christ's Kingdom in the 1000. <hi>Years
Reign</hi> may be call'd <hi>the beginning of the Last Iudgment,</hi>
and it is represented so in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9, 13, 22, 26.
For with the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ on Earth there is
as it were a <hi>Iudicature</hi> set up, and Sentence passes
according to the different Qualities of the Persons
that are found at that time. The Enemies of God
and Religion shall then be openly animadverted
upon, but the true Worshippers of <hi>Iesus,</hi> all the
Sincere Professors of Christianity shall be Favour'd,
Advanced, Rewarded. Thus the <hi>Millennary Reign,</hi>
and the <hi>General Iudgment</hi> are Contemporary, or at
least we may suppose some part of the Thousand
Years Reign to be included in the General Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thus it is if we take it in the Latitude (as
Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> seems to do) but is cannot strictly be
reckon'd as part of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> for this Chapter
expresly tells us that it shall be after is, <hi>I saw a great
White Throne, and him that sat on it, and I saw the
Dead, Small and Great, stand before God, and the Books
were open'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v. 11. 12.</hi> There is no reason then
to defer the <hi>Reign of Christ</hi> to that Time: But it is
more agreeable to Reason and Revelation to assert
that it is not very far off, that the Time is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
when this <hi>Millennary State</hi> shall Commence,
when there shall be a greater Progress on the Gospel
than ever yet hath been, when the Church shall be
wonderfully Advanced, and Christianity shall arrive
to its Maturity and Perfection. <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> shall
not visibly come in Person (as some have fondly
imagined) but he shall come and Reign in the Spirit,
he shall Rectifie the Disorders that have been in the
Christian World; he shall throw down all False
Worship, and establish the True, and he shall raise
the Christian Dispensation to its utmost Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

of Antichrist, i. e. Papists and Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans.
This proved from several Passages in
Scripture. How the Papal Antichrist shall be
destroy'd by the Spirit of God's Mouth. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Attendant of the Reign of Christ upon
Earth, is the Conversion or Fulness of the
Gentiles. An Objection answered. A two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Calling, or Conversion, of the Gentiles, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and Total. The Parable in Luk. 14. speaks
of this latter. The Occasion and Manner of
this Conversion. The Progress of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
hath imitated the Motion of the Sun. The
like is observable of Religion. The General
Conversion of the Jews, is a third Concomitant
of the Reign of Christ. Whether the Jews shall be
fixed in their own Countrey again. The Author's
Iudgment concerning the Texts of Scripture,
which are alledged to prove the National Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Return of the Jews. Lev. 26. 38,
39, &amp;c. is meant of the General Return of that
People. In Deut. 30. 1, &amp;c. there is a Primary
and a Secondary meaning. The latter applied
to the Ten Tribes. The future Restauration
of the Jews proved, from Isa. 11. 11. from
Isa. 60. from Hos. 3. 4, 5. from Amos 9. 14.
from Zech. 12. 10, &amp;c. from Luk. 2. 30, 31. from

consider'd, and shew'd to be Arguments
for the Complete Conversion of the Jews. The

BUT to pass from these Generals to a <hi>Particular

this Glorious State of Christ's Church, which shall
be before the Consummation of all Things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
in it these Things. 1. The Destruction of
Antichrist. 2. The Fulness of the Gentiles. 3. The
Calling of the Jews. 4. Universal Righteousness.
5. Universal Peace. These are the Five Things which

                     </p>
                     <p>I. I begin with the <hi>Destruction of Antichrist:</hi> For
that (it is probable) is the first Thing which will
be effected when the <hi>Thousand Years</hi> begin. By <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi>
I mean the Church and Polity of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the Impostures of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The latter is the
<hi>Eastern,</hi> and the former is the <hi>Western Antichrist.</hi>
For as the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was made up of the <hi>Western</hi>
and <hi>Eastern</hi> Dominions; so proportionably <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
or the <hi>Antichristian Power,</hi> (signally so styled)
which was to succeed in the room of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
consists of both these Great Powers; <hi>viz.</hi>
The <hi>Papacy</hi> in the West, and the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
in the East. It is well known that both
these had their Rise together, and it is probable
they shall fall together. To speak of the latter first;
<hi>Mahometism</hi> hath been in the World above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years, but it must in due time have its Period;
the <hi>Cross</hi> shall triumph over the <hi>Crescent.</hi> If it be

That according to my Apprehension, (leaving every

Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> plainly foretel the <hi>Saracens</hi> and

to join with me in this Perswasion, That this

(the right <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>) with their Adherents,
shall endeavour by all means to oppose it; and in
order to that, shall appear with a mighty Force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the People of God, <hi>viz.</hi> against the <hi>Iews;</hi> who
at that time shall be looking towards the <hi>Messias,</hi>
and shall be ready to own <hi>Iesus</hi> to be that Person,
and against the Faithful <hi>Christians,</hi> who shall then
expect his Reign. And here the final Overthrow,
and Slaughter of these Adversaries of the Church,
are plainly foretold, and particularly described,
with which is immediately join'd the<note n="†" place="bottom">Chap 39. v. 27, 28.</note>

<hi>Syrian</hi> Armies which plagued the <hi>Iews,</hi> of which
the Books of <hi>Maccabees</hi> give us a particular Account.
I reply, That though we grant this, yet those
who I have named may be meant here also: For I
have in another Place proved, that there is a

we not think, That that Vile Miscreant, who glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the Title of <hi>Prophet,</hi> and is signally so styled,
by those that adhere to his Principles and Laws,
wherewith he hath bewitched so great a part of the
World; shall we not think, I say, that that Grand
Impostor is concern'd? Can we imagine, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:65397:347"/>
that the Vengeance of God, which is threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against <hi>Seducers,</hi> and <hi>False Teachers,</hi> reaches not to
him? And when we consider what a great deal of
Mischief this <hi>Mahometan Sect</hi> hath wrought in the
World, and what vast Regions of the Earth it hath
possessed, we shall easily be inclined to believe, that
when <hi>Christ's Kingdom</hi> is set up, and <hi>Christianity</hi> is
come to its Perfection, the World shall be cleared
of this Spreading Pest.</p>
                     <p>As for the Fall of the <hi>Roman Antichrist,</hi> it is in
express Words foretold in many Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Out of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> I will mention only
that Famous Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> concerning the <hi>Fall
of Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Reign of Christ,</hi> (for both these go
together;) <hi>7. Dan. 19, 20, &amp;c.</hi> to the end of the
Chapter. I have else-where commented upon it, but
now I shall only make use only of that part of it which
is to our present Purpose. How natural is the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the <hi>other Horn, which arises out of the Fourth
Beast; i. e.</hi> the <hi>Fourth Kingdom,</hi> or Empire, <hi>upon
Earth,</hi> appliable to <hi>Papal Rome?</hi> For it is said, <hi>It
shall subdue Three Kings; i. e.</hi> the <hi>Greek Emperour,</hi>
whose Jurisdiction reach'd to <hi>Italy;</hi> and the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Lombardy,</hi> and the <hi>German Emperours,</hi> who
had Dominion in <hi>Italy.</hi> It is further said, <hi>This Horn
had a Mouth that spake very great Things,</hi> v. 20. and
more particularly in the 25 v. <hi>He shall speak great
Words against the most High, and shall wear out the
Saints of the most High, and think to change Times and
Laws.</hi> And the same Horn made <hi>war with the
Saints, and prevail'd against them,</hi> v. 21. which by the
most judicious Protestant Writers, is applied to the
<hi>Papacy.</hi> But now hear the Doom of this Great
Speaker and Warrior, <hi>The Iudgment shall sit, and
they shall take away his Dominion, to consume and to
destroy it unto the End: And the Kingdom, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and the Greatness of the Kingdom under the whole
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:65397:348"/>
Heaven, shall be given to the People of the Saints of the
most High, whose Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom,
and all Dominions shall serve and obey him;</hi> v. 26, 27.
Which is answerable to what was said in v. 14. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Coming,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of the Son
of Man; i. e. Christ,</hi> who frequently styles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so.</p>
                     <p>If you consider these Things, with many more in
this Chapter, you cannot apply them either to the
<hi>Kingdom of the Seleucidae,</hi> or <hi>Antiochus,</hi> or <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
and his Empire: But you must necessarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, and especially that
which is <hi>Papal;</hi> and you cannot but see that they are
a lively Description of that Bloody Dominion, and
of the Downfal of it, and of the Reign of Christ
which shall immediately succeed it; that is, of the
Flourishing State of the Christian Church, in a more
Glorious Manner than ever. Thus the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and Learned Expositors, who are not Friends to
the <hi>Roman</hi> See, interpret this Prophecy; but none
hath comprised the Sense and Import of it in so few,
but full Words, as that Reverend<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Patrick,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> Answer to the Touchstone, p. 55.</note> Prelate of our
Church: <q>The Seventh Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> saith he,
points at a State of Christ's Church which is not
yet come; and when it doth come, will be with a
Vengeance to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: Whose present
State will be utterly overturn'd, to make way for

Kingdom, which is to be erected when <hi>the
Mystery of God is finished;</hi> Rev. 10. 7. 12. 15. and
that cannot be till <hi>Babylon, i. e. Rome,</hi> be thrown
down; <hi>Rev. 18. 2. 19. 1, 2, 6.</hi> And we are so far
from thinking this Kingdom will be Invisible,
that we believe it will be the most Illustrious
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:65397:348"/>
Appearance that ever was of Christian Truth,
Righteousness, Charity, and Peace among Men.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>New Testament</hi> likewise this is signally fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told:
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was blessed with extraordinary
Revelations concerning future Things, acquaints us,
That the <hi>Reign of Christ,</hi> which he calls his <hi>Coming,</hi>
shall begin with the Ruin and Desolation of <hi>the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi>
of <hi>Rome;</hi> for every unprejudiced and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Man must confess, that the Second Chapter of
the Second Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> speaks of Him;
and <hi>that the Man of Sin,</hi> and <hi>that wicked One, whom the
Lord will consume and destroy,</hi> is no other than He.
It is very strange to see how <hi>Grotius</hi> bestirs himself,
and uses all Artifices imaginable, to perswade the
Reader that the <hi>Papal Power</hi> is not meant here. He
is forced to say, that this <hi>Second Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians</hi>
was writ before the <hi>First,</hi> and several such
Incongruities he runs himself into, to maintain his
Assertion: Whenas the very <hi>Character</hi> here given
of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> viz. that <hi>he sits in the Temple of
God,</hi> and <hi>exalts himself above all that is called God,</hi> &amp;c.
plainly shews to whom it belongs. And that <hi>the
Brightness of Christ's coming,</hi> whereby this <hi>Son of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
shall be <hi>consumed,</hi> is not meant of Christ's last
Coming to Judgment, but of his Coming to Reign
upon Earth, will appear from what I shall presently
add.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was honoured with abundant Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
from Heaven, concerning the Things which
were to come to pass afterwards in the Christian
Church, in a most graphical and lively Manner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
to us in Two whole Chapters, (the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
and Nineteenth of the Book of the <hi>Revelation)
the Fall</hi> of this Spiritual <hi>Baby lon,</hi> and the <hi>Saints Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
and Triumphing,</hi> because of the Vengeance of
God upon her: And then immediately, in the next
Chapter, he proceeds to speak of the <hi>Binding of
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:65397:349"/>
Satan,</hi> and the <hi>Reign of the Saints a Thousand Years.</hi>
In which Chapters, though, it is true, the exact
Order of the Time is not observed, (as in the
Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

must not always insist upon <hi>Prius &amp; Post<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ius</hi> here;)
yet this is plainly signified to us, that there is a
<hi>Connexion</hi> between these Two, the Reign of <hi>Christ,</hi>
and the Fall of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and that the one most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
goes along with the other. But exactly
speaking; the Overthrow of <hi>Babylon</hi> is part of
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Reigning, or, you may call it, an Effect of
it: For when he Reigneth, he will subdue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
this Greatest Enemy of his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>If we enquire, How he shall be destroy'd, both
St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> will satisfy us. The former
tells us, That he shall be consumed <hi>by the Spirit of
God's Mouth,</hi> 2 Thes. 2. 8. Which may signify some
immediate way of God's blasting him. God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
shall fight against him with<note n="*" place="bottom">2. Rev. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>the Sword of his
Mouth.</hi> 
                        <q>The Pope shall be destroyed, saith<note n="†" place="bottom">Colloq. Mens. cap. 23.</note> 
                           <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
without Hands. As he began, so he shall
end: He set up at first not by Power, and in the like
manner he shall be cast down. That Prophecy in
8. <hi>Dan. 25.</hi> concerning <hi>Antiochus, [He shall be broken
without Hand]</hi> shall be fulfilled of the Pope. And
again he saith, When God speaketh but a Word,
and saith, <hi>Rome</hi> be destroy'd; <hi>Sir Pope,</hi> come down
from your Throne; it shall be accomplished im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</q>
The Phrase here used may denote the
Easiness, and Suddenness of the Fall of the <hi>Papal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist:</hi>
It shall be, as it were, <hi>with a Word of God's
Mouth.</hi> Or, <hi>the Spirit of God's Mouth,</hi> may signify
the Preaching of the Gospel. This shall be made
the great Instrument of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Fall. As the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

the Church which is to come.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Rome</hi> shall not Fall by <hi>God's Word</hi> only: The
ensuing Texts of Scripture will bring you to this
Perswasion, that her Downfal shall likewise be by
humane Force and Power. <hi>He that killeth with the
Sword, must be killed with the Sword; Rev. 13. 10.
Give her Blood to drink;</hi> Ch. 16. v. 6. <hi>They shall make
the Whore desolate, and naked; and they shall Eat her
Flesh, and burn her with Fire;</hi> Ch. 17. v. 16. All
which signify the use of Violent Means. And more
fully yet, in Ch. 18. v. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Reward her even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

she rewarded you, and double unto her double, according
to her Works; in the Cup which she hath filled</hi> (which
was a Cup of Blood) <hi>fill to her Double. How much
she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much
torment and sorrow give her; for she saith in her Heart,
I sit a Queen, and am no Widow, and shall see no sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Therefore shall her Plagues come in one Day,
Death, and Mourning, and Famine; and she shall be
utterly burnt with Fire.</hi> Perhaps this last Expression
may intimate, that the <hi>Papists</hi> shall fall out among
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:65397:350"/>
themselves, that they shall dissent from one another,
that they shall contribute towards their Ruin, by
their own intestine Quarrels and Combustions; for
these are signified by <hi>Fire,</hi> not only in <hi>Luke 12. 49.</hi>
but in several other Places. But there must be
some <hi>Fighting</hi> on both Sides, <hi>Rome</hi> and its Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
as I conceive. This seems to me very plain,
out of <hi>Rev. 19. 19, 20, 21.</hi> where there are <hi>Two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
and a formal pitch'd <hi>Battle,</hi> and a <hi>Victory</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
upon it. To take it wholly in a Spiritual
Sense is very harsh, and disagreeable to what we
meet with in this, and other Chapters of this Book;
where there are several Passages which seem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us, That this Bloody <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall Fall by
the Hand and Force of Man (as well as by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Curse of God, and the Preaching of the
Gospel, of which I spoke before.) We are told
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> brake through the <hi>Alpes</hi> with Fire
and Vinegar, when he was on his march towards
<hi>Rome.</hi> It is probable that those Warriors and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,
whom God will stir up to make their way
thither, will use a resembling Method; that they
will ingage in very Hot and Sharp Service, and
with the utmost Force and Violence incounter all
Impediments which stand in their way. And as the
Old <hi>Romans,</hi> in great Streights of the Commonwealth,
created a Dictator, an <hi>extempore</hi> Monarch, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
so, it may be, the Person to do this great
Thing shall be of that sort; he shall be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
chosen out, and set up by Providence, on
purpose for this emergent Business. And who
knows, but that he may be a <hi>Dictator</hi> as it were
<hi>from the Plough; i. e.</hi> a Person taken from more
Private and Low Employments, to move and act in
this High and Publick Sphere? But I need not be
Inquisitive and Solicitous about the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>'s

Downfal, since we have so good Assurance of the

                     <p>II. The <hi>Conversion</hi> or <hi>Fulness of the Gentiles,</hi> is
another Attendant of the Reign of Christ upon

                        <hi>Fulness of the Gentiles;</hi>
Gen. 48. 19. For
the Word <hi>Gojim,</hi> is most properly applied to the

Now when it was foretold, that <hi>Ephraim's

is, that from <hi>Ephraim</hi> shall proceed Innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

the Times of the Gospel, this last Time especially;
<hi>They shall all have one Shepherd,</hi> Ezek. 37. 24. they
shall be united into one Body, under one and the
same Head. And it may be, that which he saith
to the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> is to be interpreted of
This; <hi>He that overcometh, and keepeth my Works unto
the end, to him will I give Power over the Nations:
— and I will give him the Morning-Star.</hi> Rev. 2. 26,
28. The most Easy and Natural Sense of which
Words is this, That he that is Faithful to the end,
shall be honoured with the Conversion of <hi>Eastern</hi>
Nations; I will give him those <hi>Heathen</hi> People where
the <hi>Morning-Star</hi> ariseth; I will give him the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Those, as the Reward of his Faithfulness.
A Future Calling of the <hi>Pagans</hi> may be expected at
length, as the Recompence of <hi>Overcoming,</hi> and of
<hi>Keeping my Works unto the end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But supposing, say some, that this, and other
Texts of Scripture before mention'd, speak of the
<hi>Conversion of the Gentiles;</hi> yet these Prophecies were
all Fulfill'd in the Days of the Apostles, when they
went out to preach the Gospel to all Nations, and
so they have no reference to that Conversion of the
Gentiles, which I am speaking of. But to this I
answer, That the Prophecies of the Conversion of
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:65397:351"/>
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were not fulfilled in those Times; for
though many <hi>Pagans</hi> were Converted in the Days of
the Apostles, yet that Conversion was not General.
Those Persons who were then Called, were but the
First-fruits of the Whole and Compleat Calling of
the <hi>Pagans</hi> to Christianity, which is to be a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conversion of the <hi>Iews.</hi> To this purpose, the
<hi>Apostle of the Gentiles</hi> is very clear, in Rom. 11. 25, 26. <hi>I
would not, Brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
that Blindness in part is happen'd to Israel, until the
Fulness of the Gentiles be come in; and so all Israel shall be
saved.</hi> The <hi>Blindness of the Iews,</hi> and the <hi>Salvation of
the Gentiles,</hi> are here called by St. <hi>Paul, a Mystery:</hi>
And in this he intimates, that those he wrote to,
did not know and comprehend the Design of God
in this Matter. Wherefore he unfolds this <hi>Mystery,</hi>
this Great Secret of Providence to them, acquainting
them, that God took occasion from this strange
Event, to communicate the Gospel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
and to convert them to the Faith; and then by the
Calling of these, the <hi>Iews</hi> should afterwards be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
to believe, and to accept of the Gospel, and
so they should all be saved. But whether this be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of a <hi>General Conversion</hi> towards the end of the

                     <p>I conceive then, that there is a <hi>Twofold Calling</hi> or
<hi>Conversion of the Gentiles;</hi> a <hi>Partial,</hi> and a <hi>Total</hi> one.
The first was, when the <hi>Iews</hi> were rejected; <hi>viz.</hi>
in the Time of our Saviour, and the Apostles; then
the Gentiles were called in to supply their room.
This is said to be <hi>the Salvation which is come to the
Gentiles,</hi> ver. 11. of this Chapter, and <hi>the Reconciling
of the World,</hi> v. 15. But there is a second Calling of
The Gentiles, and that is named here, <hi>the Fulness of
the Gentiles,</hi> which is something that is Greater and
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:65397:352"/>
Higher than the other, for it denotes a compleat Body
of them. This is set forth in the <hi>Parable of the
Great Supper,</hi> 14. Luke; where the <hi>Iews</hi> were those
that were <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>idden:</hi> But upon their Refusal of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
the Servants are commande <hi>to go into the
Streets, and Lanes of the City, and bring in the Poor,
Maimed, Halt, and Blind:</hi> These are the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
that in the <hi>Apostles</hi> Times, and ever since, have been
converted to the Christian Faith. But after this
is done, it is said, <hi>Yet there is room, viz.</hi> for more
Converts to Christianity; and accordingly the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
is bid to <hi>go out into the High-ways, and Hedges,
and compel them to come in, that the House might be
filled.</hi> Here is a plain Distinction between the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and the <hi>latter Conversion of the Gentiles:</hi> After
the first Invitation and Entertainment <hi>there was more
room;</hi> which intimates, in my Opinion, a future
Calling of them. And they are to be fetched out
of the <hi>High-ways and Hedges,</hi> to shew that though
they be never so Mean and Unworthy, they shall
Partake of this Grace, which shall be so Powerful
and Effectual in those Days, that they shall seem to
be <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>compelled</hi> to come in. And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
is very observable, and much to our present
purpose; they are thus compell'd to come in to
the <hi>Great Supper of the Lord, that his House may be
filled;</hi> that the Church may be Compleated and made
Entire, which it could not be without the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of these Gentiles at last. Many were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before, but now there shall be a General Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of the Faith: All Nations shall come to the
<hi>Messias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And there is another great Difference between
that first Calling, and this; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>General
Calling of the Iews</hi> (which is said to be <hi>their Fulness,</hi>
ver. 12.) shall go along with this <hi>second Calling of
the Gentiles:</hi> For so the Apostle acquaints us, That
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:65397:352"/>
                        <hi>when the Fulness of the Gentiles is come, all Israel shall
be saved; i. e.</hi> all the <hi>Iews</hi> (as well as <hi>Gentiles</hi>) shall
be received into God's Favour. But some think,
that <hi>Israel</hi> is not opposed to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> here, but
signifies the Whole People of God, the Whole <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
of God;</hi> (as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16.)
<hi>i. e.</hi> the Spiritual <hi>Israel,</hi> All Believers, whether Jews
or Gentiles. But if not from this place, yet from a
great part of this Chapter, it appears, that after
the <hi>Fulness of the Gentiles</hi> shall follow the <hi>Fulness of</hi> the <hi>Iews:</hi>
For as some of the <hi>Iews,</hi> in the Apostles
Times, were blinded and harden'd, till they saw
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> imbrace the Gospel, and then they were
provoked by their Example to come in; so shall it
be at their Last and General Conversion, of which
I am next to speak.</p>
                     <p>But first I will add a few Words concerning
the <hi>Occasion</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of the Gentiles Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
so far as I can guess. When the Impostures
of <hi>Rome</hi> are exploded by the Christian World, and
her pernicious Doctrines and Practices are loathed
by them; and when the Dominion and Tyranny of
<hi>Rome</hi> are laid in the Dust, and that by some strange
and amazing Acts of Divine Providence, which shall
be known to all the Inhabitants of the Earth; we
may easily conceive, that then the Gospel will
have its free Course, and God will stir up some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to preach it in the remotest Country, where
<hi>Paganism</hi> hath prevail'd; and that the Tidings
which have come to their Ears, concerning the Fall
of the <hi>Roman Babylon,</hi> will in some measure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them to receive the more welcome Message of
the Gospel, and to imbrace the Christian Faith,
which they have either been wholly Strangers to,
or which they have wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ully refused.</p>
                     <p>This is to be said also, That the Lives of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
will at this Time be very Exemplary, which
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:65397:353"/>
will be very serviceable for the promoting of the
Gospel among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Nothing hath hinder'd
the Propagation of Christianity in the World, so
much, as the wicked Conversations of Christians.
The Story is known of the <hi>American,</hi> who said he
would chuse rather to go to Hell, than live in Heaven
with the Cruel and Bloody <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Some of the
<hi>Indians,</hi> shewing a piece of Gold, have said, Lo here
is the Christians God! And their Faithlessness, as
well as Avarice, hath been objected to them by
the <hi>Pagans</hi> whom they tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ick with. It is no
wonder then that Infidels imbrace not the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, when its Professors are so scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in their Practices. But the Case will be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in those happy Times which I am discoursing
of; the Lives of Christians will be answerable to
their Professions; they will commend their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by the Strictness and Circumspectness of their
Walking; which, when <hi>Pagans</hi> observe, they will
be incited to think well of their Ways, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to Admire and Love, and at last to Imitate
and Practise that Religion, which hath so great
Command and Authority over Mens Minds and
Manners. Nor shall there be <hi>Signs,</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi>
and <hi>mighty Miracles</hi> wanting, if there be occasion
for them; if that be the most proper Method to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
some stubborn Infidels, and to bring them to
a hearty Confession and Acknowledgment of the
Truth: Though these (as I have suggested before)
are not properly of <hi>this Dispensation,</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shall be soon laid aside.</p>
                     <p>Where this Work shall first have its Beginning,
and in what Order this Great Conversion of the
Gentiles shall proceed, is difficult to assign: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will only submissively offer my Conjecture.
It hath been the Observation of some Learned Men,
that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Arts and Sciences have imitated the Motion
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:65397:353"/>
of the Sun. Learning set out first with <hi>Adam</hi> in
the <hi>East:</hi> He had his Philosophy from God, and
by virtue of That gave fit Names to all Creatures.
He communicated his Knowledge to those Eastern
Countries of <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Chaldaea;</hi> whence it came
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi> was skill'd in all the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that Time. He, it is Probable, left his
Skill among some of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and so it tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
into <hi>Canaan,</hi> where <hi>Solomon</hi> was Famous for
this Learning, and with great Success propagated
it among the <hi>Iews.</hi> From the <hi>Chaldaeans, Egyptians,</hi>
and <hi>Iews,</hi> it found its way to <hi>Greece;</hi> where it was
first entertain'd by <hi>Musaeus, Orpheus, Pythagoras;</hi> then
<hi>Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,</hi> &amp;c. And here, by the bye,
we may remember, That the most Inquisitive Men
among the <hi>Graecians,</hi> as <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Solon,</hi> and
others, who proved Great Sages, travelled into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and other <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries, to bring home
with them their profitable Arts and Sciences. Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
past from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> and so to <hi>Rome;</hi> for
with the <hi>Graecian</hi> Empire their Arts also were
transported to <hi>Rome,</hi> and she dispersed them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
by her Victorious Arms. Passing from <hi>Italy</hi>
they climbed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and visited <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> whence we <hi>Britains,</hi> and others, fetched
them over. Thus Learning followed the Course of
the Sun, (an Intimation of which seems to be in
the Poets, when they made <hi>Phoebus</hi> the God of <hi>Light</hi>
and <hi>Learning,</hi>) all humane Arts and Knowledge
were derived down to us from the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts of
the World, where Mankind itself first had its
rise.</p>
                     <p>The like Observation may, in part, be made of
<hi>Religion, viz.</hi> that it imitated the Suns Motion. (I
say, <hi>in part,</hi> for the Progress of <hi>Religion</hi> doth not
exactly answer to that of Learning and Philosophy.)
It arose first in <hi>Paradise,</hi> in the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>moter Parts of
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:65397:354"/>
the <hi>East:</hi> And <hi>Adam, Seth,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> cherished it
in those Regions. It was preserved in the Ark by
<hi>Noah,</hi> and coming out thence, it was propagated
by him, and his Son <hi>Shem,</hi> but especially by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
the <hi>Chaldaean.</hi> Having thus escaped the Flood,
and liv'd among the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> it sojourned a while
in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and from thence came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> with
<hi>Ioseph</hi> first, and soon after with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the rest
of the <hi>Patriarchs.</hi> From thence it took its way
through the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and so into <hi>Canaan</hi> again;
where it continued a long time under many Vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
till it began to go <hi>Eastward</hi> again; <hi>viz.</hi> in
the Time of the Captivity. But Seventy Years put
and end to that Thraldom, and fetched back the
<hi>True Religion</hi> to go on in its way, its <hi>Western</hi> Road,
that it was in before. Observe especially how when
it began to be <hi>Christian,</hi> (though at <hi>first</hi> it took its
Circuit through the whole World, to inform all
Mankind of its being Arrived; and afterwards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine
the Great</hi> carried it with the <hi>Empire,</hi> and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
it more <hi>Eastward,</hi> yet still) it ran the same
Course with the Sun generally; from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to
<hi>Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ce,</hi> to <hi>Africa,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and so to all <hi>Italy,</hi> to
<hi>Germany, France, Britain, Spain.</hi> Though I do not say,
the Gospel went exactly in this very Order succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
yet we find this to be the Progress of the
Gospel at last: It began in the <hi>East,</hi> and it hath
travelled <hi>Westward.</hi> The <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Sun,</hi> (as
Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> hath observed) have observed the like
Motion.</p>
                     <p>And it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ath crossed the <hi>Western Ocean:</hi> The <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi>
hear of Christ. We have an Essay in those
<hi>Plantations,</hi> to confirm us in the Truth of what is to
come afterwards. The true Gospel hath been prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and is at this Day, in several Places of this
<hi>New-found World.</hi> And though the <hi>Roman</hi> Priests
have planted their Perswasion in many Parts of it,
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:65397:354"/>
with vast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>fusion of Blood; yet <hi>Popery</hi> may make
way for a better Religion afterwards, when the
Gospel shall be spread even to the utmost Parts of
this <hi>Western</hi> Hemisphere, and so in its direct way
step into the <hi>East</hi> again, and visit the <hi>Islands</hi> in the
<hi>Eastern</hi> Seas, and then land on the Continent among
the <hi>Tartars, Indians, Chinoises, Persians,</hi> &amp;c. and so
finish its Circuit, by returning to the Place where
it set out first of all. Thus our Saviour's Words
shall be verified, <hi>The Gospel shall be preached in all the
World, and then shall the End come,</hi> Mat. 24. 14. This
will be a plain Indication that they are come to the
last Period of Time design'd for this World; and
that as soon as this is past, the Day of Judgment is
at hand. Thus much concerning the <hi>Conversion of
the Gentiles;</hi> by whom, I understand the People of
those Nations, and Countries, that have not had the
Knowledge of the True God: And therefore they
are to be distinguished from the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who
are not to be reckon'd in the Body of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
and therefore not be Converted, but Destroy'd.</p>
                     <p>III. <hi>The Conversion of the Iews,</hi> is another Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant
of the perfect State of Christianity. This
being a great Controversy among Divines, Whether
the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be Converted to Christ before the
end of the World; I will Inlarge upon it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to give Satisfaction in the Point. By this
Conversion, we do not mean the Conversion of a
Few, but a Great and Remarkable, a General and
National Conversion of the Jews, before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of all Things. This was the general
Belief of the Ancient Writers of the Church: The
Holy Scripture hath declared, saith<note n="*" place="bottom">In cap. 7. Esai<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> v. 14, 15.</note> Cyril of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,

                        <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and some
others of the
Ancients, hold, that they shall return to the Land
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> upon their imbracing the <hi>Messias,</hi> and
that they shall be fixed there. To prove which,
they quote Jer. 25. 5. <hi>Turn ye every one from his
evil Ways, and dwell in the Land which the Lord hath
given unto you, and to your Fathers for ever and ever.</hi> In the
39 Chap. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> there seems to be foretold not
only the Destruction of the <hi>Turks,</hi> (call'd <hi>Gog</hi>) in
the latter Days, (ver. 1. to 23.) but immediately
after that, the <hi>Return of the Iews</hi> to their own Land,
v. 23. to the end of the Chapter. All the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the Prophecy argue it to be spoken of
this <hi>last Return</hi> from their Captivity, and Dispersion.
Which is further evidenced, from those remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Words in the close of all, v. 29. <hi>I will not hide
my Face any more from them;</hi> which shews, that the
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:65397:355"/>
Prediction can't be meant of their Return under

                        </hi> from their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> because they
have been Captives since, and banished into all Parts
of the World. Whence I conclude, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Promise was never yet accomplished, and
therefore must be. And other Prophecies (which
are very plain) may be alledged out of <hi>Isaia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, Ioel,</hi>

                        </gap>tel that the <hi>Messias</hi> shall
restore the <hi>Israelites</hi> to their own Land. Indeed if
we duly weigh some of those Passages, we cannot
but think it very credible, that these poor Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds
shall recover again the Holy Land, and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
there, after their long Dispersion. Though I
will not designedly concern my self in this Dispute,
yet I think I shall render their <hi>Restauration</hi> extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
probable, whilst I am discoursing of, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the main Thing, which is their <hi>Conversion.</hi>
And that this shall be <hi>National</hi> and <hi>General,</hi> was the
common Opinion of the <hi>Ancients;</hi> and the <hi>Moderns,</hi>
excepting a<note n="*" place="bottom">Grotius, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I deny not, that <hi>some</hi> of the Texts usually cited
out of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> to prove the General Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and return of the Jews before the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are to be understood of the <hi>Temporal Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi>
of that People from the <hi>Captivity,</hi> and their
Returning back to their own Land presently after.
And <hi>other</hi> Texts are meant of the <hi>Spiritual Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
of the Jews, who were Godly and Righteous.
(Some of those Prophecies being to be taken in a
Mystical and Spiritual Sense, <hi>Canaan</hi> being a Type
of the Church.) And there are <hi>some</hi> Places also
which speak of the Conversion of the Jews, which
was to be in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Time, when he chose
his Disciples and Apostles out of the Jewish Nation;

and when afterwards Multitudes of <hi>Iews</hi> submitted

All this I acknowledge; but yet any unprejudiced
Person may take notice of other Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
both in the Old and New Testament, which
point at the General and National Calling of the
Jews, and that towards the end of the World. And
it may be taken notice of further, that some of those
Texts which foretel their Return from <hi>Babylon</hi> to
their own Land, and others which speak of their
turning from Judaism to Christianity, at the first
Propagation of the Gospel, are also to be understood
of this Universal Recalling of them at the first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of the Glorious Kingdom of Christ which
we are discoursing of; for there is a Twofold Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
Meaning of such Passages in the Prophetical
Writings of the Bible; one is Primary and Chiefly
intended, the other Secondary and Included. This
I am throughly perswaded of, from the <hi>Style</hi> and
<hi>Tenour</hi> of Scripture, that there are different Things
spoken of in the same Place and Narrative; diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

                        </gap>rrences are prophesied of at one time. All
other Historical Books have but one Sense and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and no more, because they refer to one Thing
only. But it is not so here. Any observing and
consid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rate Man must needs see this; and it is a
Key to a great part of the Bible.</p>
                     <p>There is an eminent Passage in <hi>Lev. 26.</hi> which I
don't find taken notice of; but, in my Opinion, it
speaks home to the present purpose. God, after
that long Scroll of <hi>Curses</hi> and <hi>Plagues</hi> threatened to
the disobedient <hi>Israelites,</hi> from 15. v. to 40. shuts up
all with a merciful Assurance of their being Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to their own Land at last. Though they <hi>should
perish among the Heathen,</hi> and though <hi>the Land of their
Enemies should eat them up;</hi> and though <hi>they that are
left of them, shall pine away in their Iniquity, in their
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:65397:356"/>
Enemies Lands;</hi> v. 38, 39. Yet <hi>I will remember my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with Iacob, and also my Covenant with Isaac, and
also my Covenant with Abraham will I remember, and I
will remember the Land;</hi> v. 42. He promises to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Covenant made with their Forefathers;
<hi>viz.</hi> that he would give them the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>
for a perpetual Possession. <hi>When they are in the Land
of their Enemies, I will not cast them away, neither
will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break
my Covenant with them, for I am the Lord their God.
But I will for their sakes remember the Covenant of their
Ancestors,</hi> &amp;c. 43, 44, 45, ver. The <hi>Repeating</hi> of these
Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> of their <hi>being in the Land,</hi> and <hi>in the
Lands of their Enemies,</hi> shews, That this refers not
only to the Jews being Captives in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but to
all their <hi>other</hi> Dispersions and Banishments, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
that which is at this time, and hath lasted
many Ages. And so the <hi>Reiterating</hi> of those Words,
<hi>viz.</hi> God's <hi>remembering his Covenant,</hi> plainly refers
to the <hi>continual</hi> performing of his Covenant with
relation to the Restoring of the Jews; not only
when they were Captives in <hi>Assyria,</hi> but when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
they should be banished into other Lands,
as they are at this day; even then God would be
mindful of his Covenant, and bring them back
again. And, to this end, he would enable them <hi>to
confess their Iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. v. 40. This is that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Conversion which we expect; this is
the Promise which remains to be fulfilled, for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
it is not.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is promised in <hi>Deut. 30. 1, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>if
the Israelites,</hi> when they <hi>are driven into other Nations,</hi>
shall <hi>call to mind</hi> those <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Cursings</hi> mention'd
in the Chapter before, and <hi>shall return to the Lord
their God, and obey his Voice, then the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>od will
turn their Captivity, and have Compassion on them, and
will return, and gather them from all the Nations whither
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:65397:357"/>
the Lord God hath scattered them. If any of them
be driven out to the utmost Parts of Heaven, from
thence will the Lord their God gather them, and from
thence will be fetch them: And the Lord their God
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> bring them into the Land which their Fathers pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,
and they shall possess it, and he will do them good,
and multiply them above their Fathers, and the Lord
their God will circumcise their Heart, and the Heart of
their Seed, to love the Lord their God, with all their
Heart, and with all their Soul, that they may live.</hi> In
which Words, without doubt there is that <hi>Primary</hi>
and <hi>Secondry</hi> Meaning, which I spoke of. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is not denied by any, and I will now prove
the latter. That this Promise extends even to the
<hi>Vniversal Calling</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> is clear from these
Things; First, that it is said, they shall be gathered
from all the Nations whither God had scattered them,
<hi>and</hi> if any of them were driven to the utmost Parts of
Heaven, from thence the Lord will fetch them. Now
we know that the <hi>Ten Tribes of Israel,</hi> that
were carried Captive by <hi>Salmanasser</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi>
were removed into the utmost Parts of the World.
<hi>Esdras</hi> tells us, That they went forth into a very far
Country where never Mankind dwelt; (or at least he
thought these Regions were not inhabited before:)
<hi>They were a Year and a half a going to it, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is called Arsareth, or Ararath; then dwelt they
there until the latter Time; i. e.</hi> the Time we are at
present speaking of, 2 Esd. 13. 41, 45. It is likely
this was part of that vast Moiety of the World
which is now called <hi>America.</hi>

a Learned Jew, is perswaded that these <hi>Tribes</hi> were
not only the first Inhabitants of <hi>China,</hi> and some
Parts of <hi>Tartary,</hi> but that they went into the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
                        <pb n="697" facs="tcp:65397:357"/>
However, we are certain that they came ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>her
into these, or some other Countries, that were at
a great distance from <hi>Iudaea;</hi> because if they had
been near it, they would have return'd thither with
the rest of their Captive Brethren, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave
them leave to do so, and (which is more) encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them to it. It is manifest therefore, that they
<hi>were driven to the utmost Parts of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or if we should suppose, that they were not scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
so far, but (as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> thinks) were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to the farthest Parts of <hi>Assyria,</hi> or (as others
have imagined) were dispersed into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other
Parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> or (as some have thought) tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Arabia;</hi> yet still we can say
this, that we no where read of their Return to
their own Land. I do not speak of the coming
back of a Few, (of which we have some Footsteps in
the Sacred History) but of the Return of them in
a Body, or as to a very Considerable Part of them,
of which this Text speaks. We have not one Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
concerning this; and it is certain that if they
had returned, it would have been mentioned.
Therefore I infer hence yet, that this Promise is not
fulfilled. And from this Inference I make another,
<hi>viz.</hi> that it is to be fulfilled hereafter, for none of
God's Promises fall to the Ground. And hence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I gather another, which is this, That if God
will be so favourable to them, as to restore them
at last to the Promis'd Land, it is most probable
that he doth it in order to a Greater Blessing; <hi>viz.</hi>
the turning every one of them from their Sins, and
causing them to imbrace that <hi>Iesus</hi> whom they have
so long despised and rejected. Therefore their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,</hi>
and their <hi>Conversion,</hi> most commonly go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in <hi>Scripture;</hi> and we cannot think that God
would take so much Care of those Out-casts, as to
bring them back to their Own Land, unless he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:65397:358"/>
to extend his Ancient Mercies to them, and
to receive them for his Own People again. And
then observe also it is added, <hi>The Lord will circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their Heart, to love the Lord their God with all their
Heart, and with all their Soul;</hi> which gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that their Conversion shall be <hi>Sincere</hi> and
<hi>Effectual,</hi> which without doubt will be the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of that Great and Catholick Conversion of
the Jews before the end of the World.</p>
                     <p>Next I might produce that Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
Ch. 11. v. 11. <hi>And it shall come to pass in that Day,
that the Lord shall set his Hand again the Second Time,
to recover the Remnant of his People which shall be left,
from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and
Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math,
and from the Islands of the Sea.</hi> It is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to think, that this Recovering of the Jews
<hi>the Second Time,</hi> is, First, Particularly meant of the
Returning of the Posterity of the <hi>Ten Tribes,</hi> who,
upon <hi>Salmanasser</hi>'s invading <hi>Iudaea,</hi> were either ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by him, or fled into strange Countries. There
shall not only be a Return from <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Assyria,</hi>
but from <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>AEthiopia,</hi> and even from the
most distant Regions. Secondly, more Generally
and Comprehensively, it is meant of those Times
of the Gospel, when the Jews, dispersed through
all Countries, shall be restored to their own Land
again, and shall be Converted to the Christian Faith.
This is here called <hi>the Second,</hi> and it is the Last and
most Eminent Time of their Conversion; when they
shall be so Happy likewise, as to have all the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
for their Fellow-Converts, as it follows in the
next Verse of his Chapter: <hi>He shall set up an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
for the Nations, as well as assemble the Outcasts of
Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Iudah, from
the four Corners of the Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="699" facs="tcp:65397:358"/>The <hi>Sixtieth Chapter of Isaiah</hi> treats of this very
Subject, the Glorious Condition of the Church under
the <hi>Messias</hi>'s Reign, when there shall be a <hi>General
Conversion</hi> of <hi>the Iews,</hi> as well as <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
which is most elegantly describ'd by this Lofty and Poetick
Prophet. And the 20th Verse plainly shews, that
whatever is said in this Chapter is to be understood
not of the First Call of the <hi>Iews</hi> which is past, but
of the Second which is to come: For the Words are
these, <hi>Thy Sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy
Moon withdraw it self:</hi> Where is promised the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Grace and Favour of God to this People
without any Interruption; but who sees not that
this is not yet fulfill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, and therefore is not yet
past? <hi>The Sun and Moon have gone down</hi> upon the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Nation; though the Light shone upon them
with great vigour after our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Coming, and
many were converted to Christianity; yet since that
time there hath been a miserable Defection, and
they have for many hundreds of Years been rejected,
and have remained in Darkness, and have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the Divine Favour. But though <hi>the sun
and Moon have withdrawn themselves</hi> since the first
Conversion; yet there is a Time coming when <hi>they
shall no more go down,</hi> for (as it follows) <hi>the Lord
shall be their everlasting Light, and the Days of their
Mourning shall be ended.</hi> Therefore this Place of
Scripture is meant of the future State and Restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this People. In my Apprehension this is a
a very remarkable Text to prove it.</p>
                     <p>And those Words of the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> Ch. 3. v.
4, 5. may well be thought to refer to this Last Calling
of the <hi>Iews: The Children of Israel shall abide many
days without a King, and without a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:65397:359"/>
King, and shall fear the Lord and his Goodness in the
latter days.</hi> We see the former part of the Words
verified: Nothing is more evident than that this
People have been <hi>many days,</hi> and are are at this very
time, <hi>without a King,</hi> &amp;c. they are destitute of a
<hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Governor,</hi> they are debarr'd the Use of
<hi>Sacrifices</hi> which were the main part of their Religion:
But yet they do not erect <hi>Images,</hi> and fall into <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
as they were wont to do. This is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State of this People, which this Text speaks
of, <hi>viz.</hi> that they have neither the <hi>Mosaick</hi> nor <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
Worship,</hi> however the hearts of some of them
may be inclined to this latter: But I do not judge
them. And as for the latter part of the Words,
they shall be verified in due time; <hi>the Children of
Israel shall return</hi> (i. e. <hi>shall be converted</hi> unto the
Lord, as the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast, of Ionathan</hi> renders
it) <hi>and seek the Lord</hi> by Repentance and Faith, <hi>and
David their King,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Messias</hi> (as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd)
by <hi>that</hi> Chaldee <hi>Paraphrast,</hi> and several of the
<hi>Iewish Doctors</hi> on this Place) because the <hi>Messias</hi>
was of the Stock of <hi>David,</hi> and because <hi>Christ</hi> was typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by him; whence he is often called <hi>David</hi> in the

<hi>seeking the Lord,</hi> and owning the <hi>Messias,</hi> shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
under his Thousand years Reign, which
is here call'd <hi>the latter days,</hi> and in other Places sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<hi>the last Days,</hi> before the End of the World.
And it is impossible it should be meant otherwise,
because it is to follow this time of the Jews Exile
in which they are at this day, as we heard confess'd
before by one of their Chiefest Rabbies. But I found
what I say not only on the Concession of this Great
Man among them, but upon the Words themselves
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:65397:359"/>
of the Prophecy, which tells us, that the <hi>Israelites</hi>
shall be without a King or Prince, <hi>many days,</hi> which
in the Stile of Scripture, especially in the Prophetick
Writings, usually signifies <hi>a very great number of
Years,</hi> as in <hi>Isai. 24. 22. 32. 10. Ier. 3. 7. Ezek. 12. 27.
38. 8. Dan. 8. 26. 10. 14.</hi> so that the time of their
Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> whence they return'd as soon
as <hi>70 years</hi> were expired, is not here intended, but
some much <hi>longer space of time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed it could not be the time of their being
Captive there, because that did not immediately
precede <hi>the latter Days,</hi> by which in Scripture
are frequently denoted <hi>the Times of the Messias,</hi>
the last Age of the World; and the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Writers and Commentators themselves freely
grant this. Here it is said <hi>they shall abide ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Days without a King,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>afterwards,</hi> i. e. <hi>in
the latter Days</hi> (as it is explain'd) <hi>they shall return,
and seek the Lord their God, and the Messias:</hi> Which
clearly argues, that the time of acknowledging the
<hi>Messias</hi> shall presently succeed after those <hi>many
days</hi> wherein <hi>they have abode without a King,</hi> &amp;c. This
could not be any part of the time between their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, and Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Flesh, for then they were not without a
<hi>King, Prince,</hi> or <hi>Ruler,</hi> &amp;c. therefore it must be
since, and the Time commenced when <hi>Shilo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>came,</hi> for then <hi>the Sceptre departed from ludah,</hi>
then the <hi>Iews</hi> were left without King or Prince.
<hi>After</hi> this particular Period of Time is ended, the
<hi>Messias</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom</hi> shall be erected in a more illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
manner than ever, and then <hi>the Children of Israel
shall return, and seek the Lord,</hi> and shall have a King
again; they shall embrace that <hi>Messias</hi> whom their
Ancestors crucified, and <hi>they shall fear the Lord and his
Goodness;</hi> they shall, with Reverence and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
acknowledge the exceeding Favour and Grace
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:65397:360"/>
of God to them. This I apprehend to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Import of this Prophecy, and I leave it to the
Reader to judge whether it be not a Proof of the
Grand Point now in hand.</p>
                     <p>I might mention <hi>Amos 9. 14, 15.</hi> with some of the
preceding Verses, which questionless are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of this Kingdom of the Messias which is
yet to come. The Close of the Prophecy plainly
shews that it is meant of this; for 'tis said, <hi>they shall
no more be pulled up out of their Land which I have given
them.</hi> They have been pull'd up out of that Land; that
we are certain of, and they are not yet return'd to
it: But when God shall bring them again to that
Place, <hi>they shall no more be pull'd up:</hi> they shall remain
there 'till the End of the World.</p>
                     <p>I will add that famous Prediction of the Prophet
<hi>Zachariab,</hi> Ch. 12. v. 10, <hi>&amp;c. I will pour upon the House
of David, and upon the Inhabitants of Terusalem, the
Spirit of Grace, and of Supplications; and they shall look
upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn,</hi> &amp;c.
That this Chapter is spoken of the <hi>Tews,</hi> is agreed
upon by all; and that this Portion of it is more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
so, appears from that first thing which is said
of them; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>they shall look upon him whom they
have pierced;</hi> for it refers to <hi>the piercing of our Saviour's
side with a Spear,</hi> John 19. 37. where, upon this
Action, <hi>this Scripture is said to be fulfill'd.</hi> Upon this
Account, their <hi>looking upon Christ,</hi> and <hi>mourning for
him,</hi> cannot be meant of what they did presently
after their return from the <hi>Captivity in Babylon</hi> (of
which some imagine most of the <hi>Prophets</hi> speak) for
<hi>Christ</hi> was not then come, and therefore they could
not <hi>pierce</hi> him: And besides, this <hi>Zechary</hi> prophesied
after the Captivity and the Restauration of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and consequently could not speak of these as
future things, as here, <hi>they shall look, they shall mourn.</hi>
Nor can this Prophecy be understood (as some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:65397:360"/>
of the Conversion of the <hi>Iews</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi>
Times, when several of them imbrac'd the Christian
Faith, and particularly <hi>in one day there were added to
the Church about three thousand Souls,</hi> Acts. 241. some
of whom had been <hi>Crucifiers</hi> of our Saviour, v. 36.
for this is far different from a <hi>National Mourning and
Repentance,</hi> which are here foretold. Not only <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
but <hi>the Land shall mourn,</hi> v. 12. the whole
People of the Jews. Neither is this Prophecy to be
interpreted concerning the Day of Judgement, as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Expositors have thought, telling us that then
there shall be a General Mourning and Lamenting
for the Crucifying of Christ, when <hi>they shall look on him
whom they have pierced.</hi> But this Exposition cannot be
admitted, because these Words speak of the <hi>true</hi> and
<hi>hearty Repentance and Conversion of the Iews,</hi> which no
considerate Man can expect shall be at the Last Day.
If they have not the Spirit of Grace and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
poured on them before, it is too late then to
have it. Nor can the <hi>Iewish Families mourn apart</hi> at
that time, as is related here. Therefore I conclude,
seeing none of the foresaid Interpretations are well
grounded, that the Words are to be understood of
the Days of the <hi>Millennary Reign,</hi> when there shall be
a National and Universal Call of the Jews: <hi>The
whole Land,</hi> i. e. all the People <hi>shall mourn,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Family apart,</hi> to shew the Sincerity of the Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The <hi>Spirit of Grace and Supplication</hi> shall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
on these True Penitents; they shall be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
moved by the former to hate their past E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities,
and by the latter to beg Pardon for
them. They shall in a sincere and saving manner
bewail the execrable Wickedness of their Forefathers
who put the Blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> to Death, and as cordially
grieve that they themselves cruci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ied him by their
Sins. This is <hi>looking on him whom they pierced.</hi> Thus,
on all Accounts, this Prophetick Passage is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:65397:361"/>
concerning that Last Conversion of the
Jews, which is one main Ingredient of the Messias's
Kingdom toward the World's End, when the whole
Body of that People, disperesed over the several
parts of the Earth, shall be brought home to the
Flock of Christ. Thus it is apparent that this is
one of the most considerable Texts in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>I will now pass to the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which chiefly
recounts the wonderful Grace of God in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Persons to Christianity in <hi>the Times</hi> of our
Saviour and his Apostles, and therefore speaks but
little of this <hi>future</hi> Call of the <hi>Iews;</hi> but two or
three Places are very Remarkable, which I will Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.
The first is that of <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 30, 31, &amp;c. where
we read that Aged <hi>Simeon</hi> took the Child <hi>Iesus</hi> up in
his Arms, and blessed God that <hi>his Eyes had seen his
Salvation, viz.</hi> the <hi>Saviour</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> had sent into
the World, <hi>whom he had prepared before the Face of all
People; i. e.</hi> whom he had from Eternity decreed
and appointed to make known in due time to all
the Nations and People of the World: And because
<hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Iews</hi> are a dichotomy of all the People
of the World, this Great Blessing is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and distinctly expressed thus, that he shall be
<hi>a Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Israel.</hi> Where we are assured that the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
shall first share in this Blessing of the Messias, and
then the <hi>Iews,</hi> which manifestly shews that this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is to be understood of the General Conversion of
the <hi>Iews;</hi> for in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Time the <hi>Iews</hi> were
first call'd, and then the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> It shall be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
afterwards; the way of Salvation and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shall first be discovered to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and then
to the <hi>Iews.</hi> But observe how differently this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd;
it is said Christ shall <hi>enlighten</hi> the former,
but he shall be the <hi>Glory</hi> of the latter. It is a very
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:65397:361"/>
high Word, and lets us know how great, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd,
how glorious the State of the Jews shall
be hereafter: For this must necessarily be meant of
their future Condition, because they have never since
these Words were spoken been a <hi>Glorious People;</hi> yea,
they have been above Sixteen hundred years an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious,</hi>
base, despised People. Therefore there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
a Time when these Words of <hi>Simeon</hi> shall be
fulfill'd, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Gentiles are converted to the
Faith, then Christ shall <hi>be the Glory of his People Israel.</hi>
And it is probable that this is meant by those Words
that follow, <hi>Behold, this Child is set for the fall and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
again of many in Israel,</hi> that is, the Jewish People
shall be rejected, but they shall afterwards be recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and restored. We have seen the first part of
this Prophecy accomplished, and at this very day
the Truth of it is manifest; the Jews are fallen, they
are cast off, and cease to be a Church or Nation.
The second part of the Prophecy is yet to come, when
this People shall <hi>rise again,</hi> and be receiv'd to Mercy
and Favour.</p>
                     <p>The next Text is that which I had occasion to
mention partly before, but now I will set it down
in full, <hi>Luke 21. 24.</hi> where our Saviour, after he
had been discoursing of the several Fore-runners of
those Judgments which were to befal the <hi>Iews,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
that <hi>there shall be great distress in the Land, and
wrath upon this People, and they shall fall by the Edge of
the Sword, and shall be led away Captive into all Nations,
and Ierusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until
the time of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>entiles be fulfilled.</hi> We are abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assured that at the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the
<hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Land of ludaea was in great distress, and
wrath was upon that People,</hi> and <hi>they fell by the Edge of
the Sword:</hi> And those that remain'd were <hi>led Captive
into all Nations,</hi> and dispers'd over the whole World.
But this Captivity and Dispersion, this treading
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:65397:362"/>
down of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> shall not last al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
but only <hi>until the time of the Gentiles be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd,</hi>
i. e. (as I explain'd it before) till the time of
the full Conversion of the Gentile World. So that
it is plain from these Words, that the Jewish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to be restored, and that their present Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and Banishment shall have an End. There shall
be a time when the <hi>Iews</hi> shall not be any more trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
down of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and this shall be when the
Times of these <hi>latter</hi> are fully accomplished, and run
out, <hi>i e.</hi> when the particular time arrives in which
they shall be call'd into the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, of
which I spoke before.</p>
                     <p>The next Passage to this purpose which I will take
notice of, is in <hi>2 Cor. 3. 14, &amp;c.</hi> where the Apostle
speaking of <hi>the Children of Israel,</hi> saith, that <hi>their minds
were blinded,</hi> God was pleased not to give them that
Light and Knowledge which are common under the
Gospel: Their dark Understandings were agreeable
to their obscure Administrations, which consisted
chiefly of Types and Shadows. Yea, <hi>even unto this
day,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Veil (i. e.</hi> of Ignorance and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
<hi>is untaken away, and is</hi> still <hi>upon their heart.
Nevertheless when it</hi> (i. e. <hi>Israel,</hi> say some; but this
is not probable, because though there is mention
made before of <hi>the Children of Israel,</hi> yet not of <hi>Israel</hi>
barely. It is more reasonable to believe that <hi>it</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to <hi>their heart</hi> immediately before-mention'd.
<hi>When this) shall turn to the Lord,</hi> when the Jewish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall be heartily converted, and embrace the
Gospel, and the Blessed Author of it, then <hi>the Veil
shall be taken away,</hi> this Ignorance shall be removed,
and they shall attain to a compleat Insight of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of that <hi>Law</hi> which they before adhered
to, and of the Excellency of the <hi>Christian</hi> Institution,
and the Founder of it. <hi>This Veil,</hi> whenever it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
<hi>is done away in Christ,</hi> and him only, <hi>i. e.</hi> by
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:65397:362"/>
believing in him, and by renouncing their former
Infidelity. It is evident that the Apostle speaks of
a Time when this <hi>shall be,</hi> therefore it was not then
past when he wrote this Epistle: Though I grant it
was <hi>partly</hi> accomplish'd at that time, because several
<hi>Iews</hi> had received the Christian Faith: And I grant
that it was <hi>further</hi> verified afterwards, when others
of that Nation renounced <hi>Iudaism,</hi> and believed in
<hi>Iesus.</hi> But yet still the Apostles Words, which are
a Solemn Prediction, are not <hi>compleatly</hi> fulfill'd; for
you may take notice that he speaks of the <hi>Iews</hi> in
General, and as they are a Body, calling them <hi>the
Children of Israel,</hi> which is always understood in this
manner.</p>
                     <p>And I could observe that the way of speaking
here used intimates as much: <hi>It,</hi> i. e. <hi>their heart</hi> (in the
singular number) <hi>shall turn to the Lord;</hi> which implies
that this Conversion shall be with a General Consent;
they shall <hi>All</hi> turn to the Lord as if they were <hi>one
Person;</hi> they shall do it (as it is in Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd)
<hi>with one heart</hi> and <hi>with one soul;</hi> the whole
Jewish People shall <hi>unanimously</hi> repent and believe.
The Reader may chuse whether he will attend to
this Criticism or no; for I pretend not to prove the
Universality of the Jews future Conversion from this
Mode of speaking. I know this way of arguing is
not convincing, because we do not know but that
this may be meerly an <hi>En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>llage of Number:</hi> But then,
on the other hand, we are not certain but that the
Holy Ghost intended something remarkable and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
in this manner of Expression, and therefore I
could not but offer it to your Consideration. To
conclude, the Text assures us that there is a certain
determin'd Time <hi>when the Children of Israel shall turn
unto the Lord,</hi> and then <hi>the Veil shall be wholly taken
away,</hi> as it hath been in part already. This is to be
fully brought to pass at the Time when the whole
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:65397:363"/>
Community of them shall own the <hi>Messias,</hi> and
become Subjects of his Kingdom here on Earth.</p>
                     <p>The other place which I will propound is the
Eleventh Chapter of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> a most
Eminent and Illustrious Proof of the Matter before
us. There the Apostle speaking of the Rejection
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
asserts in the <hi>12. v. the Fulness</hi> of the former,
(as well as of the latter afterwards in the 25. <hi>v.</hi>) as
much as to say, there shall be a time when the <hi>Full
Conversion</hi> of the whole Body of the <hi>Iews</hi> (no less than
of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) shall come to pass. This he Appositely
calls <hi>Life from the Dead, v. 15.</hi> because it is so wonderful,
and withal so wellcome a thing. And the Expression is
the more Observable, because the<note n="*" place="bottom">Isai. 26. 19. Ezek. 37. 12, 13. Dan. 12. 2, 3.</note> Prophets of the
Old Testament express the <hi>Restauration</hi> and <hi>Conversion
of the Iews</hi> by the same manner of speaking, <hi>viz.</hi> by
<hi>Living again,</hi> or by <hi>Rising from the Dead.</hi> And this
gives light to <hi>Rev. 20. 5.</hi> where (as I have
shew'd you) the Glorious Reign of Christ with his
Saints is call'd the <hi>first Resurrection.</hi> It is as it were
a <hi>Living again after Death;</hi> and particularly, the
<hi>Restoring</hi> and <hi>Calling of the Iews</hi> (which is so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a part of that <hi>Reign</hi>) is signalized by these
very terms, even by the Inspired <hi>Prophets</hi> of God in
the Old Testament, and by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the New.
Now then I argue thus from what the Apostle here
saith, if there shall be <hi>a Fulness of the Iews,</hi> their
Conversion shall be Compleat and Entire, the
numbers of those that are call'd shall be Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated.
I ask now whether this is past, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is to come? It is past, say some, for the
<hi>Fulness</hi> which the Apostle speaks of here happen'd in
the first times of the Gospel, when both <hi>Gentiles</hi> and
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:65397:363"/>
                        <hi>Iews</hi> were Converted by the Preaching of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and his Apostles. A great many Jews turned
to the Lord, and Believed, and became Christians
just about the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> besieging <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
and soon after the Destruction of that City many
were convinced of the Truth of Christ's Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and owned Christianity. But can any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Man perswade himself that all this amounts to
<hi>the Fulness of the Iews</hi> which the Apostle here speaks
of? No; the Apostle himself calls it but a <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
v. 5.</hi> and he makes a plain distinction betwixt
this <hi>Remnant</hi> and the General Calling of the Jews,
which he saith is their <hi>Fulness:</hi> And therefore if we
will allow St. <hi>Paul</hi> to speak Properly and Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly,
we must not mistake one for the other: We
may, and ought to grant that very many Jews were
called to the Faith in Christ, but we cannot with
any shadow of Truth assert that there was a Full
and General Calling of that People. Therefore I
conclude that this Calling is not past, but is yet to
come, which is the thing I design'd.</p>
                     <p>So I might briefly argue in the same manner from
that other Passage of the Apostle in this Chapter,
v. 26. where he sets down the result of that <hi>Mystery</hi>
which he had mentioned before about the Casting off
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> till the Conversion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be full.
This, saith he, shall at last be the Issue of it, <hi>all
Israel shall be saved:</hi> As soon as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
the <hi>Iews</hi> shall follow their Example, and
repent, and believe in Christ, and receive the Pardon
of their Sins; so <hi>all Israel,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Iewish Nation,
shall be saved.</hi> I know there are some (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> of
Old, and Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> among the Moderns) who In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
the place more generally: They think that
<hi>All Israel</hi> comprehends not only <hi>Iews</hi> but <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
all true and faithful Members of the Christian
Church that shall be gathered from among them
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:65397:364"/>
both. There shall be in due time a Great and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Conversion of all the <hi>Pagan</hi> parts of the
World to Christianity, and this shall soon be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
with as Notable and Signal Conversion of
those that are <hi>Natural Iews,</hi> in what parts of the
World soever they are. If we should understand
the Words thus, they sufficiently assert the Point
which I am proving, but the Scope of the Apostle
in this place directs us to a stricter meaning of his
Words: And so by <hi>all Israel</hi> here we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that People which peculiarly have that Name,
<hi>viz.</hi> those that were of the Stock of
the <hi>Patriarch Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the Apostle speaks of the Salvation of <hi>these
particularly,</hi> I will prove from what goes before, and
what follows these Words. First, you may observe
how the word <hi>Israel</hi> is understood in this Chapter:
It cannot be denied that in the <hi>2d.</hi> and <hi>7th.</hi> Verses it
signifies the Body of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation; and so it
doth in the Verse just foregoing this. <hi>Blindness in
part is happen'd to Israel,</hi> saith the Apostle, i. e. to the
<hi>Natural Iews</hi> whom he had been speaking of all along:
and he tells us, that this <hi>Blindness</hi> or <hi>Hardness</hi> (as it
may also be render'd according to the <hi>Greek)</hi> which
happen'd to them for a certain time shall be removed
as soon as the whole Body of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> imbrace
Christianity, as soon as <hi>their fulness is come in;</hi> then
<hi>this very Israel</hi> also shall do the same, <hi>and so all Israel
shall be saved.</hi> There is no Considerate Man can seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
refuse this meaning of the Word, for it is
manifest that it is not meant here of all the Faithful,
but is to be taken in a restrained sense, <hi>viz.</hi> for that
particular People of the <hi>Iews</hi> who shall hereafter
believe; for the Apostle expresly opposes them to
the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Again, this acception of the Word
may be proved from what immediately follows in
this Verse, <hi>As it is written, there shall come out of</hi> Sion
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:65397:364"/>
                        <hi>the Deliverer, and shall turn away Vngodliness from</hi>
Jacob. This Prophecy, as appears from the place
whence it is taken (<hi>Isai. 59. 20.)</hi> doth primarily and
directly refer to that peculiar People. We may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the preceeding part of the Chapter, and
from those terms <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the Verse it self,
both which signifie here the <hi>Iewish People,</hi> that this
Text speaks of <hi>them,</hi> and consequently that <hi>Israel</hi>
in the preceeding words is meant of the same Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
otherwise the alledging of this Prophecy out of
the Old Testament would be impertinent. I think
there needs no more to be said to prove what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook,
<hi>viz.</hi> that this Text of the Apostle foretells
the <hi>General Conversion of the Iews.</hi> And of this (and
nothing but this) many of the Ancient<note n="*" place="bottom">Origen, Jerom, Athanasius, Chrysostom, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>Fathers</hi>
and<note n="†" place="bottom">Beda, Aquinas, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>Others</hi> understood the
Words.</p>
                     <p>Now then, if <hi>all Israel shall be saved,</hi> I demand
when this was fulfilled? It could not be in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Times, for though many Thousands of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Jews were then Converted to Christianity, and
so were saved, yet far greater numbers persisted
in their Judaism, and believed not in the Crucified
<hi>Iesus,</hi> therefore <hi>all were not saved.</hi> And we hear but
of few since that have renounced their Infidelity and
received the Gospel. Wherefore there shall be a
time <hi>hereafter</hi> when the Apostle's Words shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> towards the latter end of the World.
For though it is not here expresly said, that it shall
be at such a time, yet both this and other places of
Scripture speak of it as a Future Event of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern:
And then by rational Deductions and Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and by comparing of things together (which
hath been part of my task) we find <hi>when</hi> this time
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:65397:365"/>
shall be, <hi>viz.</hi> at that happy Revelation towards the
close of the World.</p>
                     <p>And it is observable that the Apostle calls this
Conversion a <hi>Mystery, v. 25.</hi> which he would not
have done if it were meant of the <hi>Iews</hi> that were in
those Primitive Days Converted, for that was no
<hi>Mystery,</hi> but apparent and known to all: But it was
a great Secret or <hi>Mystery,</hi> that the whole Body of the
Jews should continue in Unbelief and Impenitence
<hi>till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in,</hi> and that then
they should <hi>all be Converted and Saved.</hi> This was a
<hi>Mystery,</hi> he tells them, at that time, but he was
pleased to reveal it to them; whence it is evident
that he speaks of a Future Conversion.</p>
                     <p>After all that hath been said, there is yet farther
Evidence from the 27th. Verse of this Chapter, which
is part of the Prophecy produced from <hi>Isa. 59. This
is my Covenant unto them,</hi> or <hi>with them;</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt refers to <hi>Gen. 17. 7. I will Establish my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
betwixt me and thee, and thy Seed after thee, in
their Generations, for an Everlasting Covenant; to be a
God unto thee, and thy Seed after thee.</hi> The <hi>Iewish</hi> Race,
for the sake of their Faithful Progenitors, shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
at length of Mercy and Favour, for the <hi>Covenant
is made with</hi> Abraham's <hi>Seed after him, in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> and it cannot be null'd (though there may be
for a time an interruption of the actual exerting of
it) it is an <hi>Everlasting Covenant.</hi> Again, in the
28. Verse of this Chapter, the Apostle lets us know,
that not only on this account, but by the tenour of
the <hi>Divine Election,</hi> (whether you take it for the
Eternal Decree of Heaven, or only God's singular
favour in <hi>chosing</hi> this People in time out of all others)
they shall find Mercy at last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>As touching the Election,</hi>
saith he, <hi>they are beloved,</hi> and that <hi>for the Fathers sake, i. e.</hi>
the sake of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the other Godly Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
from whom the Jews descended: And this <hi>Love</hi> and
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:65397:365"/>
the effect of it, which shall be seen in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Called,</hi> are not to be frustrated, <hi>For</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
adds) <hi>the Gifts and Calling of God are without
Repentance,</hi> v. 29. God having made choice of this
People, they cannot totally be Rejected. Though
many of them were fallen, and many more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
should continue in their Unbelief, yet God
hath not, and will <hi>not cast off his People whom he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew,</hi>
and whom he <hi>Elected:</hi> They shall not finally
Perish, but be gathered to the Church; <hi>for the Gifts
and Callings,</hi> &amp;c. Such special Favours as these are
Unchangable; being once Promised they can't be
Revoked. The Apostle founds the <hi>Vniversal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling</hi>
of the <hi>Iews</hi> upon this, that God hath <hi>chosen</hi>
them, according to what we read in <hi>Deut. 7. 6, 7, 8.</hi>
As there was <hi>a Remnant</hi> (a small number of Jews)
<hi>according to the Election of Grace</hi> (as we find in this
Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 5.) who <hi>at that present time,</hi> when the
Apostle writ, rejected not the Gospel, but were
effectually Call'd and Converted; so likewise here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
there shall be a vast number of this People, who
by vertue of the same <hi>Election</hi> shall turn unto God;
and besides he will not fail to perform the <hi>Promise</hi>
made to their Ancestors, he will not forget his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
made with them. The Jews were once the
Beloved People of God, and their Posterity <hi>shall be
beloved for the Fathers sake;</hi> which is agreeable to the
<hi>Faithfulness</hi> as well as the infinite and unmeasurable
<hi>Goodness</hi> of God. Thus you see how the Great Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>le
argues, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Election,</hi> and from the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
and from the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and from his <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness.</hi>
All these are concern'd for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of that People, and therefore there is no
question of the Truth of it. Though they are laid
aside for the present, yet they shall be taken into
Favour again, and be of the number of those that
are Saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This very thing which the Apostle
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:65397:366"/>
here asserts was the <hi>Ancient</hi> Notion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who
had this Common Saying (though they did not so
well understand it) <hi>Every Israelite shall have his part in
the World to come;</hi> which is the same that the Apostle
here affirms, <hi>All Israel shall be saved,</hi> there shall be a
General Conversion of that People.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, to insist upon no other Proofs, I will only
add <hi>Rev. 7. 4, &amp;c.</hi> which gives an account of <hi>the
number of them that were Sealed, of all the Tribes of the
Children of Israel,</hi> which I conceive is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the numerous Company of <hi>Iews</hi> that shall
be <hi>Converted</hi> in the Latter Days. It is true, Expositors
generally interpret the Words otherwise, and fix this
<hi>Sealing</hi> long before this time: Particularly Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
thinks this is spoken of the Conversion of the
Jews about the time of the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
But if it be considered that the Subject of this Chapter
is under the <hi>Sixth Seal</hi> (as is evident from comparing
the 12. <hi>v.</hi> of the 6th. Chapter with 1: <hi>v.</hi> of the
8th. Chapter) and belongs to the close of it, we
must be forced to acknowledge that these Words
appertain to the Last Times, in which the Signal
<hi>Conversion</hi> shall happen, which is fitly represented
by <hi>the Sealing of so many Thousands of every Tribe of
Israel.</hi> Besides, I can't find any time when this
hath been already fulfill'd, <hi>i. e.</hi> when there
was such a vast number of <hi>Iews</hi> Converted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therefore this Time is yet to come, and
accordingly I am perswaded that this place of the
<hi>Revelation</hi> foretells this Notable Event, and (As I
apprehend) refers to <hi>Zech. 12. 12, &amp;c.</hi> of which I
have largely treated before.</p>
                     <p>From all thse places of Scripture laid together I
conclude that there shall be at length <hi>a Visible, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and General Conversion of the Iewish People,</hi> and
that they being joyned to the <hi>Converted Gentiles</hi> shall
make up One Church of Christ. I confess I have
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:65397:366"/>
heretofore thought the contrary, being strongly
enclin'd to believe that those Texts of Scripture
had no determinate reference to this affair. But I
have since throughly <hi>examined</hi> them, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
scann'd them, and penetrated into the sence of
them; insomuch that I am now perswaded, that a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Conversion of the Jews in spoken of in them all,
or most of them. Particularly, in my Judgment, the
<hi>Eelventh Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> is a very clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Evidence of this great change of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which as it shall be Amazing, so it shall be
matter of exceeding Rejoycing and Exultation, and
therefore is deservedly call'd (as you have heard)
<hi>Life from the Dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be asked, How this General Conversion of
the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be effected, I conceive the first Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it will be this, They will take notice of the
Wonderful and Avenging Hand of God upon the
Idolaters of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have so long a time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered:
They will observe the sudden downfall of
that Wicked Assembly of Men, who have boasted
of their being founded on a <hi>Rock,</hi> and that they
should never be removed. When the <hi>Iews</hi> shall see
how remarkably God hath Defeated and Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
these Men, it will have a very good effect upon
them, and cause them to reflect on their own Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness
and Insidelity, and to fear lest the Divine
Vengeance may overtake them. And when the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Worship of the <hi>Papists</hi> is removed, which
was always so great an Offence to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and
was one main reason why they spoke and thought ill
of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> they will then be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to approach nearer to it, to be more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with it, and to discern the innate Goodness
and Excellency of it, which was before so much
clouded with Ceremonies, and corrupted with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Practices.</p>

<hi>Christians</hi> will lay aside all their former Prejudices
against the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation. It hath been a Vulgar
Opinion that the <hi>Iews</hi> Stink naturally, and that
the whole stock of them have an unsavory Smell.
And generally <hi>Christians</hi> have acted towards that
People as if this were really true: They avoid
their Society, and keep at a distance from them, as
if some unwholsome and fetid Vapours issued from
them: They have treated them with Scorn and
Contempt, with Contumely and Reproach; which
may be more eminently observed in <hi>Buxtorf's Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,</hi>
where he most rudely handles them, grossly
and sometimes almost prophanely deriding them
and their Services, calling them <hi>Beasts, Swine, Mad
Dogs</hi> and <hi>Devils;</hi> which certainly is not the way to do
any good upon them, which yet that Learned Man
pretends to in that Book. But when those happy
Days shall shine which I am speaking of, the former
Antipathy of <hi>Christians</hi> against the Race of the
<hi>Iews</hi> shall vanish away, and they shall unfeignedly
endeavour to promote the wellfare of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Souls, which by the Divine Blessing on their
Endeavours will end in their Effectual Conversion.
It was the Opinion of <hi>Tertullian, Chrysostom, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi>
and several other <hi>Fathers,</hi> (in which they are
follow'd by the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that
the Calling of the Jews before Christs Coming to
Judgment shall be chiefly Effected by the Preaching
of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> So far we may allow it to be
true, that such <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Zealous Men</hi> as they were

the time) <hi>to the Gentiles, to provoke them (i.
e.</hi> the Jews) <hi>to jealousie.</hi> And this is yet more clear
from 25, and 26. v. of the Eleventh Chapter before
insisted upon, which not only assert the General
Calling of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but that it shall be after the
Fulness of the <hi>Gentiles, i. e.</hi> when the Gentiles are
Converted. <hi>Blindness in part</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> for a certain time)
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:65397:368"/>
                        <hi>is happen'd to Israel, untill the fulness of the Gentiles be
come in.</hi> And when this is come in, then the Jews
shall no longer be blinded. I take this to be a clear
Text for the Priority of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Conversion
before that of the <hi>Iews,</hi> though I find it opposed
by several, and particularly by our Learned <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
(who attempts to distort the Words) and by
the Author of <hi>The State of the Church in Future Ages,</hi>
Chap. 6. where he contends that the Apostles Words
are to be understood <hi>in a qualifi'd sense,</hi> and that is
this, <hi>Blindness in part is befallen</hi> Israel, <hi>for so long as
until the time come in which the Gentiles shall come in,
in their fullness, that is they shall come in then more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
than ever before.</hi> But whatever this dark Gloss
drives at, this is a plain, obvious and intelligible
Truth, that though there was a great and notable
Conversion both of Gentiles and Jews in the
Apostle's time, yet that could not be meant here,
because the Apostle speaks of something to come in
Future Ages, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Compleat</hi> and <hi>Vniversal Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of those two: And as to the <hi>Order</hi> of them he
lets us know that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall be first Converted,
and then the <hi>Iews,</hi> for (saith he) the Blindness and
Hardness of these latter shall not be taken away
<hi>until the fulness of the other comes in, i. e.</hi> until the
full number of Gentiles be come into the Church
of God, by a hearty imbracing and professing of
Christianity. Can any thing be plainer than this?
Could the Apostle have used any clearer Words to
express this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Conversion of
the great Multitude of the Heathen World will
preceed that of the Jews, that it will be a means
to remove their Blindness and Hardness, and to
cause them to own the Christian Faith. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I can't submit to this Authors <hi>qualifi'd sence,</hi>
and that for a Reason which himself assigns in

a Word, where the Scope of the Place, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

But this Sence which I offer, is further evident from
what the Apostle adds in the forenamed Place, <hi>So all
Israel shall be saved.</hi> The <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>so,</hi> is very Emphatical
and Remarkable here; for it acquaints us, that the
General Conversion of Salvation of the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be
<hi>such,</hi> shall be <hi>so,</hi> that it shall be the Effect and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> foregoing Conversion. <hi>SO</hi>
they shall be Converted, <hi>in this Manner</hi> they shall
be Saved, and no otherwise. The Jews shall behold
that strange Revolution, and sudden Change, in
the <hi>Pagan</hi> World, and thence be stirr'd up to make
an Alteration among <hi>themselves.</hi> A holy Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall possess their Minds, which shall push them
on to this great Work. <hi>So, i. e.</hi> in this Manner
and Method <hi>all Israel shall be Saved,</hi> the whole Body
of the Jews shall be received into the Church.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps this Universal Call may be promoted by
some extraordinary Appearance, or Spectacle in the
Heavens. Some would infer from that Place before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
<hi>They shall look on him whom they have pierced,</hi>
that our Saviour will come, and be seen at that
Grand Change of Affairs; but from what I have
said already on that Passage, it is manifest that it is
not capable of the Sence. As for Rev. 1. 7. <hi>Behold,
he cometh with Clouds, and every Eye shall see him, and
even they which pierced him; and all Kindreds of the
Earth shall wail because of him;</hi> which is thought by
some to be a parallel Place with that which I last
named, because there is some likeness in the Words
in both Places; I rather think it is spoken of the Last
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:65397:369"/>
Day, the Day of Judgment, when <hi>they shall see the
Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 24.
30. which is generally acknowledged to the meant
of Doomsday. Then all impenitent Sinners, and
more especially they that pierced and crucified
Christ, and died in their Sins, shall see him to their
unspeakable Sorrow.</p>
                     <p>But those Words (if any) in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13. may
seem to be some proof of Christ's Appearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Clouds, when his Kingdom on Earth is
to be set up anew. <hi>One like the Son of Man came in
the Clouds of Heaven; and there was given him Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and Glory, and a Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. for I have shew'd
before that these Words are a Prediction of the
<hi>Millennium.</hi> Though I cannot be positive here;
(for it may be this <hi>coming in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi>
may only refer to the Manner of the Vision which
<hi>Daniel</hi> had; <hi>I saw in the Night Visions,</hi> saith he, <hi>one
like the Son of Man,</hi> who appeared as if <hi>he came in
the Clouds</hi>) yet, I must needs say, I am ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enclined to think that this Place speaks of a <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Appearance of our Saviour</hi> at the Entrance of the
<hi>Millennary Reign,</hi> especially in order to the rouzing
and alarming of the Hardned <hi>Iews,</hi> who will be
looking after <hi>Signs</hi> from Heaven: And therefore at
such a time it is likely Christ may appear in the
Skies with an amazing Splendor and Glory to these
gazing Spectators. I conceive he may Personally
Appear above, though he will not Reign Personally
on Earth. After he hath shew'd himself, he soon
retreats, and remains in Heaven till the Last and
Final Day. Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> who once thought that our
Saviour would make a visible Appearance in the
Clouds, in order to the Jews Conversion, afterwards
retracted this Opinion; (as may be seen in one of
his <hi>Letters</hi>) because <hi>there is no good Foundation for it,
viz.</hi> in <hi>Mat</hi> 24. 30. which he had formerly quoted
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:65397:369"/>
for that purpose. But whether there is any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for such an Apprehension in that Place of
<hi>Daniel,</hi> I leave to the Reader to judge: I only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
it as probable, but am perswaded that no Man
can <hi>Absolutely</hi> determine any Thing in this Case,
and therefore he is very presumptuous that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
it.</p>

                        <p>Universal Righteousness is another Attendant
of this Last Dispensation. An Objection
doubly answered. It is not a Sinless State.
Greater Knowledge than ever shall be at

Spirit on Mens Lives, shall be more effectual
than formerly. Jesus shall in a more eminent
Manner be exalted. Other Fruits of this happy
Reign. How these great Things shall be
wrought. Civil Magistrates shall be made
use of. Christ's Reign is not inconsistent with
that of Kings and Princes. Ecclesiastical
and Spiritual Rulers shall be Instruments in
this great Work. All Persons are some Ways
capable of promoting it. Universal Peace is
another Blessing that attends this Kingdom of
Christ. On what account it must needs be
so. Scripture attests it. An Objection ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated.
A Concurrence of all manner of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Blessings in this happy State. More
especially Bodily Health, and Long Life. Also
a vast Increase of the Poeple of that Time. The
Savage Brates shall become Tame and Gentle.
These Earthly Blessings are but Appendages of
this Dispensation. They are Inconsiderable, in
respect of the Divine Blessings which constitute
this State. The Author's Doubtings and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancies.
He is not positive as to Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Circumstances. He cannot determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Fore-runners of this Revolution.
The Freedom which he uses in a Point that
is highly Probable. He follows not some late
Writers in assigning the particular Time when
the Millennary Reign shall commence. The
punctual Date is not to be known. The Thing
discoursed of is certain, though the Time as to
us is not so. The Degeneracy of the present
Times is no obstacle to this. The Author leaves
a Testimony of his Wishes and Desires.</p>

HAving spoken of Three of the Grand Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants
of the <hi>Reign of Christ,</hi> I proceed now
to the Fourth, which is <hi>Vniversal Righteousness and
Holiness.</hi> You might have observed, that in some
of those Places of Scripture, which I alledged to
evince the Future calling of the Jews and Gentiles;
and you may observe in several. <hi>others</hi> besides, which
speak of this happy Revolution, and the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the <hi>Messias's Kingdom,</hi> that there is some
mention all along made of the <hi>Holiness</hi> which shall
abound in that Time. This is reckon'd among the
Blessings of <hi>Christ's Kingdom</hi> in several Places of the
<hi>Prophetick</hi> Writings: <hi>Thy People shall be all Righteous,</hi>
Isa. 60. 21. <hi>I will sprinkle clean Water upon you, and ye
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:65397:370"/>
shall be clean,</hi> Ezek. 36. 25. <hi>I will save you from your
Uncleanness,</hi> ver. 29. which is the same with <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them from their Iniquities,</hi> ver. 33. <hi>They shall not
defile themselves any more with their detestable Things,
or any of their Transgressions,</hi> Ezek. 37. 23. In those
Days <hi>HOLINESS TO THE LORD</hi> must be engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>on the Bells of the Horses,</hi> Zech. 14. 20. There
shall be such a Catholick Reformation, that every
Thing, even the meanest and commonest, shall share
in it. We find it to be the Office of the <hi>Messias
to bring in everlasting Righteousness,</hi> Dan. 9. 24. not
only that of his Own, whereby we are to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
but an Inherent one in our selves, (though
produced by the Holy Spirit) whereby we are
sanctified.</p>
                     <p>If it be said that this, and some of the other
Texts, refer to those Times which are past, <hi>viz.</hi>
when Christ came in the Flesh, or when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
made so many Converts to our Holy Religion,
or even to the present Times of the Gospel; and
therefore they have no respect to what is to come.
I answer, That the Consequence is not valid; for
though these Prophecies were <hi>partly</hi> and <hi>initially</hi>
fulfilled before, yet it doth not follow thence, that
they shall not be <hi>Completely</hi> fulfilled hereafter. I
grant that they are in part come to pass, for there
never was more <hi>Holiness</hi> than since the Rise of the
Gospel; but I assert withal, that the Full Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
is yet behind, for there shall be a larger
Effusion of Holiness in the ensuing Dispensation.</p>
                     <p>Or the former Answer, which I gave in the
like Case, may be Satisfactory here; <hi>viz.</hi> that
this kind of Prophetick Passages have a Double
Meaning, and therefore, must have a Double Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment.
Many of these Predictions which
foretold what should be at Christ's first setting up
the Kingdom of the Gospel, do also foretel what
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:65397:371"/>
shall happen at his Coming in the <hi>Millennium.</hi> This
is a safe way of interpreting those Place, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an Account of those Prophecies; yea, this
solves the Difficulties which occur in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.
This is no groundless Notion, but built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Interpretation of Scripture, dictated by the
Holy Ghost himself, as I have proved in another
Discourse; where I have shew'd, that this is the
peculiar Excellency of the <hi>Sacred Writings,</hi> to have
a <hi>First,</hi> and a <hi>Second,</hi> or (if you will) a <hi>Direct</hi> and
a <hi>Collateral</hi> Meaning, which we find in no other
Books whatsoever that are Historical. This is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
here; those Passages in the Prophets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
an extraordinary Measure of Sanctity and
Righteousness, are to be understood not only of
the Primitive Times of Christianity, but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of those that shall be towards the latter end
of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Blessed Reign of Christ.
It is not to be doubted but that the Prophetick
Words reach to these Two times, so that they are
fulfilled twice. In the <hi>Sacred Writings</hi> not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Persons and Things, but different Times and
Seasons, are contain'd in the same Words.</p>
                     <p>And as this Holiness of the future State on
Earth is foretold in the Holy Scriptures, so it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follows from what hath been said before:
For when <hi>Babylon</hi> shall fall, and the <hi>Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
with it, when those whose grand Design and
Business it was to extirpate the Purity of Religion,
shall themselves be rooted out, when both <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> shall universally abandon their evil Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and wicked Practices, and jointly set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Study of God's Will, and the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of their Duty; you cannot but think there
will follow upon this an Universal Sanctity in the
World. I do not mean a Sinless State; for this is
so like <hi>Heaven,</hi> that I can't be induced to think that
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:65397:371"/>
we shall have it here on <hi>Earth.</hi> Those High-fliers,
who represent the Millennary State as such, lash out
too far; and remember not that our <hi>Heaven</hi> is not
to be here. The <hi>binding of Satan,</hi> which is spoken
of, is not such a Binding as if the Devils were all
shut up, and none of them had the least Liberty to
solicite and entice us to Sin. I observe, that it was the
<hi>Chief</hi> of these Infernal Spirits that was <hi>bound by the
Angel,</hi> Rev. 20. 1. which I gather from the several
Names that are here given him; viz. <hi>the Dragon, that
old Serpent, who is the Devil and Satan,</hi> which are
heap'd up on purpose to distinguish this <hi>Arch-Daemon</hi>
from the rest. This is that very Apostate Ghost,
it is probable, who wrought the First Mischief in
the World, the Fall of the First Man and Woman;
by assuming the Shape of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> or rather, by
entring into, and acting a <hi>Real Serpent;</hi> whence he
is called here, <hi>the old Serpent.</hi> He being the Subtilest
and most Malicious of all the Diabolical Crew, <hi>is
bound, and cast into the bottomless Pit, and shut up, and a
Seal is set upon him, that he should deceive the Nations
no more.</hi> He, who was the Head and Ring-leader of
the rest, and by whose order they generally acted,
is secured; and thereupon their Power is extremely
abated, though <hi>they</hi> are not chain'd up in the
same manner that <hi>He</hi> is. It is not likely that
they forget their old Employment, but they do
what they can in it, though it be but little. They
shall not be totally, absolutely, and fully bound,
till the Last Day, and therefore they will not cease
to tempt and deceive Men till that time; but they
shall be Restrained in a very great Measure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
However, if we suppose the <hi>whole Body</hi> of
<hi>Evil Angels</hi> so confin'd, that they are utterly unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Tempting; yet, as long as Men are on this
side of Heaven, Corruptions will adhere to them.
The Best will Sin to the Worlds end, because they
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:65397:372"/>
are a Compound of Flesh and Spirit. Their Make
and Frame being such, there can be no intire Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from Sin in this Life. But this high Degree
of the Evangelical State shall set them at as great a
Distance from it as they can be capable of, in this
lower Region of the World.</p>
                     <p>For, First, in that happy Restauration, Men shall
be Blessed with a greater <hi>Knowledge</hi> than ever,
which is the Ground-work of true <hi>Holiness.</hi> The
Inspired Prophets, who speak of those Days, assure
us, That <hi>the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the
Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea,</hi> Isa. 11. 9. And
perhaps this is intended in Isa. 65. 20. <hi>The Child
shall die an Hundred Years Old; i. e.</hi> all Persons shall
grow up to maturity of Understanding, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have attain'd to any considerable Number
of Years: The Children shall have such Knowledge,
that if they die in their Childhood, they shall be as
Knowing as some of those heretofore that were
very Old, that lived an Hundred Years. This is
the Privilege of those that are reserved for the
<hi>New Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>New Earth,</hi> or the <hi>New-created
Ierusalem,</hi> which the Prophet speaks of there, as
we learn from ver. 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>There will be more <hi>Knowledge,</hi> because there will
be a more General <hi>Commerce;</hi> according to that of
<hi>Daniel,</hi> who prophesied concerning these Times,
<hi>Many shall run to and fro, and Knowledge shall be
increased,</hi> Dan. 12. 4. <hi>viz.</hi> by that free and peaceable
Travelling, by Sea and Land, from one Part of the
World to the other, which will be the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Privilege of those Days. For I am not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to submit to that New Hypothesis,<note n="*" place="bottom">

his <hi>Comet</hi> (which he fansies) will drink it up. For
according to this Gentleman's New Philosophy, as a
<hi>Comet</hi> procured the Universal Flood, so it will bring
on the Final Conflagration; and so he makes the
Drowning of the World, and the Burning of it up,
to be from the same Cause. But leaving this <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist</hi>
to his own Inventions, I think we may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
assert, that the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rth</hi> shall not be destitute of
<hi>Sea</hi> in the foresaid Thousand Years, because I shall
prove afterwards, that the Firing of the Earth will
not happen till after those Years be expired. And
consequently we may be perswaded of the Truth of
what I before suggested, that a <hi>Commerce</hi> by <hi>Sea,</hi>
as well as by <hi>Land,</hi> shall be mightily increased and
improved in that <hi>Millennary</hi> State.</p>
                     <p>In order to this, it is probable that there will
be a <hi>Common Language</hi> for all the World, a kind
of a <hi>Lingua Franca,</hi> (but much larger) that may
be used by all; whereby all Nations will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to hold correspondence with one another
at the greatest Distance. Travelling is uneasy now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we must have a Druggerman to interpret be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and the Foreigners we converse with; but
then they will be incourag'd to visit one another, when
the Conversation between them is become so easy.
By this means the great Principles of <hi>Christianity</hi> will
be soon propagated, and known in the World,
especially when I add, that now Mens Minds shall
be better disposed than ever to understand the
Truth, and to entertain the Doctrine of <hi>Iesus.</hi> The
true Notions of Things shall bear sway, and Men
shall not take Pains to Cheat and Delude themselves,
as well as others, as hath been their constant Course
through all Ages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="728" facs="tcp:65397:373"/>
Secondly, in this remarkable Renovation of the
World which we expect, Religion, shall appear in
its <hi>Native Purity and Simplicity,</hi> and Men shall see
and understand the <hi>Real Worth</hi> of it. Indeed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
like the Sun, at its first Rising, made long
Shadows; it abounded with Obscurities, and Dusky
Representations; and Men were imployed chiefly in
external Formalities and Ceremonies: But when it
shall be in its Meridian, at its greatest Height,
there will be none of these Things; but it shall be
chosen for its own Sake, and loved for its intrinsick
Value. Even at the first founding of <hi>Christianity</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
many imbraced it, because it was attested by
such Extraordinary and Miraculous Occurrences as
then every Day shew'd themselves; so that they
were in a manner thrust upon Christianity, and
they were compell'd as it were to receive it. But
it shall not be so afterwards; it shall commend it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the World, by its own Natural Excellency,
by the Worthiness of its Noble Principles, which
it is furnished with; and thence Men shall serve
God Freely, and out of Choice, and the Christian
Religion shall then appear more eminently to be
a <hi>Reasonable Service.</hi> This must needs promote a
more than usual <hi>Holiness</hi> in the Hearts and Lives
of Men; for when Religion is esteem'd for its Self,
and its inward Excellency, it will cease to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by mere Words, and outward Shews; by
mere Opinion, or by Matters of an indifferent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
We live in an Age wherein Men talk and
discourse much concerning Religion, and yet the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of them have less Religion than any Age
ever had. Why? Because they place Religion in
Words and Pretences, in some peculiar Sets of
Opinions, and in a meer external Shew of some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
that relate to Devotion. But in that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Kingdom which we look for, Substantial Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:65397:373"/>
will take place, and the only Standard of it
shall be True and Solid Piety.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A greater Measure of <hi>Grace</hi> shall be
bestowed on the Christian Church, more of that
<hi>Divine Spirit.</hi> Not in the Sense that some mean,
that Extraordinary Gifs, and Supernatural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
shall be confer'd, and that the Outward
Teachings of Man shall cease, and become useless:
But I mean thus; that the effectual Power of the
<hi>Holy Spirit</hi> shall be seen in making Men better; which
indeed is the grand Design and Office of the Holy
Ghost, and therefore shall take Place in that happy
Time. The most admired and glorious Gifts are
mean and base, in respect of Real Goodness and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;
<hi>i. e.</hi> a hearty Love of God, and his Ways,
and an upright Life resulting from it. Therefore
we may infer, that by a more abundant Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> these shall be advanced in the
World. In the Golden Age of Christianity there
shall be a mighty Power and Efficacy on Mens Minds,
exciting them to worthy and noble Actions, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them to be zealous for Religion, and to act
with Vigour and Concernedness, and to overcome
all Difficulties that lie in their way; and (in a
Word) to design and bring to pass Great Things,
for the Honour of the Supreme Being, and the Good
of the World.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>IESUS</hi> shall then in a more eminent
Manner be exalted; his blessed Undertakings for
our Redemption and Salvation, his Merits and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteousness, shall be more than ever esteem'd,
admir'd, and extoll'd. This shall be a more
especial Time of magnifying and celebrating the
meritorious Transactions of our <hi>Lord Christ</hi> for the
Saving of Mankind. Which must needs produce a
very high Degree of <hi>Holiness</hi> in Mens Lives; for there
is not a more genuine Source of it, than the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:65397:374"/>
of what <hi>Christ</hi> hath done and suffer'd for us.
There is not a more effectual Spring of True Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
nor a more powerful Motive to it, than
the Free and Unmerited Love of God the Father,
through his beloved Son <hi>Iesus.</hi> Wherefore now the
Reformed World shall exercise itself more and more,
in this true Way that leads to Purity and Holiness;
<hi>viz.</hi> a perpetual valuing and prizing the Grace of
God in the Gospel, through the Blood of the <hi>New
Covenant.</hi> This hath not been sufficiently done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto;
yea, it hath been shamefully neglected in
all Ages of Christianity: Therefore now it shall be
performed with great Zeal and Application, by all
the Inhabitants of the <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi> Though their
Works and Obedience shall exceed all that went
before, yet they shall not presume to rely upon
them. Though their Lives shall be more strict and
blameless than ever, yet they shall entertain no Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their own Worthiness, but confide wholly in
the Spotless Obedience of <hi>the Lamb of God;</hi> and they
shall attribute all to <hi>Iesus,</hi> and his <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, to heap up many Things together, in those
blessed Days there shall be no New Religion, but
New Hearts; that is, more enlightned, more warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and more sanctified. There shall then be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Striving to excel one another in laudable
and vertuous Actions. Religion and Piety shall be
Fashionable, and Goodness and Holiness shall be
esteemed most Honourable. All Perfidiousness and
Fraud, all Lying and Falshood, shall cease; and
Truth and Sincerity, Integrity and Open-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
shall universally prevail. Swearing will then
be of little Use, unless it be as a meer Act of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Worship, and owning a God; for where there
is no distrust of one another, where 'tis known that
Persons deal Truly and Uprightly, <hi>Oaths</hi> are not
needful to attest or confirm what they say. In
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:65397:374"/>
those Days Men shall conciliate an assent to what
they speak; they shall perswade others of the Truth
of what they assert, or promise, by plain Words,
and by an honest Life. Briefly, all-sinister and base
Designs; all unworthy Aims, and vitious Ends, shall
be laid aside; and the Glory of the Great God, and
of his Son <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> shall be the main Thing
which shall influence upon their Lives.</p>
                     <p>If it be demanded, How this great Change shall
be wrought? I answer; It shall be done by the
powerful Aids and Assistances of Heaven, which
shall be vouchsafed to Men in a very plentiful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Hereby they shall be inabled, above their own
Abilities and Strengths, to subdne their Lusts, to
conquer their Vices, and in the most exact manner to
conform their Lives to the Rules of the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>If you further ask, What outward instruments
and Means God will make use of, to accomplish this
Great Work? I conceive, it shall be effected by
<hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Zealous Governors.</hi> For we cannot but
take Notice, that Persons of that Character have
been rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>'d up continually, in order to great Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
and Alterations in Church and State; as is
evident in the Examples of <hi>Cyrus, Alexander</hi> the
Great, <hi>Constanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> the Great, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and the
Electors of <hi>Saxony.</hi> And in the beginning of our
<hi>REFORMATION</hi> in this Land, what strange Things
did a Resolute and Couragious <hi>King</hi> bring to pass?
Much more may be effected here, and all the World
over, by God's inspiring the Hearts of some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> with Valour and Resolution;
especially by adding Goodness and Holiness to these,
by blessing them with a real Sense and relish of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in their own Minds and Consciences. Being
thus qualified, what is there too hard for them to
accomplish? What may not be expected from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of this Character? Wicked Rulers are the
greatest Mischief and Plague of the World; and
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:65397:375"/>
accordingly it hath been Satan's Stratagem through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Ages, to procure such Magistrates as will
abett and further his Design; <hi>i. e.</hi> that will patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
all Vice and Wickedness, and, if it be possible,
establish it by a Law. This hath been the Cause
and Sourse of that horrid Deluge of Vice, which
hath broken in upon all Cities and Countries, and
miserably overspread them. Therefore I infer, that
when God will vouchsafe to stem this mighty Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
he will set up some Eminent Persons in High
Places, who by their powerful Laws, as by so many
Walls and Ramparts, shall effectually stop its impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Course.</p>
                     <p>I question not in the least, but that those Words
in Rev. 20. 4. <hi>I saw Thrones, and they sat upon them,
and Iudgment was given unto them,</hi> refer partly to
this; they signify to us, that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi>
which shall be at that time: Evil-doers shall be call'd
to an Account, and punish'd according to their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
and the Earth shall in a manner be cleared
of all wilful and stubborn Criminals. This perhaps
may be the Meaning of 1 Cor. 6. 2. <hi>Do ye not know
that the Saints shall judge the World?</hi> I offer it to be
considered whether we may not interpret it thus;
Do you not know that there shall be a time when
there shall be a <hi>Christian Magistracy</hi> in the World,
and that especially when Christianity is coming to
its Height, there shall be such <hi>Godly Rulers,</hi> and
<hi>Iudges,</hi> as shall reform all Things that are amiss
in the World? And this great Sway and Authority
shall make way even for their <hi>judging of Angels</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
v. 3.</p>
                     <p>I am far from abetting in this Discourse the wild
Fancy of those <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> Spirits, who make the
<hi>Reign of Christ</hi> on Earth inconsistent with that of
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes;</hi> who at the same time that they
set up <hi>King Iesus,</hi> pull down all others: Their
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:65397:375"/>
Fifth-Monarchy brooks no Crowned Heads. But
they forget that in the same Place where the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Prophet saith, <hi>Behold, a King shall Reign in
Righteousness,</hi> (meaning Christ, and this Kingdom
which I am now discoursing of) he adds, <hi>And
Princes shall rule in iudgment,</hi> Isa. 32. 1. Though it
is said, <hi>the Scepter shall depart from Iudah when Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh</hi>
first <hi>comes;</hi> yet neither then, nor afterwards,
is it to be taken out of the Hands of <hi>Christian
Princes.</hi> Their Monarchy, and Christ's Kingdom,
are not incompatible. Yea, I am so far from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Allowance to this sort of Men, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
aver Christ's Kingdom, whereof I am speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
shall be set up and maintain'd by the <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Earth; Christianity shall arrive
to that excellent Pitch, by the Assistance of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate,</hi> by the Incouragement which shall be
given to it by the Secular Powers, There is Ground
for what I say; for we are expresly told, that those
who formerly <hi>gave their Kingdom to the Beast,</hi> shall
afterwards <hi>hate the Whore, and shall make her deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
&amp;c. Rev. 17. 16, 17. These great Things shall
be effected by Monarchs, Princes, and States, entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
devoting themselves to the publick Good and
Welfare, and to the Glory of Him who is the
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. The Builders
of that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> shall hold the Trowel with one
Hand, and the Sword in the other: They shall at
the same time Rear this happy Structure, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
Punish those who endeavour to hinder them;
till at last, by sharply Animadverting on all Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesses
and Enormities, these be driven out of the
World, and Universal Piety and Righteousness come
in their room.</p>
                     <p>Again; This great Work shall be promoted and
advanced by the help of <hi>Spiritual Pastors</hi> and <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi>
whose Care and Faithfulness, whose Courage
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:65397:376"/>
and Zeal, are as requisite in this present Affair, as that
of the Civil Magistrate. The Rulers and Guides
of the Church shall then shew themselves true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Souls, by not refusing any Labour of Love
for their Peoples Good; they shall<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 4. 2, 5.</note> 
                        <hi>preach the Word,
be instant in Season, out of Season, reprove, rebuke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort;
with all Long-suffering and Doctrine,</hi> they shall
<hi>Watch in all Things, do the Work of true Evangelizers,
make full proof of their Ministry.</hi> They shall discharge
their Holy Function with all Mildness and Clemency,
with all Tenderness and Compassion, and yet with
all Fervency and Vigour. They shall let all Men see,
that they make the Honour of God, and the Saving
of Mens Souls, the Grand Design of their Ministry.</p>
                     <p>And it is not without great reason that I mention
<hi>both</hi> these great Orders of Men, <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters;</hi>
for it is absolutely requisite that they go
hand in hand, towards the accomplishing that Great
Work which I am discoursing of. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
must befriend each other, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> must
join in building the Temple. The great Hinderance
of the Improvement and Increase of Christianity,
hath been the disunion of these Two. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Rulers, and Spiritual Overseers, have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
in the promoting the same Religious Designs.
The Secular and Ecclesiastical Powers have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been divided among themselves, and thereby
have retarded and impeded the Common Good.
But it shall not be so in those happy Times; there
shall be no disagreement between Ecclesiastical the State and
Church, no opposition between the State and
Civil Laws. The Spiritual and Secular Officers
shall be so far from being an Impediment to one
another in their particular Charges, that they shall
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:65397:376"/>
make it their Business to promote the respective
Cause and Interest of each other. If <hi>Phocas</hi> and
<hi>Boniface</hi> held together, and thereby wrought such
horrid Mischiefs in the World; it is certain we may
experience as great and notable Effects of a contrary
Nature, from the unanimous Concurrence of pious
Governours in the Church and Commonwealth.
When they mutually advise and consult with one
another, and act jointly for the Advancement of
Religion and Godliness; as in the Times of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
the Great, <hi>Theodosius, Valentinian, Gratian;</hi> when
they strive with great Ambition (and no other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition)
who shall be most serviceable and beneficial to
the Christian Community, this will be found to be
the true Method for the propagating and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Religion</hi> in the World. And seeing <hi>Religion</hi> is
the only unshaken and lasting Basis of Kingdoms, it is
the Concern of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se Two Ranks of Persons, to agree
to advance this above all Things whatsoever. They
are to remember, that even Civil Politicks are best
guided by this Conduct; and that if a Nation, or
Council, exclude this in any of their Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
they can't be said to be Wise and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick:
For what is disagreeable to Religion, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe,
dangerous, and extremely Impolitick. To be
short, all lies in <hi>Rulers,</hi> both of Church and State,
both Spiritual and Civil. These, as I apprehend,
will be the special Instruments which God will imploy
to work that happy and wonderful Change. When
God pleaseth to send such Princes and Leaders as
<hi>Zerobbabel,</hi> such Priests as <hi>Ioshua,</hi> such Teachers and
Scribes as <hi>Ezra,</hi> the Building of the House of God
will soon be finished. Such Great and Noble Spirits

                        </gap>t on work, will easily bring it to perfection.
The Gospel will be completely established, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
will be universally propagated, and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Righteousness will prevail every where in the
World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="736" facs="tcp:65397:377"/>
Yea, <hi>All</hi> of us are capable of promoting this
great Work more or less; and therefore we ought
to make it our Concern. Our earnest and constant
Prayer should be that <hi>this Kingdom may come,</hi> and
prevail and prosper; that <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it is, and under what Shape and Guise soever
it appears, may be demolished and destroyed; that
the Infidelity of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> may have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod;
that Vice and Immorality, Irreligion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness,
may be trod down; and that the Contrary
may be set up, and advanced, in all the Regions of
the World. And we are obliged to set forward
this blessed Design, not only by our Devotions,
but our Endeavours; and to hasten the actual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
of it in our Lives and Practices; that <hi>Iesus</hi>
may be seen to Reign among Men, and that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
may be at last the Catholick Interest of the
World. When it is come to this, you need not
doubt but such a State will last long. Being so well
founded, it is no wonder that it shall continue so
<hi>many Years.</hi> That Government is most remote from
Desolation, which keeps itself most free from Sin
and Vice.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, and Lastly, <hi>VNIVERSAL PEACE AND
VNITY</hi> crown all the foregoing Blessings. This
must needs be part of the Happiness of those Days;
because when the Names of <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> shall
cease, and all <hi>other Names of Difference</hi> shall be taken
away, and turn'd into that of <hi>Christian,</hi> there will
necessarily follow Peace and Concord; all Sidings
and Factions will be at an end, all Parties will be
reconciled. This will be partly the Effect and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of that <hi>clear Knowledge,</hi> which shall be the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of those Times. Isa. 11. 9. <hi>They shall not hurt,
nor destroy, in all my holy Mountain: For the Earth
shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord.</hi> It is this
that mitigates and pacifies the distemper'd Minds
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:65397:377"/>
of Men, and brings them to a peaceable and loving
Disposition; and thereby prevents unchristian
Feuds and Quarrels, whence spring Violence and
Bloodshed, and all manner of Evils, in the Lives of
Men. It is certain, that one great Sourse of those
many Quarrels and Disputes that are in the World,
is the <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Misapprehension</hi> of Persons. They
form not right Conceptions of Things, or they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
one another. Especially in Matters of Religion
this proves very troublesome, and makes a great
Disturbance, and miserably divides Mens Judgments
and Affections. But there shall be no such Thing
in that happy Age which is to come; because then
there will be a greater Light, and Men will have a
better Understanding of one another. Which will
in part be occasioned by that <hi>Vniversal Language</hi>
which shall be all the World over. We read, that
soon after the Flood, a Plurality of Tongues caused
a Dispersion, a Division of the Sons of Men: But
the Unity of Language will join them together in
one Communion. Their speaking the same Words
will be one way to unite them in the same Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions:
for by this means they may with ease and
freedom confer with one another, and compare their
Notions together, and thereby come to an entire
Agreement. This is so rational to conceive, that
we cannot but deem it almost impossible that there
should be an universal Converse and Peace without
it. When that wish'd for Period comes about, Men
being better inform'd of Things, shall lay aside
their false and mistaken Opinions; but especially all
Misapprehensions touching Religious Affairs shall
have an end, and consequently all Controversies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to them shall vanish: All Distinguishing, but
odious Names, whereby Men laboured to brand
one another, and to perpetuate their Grudges and
Antipathies shall be forgot. They shall no more
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:65397:378"/>
revile, and (which is worse) persecute one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They shall not call down Fire from Heaven,
of fetch it up from Hell, to devour their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
In a Word, They shall no longer differ from
one another, but be all of one Mind and Perswasion.</p>
                     <p>This must needs be so upon another Account;
<hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>that Wisdom which is from above,</hi> is not
only <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>re,</hi> but <hi>Peaceable:</hi> Especially where that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
takes place in a very great Degree, there will
be as considerable a Portion of Peace and Amity.
True Godliness will extirpate all Rancour and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness,
all Dissention and Division, and will cause
the Christian Worshippers to be of one Heart. He
that purgeth his Church from Error and Vice, will
clear it also of all Distractions. This too ought to
be remembred, that the principal Disturber of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
the great Incendiary of the World, and who
made it his continual Business to soment Quarrels
and Divisions, shall be shut up, and imprisoned, all
the Time of that expected Reign. And though
some of this inferior Agents, who shall remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
may be soliciting a Revival of the Ancient Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions,
yet they shall be repulsed; or if some smaller
Disagreements shall at any time arise, they shall but
make way for a greater and more lasting Love. The
former Bickerings and Disgusts shall be heard of no
more, and (as the consequent of this) an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Calm shall obtain upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of this the Evangelical King speaks, in</hi> Psalm 72.
<hi>which is a lively Description of</hi> Christ's Kingdom, <hi>and
among other</hi> Properties <hi>and</hi> Privileges <hi>of it, it is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
that there shall be</hi> abundance of Peace so long as
the Moon endureth, <hi>v. 7. Of this the</hi> Evangelical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>frequently speaks; as in Chap. 2. v.</hi> 4. They shall
beat their Swords into Plough-shares, and their Spears into
Pruning-hooks: Nation shall not lift up Sword against
Nation, neither shall they learn War any more. <hi>The</hi>
                        <pb n="739" facs="tcp:65397:378"/>
Messias <hi>is call'd</hi> the Prince of Peace, <hi>Ch. 9. v.</hi> 6. of
the increase of whose Government and Peace, there shall
be no end, <hi>v.</hi> 7. The Work of Righteousness shall be Peace,
and the Effect of Righteousness Quietness and Assurance
for ever. And my People shall dwell in a peaceable Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and in sure Dwellings, and in quiet Resting-places.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 32. 17, 18. Thine Eyes shall see Ierusalem a
quiet Habitation, <hi>Ch. 33. v. 20. The whole 60th.
Chapter is a Prophecy of the</hi> Peaceable <hi>and</hi> Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>State of Christ's Church. In Ch. 65. 25. there
are almost the very same Words which I before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
from Ch. 11. v. 6. 9. To this belongs that of</hi>
Ieremah, <hi>Ch. 32. v.</hi> 39. I will give them one heart and
one way.</p>
                     <p>I know it will be said that some of these Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are to be understood of the Times after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
those Times of the Gospel which are now past.
I do not wholly deny this; for it is my Judgment
that they are to be interpreted concerning either of
those Times, and likewise concerning that <hi>Mill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nnial</hi>
State which is to come. We may truly say, that
these and several other Predictions of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are to be understood in a double sense, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
there is a double fulfilling of them. They
have in some measure been accomplish'd; but the
Full and Utmost Extent of them reacheth to that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Period of the Gospel-Oeconomy, and so they
shall be more amply verified then. There shall then
be no hurting or destroying; there shall be a Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Wars and Bloodshed, from Violence and
Persecution, yea, from all Thoughts and Attempts
of them. For in those Halcyon Days Christians shall
be inspired with a peaceable and loving Temper, and
shall be made like unto their Master, who is the
Great Pattern of Love. The Modern Jews acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that it was a Celebrated Saying among the
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:65397:379"/>
Old Rabbins, that <hi>the Days of the Messias shall be one
whole perpetual Sabbath.</hi> This is the very thing we
are speaking of; Christ shall bring with him such a
<hi>Rest</hi> as was never in the World before: They shall
enjoy a <hi>Sabbath</hi> of a Thousand Years. Let us be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for this Happy Time, and let us be hast'ning
it by what proper Methods and Arts we can. Let
us lay the <hi>Axe</hi> to that <hi>Root of Bitterness</hi> which hath
spread it self among us, and taken such hold of some
Men's Earthly Natures. Let us compose our selves
into a quiet posture, and effectually promote Peace
and Good Will in the World. Let us bring out, and
make use of our Juleps to check that fierce, that Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish
Distemper which reigns among too many.
Let us endeavour by mild and cooling Applications
to accommodate Differences, to reconcile disagreeing
Parties (especially in Matters referring to Religion,
but so as not to betrary the Truth) to allay all passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Heats, and to discountenance all wilful Authors
of Division.</p>
                     <p>And as the Word <hi>Peace</hi> in Scripture signifies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Usage of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> all manner of
Outward Blessings, so here in the present Case it is
to be taken in that comprehensive way. In that
Kingdom of Christ on Earth, there shall no kind of
Earthly Conveniences and Advantages be wanting
which shall be useful to the great Ends and Purposes
of that Blessed State. But as for any other; <hi>viz.</hi> such
as are serviceable to Undue Pleasures, to Lust and
Wantonness, to Vanity and Pride, to Effeminacy
and Luxury, no Man of sober Thoughts can reckon
them in the number of those Worldly good Things
which the Pious shall hereafter enjoy: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must condemn that Narrative which some
have given of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> as too sensual and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.
But we may with Truth and Soberness assert
this, That there shall be a concurrence of all those
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:65397:379"/>
things which render Men's Lives truly pleasant, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
and joyful. It is part of the Description
of that Millennary Jubilee, that <hi>they shall come to Sion
with Songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads: They
shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow, and sighing
shall flee away,</hi> Isai. 35. 10. And again, <hi>Ch. 65.
v. 17. Behold, I create new Heavens, and a new Earth</hi>
(which questionless is meant of this Glorious Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and might have been alledged among the
other Texts as a Proof of it) and then it follows, <hi>I
create Ierusalem a rejoicing, and her People a ioy. The
voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the
voice of crying,</hi> v. 18, 19.</p>
                     <p>And if we go back to <hi>Ch. 9. v.</hi> 3. we shall find
that this <hi>rejoicing</hi> and this <hi>joy</hi> shall be entire. <hi>Thou
hast multiplied the Nation, and not increased the ioy,</hi> i. e.
heretofore Joy and Sorrow were mingled; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that Nation of the Jews was visited in Mercy,
at other times it tasted of God's Judgments: <hi>They
ioy before thee according to the ioy in Harvest, and as
Men rejoice when they divide the Spoil;</hi> i. e. there was
in the times past a Medley of Joy and Trouble, of
Gladness and Fear, as in the Services of War and
Harvest; but when a <hi>Child shall be born to us,</hi> when
<hi>a Son shall be given,</hi> and <hi>the Government shall be upon
his Shoulders,</hi> v. 6. then there shall be Joy without
any allay, then there shall be such a perfect State
that nothing shall be able to impair it. I know most
Interpreters expound the Place otherwise, and make
<hi>the Ioy in Harvest</hi> to be exceeding Great Joy, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
all other. But I crave leave to dissent from
the common Exposition, and to understand this
Passage after the manner before-mentioned; <hi>viz.</hi>
that whereas heretofore they joy'd <hi>according to the
Ioy of Harvest,</hi> i. e. their Joys were mix'd with
Hardships, they were accompanied with Sweat and
Toil: And besides, the Joy of Harvest doth not
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:65397:380"/>
                        <hi>last long;</hi> for the Husbandman, as blith and cheary
as he is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> must soon return to his wonted Circle of
Pains and Labour;) Whereas under the preceding
Dispensations there was no Entire and Undisturbed
Joy, now it shall be otherwise, there shall be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
and Uninterrupted Serenity, without any
dashes of a contrary Nature; for as <hi>Christ's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
increases,</hi> v. 7. so (as it follows there) the
<hi>Peace,</hi> i. e. the Success and Prosperity of it shall
<hi>increase,</hi> and <hi>have no end.</hi> This is the Happiness of
the Subjects of that Blessed Kingdom, who are under
the Sceptre of <hi>the Prince of Peace,</hi> as he is stiled,
<hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>This in general; but, more particularly, the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Security of their <hi>Habitations,</hi> their Success in
all their <hi>Labours,</hi> and their lasting <hi>Fruition</hi> of them
are mentioned as the Attendants of this Happy
Time, <hi>v. 21, 22, 23. They shall build Houses, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
them: And they shall plant Vineyards, and eat the
Fruit of them. Mine Elect shall long enjoy the work of
their hands. They shall not labour in vain,</hi> &amp;c. These
are the Blessings of that Adult State of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Farther, there will be greater <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Body</hi> than ordinarily. I will not be positive
that as in the first Ages of the World, so now, there
will be some of a <hi>Gigantick</hi> Stature; but this is not
to be doubted of, that there shall be bodily Strength
and Vigour in an unusual degree. It is one of the
Privileges of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> (for in the large
and extensive sense it is spoken of that Place and
State) that <hi>the Inhabitants shall not say, I am sick.
Isai.</hi> 33. 24. Many Exorbitancies before were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Cause of Corporal Weakness, and divers
sorts of Maladies and Diseases: But now those shall
generally be removed; and a sound and hale Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
shall be given them; for their Bodies shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to their Souls. The whole Tour of the Blood
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:65397:380"/>
shall be laudably performed: There shall be a due
and regular Exercise of the natural, vital, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Functions: And all Persons shall be healthful
and vivacious, brisk and sprightly. This will be
the more credible if we consider that the <hi>Curse</hi>
brought upon the <hi>Earth</hi> by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
continued, shall be revers'd. The <hi>Soil</hi> every
where shall become fertile, and give its increase free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and plentifully, and all the Fruits and Products
of the Earth shall be (not only numerous, but) whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.
God made all the Creatures <hi>Good</hi> at first, as
we expresly find in the repeated Approbation of
this their <hi>Goodness,</hi> Gen. 1. And they shall be <hi>Good</hi>
at last; for the World shall be restored to its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
State, and the Earth it self shall be renewed.
And as for those Living Creatures which are Food
for Mankind, they shall arrive to greater degrees of
Perfection than formerly, and consequently shall
yield more laudable and generous Nourishment than
heretofore. Besides that the continued Health of
those Times will depend much upon the excellent
Temper of the <hi>Air,</hi> which shall then be agreeable
to humane Bodies, and have no ill Ferments from
the continual Vicissitudes and Successions of too much
Heat or too much Cold. To which may be added
that the <hi>Heavenly influences,</hi> as well as the Temper
of the Earth shall be meliorated: And so even in a
literal sence there shall be <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and a <hi>New
Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the consequence of all this, the People of those
days shall be <hi>long-liv'd:</hi> Which I gather from <hi>Isai.
65. 20. There shall be no more an Infant of days, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>or an
old. Man that hath not fill'd his days.</hi> For though this
Dispensation be no exemption from Mortality,
though <hi>Christ's Reign</hi> doth not unthrone and depose
the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> yet it wards off his fatal Blows
for a long Season: And perhaps some may reach the
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:65397:381"/>
long Ages of those that lived before the Flood.
And this shall happen not only from the Nature of
the thing it self, but by the singular Favour of God:
For as before in a judicial way he sometimes short'ned
Men's Lives, so now in the way of a Blessing he is
pleased to extend them to a great length. Which
perhaps is the meaning of what follows in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Chapter, <hi>v. 22. As the days of a Tree</hi> (a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd
Tree) <hi>are the days of my People.</hi> But supposing
that this is not the strict import of the Text (which
I submit to the Thoughts of the Judicious) yet it is
certain from the reason of the thing it self that those
Happy Ages shall abound with all things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the Welfare and Happiness of the <hi>Body</hi> as
well as of the Soul, and consequently <hi>Longaevity</hi>
shall be one of the Felicities of those times: And I
doubt not but it will be procured by a perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the true Causes and Springs of Long Life,
and of the more immediate Sourses of Diseases. For
<hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> (as well as all other Parts of True
Philiosophy) shall be then improved to the utmost,
and a <hi>Vertuoso</hi> shall be no Rarity. Especially the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all <hi>Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Minerals,</hi> wherein are laid
up the great Restoratives of Life, shall by exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Experiments be laid open to the World: And
the use of all the <hi>Vessels</hi> in the body (which now
we have but an imperfect insight into, and some of
which we know nothing of) shall be exactly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
And whatever else, relating either to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or Art, or Morality, shall be conducible to this
great End before-mentioned, shall not be wanting;
no, not that which is the choicest and most sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Conserver of Life, <hi>viz.</hi> a well-temper'd Joy
and Chearfulness, a ferene and placid Spirit, than
which nothing can be more serviceable to uphold and
maintain the vital Congruity, to nourish the Lamp
of Life, and to give a lasting Vivacity to Nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="745" facs="tcp:65397:381"/>
And from the several Particulars we may gather
this also, that there will be <hi>a greater Number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
upon the Earth in that Sabbatick Reign than there
is now. This follows from what hath been said
concerning that Universal Peace, that Extraordinary
Measure of Bodily Health and Strength, that Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men's Lives, which shall be the Blessing of
those Days. Upon the more Cessation of Wars and
Slaughters, of Pestilence and Famine, &amp;c. (which
are wont so visibly to diminish the number of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind)
there must needs be a great length'ning out
of Men's Lives, there must be a vast Increase of the
People of the World. The whole Earth will be
replenish'd and even crowded with Inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>This will make amends (as I suggested before)
for the great multitudes of Men that have in several
Ages perished, and gone to the Infernal Regions:
For within the compass of this Happy Time wherein
we suppose Mankind to be thus extremely multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and all of them (excepting some very few)
to be holy and Religious Persons, there will be a
larger Stock of Inhabitants for Heaven than there
was of those who in all the preceding Times of the
World were thrust down to the contrary Place.
And thus, which way soever we look, this Blessed
Dispensation shall be eminent for the Natural as
well as the Moral and Religious Emendation of all
Things, for Temporal and Earthly Blessings as well
as those that are Spiritual and Heavenly, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
bettering of the World, and for the Provision
it makes for the future. Mankind being free'd from
all Dangers, Mischiefs, and Troubles, shall enjoy
an undisturbed Peace, Quiet, and Repose, with a
Freedom from all Pain and Sickness: And their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
shall be more vigorous, and their Beauty more
lasting than ever before. Which shall be attended
with all outward Conveniencies, Comforts, and
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:65397:382"/>
Refreshments of what nature soever, together with
inward Peace, Pleasure, and Satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing more I will venture to add, as
belonging (I verily believe) to this Happy State I
have been describing: There shall be a Peace not
only between Rational Creatures and their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
but between these and the most Salvage
Brutes, <hi>i. e.</hi> those Brutes which heretofore were so.
For now the hurtful Disposition and cruel Nature of
all such Animals shall be taken from them, and they
shall become mild and gentle, tame and tractable.
This I take to be the meaning of that Prophecy, <hi>Isai.
11. 6, 7. The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the
Leopard shall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf, and
the young Lion, and the Fatling together, and a little
Child shall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear shall
feed, their young ones shall lie down together: And the
Lion shall eat Straw like the Ox; and the sucking Child
shall play on the hole of the Asp, and the weaned Child
shall put his hand on the Cockatrice-den: They shall not
hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain.</hi> Which Words
seem to me to be a clear Prediction concerning the
peaceable Temper which even the fiercest of the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
Herd shall be endued with in the last Times
of the World: Their former Antipathies, their
pristine Enmities shall cease, and they shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to that harmlessness and Innocence which were
at the first Creation. I know these Words are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
by Commentators understood of that Inward
Change which shall be made in Mens minds and hearts
by the powerful Influence of the Gospel: But I see
little or no Foundation for this Interpretation; for
I go upon this ground (which all sober Interpreters
of Scripture acknowledge and own) that there is no
reason to fly to a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> and <hi>Mystical</hi> Sense of
a Text, when it appears that there is a <hi>Literal</hi> one.
So it is here, there is no need of supposing any such
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:65397:382"/>
thing as Metaphors and Allegories, for the Words
in themselves, as interpreted according to the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
are very plain and intelligible. The Prophet
here gives an Account of the Peaceable Kingdom of
Christ, and tells us that this (among other things

shall <hi>lie down,</hi> and <hi>dwell,</hi> and <hi>feed together;</hi> they shall
neither prey upon one another, nor shall they be
hurtful to Men. Nothing could be more plainly
said to express the great Blessing and Privilege of
those last Days, when <hi>the Earth shall be full of the
Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea,</hi>
which are the very next Words to those which I
have set down, and shew to what Period of Time
they relate.</p>
                     <p>And that we are to understand the Words in a
Literal meaning may be further proved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
from the brief Repetition of this Prophecy in
chap. <hi>65. v. 25. The Wolf and the Lamb shall feed
together, and the Lion shall eat Straw like the Bullock,
and dust shall be the Serpents Meat, they shall not hurt
nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain.</hi> It is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the Prophet would have <hi>repeated</hi> this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and urged it in the <hi>same manner,</hi> and on
the <hi>same occasion, viz.</hi> when he was foretelling the
Happy Reign of the <hi>Messias</hi> in the laft Days (for he
brings it in under the time of the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and
the <hi>New Earth,</hi> v. 17. and it is the close of the
Description of the State of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> in
this Chapter, most part of which I had occasion to
mention before) it is not probable, I say, that the
Prophet would have reiterated this Prediction in the
very same way and circumstances that he mentioned
it before; if the Words were a meer <hi>Metaphor</hi> or
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:65397:383"/>
                        <hi>Allegory,</hi> and not to be understood in a downright
Literal Sense, he would have varied the way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing,
and have let us know that a Spiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is to be understood. But indeed the very <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Tenour</hi> and <hi>Import</hi> of the Words themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us that they are not <hi>Allegorical,</hi> but are to be
taken according to the obvious signification of the
Terms, viz. That in those Happy Times the
very Brutes (the most Furious and Implacable of
them) shall be reconciled to Man, and likewise to
themselves mutually; in order to which they shall
have a new way of sustaining themselves, the <hi>Wolf</hi>
and the <hi>Lamb</hi> shall have the <hi>same Food</hi> (that's the
meaning of <hi>Feeding together)</hi> such as the Earth
affords; the <hi>Lion</hi> shall have the same Provender
with the <hi>Bullock;</hi> and the <hi>Serpent,</hi> which used to
hurt other Beasts, as well as Men, shall be content
with the Food which was at first appointed him,
<hi>Gen. 3. 14.</hi> In short, the Irrational Creatures shall
neither devour Men, nor one another (as was usual
before) but they shall become Serviceble and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to Man, and shall be at Peace among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
This may be censur'd perhaps as a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of this Prophecy, but I believe no
Wife and Intelligent Man will condemn it for its
Novelty, but rather imbrace it because it is so
plain, easie and intelligible in it self, because it
agrees so exactly with the Context, and because it
is so suitable, yea so absolutely requisite to that
State which I have Discours'd of, wherein every thing
shall be in a better condition that it was, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the very Nature of the <hi>Beasts</hi> shall be
chang'd, that they may be what they were at
first, that is, not Harmful or Terrible; as appears
from <hi>Eve's</hi> Conversing with the Serpent. and in a
Word, there shall be such a Catholick change as shall
bring with it an accumulation of all Temporal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="749" facs="tcp:65397:383"/>
But this must be said (that I may not be mistaken
by some Persons) that though these <hi>Earthly</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Coveniencies</hi> shall be in the Millennary Reign,
yet they are the least part of it, nay, they may be
said to be the Attendants rather than Parts of it,
for it is the Confluence of <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Divine Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi>
that gives Denomination to this Happy Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
it is this that makes it chiefly to be Admired
and Esteem'd: And those other things which I have
mention'd which relate to the Body, and which are
but Appendages of this State, are wholly in order to
the <hi>Better Enjoyments,</hi> and are no farther to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
than as they are some ways subservient to
these. This I insert, that we may not deceive our
selves about the Notion of this Happy State which I
am speaking of, that we may not fancy it to be mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an Earthly Paradise, that we may not think Christ's
Kingdom to be of this World. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, it is a certain Truth that <hi>all manner of
Good Things</hi> inhanse the Comsort and Pleasure of
that Blessed Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>In fine, that which gives the Value to all things
relating to the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> is, that <hi>the Glory of
God Enlightens it, and the Lamh is the Light thereof,</hi>
Rev. 21. 23. That is, it is the Eternal <hi>Father</hi> and
<hi>Son</hi> (not excluding the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>) and not any
Created Being or Enjoyment, though never so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
that can constitute the Blessedness of this
State. In which respect it is said, <hi>The City hath no
need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it:</hi>
that is, all Temporal and Mundane Felicities (be they
never so bright) are useless and insignificant, in
comparison of the fruition of <hi>GOD</hi> himself. I take
this to be the meaning of St. <hi>Iohn's</hi> Words, and
not what is suggested by the late<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Whiston.</note> 
                        <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>orist,</hi> viz.
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:65397:384"/>
That the Inhabitants of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> on Earth
shall be wholly destitute of those great Luminaries
of Heaven; there will be no use of the Light of the
<hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> but they shall be supplied by a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Bodily Light. Which mistaken Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
was caused by not attending to the place
in the <hi>Prophet Isaiah,</hi> whence this without doubt was
borrowed, <hi>Isai. 60. 19. The Sun shall be no more thy
Light by Day, neither for Brightness shall be Moon give
Light unto thee.</hi> And yet in the next Verse it is
said, <hi>Thy Sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy
Moon withdraw it self:</hi> Which evidently shews that
the former Words are not to be understood Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
that is, concerning those <hi>Celestial Bodies;</hi>
otherwise there is a plain Contradiction in those
Texts. The true intent then of the foresaid Words
is no other than this, that the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and
all the other Temporal Blessings of the <hi>Millennary</hi>
Revolution, are Mean and Inconsiderable in respect of
the Transcendent Glory, Splendor and Influence of
the <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> who alone is able to render that
State Happy. When that desired Day comes the
full Vertue of <hi>Shiloh's Name</hi> shall shine forth, which
denotes not only <hi>Salvation</hi> (which that Time shall
prepare Men for, above any other) but <hi>Peace</hi> or
<hi>Tranquility</hi> both inward and outward, and (which
is much more extensive) <hi>Prosperity</hi> or <hi>Happiness,</hi>
which comprehends in it all things that are rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
Desireable in the Life of Man upon Earth, as
well as in the Mansions above.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have briefly represented to you those
things which may reasonably be suppos'd to be the
inseparable Attendants of the <hi>Happy Reign of Christ
on Earth,</hi> which is the highest Exaltation of the
<hi>Christian Oeconomy.</hi> It hath been with some doubting
and struggling that I have said so much, for Holy
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:65397:384"/>
Writ seems some times to say, that<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 14. 22. Rom. 8. 17. 2 Tim. 2. 11. 3. 12. Heb. 12. 6, 7, 8. 1 Pet. 1. 7. Jam. 1. 12.</note> the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church is such, that it shall not be wholly
free from Trouble and Calamity, but that it shall
always, or for the most part, suffer from the
Wicked. When I perused those several Predictions
concerning the Sufferings and Persecutions of the
Church, I stagger'd as to my belief of this Future
Quiet State on Earth, I was apt to think that the
World is now wearing off, and that we shall have
an end of it without any such thing. But then
when I consider'd that those Places of Holy Scripture
which foretell the Calamities and Distresses of the
Church of Christ may have respect only to the Times
which preceed those Thousand Years, I was again
induced to believe that there shall be such a State
as I have represented, that Christ will set up his
Kingdom in a more Illustrious and Effectual manner
than ever, and that this Kingdom shall be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with lasting Peace and Righteousness, with the
General Conversion of Jews and Gentiles, and the
Ruin of Anti-christ.</p>
                     <p>As to some <hi>Particular Circumstances,</hi> which I have
mention'd, relating to this Prosperous State of the
Christian Church, I am not Positive. It hath pleased
God to deliver things of <hi>this</hi> Nature Darkly and
Mystically; and there are no express places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
on which a certain and unquestionable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of them can be grounded, because we have
no <hi>sure Word</hi> to ascertain our Determination. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as to the <hi>Particular Way</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of the
things I have been Discoursing of, I deliver nothing
with Confidence. It is the <hi>main</hi> of the <hi>Dispensation</hi>
that I assert, and which I verily believe; though I
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:65397:385"/>
censure no Man for thinking or saying otherwise.
I am sensible of this, that when we see how the
World is at this Day, we may be enclined to
think there is no probability of this Great Change.
There seems to be little likelihood at present of this
Happy Reign in other parts of the World, as well
as among our selves; for we seem to be every Day
degenerating more and more, and we run further
from that excellent Temper and Genius which are
required in that Future Paradise. But then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that this is to be accomplish'd by a Divine
Arm and Conduct, and shall be the work of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in a singular and particular Degree. The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Arbitrator and Manager of the World can
of a sudden dispel all Difficulties, and alter the
Course of the Universe, and frame Men's Minds as
he pleaseth. When we remember how mean and
despicable Christianity was at first, but how strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it spread it self afterwards, and made its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
through the whole World against the greatest
Opposition imaginable, we may then believe the
same may happen again, and that what hath
been foretold concerning that Glorious State may
be fulfill'd. Thus I will not despair of that happy
Time.</p>
                     <p>Both <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Mahometism,</hi> or either of them,
may for a time decay and grow less, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
strength; Or perhaps one or both of them
may remain without any Diminution entire. There
may be a <hi>Superfoetation</hi> in the Mother of Harlots,
she may conceive and bring forth a New, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
the Earth with her Children. It may be the
<hi>Reformation</hi> which hath been begun and set forward
in some Parts of the <hi>Christian World</hi> may be put
back: Papal Superstition and Tyranny may return
again, and <hi>Rome</hi> may <hi>sit a Queen, and know no Sorrow</hi>
but what she creates to the true Professors of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:65397:385"/>
One would be apt to think as much upon
reading what is said concerning the <hi>Two Witnesses,</hi>
Rev. 11. 7. <hi>When they shall have finish'd the Testimony</hi>
(viz. at the end of 42. Months or 1260 Years, the
time of the Anti-christian Reign) <hi>the Beast that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth
out of the Bottomless Pit shall make War against
them, and overcome them, and kill them;</hi> whereupon
there is great <hi>rejoycing over them and making merry,</hi>
v. 10. It may come to pass that the <hi>Seven Hills</hi> may be
exalted higher than ever, and the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi>
depress'd and trampled on. Christianity may (as
Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> presaged) hoise Sail for <hi>America,</hi> the
Gospel may leave us to go to them, and we may be
half Pagans before it comes to us again. Or, if we
hold fast-the Faith, we may be forced to part with
every thing else that is dear to us: It may be our
lot to undergo all Dangers, Calamities, Outrages
and Persecutions before that Blessed <hi>Sabbatism</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives.
There may be a very Dark Night before
that Lightsome Day is seen: But at last it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
yea shine forth, and the World shall be every
ways the better for it. Yea, it may (and I hope
will) shew it self in God's good time without any
such Sad and Tragical Prologue to it as this.</p>
                     <p>I have ventured to offer my Conjectures about it,
and the freedom I have taken will not be disliked,
I conceive, by Persons of sober Minds. In my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that is a very Curious and Notable Saying of
Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> (in his Epistle to the Reader before his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the Apocalypse</hi>) speaking of the interpreting of
the Prophetical Writings and other Obscure Matters
in Scripture, <q>Unless,<note n="†" place="bottom">Nisi in hisce talibus liberiùs paulò sentiendi, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="754" facs="tcp:65397:386"/>
to us to be somewhat free in our Thoughts and
Opinions, yea even in our Errors and Mistakes
sometimes about these things, we shall never clear
our Passage to those Profound and Hidden Secrets
of Truth.</q> Accordingly I have freely suggested
my Thoughts, and if therein I have represented
some things amiss, let it be remember'd that it was
in the pursuit of Truth, and of that Truth which
it was difficult to attain to; or rather let it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
whether Truth be not here found out by that
which some interpret a Mistake. I declare I am not
Dogmatical in what I have said, nor will I perswade
others to sit down with Peremptory Confidence that
this is the certain meaning of all the Prophecies in
Scripture before alledged. But then this must be said,
there are several things <hi>highly Probable,</hi> of which we
have no <hi>Absolute Certainty;</hi> and This that I have
been Discoursing of is of that Nature. Many Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
in <hi>Holy Writ</hi> do exceedingly favour it; and
there are no Contemptible <hi>Reasons</hi> to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>line us to a
belief of it. And when we have both <hi>Scripture</hi> and
<hi>Rational Arguments</hi> on our side, it is more than half
of the Opinions which make a very plausible shew
in the World can really lay claim to.</p>
                     <p>If, after all, you enquire concerning the <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
and <hi>Determinate Time</hi> when this Sabbatick State
shall begin, my Answer in brief is, That I cannot,
neither will I attempt to assign any such thing.
When I say <hi>I cannot,</hi> my meaning is that I apprehend
no possible way of doing it in a Certain and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
way; for otherwise I could (as some have
done) pretend to present the Reader with a Punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Calculation of the Time when these things shall
happen. Perhaps I might say without Ostentation,
that I have made enquiry into the <hi>Chronology</hi> of the
Scriptures as well as others, and have considered
all that any Writers of Note have said on this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:65397:386"/>
and have made search into these Mysteries my
self; but after all I declare that I find no Foundation
for a Precise and Individual Assignation of Time.
In general we know Christ's Kingdom on Earth shall
commence when the <hi>Seventh Angel</hi> soundeth his
Trumpet, for then <hi>the Kingdoms of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ,</hi> Rev.
11. 15. But when this <hi>Last Angel</hi> shall do this Office
we are ignorant, though a<note n="†" place="bottom">Mons. Jurien.</note> Learned Foreigner
lately is confident, that this is the Time. But we
see he had but little ground for it, for his Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have proved false, though he thought he had
some more than ordinary Foundation (in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
and Events of these late times) for what he
offer'd. And he hath been follow'd by some of our
own Countrey Men, who presumed to assign the
Punctual and Precise time when those Prophetick
Passages in the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were to be
accomplish'd; as if they, above all other Men, had
a Key to those Divine Secrets, and were authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to unlock them. I look upon this as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of a well-meant Mistake, of their misapplying
some <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Texts, which they were betray'd
into by apprehending that the Circumstances which
the <hi>Publick Affairs</hi> were in at that time were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to those Prophecies. But certainly this Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is very blamable, because it may give occasion
to ill-minded Men to disbelieve all the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> because the Period of
these, which was with so great Confidence deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
is found to be untrue. Nay, indeed it hath
sometimes happen'd that when Positive Men have
peremptorily set a certain Year it hath generally
proved a worse Time than ordinary, on one account
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:65397:387"/>
or other; instead of a welcome issue of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
some very unusual and dismal thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
upon the Publick Stage, as it were a doom
for such rash Prognostications. Here therefore ought
to be a great deal of Caution, Prudence and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.
But so it is, we may observe that it is the
way of these <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Men, like the Clocks of
<hi>Basil,</hi> always to anticipate the time; they are
too hasty in fixing the Periods of Prophetick Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences,
either because they impatiently desire the
approach of them, or because they are ambitious of
being thought the first Discoverers of these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</p>
                     <p>In the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> the Time of the
<hi>Beasts</hi> Reign seems to be determined, <hi>viz.</hi> 1260.
<hi>Days,</hi> Rev. 11. 3. 12. 6. <hi>i. e.</hi> (as all grant) so
many <hi>Years</hi> (for that is the <hi>Prophetick</hi> way of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering)
which are the same with <hi>the Time and Times
and half a Time,</hi> Dan. 7. 25. Rev. 12. 14. and with
the 42. <hi>Months (i. e.</hi> of Years) Rev. 11. 2. 13. 5. Now
if we could tell when the <hi>Apocalyptick Beast</hi> began, we
might, from what is here expresly set down, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
know its end; but the former being no where

Modest Pen fixes the beginning of the
Beasts Reign in the Year of our Lord 456. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
by adding 1260. to that number makes the
end of it to be <hi>A. D.</hi> 1716. But according to this
way of Computing, the <hi>Papal Beast</hi> was in being
before there was <hi>Popery</hi> (properly so called) in the
World, which is sufficient to invalidate that Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
However, if those Numbers refer to the
end of the <hi>Beast</hi> (as it is certain they do) I agree
with this Writer that it cannot be very far off. But as
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:65397:387"/>
to the precise time, we may conjecture, but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be certain: It may be our Chronology is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
it may be the Account which we have of
Years is not Exact, and consequently our Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
cannot be accurate: Or suppose they were,
yet our Saviour acquaints us, when he speaks of
such Affairs, that the time shall be <hi>shortned for the
Elects sake,</hi> Mat. 24. 22. So that our exactest Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology
will not avail us then. I have nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to say concerning the <hi>Punctual Date</hi> of this
Notable Revolution which hath been the matter of
our Disquisition. Yea, perhaps it is impossible for
any Man to know it infallibly, I mean without a
particular Revelation. Yet I will not, as the <hi>Iews,</hi>
curse those who Calculate these Times, but rather
wish that Men would be Sober and Modest in this, as
in all other difficult and intricate Points. It is folly
to be over-curious and sollicitous here, but it is no
less than Presumption and Arrogance to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory.
This should suffice us that there is a
time when these things shall be accomplished.</p>
                     <p>In the mean season, let us comfort our selves with
the expectation of that Blessed State of the Church.
Let it be remembred that however things go now,
there shall be a better Face of them hereafter; and
though we may not live to the arrival, much less
the fruition of it, yet it is some solace to our Minds,
that, with <hi>Moses,</hi> we have a sight (at a distance)
of that Blessed <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Promise; in
which all the Defects and Declensions that have been
either in Nature or Morals shall be repair'd and
amended. Nor doth the ill posture of things at
present in the least retard my hopes or belief of a
change for the better; for though it sounds like a
Paradox, yet it is an experienced Truth, that things
farthest off are nearest. Look into the <hi>Calendar</hi> and
you will see that <hi>December,</hi> which is at the greatest
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:65397:388"/>
distance from <hi>Ianuary,</hi> is the next Month to it. See
it in Nature, when the Night is darkest it is nighest
break of Day. Look on the Globe of the Earth,
and you will find the extream parts of the <hi>East</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
on the <hi>West.</hi> And so it is here, when things
seem to be most remote from this Revolution they
are nearest to it. Extremity proves successful some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.

low before they can arrive to a sound and perfect
Constitution. Our weak, languishing and perishing
State may by the Divine Disposal make way for our
Health, and prove the fore-runner and occasion of
our lasting Happiness. Though the World in some
Ages is palpably worse than in others, yet (bating
the <hi>Last Scene</hi> of all) when in respect of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
prevailing of <hi>Vice,</hi> it seems to be worst of
all, as at this time, even then it is tending to the
best; for this hath been always observable since
the first Creation, that the greatest Corruptions and
Apostasies have made way for the most remarkable
Reformations; and accordingly, the horrid Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy
of these present times (not only among our
selves, but in all Christian Countries) is one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to incline me to believe there will be a mighty
alteration. Irreligion, Impiety and Atheism are
now making their greatest and last Efforts, before
that Glorious Day (which I have been describing)
arrives. An Universal Prophaneness is to preceed
and usher in an Universal Holiness and Purity. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Wars and Commotions, Divisions and
Contentions in Churches and States are the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of a General Peace and Repose. The World
will not go off thus as it is, but a more pleasant and

things are yet to be done, that though our Blessed
Saviour shall not descend from Heaven till the Day

he shall come and Reign here a Thousand Years, and

The Last Days, before the End of the

be exceeding Perillous and Calamitous. Christ
comes to Judgment. The Conflagration of

                     <p>I Am unwilling to go off from this Pleasant Scene,
especially to one that is so Black and Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
as that which follows. But the uncontrollable
Wisdom and Providence of Heaven leads us to it,
and therefore we must be obsequious to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
I proceed then to the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> Part
of the <hi>Evangelical Dispensation,</hi> namely that which
immediately preceedeth the Coming of Christ to
Judgment. For I have shew'd before that it hath had
its <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Childhood,</hi> its <hi>Youth,</hi> its <hi>Manhood</hi> or
<hi>Full Growth,</hi> and now come its last and feeble Years.
Wherefore I call this the <hi>Old Age of Christianity,</hi> for
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:65397:389"/>
now it miserably Declineth and grows Weak and
Decrepid. Now the World degenerates again, and
in a short time it becomes very Wicked and Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

at last upon Earth some very Bad Men, out of which
Brood afterwards, as soon as Satan shall be set at
liberty, and come to hatch them, there shall arise
a Deadly Generation of Vipers, a Cursed increase
of the most profligate Sinners, who will be set upon
Mischief, and will invade and wast the Church, and
make it their work to Deceive and Seduce the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
or rather <hi>Satan,</hi> who sets them on work, is
said here to do it, <hi>v. 8, 9. He shall go out to deceive

to lift up his Horn again. I do not mean that
any of those individual Persons who acted before
shall now appear, for they are secured: <hi>The Beast,</hi>
as well as <hi>the False Prophet, is in the Lake of Fire and
Brimstone,</hi> v. 10. But there shall be those that shall
revive the old <hi>Roman</hi> Tyranny and Superstitions,
and shall join their Forces with those of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi>
Faction. Both these Parties shall arise and
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:65397:390"/>
shew themselves soon after the thousand years are
ended: And the Prince of the Infernal Daemons, who
had been imprison'd and chain'd up all that space,
shall be Head and Commander of them, and <hi>gather
them to Battle:</hi> Their <hi>Numbers</hi> shall be exceeding
great, even <hi>like the Sand of the Sea,</hi> insomuch that
they shall cover all the Earth as it were: (for that
is meant by their going up <hi>on the breadth of the Earth</hi>)
And they shall lay close Siege to the <hi>Beloved City,</hi>
that Place whither the Saints, the Beloved of God,
shall fly for Refuge: Or the whole Church of Christ,
the Visible Body and Society of the Faithful, which
shall be left at that time may be understood by <hi>the
Beloved City.</hi> In a very lamentable and wretched
Condition they shall be, you may imagine, all the
time of this <hi>Gogick</hi> and <hi>Magogick War,</hi> and the <hi>Siege</hi>
which accompanieth it. It cannot be expressed what
Streights the Saints are reduced to, what Calamities
they undergo, what Miseries they indure.</p>
                     <p>And This is but agreeable to what our Blessed
Lord foretold of the Times immediately preceding
the Day of Judgment. He hath assured us that
those Days shall be very remarkable both in respect
of Sin and Suffering. As to the former, when he
compares them to<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 24. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>the Days of Noah,</hi> in which the
Old World gave themselves up wholly to their
Pleasures, and forgat God, and defied his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
he sheweth how Corrupt and Wicked the
Last Times shall be. So that Interrogatory of our
Saviour, <hi>Luk. 18. 8. When the Son of Man cometh,
shall be find Faith on the Earth?</hi> is a downright Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and signifies that he shall not find Faith upon
Earth: That is, not only (as some interpret it)
the <hi>Faith</hi> even of God's Servants shall be very Weak
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:65397:391"/>
and Little before the Last Coming of Christ; the
Saints themselves having been persecuted and haras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Wicked shall faint and flag: They shall
scarcely believe the Promise of his Coming; they
shall almost despond that Christ will help and deliver
them: But the meaning rather seems to be This,
that <hi>Faithfulness</hi> (here called <hi>Faith</hi>) shall be very
rare upon Earth, Sincertiy and Truth shall be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Lying, Perfidiousness, Dissembling, and
(which is the Consequent of those) inward Hatred
and Malice, and all outward Injustice, Violence, and
Oppression shall come in their place. And so in
another place<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 24. 12.</note> Christ foretells that not long before
the Day of Judgment <hi>Iniquity shall abound,</hi> and <hi>the Love of many shall wax cold:</hi> For this is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
that the Signs foregoing the Destruction of
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and of the Coming of Christ, are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
in that Four and twentieth Chapter of
St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> Or we may say, the former Signs
were to be repeated, and more fully display'd in the
Latter Event.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour likewise fets forth the State of the
Last Days before the End of the World, not only
as extremely Sinful, abounding with great Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and universal Corruption of Life, but as most
Afflictive and Dangerous, most Distressed and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous.
<hi>There shall be</hi> (saith he) <hi>distress of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
with perplexity, the Sea and the Waves roaring,
Mens hearts failing them for fear,</hi> Luk. 21. 25, 26.
Yea, Those Words of Christ in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 21. are
applicable here, for the reason beforementioned;
<hi>Then shall be great Tribulation, such as was not since the
beginning of the World to this time, no, nor ever shall
be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="765" facs="tcp:65397:391"/>And now the Fore-runners of that Great and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Day of the Lord, mentioned by our Saviour in
this Chapter, shall appear; <hi>viz. Wars</hi> and <hi>great
Commotions in Kingdoms and Nations, Signs in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and in the Earth, Earthquakes, Pestilence,</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;</hi>
with other unusual and extraordinary Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and tremendous Accidents, which shall give
notice of the approaching Judgment. Thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
not only confirms the Truth of what we read
in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> but he further explains and sets it
forth. He plainly suggests unto us what an evil
posture the World will be in before he comes to
Judgment. He lets us know that the Tribulation
as well as the Wickedness of those Days which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the End of the World shall be more grievous
than any that ever were before. At that time the
Sins of the Churches Enemies, and the Sufferings of
the Godly shall be at the Vertical Point, as high as
they can go. Briefly, It will be found true that the
World shall be most Wicked and most Perilous at
last. The worst State of it will be towards its End.
For the Devil will be very wrathful and outrageous,
<hi>because he knoweth that he hath but a short time,</hi> as it is
said of him in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. And at that time it
may more truly be said of him than ever; for the
1000 years being ended he is <hi>loosed but for a little
season,</hi> Rev. 20. 3. He must <hi>soon</hi> go off the Stage,
and that makes him act his part with so much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and fierceness. The <hi>Iudgment</hi> shall come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after the 1000 years: There shall be a very
considerable time between the <hi>Mellennium</hi> and <hi>Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi>
but it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a small time</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the thousand years: And therefore on this
account that malicious Spirit shall bestir himself with
a mighty Concernedness. The Tenth and Last Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
which he raised in the Primitive Times was
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:65397:392"/>
the Bloodiest: So now he rageth most when he
is to take his farewel of this Earthly Stage.</p>
                     <p>And now behold the Tragical Close of all! <hi>Fire
came down from God out of Heaven, and devoured</hi> these
Armies of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and <hi>the Devil that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them was cast into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone,</hi>
Rev. 20. 9, 10. For now, after all, <hi>CHRIST</hi> appears
from Heaven, and comes to be Avenged of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and to Judge the whole World, as you read
expresly in ver. 11, 12, of this Chapter. Before his
first Coming <hi>Satan</hi> reigned a long time, as God of
this World; he had a kind of an unlimited Rule
and Sway: But our Saviour, by his Coming, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
his Power and Lordship, and afterwards, in
the <hi>Millennary Reign,</hi> gives a greater check to them:
But, at his <hi>Last Coming,</hi> he shall wholly deprive him
of his Rule and Dominion. Accordingly he comes
at that Day, to drive <hi>Satan</hi> down into his own
Place, and there to leave him to be tormented for
ever and ever: He comes to take Vengeance on <hi>Sinners,</hi>
and to punish them with the utmost Severity: He
comes to rescue the <hi>Righteous</hi> from the Fury both of
Satan and wicked Men. This is the Work of the
Last Day.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing more to be added, unless it be
the <hi>Conflagration of the World:</hi> For this I take to be
an evident Truth, that the Firing of the whole
Frame of Heaven and Earth, is a Consequent of the
<hi>Final Iudgment,</hi> which is after the <hi>Millennium.</hi> For
to what purpose should this material System be
consumed, or rather indeed how can it, till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Scene of Action in this World be at an end,
which will not be till after the Thousand Years are
past? I deny not, but there may be some Beginnings
of it before, which perhaps is meant in that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Place, Rev. 20. 9. <hi>Fire came down from God out
of Heaven, and devoured,</hi> &amp;c. Here is an <hi>Essay</hi> of
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:65397:392"/>
the Last Firing of the World, which is prophesied
of by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and others; and it appears from this
Chapter, that it was after the Devil was loosed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Thousand Years Reign of Christ here on
Earth, yea towards the Consummation of all Things.
This is the true Time of its happening, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

New Edition; for<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lib 3.</note> he fancies that this shall arise,
<hi>Phoenix</hi>-like, out of the Ashes of that other. For
this Reason it was necessary to hold, that the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Reign of the Thousand Years shall begin <hi>after</hi>
the Conflagration is over; <hi>viz.</hi> between this and
the last Judgment. But, so far as I am able to
judge, most of the Places he quotes are rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:65397:393"/>
him than for him, if they be well scann'd.
As to what he lays so great Stress upon, that the
<hi>Iudgment,</hi> and the <hi>Reigning of Christ,</hi> and joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> Chap. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.) he should
consider, that the <hi>Iudgment</hi> is <hi>oftentimes</hi> introduced
in this Book, not as if it were then to happen when
it is mentioned, but to strike Terrour into the
Minds of the wicked Persecutors of the Church,
and to represent to them the Certainty of their
future Punishment, <hi>viz.</hi> when that Day comes: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that it were easy to prove, that not only in
this Book, but in other Writings of the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
every great and Notable Revolution is compared to
<hi>God's judging the World,</hi> and is set forth by the Holy
Ghost after that manner.</p>
                     <p>Again, this Learned Writer frequently misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
the Places which speak of <hi>Christ's Coming,</hi> as
that in 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 8. which is not meant of his <hi>Last
Coming to Iudgment,</hi> but of that which I have
been largely treating of; <hi>viz.</hi> the happy Reign of
the Godly when <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall be destroy'd, which
commenceth long before the Final Coming of our
Saviour: And therefore when he saith, <hi>the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
cannot be till Christ's Coming,</hi> he deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and his Readers, by not attending to the true
Meaning of <hi>Christ's Coming,</hi> in those Texts which
he refers to. Indeed, most of his Mistakes proceed
from this, That whereas the Scripture often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>the Coming</hi> of our Lord to set up a Glorious
Church on Earth, before the end of the World,
(which likewise he himself acknowledges) he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
it of another <hi>Coming; i. e.</hi> he imagines it
to be understood of the <hi>Last Appearance</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                     <p>Another great Occasion of his Misapprehensions
in the present Point is this, That where-ever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
he finds in the Old or New Testament any
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:65397:393"/>
Passages concerning <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Burning,</hi> he applies
them (as the Reader may observe through his
whole Treatise) to the <hi>Last Combustion of the World,</hi>
which hath unfortunately betray'd him to many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
                     <p>Likewise, wheresoever <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and <hi>a New
Earth,</hi> are made mention of in the Bible, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
them of a New Material World, whenas
there was no such Thing intended; for these Terms
denote only a new State and Face of Things, <hi>viz.</hi>
that blessed <hi>Millennium</hi> before treated of. Then
there shall be such a great and notable <hi>Change,</hi> that
there shall seem to be a <hi>New World.</hi> The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of this Place shall be so strangely alter'd, that
there shall be as it were an Appearance of a <hi>New
Creation.</hi> In this Sense the Apostle uses the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>He that is in Christ is a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
This Author might as well interpret <hi>these
Words,</hi> as the <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and <hi>New Earth,</hi> of a
New Material Creation, and hold that every Man,
when he is made a <hi>true Christian,</hi> is physically Created
again.</p>
                     <p>But I observe it is with this Learned Gentleman,
as it was with <hi>Origen</hi> of old, who was generally
faulty in <hi>Allegorizing</hi> those Places of Scripture which
are to be taken <hi>Literally,</hi> and yet was so unhappy as
to expound a clause in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 12. in this latter
way, notwithstanding it is evident that it was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in a <hi>Mystical</hi> one. So we find this Writer tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that part of the Bible which speaks of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>World,</hi> and of the <hi>Fall of Man,</hi> into <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
and <hi>Metaphor,</hi> though they are plain <hi>Historical</hi>
and <hi>Literal</hi> Passages; but those Texts of Scripture
which mention <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and a <hi>New Earth,</hi> in
a Metaphorical way of speaking, are taken by him
in a Literal and proper Sense. <hi>The Heavens,</hi> and
<hi>the Earth,</hi> with the whole Six days Works of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:65397:394"/>
in the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> are according
to him Allegory and Mystery, not to say a Fable:
But the <hi>New Heavens and Earth</hi> in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> (where
they are interpreted to his hand of<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 65. 18, 19.</note>
                        <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the
the Church of God) and in other Places, are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by him in a strict and literal Sense, of a <hi>New
Corporeal System of the World.</hi> This is the Perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of humane Wit, and it is its own Punishment.
I heartily wish the Learned Author were sensible of
it; and then he would see, that this Notion of a
New Material Earth, and a New Set of heavenly
Bodies for Men to inhabit in, is all Romance and
Fiction, built only upon some distorted Texts of
Scripture, upon some mistaken Passages, for want of
comparing them with others in the Sacred Writ;
upon some Scraps and Fragments of a few <hi>Platonick</hi>
and <hi>Stoick</hi> Philosophers; upon the Prepossessions of
some of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church, who had been
Admirers of the <hi>Platonists</hi> Opinions; upon the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical
Flaunts of some others of them; upon the
high Flights of some fanciful <hi>Poets;</hi> and, lastly, on
the Dreams of some of the <hi>Iewish Rabbins.</hi> These are
too small, too tender Wires, to hang so great a
Weight on, as those <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and that <hi>New
Earth,</hi> which he fansies.</p>
                     <p>If it be said, that <hi>the New Heaven,</hi> and <hi>New Earth,</hi>
are <hi>after</hi> the Burning of the World; because S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
immediately after he had mentioned this dreadful
Event, adds these Words, <hi>Nevertheless we, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Promise, look for New Heavens, and a New
Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness,</hi> Epist. 2. Chap. 3.
ver. 13. I answer, That this is Inconsequential;
for we cannot here argue from the Order of the
Apostle's Words, to the Order of the Things spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of. He relates the Consumption of the World
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:65397:394"/>
by Fire, and then annexes his Expectations of a
new and better state of Things: But it doth not
follow thence, that this shall be after that. For the
plain Mind of the Apostle seems to me to be this;
<q>Notwithstanding that dreadful Dissolution of all
Things, which I have been speaking of; you and
I, and all good Christians, must comfort and chear
our selves with that Expectance and Belief of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
State of Things, which shall certainly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene
between this and that. We look for happy
Days before that Time comes: These shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
us, as 'twere, with a <hi>New-made World;</hi> these shall
be <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and <hi>New Earth</hi> to us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us not be discouraged and disheartened,
with the Thoughts of that Terrible Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the material Earth and Heavens. <hi>We,
according to God's Promise,</hi> (recorded in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Writings, <hi>Isa. 65. 17. 66. 22. Hag.</hi> 2. 6.)
<hi>look for</hi> this new Scene of Affairs in the World,
<hi>viz.</hi> a Glorious Church on Earth. And though
things look otherwise at present; though there
is no Appearance of any such State now, <hi>neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>
I tell you there shall be, before the Day of
Judgment, a Time when this shall be fulfilled.
And though we of this Age shall not survive to
see this blessed Time, yet we rejoice in the firm
and certain Belief of it; and we exhort all holy
Men, in succeeding Ages, to expect and long for
this Day.</q> The Sum of these Words then is this;
Although this World shall be dissolved by Flames,
yet before this amazing Change happens, we are to
look for New Heavens, and a New Earth; <hi>i. e.</hi> such
a State wherein universal Holiness shall be Lasting
and Permanent, (which is one of the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as you have heard, of this happy State I have
been treating of;) for that is the meaning of those
Words [<hi>wherein dwelleth Righteousness.</hi>] This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:65397:395"/>
is the Sense of this Text of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which is
vouched by the <hi>Analogy</hi> of it with other Texts, and
the natural and facile <hi>Scope</hi> of the Words, and the
<hi>Criticism</hi> of the Adverb <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, which in many other
Places of the New Testament is Synonymous with

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>sed, attamen, quinetiam.</hi> This, I
say, I take to be the genuine Sense of this Place,
and accordingly the forementioned Objection va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes.
Or if you interpret it, (as some Learned
Expositors do) of the Eternal Glory and Happiness
of blessed Souls above, which all holy Men <hi>look for,</hi>
the Objection hath no force.</p>
                     <p>Further, it is intimated in this very <hi>Chapter,</hi> that
the universal Combustion of the World shall be
after the <hi>Millennium,</hi> and <hi>after the Iudgment;</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this Author places it before them both;) for the
setting of the Heavens and the Earth on Fire, is
said to be in order to <hi>the Perdition of ungodly Men,</hi>
ver. 7. for presently after the Last Judgment is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched,
and the Righteous are translated into the
Regions of eternal Happiness in the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
presently after this, I say, the Earth,
and the Elemental Heavens, shall be fired, and those
vile Criminals who were adjudged to everlasting
Torments, shall be plagued and cruciated in these
Flames. This at least is their <hi>INCHOATIVE
PERDITION,</hi> I conceive.</p>
                     <p>To shut up all, and make a Final Period, (and
now it is high Time to do it, when the World it
self doth so) As the Earth of old was overwhelm'd
with Water, so now it feels an Inundation (if I
may so say) of Fire, a Burning Deluge, an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Flood, and Torrent of Devouring Flames. Now
Nature itself expires, and is laid asleep in her
own <hi>Vrn,</hi> and Bed of <hi>Ashes.</hi> And as this General
Bonfire is as it were to Light the Saints to Heaven;
so the loud Blazes of it, its crackling Flames, its
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:65397:395"/>
horrid Flashes and Eruptions, are to give the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some Foretasts of the contrary State and Place:
For they shall pass but from one Fire to another,
even to those <hi>EVERLASTING BVRNINGS</hi> which
were prepared of old for them. This <hi>Earth,</hi>
which before was their only <hi>Heaven,</hi> shall now just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
become their <hi>Hell;</hi> and all the infernal Vaults,
which were the former Receptacles of Evil Spirits,
shall be set wide open, and make one large and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious
Prison, and Place of Execution, for these
Condemned and Tormented Wretches. Therefore
this <hi>Conflagration</hi> must be after the <hi>Final Sentence</hi> is
passed upon them, and not before it. If the World
were all on Fire before the <hi>Iudgment,</hi> (as some
assert) it would be a Hinderance to the Trial, and
good Men as well as bad would feel the Effects of it.
Therefore when the <hi>Doom</hi> is over, and the former
are taken up to Heaven, and safely lodged there,
the dreadful Fire-works shall play upon the latter,
and the whole World at last shall become one Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Pile. Now <hi>Hell</hi> is enlarged, and the Devils,
and other damned Creatures, change their subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Vaults of Fire, for a more capacious Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
of Flame and Smoke; the whole lower World
being converted into one Eternal Hell. This is the
Last Catastrophe, the Final Close of the Incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
World, the Everlasting Period of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Enemies, of all her Calamities of what Nature
soever. This is the true Order (as I conceive)
of the Transactions of this concluding Scene of the
World.</p>
