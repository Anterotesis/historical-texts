            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

xiiii. day of Ianuarye in the yere
of our Lord God .1558. about .ii.
of the clocke at after noone, the
moste noble and Christian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
oure mooste dradde soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Ladye Elyzabeth by the
grace of god Quene of Englande Fraunce &amp; Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
defendour of the faith. &amp;c. marched from the
towre to passe through the citie of London towarde
Westminster, richely furnished, &amp; most honorably
accompanied, as well with gentilmen, Barons, &amp;
other the nobilite of this realme, as also with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
trayne of goodly and beawtifull ladies, richly
appoynted. And entryng the citie was of the people
receiued marueylous entierly, as appeared by thas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie,
prayers, wishes, welcomminges, cryes, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
woordes, and all other signes, whiche argue a
wonderfull earnest loue of most obedient subiectes
towarde theyr soueraigne. And on thother syde her
grace by holding vp her handes, and merie counte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naunce
to such as stode farre of, and most tender &amp;
gentle la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage to those that stode nigh to her grace,
did declare her selfe no lesse thankefullye to receiue
her peoples good wyll, than they louingly offred it
vnto her. To al that wyshed her grace wel, she gaue
heartie thankes, and to such as bade God saue her
grace, she sayde agayne god saue them all, and than<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked
them with all her heart. So that on eyther syde
ther was nothing but gladnes, nothing but prayer:
<pb facs="tcp:475:3"/>
nothing but comfort. The Quenes maiestie reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
marueilously to see, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, so exceadingly shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
her grace, which all good princes haue euer
desyred, I meane so earnest loue of subiectes, so eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declared euen to her graces owne person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
caried in the middest of them. The people again
wer wonderfully rauished with the louing answers
and gestures of theyr princesse, like to the which they
had before tryed at her first comming to the towre
from Hatfield. This her graces louing behauiour
preconceiued in the peoples heades vpon these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideracions
was then throughly confirmed, and in
dede emplanted a wonderfull hope in them tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng
her woorthy gouernement in the reste of her
reygne. For in all her passage she did not only shew
her most gracious loue toward the people in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
but also priuately if the baser personages had
either offred her grace any flowres or such like, as a
signification of their good wyll, or moued to her any
sute, she most gently, to the common reioysing of all
the lookers on, &amp; priuate comfort of the partie, staid
her chariot, and heard theyr requestes. So that if a
man shoulde say well, he could not better tearme the
citie of London that time, than a stage wherin was
shewed the wonderfull spectacle, of a noble hearted
princesse toward her most louing people, &amp; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
exceding comfort in beholding so worthy a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,
&amp; hearing so princelike a voice which could
not but haue set thenemie on fyre, since the vertue is
in thenemie alway co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, much more could not

but enflame her naturall, obedient, and moste lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng

grace, and her gouernement. Thus therefore
the Queenes maiestie passed from the Towre,
tyll she came to Fanchurche, the people on eche side
ioyously beholdyng the viewe of so gracious a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
theyr queene, and her grace no lesse gladly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
and obseruing the same. Nere vnto Fanchurch
was erected a scaffolde richely furnished, wheron
stode a noyes of instrumentes, and a chylde in cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparell, whiche was appoynted to welcome the
queenes maiestie in the hole cities behalfe. Agaynst
which place when her grace came, of her owne wyll
she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the chariot to be stayde, and that the
noyes might be appeased tyll the childe had vttered
his welcomming oration, which hespake in English

to one ende that quietnes might be mainteyned,
and all dissention displaced, and that by the

which was curiously trimmed agaynst that tyme

            <p>This pageant standynge in the nether ende of

passed on forward in Chepe syde.</p>
            <p>At the standarde in Cheape which was dressed
fayre agaynste the tyme, was placed a noyse of
Trumpettes, with banners and other furniture.
The Crosse lykewyse was also made fayre and

well trimmed. And neare vnto thesame, vppon
the porthe of Saint Peters church dore, stode the

did passe by, whiche on euery syde cast her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,

Sone after that her grace passed the crosse, she
had espyed the pageant erected at the little conduit
in cheape, and incontinent required to know what
it might signifye. And it was tolde her grace, that
there was placed Tyme. Tyme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the opening, when her grace vnderstode that the
Byble in Englyshe shoulde be deliuered vnto her
by Trueth, whiche was therein represented by a
chylde: she thanked the citie for that gyft, and sayde
that she woulde oftentymes reade ouer that booke,

caused hym to staye, and so passed forward till she

tyll her grace came to the vpper ende of
Cheape. And there by appoyntment, the right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
maister Ranulph Cholmeley Recorder of
the citie, presented to the Quenes maiestie a purse
of crimeson satti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

brieflie vnto the Queenes maiestie, whose

his brethren, and comminaltie of the citie, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their gladnes and good wille towardes the
Quenes maiestie, dyd present her grace with that
golde, desyering her grace to continue theyr good
and gracious Quene, and not to esteme the value
of the gift, but the mynd of the geuers. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
maiestie with both her handes tooke the purse,
and aunswered to hym againe merueylous pithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and so pithilie, that the standers by, as they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
entierly her gracious aunswer, so they mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
<pb facs="tcp:475:12"/>
at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cowching therof, which was in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
truely reported these. I thanke my lord maior,
his brethren, &amp; you all. And wheras your request is
that I should continue your good ladie &amp; quene, be
ye ensured, that I wil be as good vnto you, as euer
quene was to her people. No wille in me can lacke,
neither doe I trust shall ther lacke any power. And
perswade your selues, that for the safetie and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes
of you all, I will not spare, if nede be to spend
my blood, God thanke you all. Whiche aunswere
of so noble an hearted pryncesse, if it moued a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylous
showte and reioysing, it is nothyng to be
meruayled at, since both the heartines thereof was
so woonderfull, and the woordes so ioyntly knytte.
When her grace hadde thus aunswered the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder,
she marched toward the little conduit, where
was erected a pageaunt with square proporcion,
standynge directlye before thesame conduite, with
battlementes accordynglye. And in thesame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunt
was aduaunced two hylles or mountay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of conuenient heyghte. The one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng

And vnder thesame tree at the foote thereof, sate
one in homely and rude apparell crokedlye, and

were written proper sentences, expressing the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the decaye of a commonweale. The other
hylle on the South syde was made fayre, freshe,

of flowres and beawtie, and on thesame was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
also one tree very freshe and fayre, vnder
the whiche, stoode vprighte one freshe personage
well apparaylled and appoynted, whose name

which expressed the causes of a flourishing

or caue, with doore and locke enclosed, oute of

it selfe beawtifyes it selfe, and receyued her grace
at all places as hath been before mencioned, with
most tender obedience and loue, due to so gracious
a quene and soueraigne ladie. And her grace lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of her side in all her graces passage shewed her

Gouernour, but priuately these especiall poyntes
wer noted in her grace, as sygnes of a most prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:475:19"/>Certain notes of the quenes maiesties great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
clemencie, and wisdom vsed in this passage</p>
            <p>Aboute the nether ende of Cornehyll towarde
Cheape, one of the knightes about her grace had es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed
an auncient citizen, whiche wepte, and turned
his head backe, and therewith said this gentleman,
yonder is an Alderman (for so he tearmed hym)
whiche wepeth &amp; turneth his face backeward. How
may it be interpreted that he so doth, for sorowe, or
for gladnes? The quenes maiestie heard hym, and
said, I warrant you it is for gladnes. A gracious
interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a noble courage, which would turne
the doutefull to the best. And yet it was well known
that as her grace did confirme thesame, the parties
cheare was moued for verye pure gladnes for the
sight of her maiesties person, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beholding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he toke such comforte, that with teares he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thesame.</p>
            <p>In Cheapeside her grace smiled, and being ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
demaunded the cause, aunswered, for that she had
heard one say, Remember old king Henry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this realme doth hold of so woorthy memorie: so in
her doinges she will resemble thesame.</p>
            <p>When the cities charge withoute parcialitie
and onely the citie was mencioned vnto her grace,
she, saide it shoulde not be forgotten. Whiche saying

due obedience and entiernes, to their so good a
Queene which will in no poynt forgeat any parcell
of duetie louingly shewed vnto her.</p>
            <p>The answer which her grace made vnto maister
Recorder of London, as the hearers know it to be
true, and with melting heartes heard thesame: so
may the reader thereof conceiue what kinde of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
and courage pronounced thesame.</p>
            <p>What more famous thing doe we reade in auncient
histories of olde tyme, then that mightye prynces

of this vertue, as her grace shewed in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one
passage through the citie. How many nosegayes did
her grace receiue at poore womens handes? How
ofttimes stayed she her chariot, when she sawe any
simple body offer to speake to her grace? A bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che of

               </gap>
the merueylous wondring of such as knew the
presenter, and noted the Queenes most gracious
receiuing and keping thesame.</p>
            <p>What hope the poore and nedy may looke for at
her graces hande, she as in all her iourney conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallye,
so in her harkenyng to the poore chyldren
of Christes hospitall with eyes cast vp into heauen,
did fullye declare, as that neither the welthier es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb facs="tcp:475:20"/>
could stande without consideracion had to the
pouertie, neither the pouertie be duelye considered,
vnles they were remembred, as commended to vs
by goddes owne mouth.</p>
            <p>As at her first enterance she as it were declared,
her selfe prepared to passe through a citie that most
entierly loued her, so she at her last departing, as it
were, bownde her selfe by promes to continue good
Ladie and gouernor vnto that citie whiche by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
declaracion did open their loue, to their so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and noble prince in such wyse, as she her selfe
wondered therat.</p>
            <p>But because princes be set in their seate by gods
appoynting and therfore they must first and chiefly
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der the glory of him, from whom their glory issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
it is to be noted in her grace, that forsomuch
as god hath so wonderfully placed her in the seate
of gouernment ouer this realme, she in all doinges
doth shew her selfe most myndfull of his goodnes
and mercie shewed vnto her, &amp; amongest all other,
two pryncipall sygnes thereof were noted in thys
passage. First in the Towre, where her grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she entred her chariot, lifted vp her eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and sayd.</p>
            <p>O Lord, almighty and euerlasting God, I geue
thee most hearty tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes that thou hast been so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
vnto me as to spare me to beholde this ioyfull
daye. And I acknowledge that thou hast dealt as
wonderfully &amp; as mercifully with me, as thou didst
<pb facs="tcp:475:21"/>
with thy true and faithfull seruant Daniel thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete whom thou deliueredst out of the denne from the crueltie of the gredy and rageing Lyons: euen so was I ouerwhelmed, and only by the deliuered. To thee therfore onely be thankes, honor, &amp; prayse, foreuer. Amen.</p>
            <p>The second was the receiuing of the Byble at the little conduit in cheape. For when her grace had learned that the Byble in Englishe should there be offered, she thanked the citie therefore, promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the reading thereof most diligentlye, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent commaunded, that it should be brought.
