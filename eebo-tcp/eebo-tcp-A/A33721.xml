            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <q>So then, Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE Apostle towards the close of
the Ninth Chapter speaking of a
twofold Righteousness, of Works
and of Faith, tells us that the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
did attain to the Righteousness of Faith,
but the <hi>Iews</hi> did not attain to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Works, which they so much
trusted in, <hi>for they being ignorant of Gods
Righteousness, and going about to establish
their own, have not submitted themselves to
the Righteousness of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. Hence
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103587:3"/>
the Apostle takes an occasion to compare
the Righteousness of the Law, with that
of Faith; calling one our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the other the Righteousness of God,
which the Law do's tacitly point to, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
Life to perfect Obedience, this not
being found in any mere Man since the
Fall, we are directed to seek it in Christ,
who is the end of the Law to every one
who believes, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. he brings in <hi>Moses,
verse</hi> the 5th. describing the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which is of the Law, that <hi>the man
which doth those things shall live by them.</hi>
Such doers of the Law we are not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can look for nothing but Death by
Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 6th. He brings in the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Faith by a <hi>Prosopopcia,</hi> speaking
it self to an afrighted dejected sinner, who
is also brought in musing upon his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Condition, full of sad thoughts, saying
over many dismal th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>gs to himself in his
own Heart about his Eternal State, how
shall I get to Heaven, how shall I
escape Hell, how shall I dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Burnings which I see no way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
by Law, the righteousness of Faith
meets this convinced Sinner, in this great
distress of Conscience, communes with him,
discourses of Christ to him, minds him of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103587:3"/>
his Resurrection from the dead, and
Ascension into Heaven, you seem (says
the Righteousness of Faith) to deny both
in talking at this rate, your way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is plain, Christ is ascended, you shall
as surely go to Heaven, if you believe as
Christ is gone before you, as surely escape
Hell and overcome Death, as Christ is
risen from the dead, and the only way to
get an Interest in Christ is to attend to
the word of Faith that is preached, <hi>ver.</hi>
8. when once that prevails and brings you
to confess with your mouth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
and believe in your heart that God
hath raised him from the dead, you shall
be saved <hi>ver.</hi> 9. this proved out of <hi>Isa.</hi>
28. 16. <hi>Whosoever believes on him shall not
be ashamed, whether Iew or Gentile, ver.</hi> 11,
12. and because Prayer is the principal
part of that outward Confession made
with the Mouth, and the best indication
of Faith in the Heart, he concludes <hi>ver.</hi> 13.
<hi>Whosoever shall call upon the name of the
Lord shall be saved.</hi> Whence Observe;</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> The chiefest thing we should now
pray for, is, that we may have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Christ and his Righteousness,
desiring to be found in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103587:4"/>
Having spoken so much of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Faith, he does in a certain gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
shew the way and means of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, it is not a Righteousness that is to be
done by us, to be wrought out with our
own hands, but prepared for us by another,
freely promised and given to us, therefore it
must be askt, it must be earnestly pray'd for,
we must beg hard of God to impute it to
us, <hi>v.</hi> 13. the Law propounds the work of
Righteousness to be done by us, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
(<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17.) propounds the Gift of
Righteousness to be pray'd for and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
received, <hi>v.</hi> 14. there can be no Prayer
without Faith, no Faith without Hearing,
no Hearing without a Preacher, no Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
unless they be sent, from all which he
draws this Conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the next
immediate Cause of Faith is Hearing.</p>
                  <p>There is much Preaching and much
Hearing in this City, but what comes on't?
Truely if Faith does not come, nothing
comes that will turn to any good Account
to you: The Apostles in the Primitive
times so spake that many believed, <hi>Acts</hi>
14. 1. with that evidence and power, their
words had a special Accent in the Ears and
Hearts of those that heard them, God gave
a signal testimony to the word of his Grace,
than fear came upon every Soul, <hi>Acts</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:103587:4"/>
2. 43. Those who were not savingly
wrought upon, were greatly astonished
at the Doctrine of the Gospel; 'tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
now, how little of this astonishment
does appear in our Assemblies, where is
this fear that came upon every Soul, 'twas
short of Faith, yet I am perswaded when
Faith comes in some open eminent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
that the whole Assembly is usually
struck with some present fear, the Word
comes like a mighty rushing Wind into
the Congregation, shakes all, when 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to Convert one; something like
this may be observed in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the
Apostles, and other passages in the New
Testament, it is fit that Grace should be
solemnly attended when it goes forth to
the publick Conversion though but of one
Soul: If God intend the coming of Faith
into any of your hearts this day, he'l come
along with his Work, he will prepare the
way, he'l bless your hearing, and speak
something inwardly to you from himself,
that shall incline your hearts to believe
the Gospel, though God speaks by the
Ministry of man, yet his voice is distinct
from ours, and begins where that ends,
carrying the Word from the Ear to the
Heart, there leaving it under those mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Faith that make it work effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103587:5"/>
Hear I beseech you with diligence
least you obstruct the coming of Faith by
not attending to what shall be spoken to
you in the name of the Lord. <hi>So then
faith cometh by hearing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> Hearing the Word of God Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us, is the ordinary means of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
faith in us.</q>
                  <p>First, What are we in a more special
manner to understand by Faith here in
the Text.</p>
                  <p>The general Object of Faith is the
whole Doctrine of God laid down in the
Scriptures; the special object of Saving
Faith, is the Free-promise of Grace in
Christ Jesus, this supports the former, we
must believe the Divine Narrative of the
whole Will of God revealed in the Bible,
before we can pitch our Faith in any suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
actings upon any part of it, 'tis one
thing to assent to the Truth of the Word
in General, a further and indeed another
thing to apply the Promises; he believes
a Promise who do's siducially rely upon it,
this is properly Trusting, we believe
something in reference to our selves, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a comfortable Hope and Expectation
of it, respecting not only the Truth of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103587:5"/>
the thing, but also the Goodness of it in
reference to our selves under that possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
probability or certainty of obtaining
it, which our Faith, according to its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Degrees may represent unto us, Faith
in the Righteousness of Christ for justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is here principally intended.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Why must this Faith come
by hearing. Hearing is alwayes antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to Faith, though Faith be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the consequent of Hearing, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.
18. all Hearers are not believers, though
all Believers are first Hearers.</p>
                  <p>I shall evince the necessity of Hearing
in order to Faith, from these following
grounds:</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>Hearing is Sensus Disciplinae,</hi> the Sense
by which all knowledge is let into the
Soul. There is a two-fold Knowledge
belonging to Faith, one leading to it, the
other found in it, arising from it, and is
the same with Faith it self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The First,</hi> is Litteral or Historical, 'tis
rather <hi>notitia</hi> then <hi>cognitio,</hi> a notice or
particular information given us of the
Contents of the Bible, especially of the
report which the Gospel makes of the
way of Salvation by Christ, we must
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103587:6"/>
know what we are to believe, before we
can be supposed to believe any thing;
<hi>How shall they believe in him of whom they
have not heard, and how shall they hear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Preacher.</hi> Words are the proper
Object of this Sense of Hearing, where
nothing is spoken, nothing can be heard,
the sound of Words must reach the ear,
before the sense of those Words can enter
into the Understanding. This Historical
Knowledge do's not lye in Learning the
Scriptures by roat, without any Rational
Knowledge of the Litteral Sense and
Meaning of those Propositions of Truth
that are contained therein, this would be
only Memory without any Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
A Natural Man does not dis-believe
the Scripture, because he has not a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Conception of the common Notion
of things spoken of there, but because he
has, and sinding them so uncouth, so
seemingly contrary to Humane Reason,
he rejects them as Foolishness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Second,</hi> Is a Knowledge more than
Historical, and is of the Essence of Faith
all one with it, it is that which we call a
Saving Knowledge; it lies in the Use
and Application of Gospel Truths to our
own Souls, when we shape our selves to a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103587:6"/>
real Conformity to the Call of God in
every Gospel Truth, acting in a way of
Duty what the Word of God commands.</p>
                  <p>There is no Saving Knowledge of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Truths, but the Knowledge of Faith,
and no other Reason for Faith in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Misteries of the Gospel, but the bare
Word of God.</p>
                  <p>That Faith is Knowledge, I prove thus,
Because in Scripture, 'tis opposed to Folly,
Blindness and Ignorance, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23, 30.
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Besides it has all the effects of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the Soul, it gives full satisfaction
to the Mind of a Man, removes all doubts,
establishes the Heart in a full perswasion
of the Truth of the Word of God; Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Knowledge is liable to many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
but a Divine Faith admits of no Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood,
therefore Faith perfects mans Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
because it brings in nothing but
Truth, no mans Errors do proceed from
Faith, he may err in matters of Faith, but 'tis
not from his Faith, but his Unbelief, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Faith is Knowledge, unerring Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
we believe and are sure, we may be
so, if we rightly understand our selves in an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103587:7"/>
act of Believing, no demonstrations of
Reason, do give that Evidence of Truth
as Faith do's, as mans Understanding is
too low, to take in Divine Truths, so
Gods Understanding is too high, for man
to comprehend, therefore we are called
to yield the obedience of faith to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Will, God governs man rather by
giving him the knowledge of his Will,
then lifting him up into his own Infinite
Understanding, that is above our Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
our Duty lies not in knowing what
God knows, but in doing what God
commands, who gives no account of his
matters to us, only commands us to believe
his Word, and to look upon that as a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ground and reason of our faith,
when we hear it preached to us.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Because</hi> God has appointed hearing
the Word, as a necessary means of faith, he
will not immediately speak to our hearts
by his Spirit, but has appointed his Word
to be first spoken to our Ears, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
that way to let it down into our
hearts, thus <hi>Faith comes by Hearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How should Hearing of things
above our Reason contribute any thing to
our believing them? One would think
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103587:7"/>
the oftner we hear them, the more absurd
we should count them to be, and reject
them with greater Indignation, having so
often tried them by the Touchstone of our
own reason, and pronounced them unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Hearing alone will not let in
these Divine Mysteries into our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. God must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
Teach us and reveal them to us
by his Spirit, before we can believe them,
which brings me to the third head, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. How faith is wrought by our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word.</p>
                  <p>1. By a special Appearance of God to
the Soul.</p>
                  <p>2. By opening the Heart, enlightning
the Mind, and perswading the Will to a
thorough closure with Christ upon Gospel
Terms.</p>
                  <p>To these two heads may be referred
all that falls under our discerning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the work of the Spirit in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
faith in us.</p>
                  <p>I. Faith is wrought by a special appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103587:8"/>
of God to the Soul, what this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of God is, how it rises out of
the Word, in what manner 'tis let into
the Soul, I shall endeavour to open to
the experience of those who know what
it is to hold Communion with God in
hearing his Word: there is some co-inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the particulars above-mentioned,
yet not without some distinction, which I
leave to your own observation, the less
of Art or Method there is in handling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
points, the better, they come
with most power to the Conscience in
their own simplicity, therefore I shall in a
joynt Discourse run the matter close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
looking sometimes on one side,
and sometimes on t'other, till I have view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it round, that I may present the whole
Truth to you in so great and necessary a
point, we can have no saving knowledge
of God but in and by his word, we must
look through that Glass upon him, and
that appearance of God we meet with
there, is the beginning of all Religion,
the Word never comes with power to
our Consciences, till God appear in it.</p>
                  <p>How that is, I am now to shew. Whilst
we are hearing his Word we see God
standing forth, in his own words, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103587:8"/>
himself to be the Author of it, this
draws in our attention, adds that weight
and authority to the Word, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but receive it as the Word of God,
and set our Seals to the Truth of it, we see
sufficient grounds for our Faith in God
from this manifestation of himself to our
Souls. Thus God wrought faith in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Gen.</hi> 17. 1. by appearing to him
several times as God Almighty and All-sufficient,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> might not doubt
of any thing that such a God should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to him, and therefore 'tis said <hi>Rom.</hi>
4. 3. that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, being
fully perswaded that what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
he was able to perform, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.
Thus God appeared to <hi>Samuel</hi> revealing
himself to him by his Word 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 21.
So Christ appeared to <hi>Paul</hi> by a voice,
and a Light from Heaven, I am Jesus,
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. there are spiritual appearances of
God now to our Souls under the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel answerable to these Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Old. God lets himself down into
our Hearts, through the apprehensions of
our faith, which frames in our hearts a
right image of God answerable to that
Character he gives of himself in the Word,
he shines through the Word in all his
Glory, when he spake of Old to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103587:9"/>
by an articulate voice, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
word then was accompanied with
such convincing signs of his Presence, that
they could not but believe it, and so is the
written Word now as capable of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
God to us, when he has a mind
to be seen by us, as that was then; the
Letter of the Word is but a Creature, but
the Truths contained in it are Eternal, and
do all center in God himself, who is the
Essential Word, thus God rises out of the
Word, and looks a man in the Face, tells
him, thus saith the Lord, I am that Lord
God Almighty who now speaks unto you,
he leaves no Objection unanswered, shews
what sure grounds of faith, we have in
him, shall God say and not do? 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for God to lie, it must be so as
God saies, it can't be otherwise, Heaven
and Earth shall sooner pass away than one
Tittle of the Word be broken, thus in
God we praise his Word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 4. 10.
Consider the Word out of God: 'twill
puzzle Men and Angels to make out the
meaning of it, to think the things spoken
of possible or likely to come to pass, but all
things are possible with God, and to those
who believe in God, they stick at nothing,
they are sure Omnipotency knows no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficulties,
the Counsel of the Lord must
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103587:9"/>
stand, his thoughts shall come to pass: a
Soul thus struck with a sense of Gods
Presence yields immediately, I believe
Lord with all my heart, am ready to do
whatever thou requirest of me, so <hi>Paul:</hi>
Oh that God would so manifest himself to
every one of your hearts this day, that he
would shew himself, come up close to
you, look you in the face, and say, I am
Jesus, you could not withstand this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
presence of God in Christ Jesus, O speak
Lord, 'tis but thy saying to each of us I
am Jesus, and we shall all be made to
know the Lord from the least to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
I hope the quickning voice of the Son
of God, is now sounding in the Ears of
your Faith, while I am speaking to you,
and that you do receive the Word, not
as the word of Man, but as it is indeed
the Word of God, quick and powerful,
sharper than a two-edged Sword in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of your hearts.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of the Truth as 'tis in
Jesus (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 21.) is one thing, and the
knowledge of the Truth as 'tis in Ink and
Paper is another; they are the same
Truths, but as they are in the Scriptures
they lie in the dead Letter, as they are in
Christ they are seen in their living root
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103587:10"/>
and principle from whence they spring,
meer Scriptural Knowledge is but Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,
we look upon the things we read
and hear, rather as notions than realities:
till God fills up all expressions of Scripture
concerning himself, with a Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
answerable thereunto, we believe
nothing that is said of him, but such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God in his Word, captivates our
hearts to the belief of it, we must believe
him to be such a God as the Word declares
him to be, before we shall count all his
sayings true, we must fetch strength from
the name of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13. to support our
Faith in all its actings upon any part of
his revealed will, and we never deny any
Truth plainly revealed but we deny his
name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 8. and question his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;
some Truths bare more upon one
Attribute, some more upon another, but
all are founded in God and in the essential
properties of his Nature, from whence they
have their verification and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so that till God appear and shew
himself to the Soul, all that is said to us
out of the Scriptures in the name of an
unknown God affects us not, because it
wants that which is the ground of its Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility,
no man can say that Jesus is the
Lord, but by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103587:10"/>
cannot say so and think so, he cannot say
so and believe what he says, till the Father
reveal his Son in him, <hi>Paul</hi> by the Light
of that Revelation of Christ in him, knew
all Gospel Mysteries, and without such an
inward spiritual manifestation of God to
our Souls, giving us a sight of him who
is invisible, 'tis impossible we should ever
be throughly convinced of the Divinity
of the Scriptures, all Divinity springs
from God, leads to him, nay it looks him
directly in the Face, and can't be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
apart from him, there is but one
God and one Faith, God must be in the
view of our Faith whensoever we really
act it.</p>
                  <p>Neither can we have that inward testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit convincing us of the
Divine Authority of the Scriptures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this special Appearance of God in the
Soul as a witness to the Truth of his
Word.</p>
                  <p>While we are hearing the Word, God
has invisible wayes of access to our hearts,
he conveys himself through his Truth to
our Souls, his Divinity leads the way,
without some appearance of this, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the Word would have no place
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103587:11"/>
in our hearts, but coming with so
great a presence, in so great a name,
and with so strong an impression, God
himself writing them upon the heart,
we cannot but receive his Testimony, the
Word comes into our Hearts suddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are aware, and seises them for
God, we cannot but think, speak, act
and judge as God does, the sense of the
Word is the sense of our Souls, so far as
the Word is written in our hearts, we read
it without the least variation, the Copy
answers the Original: Hence arises that
habitual disposition or inclination to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
God creates this new heart, I say
this infused habit or principle of faith, is
antecedent to all acts of faith put forth by
us, and is in it self the sole act of God
upon us in our first Conversion, it is from
this supernatural principle thus infused,
that the natural powers and faculties of
the Soul of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Understanding
and the Will, are enabled to take in things
purely Spiritual and Divine, Nature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
acts above its sphere, those inbred
common Notions that are the Standards
and Measures of Natural Truths in all
their consequences will never lead us to
grant, or admit that which is supernatural,
when we do this, 'tis always from some
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103587:11"/>
higher Principle; when we see men act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above themselves, we may conclude
they are acted by something higher than
themselves, which is the Spirit of Christ
dwelling in them.</p>
                  <p>This special Appearance of God, with
those inward effects of it upon the Soul
which I have been speaking of, may be
known to Believers, they discern it in
others, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 17, 18. and do when
they give a true reason of their faith, see
it in themselves, that all springs from the
Fathers revealing his Son in them, they
can give no other reason why they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Jesus, 'tis God that opens the door
of Faith and makes it effectual, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 27.</p>
                  <p>We are apt to be taken with any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Man in a Sermon, this we look
after, what words of Mans Wisdom, how
Man acquits himself in reasoning of this or
that Point. 'Tis true there is some skill
required in Planting, and Watering, but
all the encrease comes from God, your
Faith consists not in the Wisdom of Man
but in the power of God, if God himself
do not appear as a witness to his own
Truth, as the great undertaker of all that
he has promised, what we say will prevail
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103587:12"/>
little, your faith must terminate in God
himself, and in that Ability that is in him
to perform his word, this was the ground
of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>Paul</hi> knew him whom
he believed, 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1. 12. and so must
you if ever you believe to the saving of
your Souls. Did you go out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
after every Sermon you hear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a sight and sense of this appearance of
God in his Word, speaking to you from
Heaven and shewing himself to your souls
in some spiritual resemblance suited and
adapted to that Word you are hearing,
how could you reject such a Word, so
full of God, so exactly corresponding to
what you see in God himself, you must
yield and cry out each of you, who am I
that I should withstand God?</p>
                  <p>This is the first way that God takes to
work Faith in us, by our hearing the
Word Preached to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Faith is wrought by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heart, enlightning the mind, and
perswading the will to a through closure
with Christ upon Gospel Terms.</p>
                  <p>I shall now shew you how God thus
appearing to us in hearing the Word,
does open the heart, enlighten the mind
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103587:12"/>
and throughly perswade the will, to a
through closure with Christ upon Gospel
Terms.</p>
                  <p>Naturally our hearts are shut up against
the Gospel, our Minds are blinded 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 4. till God shines into our hearts, to
give the light of the Knowledge of the
Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,
<hi>ver.</hi> 6. Enlightning the eyes of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What is this Light of Faith, and
how does it differ from the Light of
Reason?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Light of Reason lies in the
evidence of the thing it self, as it falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Humane Understanding, arguing
from the cause to the effect, drawing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
conclusions from undeniable premises,
granted and acknowledged by all men to
be Truths in Nature: Upon such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
they build all their acquired
Knowledge, and do put the stamp of
Truth upon all fair inferences from thence,
which they judge agreeable to those first
principles and notions of Truth, that pass
for currant under that name among cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
men, who do but think they know,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103587:13"/>
and do rather ghess than judge: so great is
the uncertainty of all humane Knowledge,
we have little cause to glory in it.</p>
                  <p>The light of Faith lies in the infallible
certainty of Divine Testimony, faith sees
not the causes of things in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but in God alone, to whom all
things are possible, faith excells all other
knowledge, in as much as it sees and knows
all things in their first Cause, God, and
takes hold of them by the very root from
whence they first spring, arguing from the
Veracity of God, to the Truth of all his
sayings, we know that God has spoken
thus and thus, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 29. we know
the Doctrine is of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 17. and
that no prophesie of the Scripture is of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Interpretation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this conviction we cannot but yield
the obedience of faith to every word of
God: I do not deny but experience may
and does give Believers some Evidence
of the things themselves, but this belongs
rather to their after Edification, then to
the first act of Faith in their Conversion,
by which they close in with Christ, upon
the credit of a bare word of promise from
him who cannot lie,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103587:13"/>
                     <hi>Object,</hi> Since these sublime supernatural
Misteries of the Gospel are so much above,
and so seemingly contrary to humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
how comes it to pass that any man
should own them for Truths, and be
brought under the power of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis by a Divine Faith, I call it
Divine because 'tis the work of God that
we believe his Testimony, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6, 29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Does not this Operation of God
upon the Hearts of men in working faith
in us, offer violence to mans Nature and
force the Will to consent to that which
is above the Understanding: Or how can
the efficacy of Gods Grace in determining
Mans Will to such a Spiritual Act of Faith
in Christ Jesus be consistent with the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Many intricate disputes there are
about this Point, managed by subtil heads,
not without some shew and appearance of
Reason, who to secure the liberty of
Mans Will, have denied the efficacy of
Gods Grace, placing the power of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in man himself, to avoid the force
that otherwise they think must be offered
to his Will. But to clear the efficacy of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103587:14"/>
Gods Grace from this imputation, I need
say no more but this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Grace of God enters the Soul
of man as a New Nature, and therefore
cannot put any force upon him, Nature
works kindly in all, by Inclination, not by
Violence; as Nature is from Generation, so
the new Nature is from Regeneration;
one is the birth of the Flesh, the other
of the Spirit; as we are born Men by our
first birth, so we are born Christians by
our second birth. Artificial Christians
are all name, without any living Nature
answerable to it, being not truly born of
God and thereby made partakers of his
Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>The breathing in of this new Nature
into the Soul of man by the Spirit of God,
is that new Creation spoken of in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
'tis the first Act of God in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
'tis solely the Act of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any concurrence of ours, we have
only a passive obediential power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the impression! 'Tis God that makes
it, upon this supernatural Principle are
grounded all after proceedings in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Soul forward to an actual closure
with Christ, all the natural powers and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103587:14"/>
faculties of the Soul are gathered into this
supernatural Principle, do act under it,
are moved by it, and directed in all their
free motions to a supernatural end, which
they could not of themselves tend unto;
and let it not seem incredible to us that
God should do this, he can do no evil
from the perfection of his Nature, and for
the same reason all good must needs be
in the power of his hand, the greatest
good that can be done to fallen Man, is
thus to restore him. In this new Nature
are wrapped up the seeds of all Grace,
which by the efficacy of the Spirit, are
drawn out into act, with the free consent
of Mans Will: Should God determine the
Will of Man to a good act whilst it is in a
bad state and under a corrupt nature, this
would imply force and violence, but to
lead out a man according to his new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is not to put a force upon him. If
Sin had that efficacy upon Man in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
state, to encline his Will to Evil, why
should not Grace have the like efficacy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Man fallen to encline his Will to good.
Though an inclination to Evil in Man
standing was possible from the liberty of
his Will in which he was created, yet such
an actual inclination was inconsistent with
his perfect state, and left such an inherent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103587:15"/>
crookedness in his perverted Nature that
nothing but Grace can rectifie and make
streight again. What is a principle of
Grace, but liberty to Good restored to
fallen man, from whence an actual incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to choose what is good do's follow
of course, when God calls and excites
him thereunto, here is no force put upon
mans Will, it acts freely in the choice of
good, and it cannot be otherwise, since
Grace enters as a new Nature, ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
a powerful Principle of Holiness
in the Soul, that do's incline a man freely
to comply which the efficacious grace of
God exciting him to those acts of Holiness
so agreeable to the Nature of the new
Creature, as Sin reigns unto Death, so
Grace will reign through Righteousness
unto Eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 21. Shall not
he that raises the dead be able to quicken
a dead Soul, but we are more sensible of
that power that God puts forth upon the
bodies of Men, then of that which he puts
forth upon their Souls, <hi>that you may know
that the Son of man hath power to forgive
sins, Take up thy bed and walk, Mat.</hi> 9. 6.
This you all see, but the actings of my
saving power upon the souls of men, that
power that works within, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20.)
you see not; let this that you see convince
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103587:15"/>
you of that which you see not, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dispute my power more to forgive
sin, I can heal the diseases of the Soul as
well as those of the Body, the power
that God has to forgive sin is the
great prerogative of God, belonging to
the soveraignty of his grace. God walks
invisibly thorow the World, doing his
mighty works of Grace, he touches some
mens hearts, not others; he draws some
and not others, by the sweet yet irresista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
force of his Grace; we see nothing but
man, mans Will, mans Choice, mans Act,
and therefore conclude all is by mans own
power, because we see not the wheel
within the wheel, the Spirit of God set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the whole soul in motion towards
Christ: This <hi>arcanum Iehovae,</hi> this secret
of the Lord is with them that fear him,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 14. The way of the Spirit of
God in the hearts of men is discerned by
few, 'tis a very hard matter to understand
how God works in us to will and to do,
because we find it to be our own act to
believe, repent and turn to God, we
ascribe all to our selves as if our own arm
had saved us: The truth is, God in all
the efficacious operations of his grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hearts of men, loves to conceal
himself, he will not be seen by others to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103587:16"/>
do what he do's in and for his Saints, <hi>no
noise in the streets, Matth.</hi> 12. 19. <hi>The
kingdom of God comes not with observation,
Luke</hi> 17. 20, 21. All is done within
secretly and silently, non are privy to this
heart-work, but they that feel it, this is
the hiding of his power from the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those whom he never intends to
work upon, and for the hardening of
their hearts, that they may still retain an
opinion of their own ability to do that
which they see others so freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
addicting themselves unto: Though
this be a cause of stumbling to many, who
boast of a supposed power and freedom
of will to believe and repent when they
please, yet such in whose hearts God has
wrought these mighty works of his grace,
they see and feel the weight of his Arm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
upon their souls, they know it is
Gods doing, that a divine power has touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their hearts, and carried them out to all
these acts of Faith that they put forth,
they openly acknowledge this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
10. <hi>Phil,</hi> 4. 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.
<hi>Not I but Christ.</hi> When they feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
most strengthned by Christ, they
are then most sensible of their own self-insufficiency
and weakness, I can do all
things through Christ, yet not sufficient of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103587:16"/>
our selves to think a good thought; <hi>when I
am weak, then am I strong,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10.
They would not say so, if they did not
find a power more then humane exerting
it self within them, and strengthning them
with might in their inward man, I live,
yet not I, but Christ lives in me, till we
can thus distinguish between Nature and
Grace, and see God influencing our Wills
in all their free motions to that which is
good, we shall vainly assume to our selves
a power that never yet reduced it self to
the least real act of Faith in any man
whatever: 'tis easie talking of a power
to believe, before we come to believe in
good earnest, then our strength fails us if
God do not support us, and help our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief;

                     <p>Faith is a secret and a sudden work,
when it comes it gives some sense of it self
to an observing Christian, that quickly
convinces us of a change in our selves, a
heart truly turned to God, is not the same
it was before, not in the same posture,
not in the same disposition and frame,
there is something new appears in every
new Creature, that do's not belong to the
Old Man but rises up in opposition to
him: this newness do's not lye in some
one corner of the heart, but every where,
'tis universal in every faculty; all things
are become new, though the old leaven
be not totally cast out any where, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103587:17"/>
lest as an occasional provocation and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to the Grace of God to act in more
opposition to those motions of sin, that
put a force upon the New Creature, are
directly contrary to the bent and genius
of our renewed Nature; till Faith comes
we are never sensible of any such inward
Conflicts between the flesh and the Spirit;
but then the fight begins, the good fight of
Faith: 'Tis Faith strikes the first stroke,
makes the first assault upon our reigning
sin and corruptions, and will never cease
contending with them, till it has got a full
Victory over them, and throughly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
them.</p>
                     <p>But how shall we know in the very

                     <p>When the word Works effectually after

touch upon the heart at the time of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

of the occasional Conversion of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer,

where there was Prophesying and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
'tis probable some such are come

their Hearts were prick'd, they cry out in
the midst of the Sermon, <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
what shall we do?</hi> We want such pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Conversions, had we more of these
New Births in our Congregations; we
should have more of these out cries;
which would be very awakening to us all,
if God would honour his Ordinances with
such visible signs of his presence, as in the
Primitive Times the Word was preached
with that power, that it wrought a great
consternation and astonishment in the
whole Assembly, there was a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon their minds, which had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
effects; some blasphemed, and some
believed, but all were moved and stirred,
struck inwardly, though many saw not
the hand that struck them; 'tis otherwise
now; hearers are more unconcern'd, in
a more drowsie frame; we can hardly
keep them waking all Sermon time; they
say these were extraordinary cases, not
applicable to us now: I must tell you,
Conversions wrought by ordinary means
now, are extraordinary things, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
effects; the Light into which
we are brought, is, and ought to be, as
marvellous in our Eyes now, as 'twas in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103587:18"/>
theirs heretofore; they who find nothing
of this, neither in nor after Conversion,
would do well to make a stricter inquiry
into their state; sometimes we bring down
Grace as low as we can for the sake of
weak ones, but we must not make nothing
of it, to please some who would rest in a
silent easie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Conversion, and think to go
Heaven by the charitable Opinion others
have of them; that so great a change as
Conversion is, should make so little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance

it, is that we should not easily digest,
Let every one examine himself.</p>
                     <p>Should God come upon any of you
with a through Conviction of Sin, and
give you a real sight of Christ as your only

he did not consider which foot he should
put foremost, but leaped up on a suddain,
broke out into a passionate inquiry after
the way of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Faith especially at its first entrance,
when it first comes into our Hearts, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103587:19"/>
accompanied with a through Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of our lost undone Estate: I don't
speak now of those legal Convictions that
in some may be preparatory to Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but of that saving Evangelical Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that is of the Essence of saving Faith,
alwayes accompanying it, it is the reason
of Faiths earnestness in its first actings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ, <hi>Master save us, we perish.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Acts</hi> we have several instances
of Faith wrought in the time of hearing,
<hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44. <hi>While Peter yet spake, the
Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the
word:</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 8. <hi>Acts</hi>
28. 24. <hi>Paul</hi> perceived Faith in the Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by his attentive hearing, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 9.</p>
                     <p>When Faith does not make this publick
entrance into the Hearts of those who hear
the word; as it did in the Primitive times,
in the view and face of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and 'tis much to be lamented
that it does not: I fear it portends more
than I am willing to tell you; yet I hope
Faith may and does come in a more silent
manner into your Hearts at the time of
hearing; this you may know by a sudden
astonishment, and trembling that <hi>sezes</hi>
upon the Soul, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 33. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 12.
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 6. When a discovery of the Evil
of Sin, and of the Grace of Christ do meet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103587:19"/>
together in one saving Conviction in the
Conscience of an awakened Sinner, we
must needs be variously affected with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and hope; Grace clothes it self with
contrary passions at the same time, as it
looks at Sin, and at Christ, loathing the
one, and embracing the other; this may
be perceived at the first opening of the
Heart to believe the Gospel, a present act
of Faith is and will be the present sense
of the Soul in and about what it believes;
there is no putting the word from us,
when once we believe it in our Hearts:
Men may talk of Gospel-Truths under a
formal profession of Faith, and not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with them, but the Word works
effectually in them that believe. Faith tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
the Soul in the most sensible part of
it, gathers up the Mind and Thoughts of
a Man into a close and serious debate with
himself, about those things which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
in reference to himself; his Heart
waxes hot within him; this is the
Power and Dominion that Faith has
over us, being the highest principle in
Man; it overcomes all contradictions
from the Flesh, answers all Carnal Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
throughly perswades a Man, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
establishes the Heart in the belief of the
present Truth, so that we become unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103587:20"/>
from the hope of the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>These are the inward Commotions that
Faith makes in the Soul at its first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
you cannot so slight the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Faith, as not to be greatly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
about them; 'tis not come to real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
till it comes to this; you are and
must be serious in and about that which
with your hearts you believe concerning
your Eternal State.</p>
                     <p>Whether you now are, or ever have
been in such a frame, God and your own
Consciences know best; they are not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles
that you believe, but matters of that
moment that you cannot but be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in them, and there is nothing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to fire your Hearts with a zealous soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and thoughtfulness about them, but
only your believing them; you can no
more step over such an act of Faith, than
you can cease to think while you are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thinking, or cease to move while actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
moving: An act of believing is the
Soul in actual motion towards Christ, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for refuge to the hope that is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. This is the way of the Spirit in
working Faith at the time of hearing;
and if you observe such a one whose heart
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103587:20"/>
the Word has reached; he goes home
musing upon what he has heard: Suppose
one standing in the Spirit of <hi>Isaiah</hi> at the
Meeting-door, as you go forth crying
out, <hi>Who hath believed our report, to whom
has the arm of the Lord been revealed this
day;</hi> how experimentally would such a
one say, I have believed, to me hath the
Arm of the Lord been revealed; follow
him further into his House, into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or Closet; behold he prayes, as the
Word brings down the sense of God into
the Soul; so Prayer carries up the sence
of the Soul, concerning that word, <hi>to
God above:</hi> Prayer, especially just after
Conversion, is but a Holy enlargement of
the Heart about those things that God
first speaks to us by his Word. <hi>I will say
'its my people, they shall say, the Lord is my
God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In hearing expect no other reason for
Faith, but the bare testimony of the
Word of God, search the Scriptures whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things are so or no, as Ministers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
if you find them so, charge them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Consciences as most worthy of all
acceptation and belief: Religion now a
dayes is branched out into so many specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and subtle questions wrapped up
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103587:21"/>
in such terms of art, under such nice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
that the power and simplicity
of the Gospel is almost lost, ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
know not what to believe while
the Pulpit gives such an uncertain sound.</p>
                     <p>There is not so much Rational Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
required to the obedience of Faith
as some imagine, leave others to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
to produce their Reasons <hi>pro</hi>
and <hi>con,</hi> do you quote Scripture and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
begging of God to direct your faith
into right apprehensions of his revealed
Will, hold fast there and you are safe,
the greatest Scholars in the World must
come down to the plain mans Faith, if
ever they die in peace, in all Gospel
Truths, their consonancy, not to our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but to the Scriptures is to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Mans leaning rather to their own
understanding of the thing, than to their
faith in the Word, about that thing, hath
led them into Error, into false notions of
Divine Mysteries. I grant from your
faith in one Truth you may fetch Reasons
for some other Truth depending upon it,
these are Gospel Reasons not your own;
we don't believe because we know, but
we know because we believe; this is a
new way of knowing things, which the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103587:21"/>
world is not acquainted with, because it
cannot receive the spirit of Truth, the
spirit of Truth is a spirit of Faith; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

themselves, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 13. to confirm
and strengthen your Faith, that you may
be built up further in it, furnished with
further matter to act it upon.</p>
                     <p>Let none be discouraged though never
so ignorant and unlearned, of a low,
mean, capacity, yet come to hear with an
expectation of Gods working faith in thee,
faith will overcome all these difficulties, as
weak and simple and ignorant as any may
be supposed to be, yet be not discouraged,
you may be made to believe more in one

                     <p>
                        <hi>It is written in the prophets</hi> (Joh. 6. 45.)
<hi>and they shall be all taught of God, every
man therefore that hath heard, and hath
learned of the father cometh unto me; Not
that any man hath seen the Father.</hi> 'Tis
not what men you hear, what Ministers
you follow, till God the Father do's speak
powerfully to your hearts by the Ministry
of man. It matters not who the man is,
your faith consists not in the Wisdom of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103587:22"/>
man, but in the power of God, when you
have a proof of Christs speaking in any,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3 then hearken diligently, till
you hear an inward Word from this invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Teacher, you'l never come to Christ.
If all the Ministers in the World should
lay their heads together, they could never
bring a sinner to Christ, till the Father
speaks the word and draw him. We are
but Ministers by whom you believe, as
the Lord gives to every man; <hi>So then,
neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he
that watereth, but God that giveth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,</hi>
1 Cor. 3. 5, 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>The sum of all is this, We are sent to
Preach, that you may Hear; we carry
the Letter of the Word to your Ears, the
Spirit brings it home in the name of God
to your Consciences, convincing you that
it is his Word, under this Conviction you
see the truth of the Word, in the veracity
of God, this word of Truth and your
Souls meeting so close, as they alwayes do
in an act of Faith, sanctifies you; this
sanctification lies in the ready assent of
your understanding, and free consent of
your Will, the one is founded in light,
the other in love, so that when an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
Understanding receives the Truth
in the love of the Truth, there is a firm
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103587:22"/>
Principle of Holiness fixed in that Soul,
flowing from that Union to Christ that
Faith gives us, this is the beginning and
progress of that Faith, the end of which
is the Salvation of your Souls.</p>

                  <head>The Second Point.</head>
                  <head type="sub">How we are Iustified by Faith.</head>
                  <p>WE ought to be Doers of the Word
and not Hearers only, to maintain
good Works for necessary uses, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 14. It
behoveth us therefore to know what use
we should make of our works and doings
in the great business of our Salvation, so
as not to entrench upon the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, not to degrade that from
being our sole and only justifying Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
Some men are as much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in grounding their salvation upon
doing, as others are in grounding it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bare hearing; and therefore these
things must be warily spoken unto, and
warily understood. When we urge the
necessity of doing the Word of God,
Carnal Reason lies at the catch, and is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103587:23"/>
ready to take every thing in a wrong
sense and meaning, and to bring down
the Mysteries of the Gospel to a low loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
vulgar Notion more suitable to humane
Reason. There are two extreams that
men are apt to run into; either they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
good works, or else, they trust in good
works; either they do in a careless formal
presumptuous manner, pretend to cast all
upon Christ, without any serious inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
after the Truth of Grace in themselves,
or ever proving it by its fruits; conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it altogether needless to be any way
active in their own salvation. Secondly,
If upon search they find any actings of
Grace in their Hearts, any fruits of Grace
in their Lives, these are their own proper
goods they think, Money found in their
own Purses; it matters not how they
came by it, they have it, and they are
resolved to convert it to their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
use, making it nothing less than a part
of their Justifying Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>Those of this way, with whom I have
now to do, do state the matter thus.</p>
                  <p>They say, that Christ is the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cause of our Justification, having by
his Death satisfied the Law, and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
us from the Curse of it; and so far
we agree with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:103587:23"/>
They say further, That Christ to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
our Justification, hath also purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for us strenght and ability to perform
the condition of the new Covenant (this
we assent to) the performance of which
according to them, is to be taken in as a
part of our Justifying Righteousness, and
this we deny.</p>
                  <p>We say the performance of what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the New Covenant, is a good
Justification of the Cause, whether it be
of Faith or of Good Works, or of any
particular thing or action, the sincerity
and truth of which may be in question.
But we deny that it adds any thing to the
Justification of the person, and therefore
they speak not <hi>ad idem,</hi> to the same thing,
when they deny Christs imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
to be the sole Righteousness that
justifies the Person, because there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Righteousness required, upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account to justifie or clear up the
sincerity of our Faith and Holiness; I say
to clear up this to our selves and other
men, which we deny not. For we do
not admit any Faith to be a justifying
Faith, but upon good evidence of the
Truth of it, neither do we admit any
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103587:24"/>
works to be good works but upon full
proof of the goodness of them.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of all is this; we say, Faith and
obedience once proved to be true and
genuine, are good evidences of our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in Christ, whose imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is the sole and only Righteousness
by which our Persons are universally
justified from all charges and blame what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
in the sight of God, and to say o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
is in effect to say that Christ died
to justifie us, that we might be justified
without him; or at least not only and
solely by him; which is highly derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the death of Christ, neither will
their owning Christ to be the meritorious
cause of our Justification salve the matter
while they do in any sense require ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Righteousness distinct from that of
Christs, for the justification of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the sight of God.</p>
                  <p>And having given you this brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the matter in difference, I shall
now proceed.</p>
                  <p>The Point in General which I am to
speak to is this. That though good works
are highly necessary in a justified person,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103587:24"/>
yet they not required in any way of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality
to the Justification of the Person.
Or thus, no part of our inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
can be any part of our justifying
Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>This I might prove to you many ways.</p>
                  <p>First, From the subject of Justification,
an ungodly Person; a believing Sinner
flying in the sense of Sin unto Jesus Christ
for Life and Pardon. Sin is that from
which we are Justified, the Righteousness
of Christ is that for which or by which we
are Justified, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 39.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because there must be a
change of stare in Justification, and by
Justification, before we can derive any sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace from Christ to enable us to the
least good work. I might also</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Argue from the weakness and
imperfection of all Inherent Holiness which
is not able to justifie it self, much less the
Person.</p>
                  <p>And many Arguments may be brought;
but my design is to contract this general to
a particular point, concerning the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>credere,</hi> or the act of believing; and I
shall shew that that part of our inherent
Righteousness that flows from our doing
the Word of God, that is, the Work of
Faith as done by us in an act of believing,
is no part of our justifying Righteousness.
This is that which seems to have the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
claim to, and interest in, our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if this be disproved, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will hold a <hi>fortiori</hi> against all the
inferiour branches of our inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
they must be forced to quit
their claim also.</p>
                  <p>That which seems to intitle Faith to
such an Interest in our Justification as is
pleaded for by some, is the phrase and
manner of expression which the Scripture
uses in speaking of Faith, telling us that
Faith is imputed to us for Righteousness,
that we are justified by Faith; that he
that believes shall be saved, and the like.</p>
                  <p>The question is, in what sense these
Scriptures are to be understood; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are to take up our standing part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the act of Faith, and partly in the
object of Faith, making up a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
partly from our selves, and partly
from Christ, or whether we are by Faith
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103587:25"/>
to go out of our selves unto Christ for our
whole, sole and only justifying Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
and this is that which I affirm,
and shall endeavour to make good, and
shew you that the Scriptures alledged do
not ascribe our Justification to the Act,
but wholly to the Object of Faith; not
to our believing, but to Christ believed
on, which I prove thus:</p>
                  <p>First, From those Expressions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
peculiar to Holy Writ, by which
the Holy Ghost doth of set purpose limit
Faith to its Object, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 47. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9:
33. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to believe
in, into, or upon Christ, which plainly
points out this, that Faith is alwayes to be
taken in relation to its Object; that by
Faith is meant Christ apprehended by
Faith. Life is promised, not simply to
believing, but to believing in; in whom?
in Christ, or nothing. Faith is a relative
term (as to its whole sense and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to the Object Christ. It must be
Faith in Christ, or Faith in nothing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
is a Scripture Phrase, setting forth
our leaning upon Christ. Faith, as our
Act adds nothing to Christ, doth not
make his Death satisfactory; it was so in
its self before, though by an applicatory
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103587:26"/>
act of Faith it is made so to us; that is, we
do reap the benefits of his Death and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
we are not united to Faith,
but by Faith we are united to Christ.
Faith is the <hi>Medium uniens;</hi> we do not
trust in our Faith, but by Faith we trust
in Christ; all that Faith signifies is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Christ; all that it doth, is in the
Name of Christ; without Christ it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
nothing, it doth nothing, it is nothing.
When we are said to be justified by the
Faith of Christ, or justified by Faith in
Christ, <hi>Gal</hi> 2. 16. pray must the meaning be,
that we are justified by Faith, and Christ,
as some would have it, giving the priority
to Faith, and making Christ but a remote
cause of our Justification, and our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Righteousness to be the next and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
cause? Were Men more willing
to exalt Christ, and debase themselves,
this would be <hi>English</hi> plain enough:
Faith in Christ would then signifie but one
Righteousness; it would not be Faith
and Christ. Let Men have a care how
they speak unadvisedly of Christ to the
lessening and diminution of his Honour:
God hath said he is our Righteousness
without any Limitation, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction:
Now for Men to say, ay but not
all our Righteousness, not our only Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103587:26"/>
I say, 'tis a bold word thus to
distinguish whatever remote inferences
they may gather out of Scripture to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their meaning; yet since God hath not
thought fit to drop any such diminutive
expression of Christ in Scripture, I say it
is a bold word for Men to Speak. You
may see how severely speaking against
God was punished, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 5, 6. And
God complains of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 35. 13. <hi>With
your mouths ye haue boasted against me, and
have multiplyed your words against me: I
have heard them.</hi> We may safely deny any
thing of God that implies weakness or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection;
but to deny that of Christ
which tends to the Exaltation of his Name
and riches of his Grace; let Men distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
how they will, it is dangerous med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
here: This is a tender point; that is
the first.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the bare act of Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any relation to the object, justifies;
then any act of Divine Faith will justifie
us as well as Faith in Christ; for the Act
is specified by the Object: Take away the
Object, and all Acts of Faith are alike,
equally insignificant. But I proceed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:103587:27"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To the third Argument that
shall be drawn from the Nature of Faith,
which consists in receiving. As it is the
Act of a Believer, it implies doing; but
properly as an Act of believing; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in receiving, and that with an empty
hand: Now the question is whether by
this receiving Act of Faith there do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to us a Righteousness of our own,
distinct from that which we receive from
Christ? I say no: We are not justified by
a Righteousness that we do, but by a
Righteousness that we receive: Now the
bare Act of receiving in a common Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
way, is not counted morally meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
A Beggars receiving an Alms, argues
no merit in the Receiver, but meer Grace
in the Donor. We count that he who
only receives a benefit, he doth nothing
for it, it comes freely: Indeed he doth
something naturally in receiving, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
morally by way of merit for the
thing received. Thus it is among Men,
and so we understand it, in all such act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of ours; but when we come to deal
with God, how do our proud hearts put
a value upon them; then we put a value
upon every thing, upon our coming, upon
our adhering, upon our relying, upon
our asking, upon our receiving; We
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103587:27"/>
grow proud of those very Acts of Grace
by which we do express our Poverty and
Beggary, our absolute Dependance upon
another; as if Christ was beholden to us
for our accepting of him: So naturally
prone are we to rest upon any thing that
looks like our own doing.</p>
                  <p>Brethren! There are two things to be
considered in Faith.</p>
                  <p>(I.) The Motion of the Soul in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
which is an Act naturally necessary
to all manner of receiving; it is as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
forth, and opening the hand.</p>
                  <p>(2.) You may consider the passive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
it self, wherein the Nature of Faith
doth chiefly consist, in admitting, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and owning the Gift.</p>
                  <p>Though the word Believing doth Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
imply an Action, yet really and
physically we are passive in believing:
For these Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The first Reason is this; They
who make our Act of believing a part of
our Justifying Righteousness, do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
make Faith to contradict it self
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103587:28"/>
in and by its own Act: If by an Act of
believing we go out of our selves to Christ
for all: I do not see how by the same Act
we can possibly settle upon any thing in
our selves that is not Christ: If by being
justified by faith they understand the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of faith, then we agree with them;
then faith and Christ is all one: By faith
we mean Christ applyed, and nothing but
Christ. But if they understand the bare
Act of believing in distinction from Christ
the Object; therein we differ from them.
And they must so understand it who make
our Act of believing a part of our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Righteousness distinct from Christs
Righteousness; and therein I say, they
make faith to contradict it self in and by
its own Act: I do not know whether I am
understood; I think I understand my
self in what I have said: Take it thus,
Pray consider what is the sense of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Soul under a present Act of faith in
Christ? I appeal to you all, I desire you
would all be Judges in this matter who
have ever been serious, and in good
earnest, dealing with God by an act of
faith for Salvation. You believe in Christ,
what is the <hi>English</hi> of that? What do you
mean by it? Is not this your sense; you
desire to cast yourself wholly upon Christ,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103587:28"/>
to be found in Christ not having on your
own Righteousness; to be built upon that
Foundation, to lay hold on Eternal Life in
Christ; to go out of your selves unto
Christ for Righteousness and Life; to
seek that in another which you have not
in your selves; to count all things but
loss and dung that you may win Christ;
don't you mean this? Pray what an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
then is it, what a gross contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to say I am justified by something
in my self, by virtue of that very act of
faith, by which I do purposely go out of
my self to Christ for all. If this be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Sense, I have quite lost the use
of both, and will never pretend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
any thing. But how do some
Men fight with their own shadows and
lose themselves in their own expressions.
They cannot speak of Christ, and of the
way and manner of applying Christ, but
presently they must be Co-workers with
Christ in their Justification.</p>
                  <p>Brethren! We must not be perswaded
out of our Christian Names, nay out of
Christianity it self by those who would
impose their own notions upon us, and
indeed preach another Gospel; let them
read on and tremble. But I will say this,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103587:29"/>
that if <hi>Paul</hi> were alive, and should hear
any man upon Earth, or Angel from
Heaven compound Faith and Works,
Works and Christ in the matter of our
Justification, I doubt not but he would
curse them in the name of the Lord. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we are not to be Mealy-mouthed,
and silently suffer the grand principles of
the Gospel to be decryed, as if we doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whether they were true or no. These
are the Pillars of the House, all fall with
them, if they be taken away. These are
the Ancient Land-marks and bounds of
our Religion; they must not be removed,
for if you suffer that, you will quickly
have a dead Child in the room of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
New Notions, though not contrary
to any received foundation, should be
warily uttered; but supposing there is
the least discrepancy or opposition, it
is our duty and wisdom to be silent, and
not break the eye of the Needle, by forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Camel through. New Notions
must yield rather to antient received
Truths, they must be governed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
by them. It is dangerous to force plain
Scripture, and plain principles to make
good our own private interpretations.</p>
                  <p>2. Our act of believing is no part of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103587:29"/>
our justifying Righteousness, because justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is an act of God; not properly
subsequent to our Faith, but simultaneous
with it. They are concomitants, so close,
so instantaneous, that we cannot say which
is first, or last in time; we cannot say the
one takes its rise from the other. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
my self thus; it is one thing for the
Scripture to speak Doctrinally of Faith,
another thing to speak of a Believer under
the actual exercise of Faith. When the
Scripture speaks of the Doctrine of Faith
in the Abstract, it tells us the consequents
of it, that according to Gods order and
appointment, Faith is requisite unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and so Faith is antecedent to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and Justification is spoken of
as a thing to come, upon our believing.
The Doctrine of Faith shews what shall
be to all who obtain it; the actual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Faith shews, what is to them who
have it, and do believe it. It is not only
he that believes shall be saved and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but is justified. It is true, who ever
believes shall be saved; the just shall live
by faith, this is Doctrinally true. But he
that believes hath everlasting Life, <hi>Iohn</hi>
3. 39. is justified; this is experimentally
true. God, if you rightly consider the
point, doth justifie us, by working Faith
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103587:30"/>
in us. It is his way of Justifying; it is the
way God hath chosen to communicate the
Righteousness of God, which is a stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Mystery, and cannot be otherwise
applied to the soul. He doth not justifie
us because of any antecedent act of Faith
we have lying by us, and which we could
now produce as a price (as it were) and
Meritorious Means of our Justification.
God justifies us by working Faith in us;
God being willing in so great an act of
Grace, to speak to our Understandings
and Knowledge, he hath appointed Faith
as a fit means by which the soul not only
doth the thing, but also lets in a sense of
what is done upon the soul; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faith the Apostle; <hi>it is of faith that it
might be of grace:</hi> God will be understood
in all the acts of his Grace towards us. Now
that there might be in us a sense of recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so great a benefit, God resolves
to put it into the hand of Faith, which
hath a natural sutableness in it, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to receive what free Grace tenders to
it; and so it doth when it is in any
strength. Christ and our Souls would
never meet were it not for Faith. There
is no letting down any thing spiritual and
supernatural into the soul, but by Faith;
Faith is our <hi>modus habendi,</hi> it is the <hi>way,</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:103587:30"/>
the <hi>means</hi> by which we come to have God
and Christ, and an Interest in the things
of Heaven. We have what we have from
Christ by Faith, and we hold it by <hi>Faith.</hi>
Faith and Repentance as acted by us,
and reflected upon, are very good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of our Justifications, for it is in that
reflection only that they do give evidence
of themselves, and of any thing produced
from them. Therefore, I say, as they are
reflected upon they have retrospection to
our Justification, of which they are very
good and evident proofs; but they have
no antecedent causality to produce the
thing signified, because they signifie it, as
a thing already done, past and perfect.</p>
                  <p>3. And lastly, Justification is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set down in Scripture without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to these acts of Grace in us, to
shew that it wholly flowes from Christ;
and that by our believing we add nothing
to our Justifying Righteousness, but do
only apply it, as wholly derived from
Christ alone, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath
the Son, hath life;</hi> they that are in Christ
there is no Condemnation to them, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 1. Now because we cannot admit sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to be in Christ but by faith, therefore
what flows from Christ, is attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103587:31"/>
faith; which is, I say, our <hi>modus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi,</hi>
but still the real cause of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
that which makes us just in the
sight of God, is our being in Christ, and
our having the Son. There is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of having any thing else; but
faith is our <hi>modus habendi;</hi> we cannot
have the Son but by faith, nor be in Christ
but by Believing. Therefore God speaks,
to our Understanding, and hath attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that to the act of faith, which is only
derivable from the Object.</p>
                  <p>I shall now shew you the weakness of
those grounds and reasons they go upon,
who differ from us in this point.</p>
                  <p>1. They speak much of a Charge of
Infidelity, Impenitency and Unholiness to
be drawn up against us at the last day, and
therefore it concerns us to muster up all
our good works, all our acts of Grace,
and every part of our inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that we may be in a readiness to
answer to this Charge and clear our selves.</p>
                  <p>A specious Argument! enough to amuse
the World, and fright men back into
the Popish Doctrine of Justification by
Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:103587:31"/>
Brethren! I do not deny that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
impenitent and ungodly Persons
shall be charged with infidelity, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
and ungodliness, and be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but to talk of a charge of Infidelity
against a Believer at the last day, I say, it
is a groundless, unscriptural Notion. I
do not deny that the faith of the Saints
that draws them to Christ, and its effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
afterwards in all its fruits, will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of by Christ, when they are
admitted into the Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34.
<hi>Come ye blessed;</hi> and when that blessedness
is fixed, Christ doth not put them upon
the proof of their faith, but helps them
himself to understand the former actings
of their faith and love to God, which
they were ignorant of before. <hi>When saw
we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty
and gave thee drink? &amp;c. In as much as
ye have done it to one of the least of these, ye
have done it to me.</hi> I see more Grace in
you saith Christ, than ever you saw in
your selves, so and so appearing in your
lives; <hi>Come ye blessed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brethren, Good Works are good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
to us, to make out the Truth of
Grace in us; but the All-knowing God
needs no such Evidences for his Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103587:32"/>
he knows what is in man, and needs
not that any should tell him. He searches
the Heart. Though we see Grace only
in the Fruit, yet God sees it in the Root
and Principle. Besides, I conceive, the
last Judgment is not to prove who is, and
who is not in a state of Grace; but rather
to pronounce the Sentence according to
the state that every one shall appear in
at the Resurrection. There will be no
doubting of any mans state at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
the method and manner of the
Resurrection will decide it. Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
will separate the Sheep from the
Goats; and he will do this before the
Judgement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 32, 33. You shall
know a Believer then by his Station at
the right hand of Christ; by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
among the Sheep. The Angels are
sent forth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. togather up the
Elect from the four Winds, from the one
end of Heaven to the other. They will
ransack every corner of the World to find
out every Saint; not only the Ninety and
Nine, but the whole Hundred shall be
presented to God; not one missing, we
shall all stand together. Now after they
are thus ranked by Christ, and the Angels
have declared them to be Sheep, to be
true Believers, must they come under a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103587:32"/>
charge of infidelity? Who must draw
up this charge, and manage this false In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment?
Either God, or good Angels,
or Conscience, or the Devil. God he
hath justified them here, sealed them by
the Spirit of Adoption to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and he will never reverse his
judgment.</p>
                  <p>The judgment of God at the last day
will be pursuant to the judgment already
past by his Word and Spirit in the Hearts
and Consciences of Believers here. Good
Angels are imployed to gather up the
Elect, and consequently they have a true
discerning who they are. Our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are sprinkled with the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and have an answer in readiness, by
the Resurrection of Christ from the dead.
And the Devil will have something else
to do in that day, when he stands at the
head of the wicked to receive his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
with them, the time of his torment
being then come. Though he be now
the accuser of the brethren day and night
before God, he must then Eternally be
cast down. True, he is now our accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
and we must labour to overcome
him by the Blood of the Lamp, as <hi>Rev.</hi>
12. 10, 11. that is, by Arguments drawn
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103587:33"/>
from the Blood of Jesus; yet I say fear
him not after death. The last enemy that
shall be destroyed is Death, saith the
Apostle; and must we have an after ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with the Devil? Must we be set
upon a fresh by him? No, no, after
death he hath done with you for ever;
he will not dare to look you in the face
at the last day: He draw up a charge
against you? You shall accuse, judge and
condemn him, and all the Devils in Hell,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3. Never fear, you that dye
in the Lord, shall rise up under those
denyable evidences of a state of Grace,
that neither the Devils nor wicked Men
shall dare to gain-say. What, must poor
Christians who have lived under doubts,
fears, under buffetings and temptations,
under accusations and challenges from
the Devil and their own Consciences,
must they rise so? Is this to be raised in
power, with our Spirits made perfect?
Surely <hi>Paul</hi> was out in his triumph, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 33. <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge
of Gods elect?</hi> Do you make good your
Title to Christ now, and never fear any
charges afterwards at that day; it will
be a joyful day to Believers. <hi>Look up,</hi>
saith Christ, <hi>lift up your heads for your
Redemption draweth nigh, Luke</hi> 21. 28.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103587:33"/>
And therefore comfort one another;
your Witness is in Heaven, and your
Record is on high, as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, God,
Christ, Angles, Conscience, will all be
on your side.</p>
                  <p>Aye, but if this feigned process be not
observed, some mens notions will fall to
the ground. Aye, and let them fall;
no matter how soon; for they are not
grounded upon the Word of God that
endureth for ever. Brethren, we must
not draw Schemes and Models from our
own Brain, and when we have done,
impose them upon God, and make his
proceedings in every particular exactly to
suit the methods of Humane Judicatures:
The natural notion of these things is so
strong in some mens heads, that it doth
carry them out beyond the line of the
Gospel. Good works certainly do best
furthest off from the judgment seat of
God. They are good and comfortable
evidences here, but they will make but
a sorry Righteousness there for us to
plead. Though God may and will take
notice of all the fruits of his Grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in our words or works, when he
passeth the solemn declaratory Sentence
at the last day, which is but a fuller ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103587:34"/>
of our justification. God will
personally and publickly own that which
he hath secretly in our Consciences, done
by his Word and Spirit in us. God doth
now act mediately by his word, then he
will act immediately by himself; we shall
hear the sentence of our Justification from
his own mouth, which now we hear on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the mouths of his Ministers that
speak to us in his name.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The second ground they go
upon is this, they say, that it is a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
service imposed upon us by God
in the new Covenant; and therefore the
performance of it must needs be part of
our Justifying Righteousness; which is
very specious, and very suitable to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Reason, as most things are that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the Mysteries of the Gospel, but
it is of like sound and significancy with
the other.</p>
                  <p>Alas! At how little a hole will self-Righteousness
creep in? How apt are we
in the pride of our hearts to distinguish
our self-Righteousness into our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we may have somewhat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to glory. To prevent mistakes I will
premise one thing; that is this, I do not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103587:34"/>
deny, but that to believe in God, in
Christ, is an eminent piece of service, a
great act of Divine Worship, the greatest
act of Worship we can perform to God
on this side Heaven. But I deny that
it is a service done in order to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
or purchasing those benefits which
we receive from Christ as his free gift.
Faith receives what Christ hath already
procured. Faith doth not come to Christ
to desire him to dye for us; but having
dyed for us, it comes for the fruit of his
death: It comes on no other Errand but
to receive what is already prepared.
Faith hath no causality or efficiency at all
in contriving, compassing, constituting
the great act of Grace, wherein the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of our sin and our justification is held
forth unto us. Our Faith did not move
God to promise pardon, but finding all
this Grace in Jesus, Faith applyes it, lays
hold on it, and God gives us leave, nay
commands us to do this. So that Faith is
a service we owe to God by way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in complyance with his free Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, but it is not a service done by
us in way of procuring that which is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given. No, no, we owe that to Christ
and not to Faith. Brethren! In common
acceptation, when we say come to me,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103587:35"/>
and I will do this and that for you; pray
who is the doer, he that comes to have
the thing done, or he that doth it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
if coming be a service in this case,
it is a service done to a Mans self, and
can never be urged as a service done to
God.</p>
                  <p>But they further say, that this is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
service: Why? Because God
hath commanded us to believe that we
may be justified. Commanded us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and pray, what is that? I told you
before the meaning of an act of Faith,
even to renounce our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to come in our nakedness and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
to Christ, without Money or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Moneys worth, that we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
by him in all things. Is not this
the old, honest, plain down-right notion
of believing? And is this the Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
service required? Why don't you do
it then? Who is against it? Only let
them attend to the sense of Faith, and
not be carried away with the meer word
and talk of Faith, as their own act, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
regarding the inward sense and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the thing it self. Hath God
required us to believe in Jesus; let us
know what that means and do it; no
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103587:35"/>
body is against it. If that be the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
service, let them lye low before
God, and seem more vile in their own
eyes, and cast themselves upon Christ for
all. Let them learn to come without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
This is the proper Obedience of
Faith; that Obedience which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospel doth require; and
since you will call this a condition, I say,
why don't you perform it? Is this the
performance of such a condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
according to the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of believing, to tell the World that
Christ is not our only Justifying Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that we must seek for something
in our selves to joyn with him, if ever
we will be saved? Is this the condition?
Doth God mean this, when he bids me
believe in Jesus? Sirs! Let us not read
our Bibles backwards; wresting Scripture
to our own destruction: It is strange to
me, that Faith which is all along in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
opposed to Works in our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and is appointed by God to shut all
good works out of Justification, should
be thus made an inlet to bring all good
works into Justification. Oh! That we
were more under the powerful actings of
true Justifying Faith, it would then open
it self more fully to us, and shew us its
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103587:36"/>
meaning. I wish we could a little better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the actings of our Faith, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the reason, the sense of it, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
the intent of an act of Faith,
what a thing Faith is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They suppose a double Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and a double Justifying Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
the first to justifie us from the
accusations of the Law, the other to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the sincerity of our Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;
and here comes in all our inherent
Righteousness. This is specious too: But
I would not have men coyn new heads
of Divinity to make good their own
notions. We know but of one Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
I say, the second Justification,
which they talk of, it is implyed in the
first; and therefore needless and unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:
For since the Revelation of the
Gospel, infidelity and unbelief is a sin
against the Moral Law; and Faith in
Christ is injoyned as a duty by the Moral
Law; by which we take God to be our
God, and consequently do bind our selves
over to believe whatsoever he had, or
hereafter should reveal to be his Will.
This we are bound to by the Moral Law;
therefore if we are (as they themselves
affirm) freed by Justification from the Law
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103587:36"/>
of Works upon the condition of Faith,
then we are on our first Justification ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
freed from infidelity, and our
Faith is sufficiently approved to be true,
and what then need a second Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
unless we will suppose an error in
the first Judgment; which is impious to
suppose; as if God should acquit us from
the accusation of the Law of Works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the condition of Faith; which upon
after examination, Christ discovers to be
false and unsound. So that these things
do not hang together.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They say that Faith and
Holiness are conditions and evidences of
our title to Christ, and all that comes by
him; and therefore part of our Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rightcousness.</p>
                  <p>It is hard to understand the strength of
some mens reasoning; but grant all
this, it amounts to no more but Christ,
and a title to Christ, so far we are agreed,
for we desire no more. But how they
will make Faith which is our title to
Christ, and unto which Christ and all his
benefits are by the Gospel granted, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
and made over; how they will
make this title never so well evidenced,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103587:37"/>
to be part of our Justifying Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I see not: A title adds nothing to
the inheritance, makes it neither more
nor less, but conveys it down to us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the intrinsick value of the
thing, be it more or less. A title to Land
is no part of the Land; only we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
in it as it is, by vertue of our title.
Now therefore if the Righteousness of
Christ be not of it self sufficient to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
us, I see not how a good title mends
the matter; for if the Estate be never so
great, and we have no good title to it, it
is worth nothing to us; and if our title
be never so good, we can have no more
then is, and belongs to the title. So that
after all this stir about conditions and
evidences of our title to Christ, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of all is this, we have a title, a good
title, are under all the conditions and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of a good title; but to what?
To an Inheritance that is not sufficient to
maintain us, to a Righteousness that is
not sufficient of it self alone to justifie
us; and where are we now with our
conditions and evidences of our title?
For ever distitute of a compleat Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Righteousness. Is this to Preach
Christ? To Preach the glad Tidings of
the Gospel? Is this the way to quiet and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103587:37"/>
settle the Consciences of poor distressed
sinners? surely no.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They urge the literal sense of
some few Scriptures that seem to speak
for them; especially two; and I do not
know of more in the whole Bible, as to
the literal signification; if there were we
should hear enough of it. I know they
quote many others, which add no weight
at all to the Argument they would ground
upon them, Therefore I shall not speak
to them. Those two are <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 37. <hi>By
thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy
words thou shalt be condemned;</hi> and that
in <hi>Iames,</hi> where it is said, <hi>Abraham was
justified by works, Iam.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
                  <p>For that in <hi>Matthew, Calvin</hi> charges
the Papists with very great weakness in
offering to draw an Argument from that
Text for Justification by Works. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate</hi>
a Learned Jesuite on the other
hand is very angry with <hi>Calvin</hi> for suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be so
weak and injudicious, as to argue so from
that Scripture; for, saith he, we very
well understand that this Text doth not
speak <hi>De justificatione, qua justi efficimur,
sed de judicis sententia, qua, sumpto ex
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103587:38"/>
verbis nostris argumento, justi declaramur.</hi>
So saith the Jesuite; we know this Text
doth not speak of that which is the cause
of our Justification, of the thing for which,
and by virtue of which we become just
and righteous, only here is the appearance
of our Righteousness by our words, and
we are declared to be Righteous. So that
this doth not touch this cause of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and yet this is the main Text
brought for it, the main proof repeated
again and again, to prove inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
to have an influence into our
Justification. I say let them take the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from the Papists or Protestants, which
they please, they are both against them
in this thing.</p>
                  <p>As for the other Scripture, They will
take it in no other sense but what implyes
a contradiction to all other Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the case. The whole current of
Scripture is against Works in Justification,
and leads us to a fair construction of that
in <hi>Iames,</hi> that it is to be understood of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
before men, and not of a justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before God. Protestant Writers have
sufficiently cleared up this, to the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all but such who are resolved not to
be Convinced. Certainly they should have
a care how they abound too much in their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103587:38"/>
own sense. The Learned Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>
saith, <hi>that a little Phylosophy makes men A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,
but a great deal will convince them
of a Deity.</hi> Some mens Logick and School
Learning overthrows Reason, which due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
improved and well managed, would
teach them to argue otherwise: Certainly
in our reasoning about Divine things we
should be careful not to abound too much
in our own sense. It is better for us to
leave the Mystery of the Gospel in its
Mystery where we found it, than to seek
to draw it out, and so to explain it, as to
force it into the mould of Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
shaping it on every side to an exact
conformity to the thoughts and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our weak imperfect Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
I say, no Gospel Truth will bear
this. After all our Faith and Knowledge
and Experience, we know but in part,
and there is at the end of every Gospel
Truth, a Mystery; something that is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our Understanding, that calls for si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
for an holy Admiration, for an
humble submission in Faith to the Will of
God. Therefore I would not have men
speak as if they knew all, and draw par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Schemes, and it must be so, and
no otherwise; and thus and thus you must
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103587:39"/>
proceed in this and that way and form,
therefore things must be so stated.</p>
                  <p>I have done with the Argumentative
part. I will now speak a word or two in
a looser way of Discourse.</p>
                  <p>I say then thus, he may be a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
who doth not take his faith for any
part of his Justifying Righteousness; I
suppose that will be granted: But he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a true Believer who takes not
Christ for his Justifying Righteousness. I
do not say now for his only Justifying
Righteousness, because I would speak in
the sense of those I oppose. I say, they
cannot be Believers who do not look upon
Christ as their Justifying Righteousness;
but they may be true Believers who do
not look upon faith as a part of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
Righteousness. For the first, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it an Error, it is only about the act
in our apprehension which doth not alter
the nature of the thing at all. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is an Error in the act, which quite
destroys the very nature of faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the safer way is rather to press per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to believe, to see they have faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and in Truth, than urge them to such
an unscriptural construction of their faith,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103587:39"/>
putting such a title of Honor upon it to the
reproach of Christ and his Righteousness.
They honour faith sufficiently who only
prefer Christ before it. No doubt God
will give faith its due praise and place at
the last day; our not knowing or not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the reach and truth of our
faith in all circumstances of it, will be no
prejudice to faith at the last day. I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
wish, we were more in the Exercise
of Faith than in Controversies about it;
more in the Practise of Good Works than
in Dispute about them; we should then
sooner understand both the one and the
other. Sirs! the mysterious, sublime
Doctrine of Justification was revealed
for our comfort, and proposed to our
faith to be believed; not to our reason
to argue upon in a <hi>Quodlibetical</hi> manner
and to toss to and fro for Argument sake.
What if we know no more of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then is absolutely necessary for our
Justification? This is the case of many
plain, sincere hearted Christians; and if
it were so with us all, we may have fewer
Notions in our Heads, but possibly more
Grace in our Hearts. The Lord grant,
that we may know the Doctrine of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
so as they know it who are saved
by Christ. But <hi>surgunt indocti &amp; rapiunt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103587:40"/>
Coelum, &amp; nos cum doctrinis nostris sine
corde, volutamur in carne &amp; in sanguine.</hi>
The Learned they dispute and wrangle
themselves into Hell; the unlearned they
believe, practice and gain Heaven, taking
up the truth in simplicity according to the
general scope of the Gospel, as it is held
forth to the meanest Capacity. Brethren!
what <hi>Paul</hi> said to the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31.
that I say to you all, <hi>Believe on the Lord
Iesus Christ, and thou and thy house shall be
saved.</hi> Don't you go home now, and tell
your Families that they must not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this Text so as to look upon Christ
as their only justifying righteousness, but
look out for something in themselves, if
ever they be saved. No, pray speak Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Language, expound Scripture by
Scripture, and tell them, that Christ is
all in all; tell them plainly that they must
not be found in their own righteousness;
they must be <hi>found in Christ not having on
their own righteousness,</hi> that they must <hi>count
all things but loss and dung that they may
win Christ;</hi> that there is no <hi>other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but Christ, no other name under Heaven
by which they can be saved, but the name of
Christ;</hi> tell them they must not come for
Justification and Life in the name of their
Good Works, of any thing that belongs
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103587:40"/>
themselves; but only in the name of
Christ, promote this Doctrine in your
Families and among your Children and
Servants. This is the way to save you
and your Household. This is good, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
household Divinity, and suited to
the ordinary Capacity of all serious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.
We must not send our Hearers
to intricate distinctions, to learn the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Doctrine of their Justification.
The sense of the Gospel is plain enough
in this thing, they that run may read it.
Come, come, you shall never be charged
at the Last Day for giving too much to
Christ in the matter of Justification. You
are bound to ascribe all to him, and you
shall never be charged for giving too
much. And certainly if it be possible to
err on that hand, I had rather err in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much then too little to Christ. Do
you think that a true Believer, who doth
not look upon the act of Faith or works
of Holiness to be any part of his justifying
righteousness; but casts himself upon
Christ, do you think, I say, that God
will reprove such a person at the last day
for ascribing too much to Christ, and not
pleading his own righteousness? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Believer cannot plead the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ without Faith; his way of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103587:41"/>
arguing from Christ will sufficiently evince
the truth and reality of his Faith; there
needs no other proof and demonstration
of it.</p>
                  <p>I should have made some Application.
I will tell you what I intended.</p>
                  <p>First, To those who ground their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
upon the sandy Foundation of
their inherent Righteousness; I would
exhort them to pull down the house pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
before it fall upon their heads; and
lay a better Foundation, if ever they think
to stand before the Son of Man in his
Day.</p>
                  <p>Then I should exhort them, and press
them to study other Arguments, (as there
are very many) to promote Good Works
and practical Holiness among men; and
not justle out Christ to make room for self
Righteousness in the matter of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What, must we work for Life still?
To work for Justification is to work for
Life, and why should we thus turn the
Gospel into the Law?</p>
                  <p>I should speak also to those who are
built upon the right Foundation, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103587:41"/>
have cast themselves upon Christs Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
for Justification unto Life. Let
such be careful to maintain good Works;
let them be Examplary in the practise of
them; and bring forth fruit meet for the
Kingdom of God. For as the Foundation
may be too weak for the Superstructure,
so the Superstructure may be too mean for
the Foundation. And therefore down
with all this Hay, Wood and Stubble,
and labour to walk more sutable to that
Holy Faith under the Profession of which
you live. Brethren! The unsutable and
uncircumspect lives of Professors, have
been the greatest scandal to the Doctrine
of Justification by Faith; it hath opened
the Mouths of men against it. Therefore
labour to live men into a Conviction of
this Truth. Disputes and Words will not
do it, till you make it appear, that the
Grace of God that hath brought Life and
Immortality to light through the Gospel,
hath taught you to deny all Ungodliness
and Worldly Lusts. This is the way to
promote the Doctrine of Justification by
Faith alone. You that are built upon the
right Foundation had need be careful and
circumspect. The House is not yet finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we do all of us lie open more or less to
Storms and Tempests here below, though
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103587:42"/>
they cannot throw down the house, yet
they may shake the house; the rain may
beat into the house, may soak through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
room of the house, may foul the house;
may greatly incommode us and distress us.
Therefore keep your Souls in good repair,
keep them as tite as you can against Wind
and Weather.</p>
                  <p>And for your Comfort I would have
told you that Heaven will mend all the
Errors in the Superstructure, if the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
be right. God will then take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and separate all those weaknesses and
sinful mixtures that now run along with all
our Graces; all Cracks and Flawes, the
sinkings, and failings, the bendings and
leanings, this way and that way in any
part of the building, Heaven will mend
all, will set all right and straight; when
we are Sanctified throughout, and the
Top-stone is laid.</p>

the nature of Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
by comparing it with Legal
Repentance, observing as we go how
they differ from each.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Legal Repentance is the work of
the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> The work of the Spirit by
the Law, for the Law works but faintly
under the influence of meer Natural Light,
unless the Spirit awaken the Conscience,
and set home the Law, little will be done,
such a work of the Law you have <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 15. letting in a Spirit of Bondage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Conscience, accusing us for what
we have done against the Law, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us so convicted without any plea for
our selves.</p>
                  <p>Evangelical Repentance is the work of
the Gospel, sweetly melting the Heart by
Arguments drawn from the Love of God,
and his free Grace in Christ towards Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
it encourages a trembling Soul to
plead with God for Mercy as the Publican,
<hi>Lord be Merciful to me a Sinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) Legal Repentance is all terrour
and no hope, it rises from the revelation
of Gods Wrath against Sinners; 'tis a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing
Repentance without any hope of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103587:45"/>
pardon, the Curse of the Law lies hard
upon a Man; he knows not how to get
from under it, but lives in a fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of fiery indignation to devour
him, he is a terrour to himself: But Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Repentance leaves not an affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sinner altogether without hope, as I
shall shew under the next head.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Legal Repentance is from world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sorrow, not so much for the sin as the
penalty incurred thereby, the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of which is very dreadful to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
sinner; he is more affected with
the evil of punishment, then with the
evil of sin in it self; 'tis not for Gods sake
but his own, that he repents of sin; he
could love it well enough if it did not
damn him: Though I do not deny, but
a Repentance purely legal, may have
some sense of the evil of sin as sin, not
only as <hi>malum prohibitum,</hi> but as <hi>malum
in se,</hi> as evil in its own nature; where
common notions of good and evil are not
utterly extinguished, it must needs be so,
especially under a higher conviction from
the Spirit of God, that gives us a farther
discerning of the evil of sin, then the
meer light of nature under its greatest
elevation can possibly do. It was so in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103587:45"/>
                     <hi>Iudas, Matt.</hi> 27. 34. he was convinced,
not only that he had broken the Law of
God, but that he had sinned in so doing.
<hi>I have sinned in that I have betrayed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood:</hi> He knew he had a hand in
murdering a Man, a good Man, a great
Man, who was more then Man; no doubt
all this came up into his mind, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ, yet the knowledge of Christ
that <hi>Iudas</hi> had, did not reach so far as to
beget the least hope of Mercy from him;
and here lay the legality of his Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
it was a despairing Repentance,
he conversed only with the Law, and so
sunk under the wrath of God, and the
curse of the Law; he had none to accuse
him but his own Conscience, the Rulers
and chief Priests were for him, had set
him a work and rewarded him; but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him under such horror of Conscience,
he had done their business, what care
they, see thou to that; unconvinced sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
do slight the convictions of others,
they may go hang themselves for all them,
they have no pity for them.</p>
                  <p>I speak this to shew that legal Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
may take in something of the evil of
sin in it self, as well as the destructive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it to us; though these legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103587:46"/>
of the evil of sin in it self, are
far short of those more through convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that accompany true Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
Though the sorrow that is in
legal Repentance be but worldly; yet 'tis
very pungent, it pierces us thorow, and
pretends to some Devotion too, as if it
were for Gods sake, when self is only at
the bottom. <hi>Pharaoh confessed his sins,</hi>
and desired the Prayers of Gods People,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 27, 28. <hi>Saul wept for his sins,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16. The effects of Gods wrath
are very dreadful upon convinced sinners,
may draw Tears from their Eyes, when
they see what mischief they have brought
upon themselves; they repent, but how?
Not of the sin, but of the punishment:
Alas! What does that signifie, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
is it? What have we to do to
repent of the punishment? We can't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
it; 'tis Gods part to repent of the
punishment, to turn from his wrath, to
cease from his anger, which he will do,
when we repent of the sin that occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</p>
                  <p>To repent of the punishment, is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to be sorry that God is so just, that
he so severely animadverts upon sinners;
we wish he would let them go unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103587:46"/>
that we might more securely go on in
our sins; the only way to escape venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
is to acknowledge the sinfulness of
sin, and to repent of our great folly in
committing it; such a frame of Spirit
bears some proportion to the Holiness of
God, argues true Godly sorrow, which
worketh Evangelical Repentance unto
Salvation. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Legal Repentance is before Faith,
without Faith may never issue in saving
Faith, as in <hi>Cain, Saul, Iudas,</hi> but Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Repentance does alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
saving Faith; and of this I am now
to speak under the second head; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The nature of Evangelical
Repentance; what it is in its first rise and
original; upon what 'tis founded.</p>
                  <p>It came in with the Gospel, the Law
never intended any such thing, the sinner
was to be cut off by Law, to die without
Mercy, <hi>in the day thou eatest thou shalt die,</hi>
says the Law; <hi>unless ye repent,</hi> says the
Gospel; here is an exception put in (in
case of repentance) against the peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Sentence of the Law. I say repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103587:47"/>
comes in with the Gospel, <hi>I will put
enmity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Repentance rises
out of this Enmity. This seems to point
particularly at the Conversion of <hi>Eve,</hi> who
by Faith in the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> should
turn against the Serpent. <hi>I will put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between thee and the woman;</hi> this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whom thou hast deceived, shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thy Enemy, and bring forth a seed
that shall break thy head, thou shalt bruise
his heel, but his Death shall be thy over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
Repentance is a Gospel Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
purchased by Christ, 'tis an act of
Grace in God to injoyn us Repentance, as
his leaving men in an impenitent harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
frame is an act of his Justice and Wrath.
The Law in its Original Constitution, does
not intend the amendment of the sinner,
but his utter Destruction; the Law can
kill the sinner, but cannot mortifie the
sin; Damnation makes no man better,
but concludes him Eternally under sin and
wrath, the Justice of God is not obliged
to turn a sinner from his sins, but to turn
him into Hell for his sins.</p>
                  <p>That which makes it a just and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing with God to forgive the sins of
Believer, is Christs Merits and his own
Promise; 'tis Justice in God to make good
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103587:47"/>
his own Promises, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>
1. 6, 7. he is a debtor to his own promise,
he cannot deny himself, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13. he
owes the performance of his Promise to
his Faithfulness and Truth; 'tis an act of
Justice to himself to keep his Promise:
God offers Mercy to sinners, not because
they do repent, but that they may repent:
Repentance is not the Cause but the Effect
of Pardon, God always intends Pardon
to those whom he effectually calls to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
he gave no such call to the
Angels that fell; there was no Gospel
preached to them. No fallen Angel was
saved, because no Elect Angel fell, but
there are many of Gods Elect among the
fallen Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> to whom promises of
Salvation were made upon their believing
in Christ; this being published to all in
the Gospel, all who hear the Gospel do
put in for their share in this Salvation, and
that they may render the attainment more
easie and feazable to them, they deny ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Election, bring in Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
assert the liberty of Mans Will
to believe if he please, and supposing it to
be in their own power to believe, they
conclude they may be saved as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and this is the ground of all that
security that is among common Professors.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103587:48"/>
Having spoken thus much of Evangelical
Repentance as it implies a real hatred of
sin as sin, and a real turning to God as
the chiefest good from an inward change
of nature renewed after the Image of
God, I shall now shew you,</p>
                  <p>1. That such a Repentance can never
be wrought in any by the Law alone, the
Gospel has a principal hand in this.</p>
                  <p>Why not by the Law.</p>
                  <p>Because in the Law there are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
motives and inducements to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
nothing that encourages to it, that
renders it available to mans Salvation, the
law cannot give life to a sinner upon his
repentance; the Gospel can, but the Law
cannot, could a man under the Law, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
suppose that? What would he get
by it, he must to Hell after all, the Law
as a Covenant of Works does not seek to
bring a sinner to Repentance, but to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
the Law cannot give Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
unto Life, because it cannot give Life
upon our Repentance.</p>
                  <p>You'l say then, is the Law against Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103587:48"/>
I don't say so neither; for
take Repentance as 'tis a just equitable
thing, as a holy disposition of mind; so
the Law is not against it where ever it may
be found, as it is not against any other
act of Moral Righteousness as such that a
man may do, and yet for all this 'twill
condemn a man for his sin, and all his
righteousness shall not be remembred,
though the Law be not against Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
yet it will not accept of repentance
as a satisfaction for past sins, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
provides full satisfaction for the Law,
and promises sufficient and effectual Grace
to the sinner to bring him to repentance;
having rescued him from the Curse of the
Law, enables him to walk worthy of the
blessing of the Gospel, if those who are
justified were not sanctified, they would
live to the scandal of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>The Law cannot contradict it self, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already pronounced a peremptory
sentence of death upon the sinner, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
the Law should ever give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
unto Life, the Law insists upon the
Execution of its own Judgment, and will
not be satisfied till that be done, in this
the Gospel yields to the Law, to have
execution done upon man for sin, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103587:49"/>
provides a man on purpose, <hi>the man
Christ Iesus, who bore our sins in his own
body upon the cross.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. This Evangelical Repentance implies
real Sanctification, but the Law sanctifies
no man, because it can't convey its own
Holiness to another, can't alter the Nature
of a Man, but only shew him what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
his sin has done him, shews him his
sin in this or that instance, to his great
terror, but if he happen to out-live those
terrors, and not die in the fit as <hi>Iudas,</hi> his
evil heart will encline him as strongly to
sin, as ever it did before his former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
they made him give a present
start backwards, but he will quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
himself, and return to his wretched
course, he cannot cease from sin, though
he know it displeases God yet he likes it
never the worse for that, might he but
escape the punishment, 'tis not the wrath
of God in it self that he fears, but only as
it goes forth in the penal effects of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself, else he could suffer God to
be angry, and not be troubled at it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this goes most to the heart of a Child
of God, that he has incurr'd his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
<hi>There is no soundness in my flesh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of thine anger, Psal.</hi> 38. 3. The Law
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103587:49"/>
alone never works any real Sanctification
in a sinner; 'tis indeed the rule of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it judges us according to what we
are, but cannot make us better.</p>
                  <p>4. Repentance is a turning unto God,
but the Law gives no encouragement to
a sinner to turn to God, it holds forth the
Wrath of God against him, that makes
him run from the presence of an angry
God and hide himself as <hi>Adam</hi> did, how
can dry stubble stand before a consuming
Fire, but God out of Christ is a consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fire to a sinner, he dares not come
near him.</p>
                  <p>5. The law by it self can't work a sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conviction 'tis very Instrumental in
conjunction with the Gospel to do this,
but of it self it cannot. Saving Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is of the essence of Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>Saving Conviction hath these four pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
                  <p>1. It apprehends upon Scripture grounds
a possibility of a sinners Salvation, and
not only so, but a fair probability of it
upon the due use of those means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103587:50"/>
by God in order thereunto, and leads
out the sinner to seek relief in Christ, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
some hope of obtaining it.</p>
                  <p>2. It works a hatred of sin as sin, strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclines and disposes the heart of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to break off from his sins, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himself to a strict course of Holiness:
God offers Grace to sinners, because he
intends to give Faith and Repentance to
as many as are ordained unto Life, Faith
inclines us to beg Repentance, disposes us
to it, laies open the foulness of sin so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so convincingly that we cannot but
repent of it, under such a saving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
as Faith works in us, I call it a
saving Conviction, because it puts us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the diligent use of all means tending to
Salvation; a man is so convinced that he
cannot rest till he has found out an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
remedy to cure so deadly a disease, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will satisfie him but Christ, we see
not all that is in sin; till we see an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity of Christ to save us from it:
Here is a deep discovery of sin indeed,
when we know nothing but the Blood of
Christ can take it away; <hi>Behold the Lamb
of God,</hi> &amp;c. a Sacrifice of Gods provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all the Bulls, Goats, Sheep and Lambs
of Mans procuring will never expiate sin,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103587:50"/>
nothing that is among men can do it, but
God has a Lamb, cherished in his own
bosom from Eternity, this Lamb must be
slain to take away the sins of the World,
'tis very astonishing to think what God
parted with from himself to satisfie his own
Justice; his Attributes conspire together
to heighten and advance each other; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Grace lays out it self to satisfie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Justice, and satisfied Justice gives
way to infinite Grace to glorifie it self in
mans free Redemption.</p>
                  <p>3. It convinces us not only of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
sins, but of the general Corruption of
our Nature, 'tis by a Divine supernatural
Light that we discern this, we have a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it in our selves, from an inward
Principle of a higher Life raised up in us
by the power of God in our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which will not suffer us to walk any
more after the flesh, we cry and complain
of that proneness that is in us to evil; <hi>O
wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. No
unconverted man is brought in complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Corruption of his Nature, only
<hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and such like, but none
else. When we look upon the old man
with the eyes of the new, we see that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
that never appeared to us before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:103587:51"/>
4. It Convinces us not only of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of the Law, in punishing, but also
of the Holiness of the Law in all its just
and reasonable Commands; <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12.
This is a main difference between Legal
and Evangelical Repentance, that Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Sense that is in a Legal Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Holiness of the Law, is very
small, next to none at all, and that which
is, proceeds chiefly from the remainders
of light in all natural Men, left on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the Conscience, that all reverence
of God and his Law might not be quite
cast off, and something of this may now
and then appear under strong legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
of sin, as in <hi>Iudas,</hi> but all this
never begets any true love to Holiness,
for still they go on in their sins and have
pleasure in them that do so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32.
which is a great demonstration of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Dominion sin has over fallen man,
in carrying him on not only against the
known Law of God written in the Word,
but against all the natural Notions of the
Law written in his own heart, nothing
can hold him in, he despises God and man
and his own Conscience, he will not be a
Law to himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:103587:51"/>
Legal Convictions come short in all
these properties of saving Conviction.</p>
                  <p>Legal Convictions are either such as are
antecedent to the Commission of Sin, or
such as follow upon it, which are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called Convictions.</p>
                  <p>Convictions antecedent to sin, are all
one with the knowledge of the Law, by
which we understand what is morally
good or evil in it self; what is sin, and
what is not, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in innocency
were under this Conviction, they knew
what God had forbidden, <hi>viz.</hi> to eat of
the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil,
and that to eat of it in opposition to Gods
express command to the contrary, was a
high act of Disobedience, to be punished
with Death, but by the subtilty of the
Devil they yielded to the Temptation,
and did eat: if their perfect knowledge
of the Law could not keep them in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
from falling, how can we expect
that our imperfect knowledge of the Law
from any Convictions of that kind, which
we may be under should keep us.</p>
                  <p>And for those legal Convictions subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to the commission of sin, by which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103587:52"/>
we see the obliquity of our own actions,
and know our selves to be Transgressors
of a holy righteous Law, they fall short
in all the forementioned properties of
saving Conviction, they leave us without
hope of Mercy, work no renovation of
nature in us, they may disturb us in the
present act of sin, and terrifie us much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that, laying some present restraint
upon us, but they work no real Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in us, <hi>Iudas</hi> was in great horror of
Conscience for betraying his Master, was
much troubled that he should have a hand
in shedding innocent blood: and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the light and power of this Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how evil it was to Murder another, he
hangs himself, which was as contrary to
Law, as killing another: I speak this to shew
how legal convictions may hurry a man
from one sin to another, but they never
lead him into a constant setled way of true
Holiness, whence I infer that Convictions
purely legal will never work Repentance
unto Life.</p>
                  <p>How Repentance unto Life is wrought
by the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Because God hath appointed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to be the means of Repentance, <hi>Luk.</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:103587:52"/>
24. 47. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26. to the Glory of
his Free Grace, as Justice is glorified in
the Damnation of an impenitent sinner,
so Grace is glorified in his Conversion;
Evangelical Repentance is from a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Gods Love and Free Grace: <hi>His
goodness leads us to Repentance, Rom.</hi> 2. 4.
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 4. A true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
fears least he should miss of Mercy,
and come short of it, he rejoyces at the
good News of the Gospel, begins to lift up
his head in some expectation of a blessed
Redemption, he serves God chearfully
being perswaded that his Duties and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
will be pleasing to him and accepted
by him for Christs sake, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 4. <hi>Hos.</hi>
6. 1, 2. a sence of love and mercy quicken
up a drooping trembling sinner to return
unto God, the Prodigal remembred what
a kind Father he had, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 18. 'twas
<hi>Pauls</hi> Argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.
'Tis a sad thing that the Grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
which is intended to keep men from
Despair, should by some be made an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to presumption, God forbid
we should continue in Sin because Grace
abounds.</p>
                  <p>2. The Grace of the Gospel is not only
an appointed Means, but is in its own
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103587:53"/>
nature a fit means to work repentance,
suited and adapted to that end, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God leads us to repentance, the
Schoolmen tell us that <hi>amor est congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivus,</hi>
and they give this reason for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it does congregate and gather in
our roving scattered thoughts from those
various lesser Objects after which they go,
fixing our Minds upon God, the only soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfying
Object. Love is conciliative,
when God doth through Faith let in any
sense of his intended grace towards sinners,
the heart melts under it, a sinner does not
repent that he may believe, but because
he does believe, something of the Love
of God to sinners in Christ Jesus, some
inkling of this is come to his ear, hath
touched his very heart, before ever he
sets upon repentance, and now he can hold
no longer, the love of Christ constrains
him, great is the power of Love, when it
commends it self to us in some signal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of kindness to our visible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and benefit.</p>
                  <p>3. Because Christ gives repentance, <hi>Act.</hi>
5. 31. he purchased this and all other
graces for us, by dying for us, he not only
obtained pardon of Sin in our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but all inherent Graces in the Saints
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103587:53"/>
come from Christ, he procured them for
us, he works them in us, his sufferings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not only satisfactory for sin, but meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
of grace to be bestowed upon us,
though the Law can't sanctify a sinner yet
Christ can, and 'tis an act of special grace
towards us when he doth, but he will first
satisfie the Law and Justice of God, that
being brought under grace by our free Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
we may answer to the Law of
grace in our sanctification, denying all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness
and Worldly Lusts, living soberly
and righteously here below as the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Lord ought to do; the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
perfect Obedience, but in case of
Failure, the Gospel Promises Faith and
Repentance, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18.</p>
                  <p>4. Because God hath annexed a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Spirit to the Gospel, to make way
for his Grace, and to give it a prevailing
efficacy in the Hearts of men, they are
drawn by the loving kindness of God,
and cannot resist it, the Spirit opens the
Mystery of the Love of God in Christ,
and so charms the Soul with it, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to withstand the allurements of it.</p>
                  <p>5. Because the ways and means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a sinner to life, are all supernatural;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103587:54"/>
the Law speaks nothing of this, the Law
never puts us upon any thing that is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural;
I mean that originally was so
to man in his perfect state, for then it had
been quite above the reach and capacity
of Mans Understanding, but God suited
his Law to those inbred Notions and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Truth, that were concreated in
us, the way of salvation through Faith
and Repentance being supernatural; we
must apply our selves to the Gospel to
know this.</p>
                  <p>3. The necessary Connection that is
between Evangelical Repentance and sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faith. I prove, it thus.</p>
                  <p>'Tis so in the first production of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and in all the subsequent acts of
Repentance, therefore 'tis alwayes so.</p>
                  <p>In the first production of Repentance
if you consider how this was wrought by
<hi>Iohns</hi> Ministry, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. these
two things will evidently appear.</p>
                  <p>First, That Repentance alwayes presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
Faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That Repentance rises out
of Faith. And how!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:103587:54"/>
I will clear up this by a brief Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
upon those words, <hi>Repent ye, for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> is brought in inviting sinners to
Repentance; the Argument he uses is
plainly this, God is inclined to Pardon
you, therefore Repent: I come as a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
to prepare the way, that by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you the first newes of Gods intended
grace and favour towards you, I might sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and mollify your hearts and dispose you
to a ready thankful acceptance of Christ,
this offer of Grace is called the Kingdom
of Heaven because it is inclusive of all the
happiness that Heaven can afford: all good
comes along with Pardoning Grace, I see
says <hi>Iohn,</hi> you are all lying under the sad
damning circumstances of your own sins,
in a very woful miserable condition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
about with Hell and Death, with
horror and darkness, all things round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
you, look very black and dismal, I
am come to put you into a better state, to
offer you a Kingdom, which will shortly
appear in all its Glory; 'tis at hand, 'tis
coming toward you, Heaven it self is come
to look after you to lend a helping hand
to lift you out of this horrible Pit, before
it shut its mouth upon you, see that you
refuse not this grace, that you put not from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103587:55"/>
you the word of the Gospel, least you
judge your selves unworthy of Eternal
Life, as <hi>Acts 13. 46. i. e.</hi> it will as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear to be so, as if it had been so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in open Court, upon a fair hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your Cause, if Heaven and Earth
were to sit in Judgment upon you, they
would conclude you most unworthy of
Everlasting Life, and by putting the word
from you, you have in effect passed this
judgement upon your selves, or you have
done that now which your own Consciences
will so interpret at the last day, they will
then tell you you might have had life and
pardon, but would not; you would not
come to Christ that you might have life,
therefore your damnation is just, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
perish, &amp; may thank your selves for
it, how speechless will sinners be then: as to
remain in impenitency under the outward
Light of the Gospel, does argue the height
of unbelief, so to be brought to Repentance
by the Preaching of the Gospel does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
imply Faith in the Gospel, 'tis
impossible that a Tender of Grace should
work Repentance till 'tis believed, 'tis of
no force, makes no impression upon the
Mind of a Man till then, therefore, Faith
must be presupposed, I make it out thus.</p>
                  <p>That which is brought as a motive for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103587:55"/>
the doing of a thing, must be first under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
received and believed, before the
thing can be done upon that motive:
there is in the Gospel a general offer of
Mercy to sinners, this proves an effectual
means to beget Faith in all that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
unto life, upon their believing
this general offer of Grace, their hearts
begin to melt under it, and some inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Repentance is wrought in them,
this Faith and this Repentance wrought
in a more general way at first, do form
themselves into more particular and distinct
acts afterwards, thus the principles of the
Doctrine of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance from
dead works and Faith towards God are
first laid, and then there is (in the light
and power of these principles) a going on
unto perfection, Heb. 6. 1. Our first Faith
is a more general Faith, and so is our first
Repentance, rather an inclination and
tendency to believe and repent, then
actual Faith, or actual Repentance. Our
first Faith wrought in us upon the general
proposal of Gospel Grace, contains in it
a saving Conviction of Sin, 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to receive grace without it, grace
is nothing to us, of no signification to us,
but as it gives relief against sin, which we
must have some sense of, before we apply
our selves to the grace of God for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103587:56"/>
we must see something in our selves
that wants a pardon, and which we are
willing to repent of and forsake in Case
of a pardon, Repentance is as true an
effect of Faith, as Pardon and Comfort,
Faith first brings a sinner to Christ under
some hope of Pardon, and then busies it
self in working Repentance, in order to a
comfortable sense of Pardon. The Spirit
lets in some sense of Gospel Grace tendred
unto sinners, and affects the heart with it,
as very desireable, as a very seasonable
offer, by no means to be slighted, the
Soul begins to be taken with it, conceives
some hope from it, and this is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Faith, and with our first Faith
Light comes in giving us some Gospel
Conviction of sin in order to Repentance,
I call it a Gospel Conviction, because it is
wrought by means of the Gospel, all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
acts of Faith and Repentance have
their rise from this first work, which
brings me to the second Point, viz.</p>
                  <p>That Faith is not only joyned with
Repentance in the first production of it,
as has been shewed, but in all the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
acts of it ever after; which I make
out thus. Faith and Repentance do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
refer to each other in their several
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103587:56"/>
actings, Faith to Repentance, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to Faith; he that believes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
because he believes, and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
believes because he repents, <hi>i. e.</hi> as
Faith is the cause of Repentance, so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is the reason of every particular
act of Faith put forth upou Christ for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
'tis impossible to make up the full sense
of an act of Faith on our part, if you fetch
not the reason of it from Repentance: Why
do we go to the Physitian, is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are sick, weary and faint ready
to die of such a Disease: So why does a
weary Soul come to Christ, is it not to
be eased of his Burden? that insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
burden of sin that is ready to sink
him into Hell.</p>
                  <p>If Faith and Repentance be thus always
joyned together, does it not follow that
we are justified by our Repentance as
well as by Faith? I Answer, No. Though
we are not saved without Repentance, it
does not therefore follow that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by our Repentance; but some to
make good this Assertion have coyned
many subtle distinctions, relating to both.
Before I give a particular reply to this,
let me say something in general. Religion
may be considered, either in its primitive
purity and simplicity, as it was laid down
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103587:57"/>
in the Fundamental Principles of it, by
Christ and his Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Or as it has since been drawn through
the various Discourses, Reasonings and
Writings of Men for so many Centuries
past, this has so much overcharged Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with so many nice distinctions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
questions, and endless disputes, that
it seems to be quite another thing then it
was in the Apostles dayes: The best way
is to return to the primitive simplicity of
the Gospel, especially in judging of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
which are plainly and clearly
laid down there in Terms very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
                  <p>Though Faith be the Gift of God, and
is given of meer Grace but to a few, yet
all who live under the Light of the Gospel
may know what they ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
which will render their unbelief
more inexcusable; did we dwell more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what is plainly revealed as fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
necessary to Salvation, we should
better discern, by the light of those Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
the just consequences of them,
in any deductions from them, which may
not be so particularly and expresly spoken
unto in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:103587:57"/>
But now to answer the query whether
we may not be said to be justified by our
Repentance, as well as by Faith, since
we are not saved without Repentance?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between Justification and Salvation,
Salvation includes all qualifications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that state, Justification lets us
into that state; gives us right to Life from
whence spring all Qualifications becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Life. Besides, Saving Graces are
so called, not that they are the Causes of
Salvation, but because they accompany
it, we cannot be saved without them.
Faith it self as a Grace inherent in us, is
no meritorious Cause of our Justification;
'tis that which carries us out of our selves
to Christ for Righteousness upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of which we are justified in the sight
of God, when we say we are justified by
Faith, we don't mean we are justified by
any thing in our selves, we can't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it so, but the contrary, that we must
be beholding to Christ for all. He that
receives all from another, gives nothing
to himself, he does indeed apply to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to his own use and benefit, what is
freely given to him by another, but he
cannot in any propriety of Speech be said
to ascribe any thing to himself, or to owe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103587:58"/>
himself thanks for what he receives from
another: Faith in its justifying act does
not look to it self as our grace, but unto
Christ as our Righteousness, the inherent
grace of Faith is not our justifying Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
though it lead us out to him who
is; Faith is the hand, but Christ is the
gift; nay the hand it self is the gift of
God, as well as that which is put into it:
God gives us not only what we believe,
but he gives us to believe; the habit and
act of faith are both from God, that
he that glories may glory in the Lord on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
And if it be so with faith, if that be shut
out from being any part of our justifying
Righteousness, 'twill hold true much more
in all other saving graces that spring from
faith, whether Hope, Love, Fear, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Repentance proves our
Faith to be saving, such a faith as gives
us an Interest in Christ, faith adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Righteousness of Christ, but
applies it as it is, it only gives us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in it, and makes it ours by vertue
of the Promise tendring it to us, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Promise we have a sure inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in the thing promised, and may ever
after count it our own, and if we are not
justified by our graces themselves, much
less by our good works, which are the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103587:58"/>
fruits and issues of them, we must resolve
all our graces into faith, and faith it self
into Christ and his Righteousness before
we can be clear in the matter of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>4. The real distinction that is between
them notwithstanding this necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection.</p>
                  <p>Faith and Repentance are frequently
joyned together in Scripture, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
each of them singly put for the whole
work of Conversion, and then they do
alwayes include each other, and imply the
whole work of grace in the Soul, as <hi>Luk.</hi>
13. 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.
18. Though they cannot be separated,
yet they may be distinguished, not only
nominally but really; they are spoken of
(<hi>Act.</hi> 20. 21.) as two distinct things, as
Faith and Hope are inseparable, yet two
distinct Graces, so 'tis with Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
they grow together as different
Branches from the same Root that bears
and feeds them both, they are the two
Vital Constituent parts of a Christian,
which have their distinct Offices and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences:
Repentance is the same in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
with Faith, though they receive
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103587:59"/>
different denominations, from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
objects and occasions about which
they act: A principle of Grace is that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Seed, or that Spirit that is born of
the Spirit; the fruits of the Spirit are not
the Spirit it self, but something produced
by him; all Graces are the fruits of the
Spirit and are specified by their different
objects: All Graces are but so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of that holy Disposition, that
is wrought in us by the Holy Ghost. To
Repent of Sin is as true Holiness as not to
sin at all; a sinner has no other way to
express his Love to Holiness, than by a
declared Hatred of his Sins.</p>
                  <p>They differ in their Objects, faith as
justifying, hath Christs Righteousness for
its Object, Repentance has mans unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
for its Object; as Faith acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ for an Interest in his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
so Repentance acts towards God,
acknowledging our own Unrighteousness
and bewailing it, we cannot rejoyce in
the Righteousness of Christ, till we mourn
for our own sins; Christ reconciles God
to us, by the attonement offer'd, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 20, 21. and us to God by working Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in us, who were Enemies to him
in our Minds by wicked works, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103587:59"/>
alienated from the life of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 18.
This Enmity against God and alienation
from him, is removed by Repentance:
Faith works upwards to appease Gods
Wrath, by holding up the Blood of
Christ; Repentance works downwards
upon our selves, changing our Minds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, that we may be conformable
to his Will, and rebel no more against
him. Besides,</p>
                  <p>All Graces do not imploy, at least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually,
the same Affections, there is more
joy and hope in Faith, more sorrow and
fear in Repentance; faith lifts up and
comforts a guilty sinner upon one account,
Repentance humbles him and lays him
low upon another account, filling him
with godly sorrow for his sins.</p>
                  <p>5. Reasons why the Professors of this
Age who are so much for Faith do mind
Repentance so little, are so seldom found
in the Exercise of it.</p>
                  <p>1. Because they rest in general Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Faith, and of Justification by Grace
through Christ; they say they have faith,
and think this will save them, we may
have right notions of faith in our Heads,
and yet be under no real actings of faith
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103587:60"/>
in our Hearts; we may be Orthodox in
our Judgements, sound in the Doctrine of
Faith, and yet be strangers to the Grace
of Faith; we may hold the Truth, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
for it, preach it up, maintain it in
our Discourses, as our Opinion, and yet
be rotten at Heart for all this, under the
power of unbelief, if you know these
things happy are ye if ye do them. Faith
must be done as well as talked of, it must
be really acted by us in our own case,
'tis not the doctrine of faith, but your
faith in or according to that doctrine, that
saves you, the just shall live by his own
faith, the doctrine of faith is an external
thing laid down in the letter of the word,
but the grace of faith is an inward living
principle found only in the hearts of real
Saints, this is that I am inquiring after,
and pressing upon you as that that will
certainly produce Repentance, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.
10. 'Tis one thing to have a Notional
Knowledge of the doctrine of faith as
contained in the letter of the word, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to be under the power of the
grace of faith as it passes thorow the heart
in the lively actings of it: Notions of
things may be separated from those effects
that alwayes attend the things themselves
when they are in being, we may shake
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103587:60"/>
and freeze under our notions of fire, but
we cannot stand before fire it self and not
be warmed by it, were there more real
faith; I mean of the grace of faith, among
professors, there would be more Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
let us not slatter our selves in the
good opinion we have of our faith, and
of our supposed Interest in Christ, 'tis all
false, our faith is vain, and we are yet in
our sins, if Repentance do not accompany
our faith: The visible neglect of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the Professors of this age, has
brought a reproach upon the doctrine of
faith, and caused it to be evil spoken of,
that faith that does not sanctifie, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
justifie, and without Repentance there
can be no Sanctification: not that we
make Repentance any Meritorious Cause
of Pardon, or that it is to be rested in as
any satisfaction for sin, only we affirm that
justifying faith alwayes works Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they rest in a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which they took up at their
first Conversion and that must serve all
their lives long, 'tis enough they have
once repented, that work is over, they
have done with it now, and care not to
return to it again: but because you have
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103587:61"/>
once repented, you must always repent,
you entred into Covenant with God for
your whole lives, to repent of every sin
you should fall into, and shall we begin
in the Spirit and end in the Flesh.</p>
                  <p>3. Because they have long since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
what was amiss in their Lives, and
refrained from the outward acts of those
sins they lived in heretofore, all this may
be without any true Repentance, you say
you have forsaken your sins that is a gross
mistake, for till you repent of them you
have not forsaken them in Gods account,
but are still looked upon as those who
justifie your selves in those very sins, if not
why don't you repent of them, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
abide under the guilt of that sin
which you have not repented of, the
turning of the heart to God, can never
be without Repentance; till then you
still retain the good opinion you had of
your sins, your heart is set upon them
still, nothing but Repentance turns the
heart another way. There can be no real
Reformation of Life, without a change
of Heart; Men may for a spurt force
themselves to an outward Course of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but they can never hold it, the heart
will go its own way, and carry the man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103587:61"/>
after it, nothing but repentance makes a
man a better man than he was before; a
man is the same that ever he was till he
repents, then indeed he is another man,
of another Mind.</p>
                  <p>4. Because they reckon all their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
sins among their Infirmities, and
therefore a slight Repentance will serve
the turn, they think they will be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Course to them, without any more
ado.</p>
                  <p>I look upon it as a great Error, to hold
that all sins committed in a state of Grace
are sins of Infirmity; Saints themselves
may be guilty of wilful presumptuous
sins, and when they are, they must not
think to shift them off as common Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
I grant, those grosser acts of sin,
that a Saint may be surprized into, do
argue an infirm imperfect state, their state
may be good though imperfect, there
may be some good thing in their Hearts
toward God, when they fall foul as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> did; but I am not now
inquiring what is in their hearts, but what
is in those grosser acts of sin, <hi>viz.</hi> Murder,
Adultery, and the like; I say there is
nothing but Evil in them, they are all
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103587:62"/>
over and throughout sinful; now, what
is morally evil and sinful in its own nature
cannot properly be called a sin of Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because an Infirmity in the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, is the deficiency of a good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
'tis not so good as it should be, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
evil in it self it is not, <hi>v. g.</hi> a
Child of God prayes but not so fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he should, he hears the Word, but
not so attentively as he should; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
in Christ, but not so firmly, so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so stedfastly as he would, this is his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
here the action it self, or the thing
done, is for the substance and matter of it
good in it self, what God has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but when we do that which is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially
Evil in its own nature, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by God, this is more than an Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the whole action is naught; 'tis not
a weak action, but a wicked one. He
that is an infirm man, is a living man; a
dead man is more than infirm, he has no
life at all in him that is capable of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if a Child of God should swear, be
Drunk, or commit Whoredom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
would not say as some do, Oh the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of the Saints, but I would say oh
the Wickedness, the Leudness of the Saints;
you'l think these hard words, hard things
must have hard words, they that do well
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103587:62"/>
shall hear well, and they that do ill must
hear ill: Sin is not the less sinful because a
Godly Man commits it, it falls under
greater Aggravations in him, than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
there may be some good thing in
his heart, but there is nothing in these
sinful acts but what is morally Evil and
abominably wicked. This should awaken
us to Repentance, are there not sins even
mong us against the Lord our God?</p>
                  <p>6. The Application.</p>
                  <p>Repentance being the plainest and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Evidence of Saving Faith, let us be
much in the exercise of this Grace: We
should repent as often as there is new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for Repentance, I do not say we
should alwayes be grieving and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the same sin; Repentance may
have its perfect work, in reference to
some particular sin, which God has suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
humbled us for. There is a time
to set broken bones, we may rejoyce in
the Cure, in that Ease and Rest that God
gives us, when he speaks peace to us: By
believing we enter into Rest, till some
new sin disturb our rest, and then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is to be renewed: By a new sin
I don't mean common unavoidable Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103587:63"/>
but some grosser wilful Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
We ought to be humbled under
our Infirmities, to confess them, and so to
pass on by a present act of Faith, into our
wonted serenity and peace of Conscience
not doubting but God will overlook them
for Christs sake. Faith is not so put to it,
does not labour so much to take in the,
pardon of them, as it does and must do
to obtain the pardon of grosser sins, which
put the Soul at a greater distance from
God, then common Infirmities do, which
are pardoned of Course to Believers upon
their humble acknowledgement of them,
but in case of any particular wilful sin, we
must renew our Repentance in a more
solemn manner, and afflict our souls for
it, how long God may keep us mourning,
before he restore to us the joy of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
must be left to him who knowes
when to administer comfort to us, in the
fittest season: When we are about this
work, 'tis good to reflect upon former
sins already pardoned, there sinfulness ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
thorow the Pardon. We may join
our old scores to this new reckoning, and
carry over all to the present Account,
that having the sun Total before us, we
may bewail the late addition we have
made to it: When we see how high it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103587:63"/>
rises, every new offence receives an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation,
from so many that went before,
'tis some Extenuation of a Fault to say, 'tis
the first time; but frequent relapses into
the same sin do heighten the guilt of it,
and in such Cases there is nothing but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
or perishing.</p>
                  <p>The more you are in the Exercise of
this Grace of Repentance, the less incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
will you be to any sin: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
were the Devil sure you would
Repent, he would not be so forward to
Tempt you to any sin, nothing does so
enrage the Devil, as the Repentance of
the Saints, could he keep them always in
that Mind, they are in, in the hour of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Temptation, he might Glory over
them, but when they come to themselves,
and consider better of it, how do they
inveigh against the Tempter, and cry down
the sin as an abominable Practise, and
what does the Devil get by this, he loses
more by their Repentance then ever he
got by their Sin, he is laid open as an
Impostor, as a Deceiver; the Repentance
of the Saints is the greatest Torment to the
Devil before his time that can be; as there
is joy in Heaven at the Conversion of a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103587:64"/>
Sinner, so there is no small sorrow in Hell
upon the same Account.</p>
                  <p>You cannot Honour God more than by
a Daily Repentance, thereby you vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
your holy Profession, from giving
the least countenance to sin; were the
people of God more ashamed of sin, the
wicked of the World would glory less in
it, they would begin to blush with you,
and hang down their heads for doing that
which is so openly decry'd by all good
men, good men are greatly wanting in the
open Profession of their Repentance, if
you did mourn for sin more, others would
rejoyce in it less.</p>
