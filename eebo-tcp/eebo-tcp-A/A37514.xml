            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>UNhappy she, whom Fortune hath forlorn,</l>
               <l>Despis'd of grace, that proffered grace did scorn,</l>
               <l>My lawless love, hath luckless wrought my woe,</l>
               <l>My discontent, content did overthrow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My loathed life too late I do lament,</l>
               <l>My woful deeds in heart I do repent:</l>
               <l>A Wife I was that wilful went awry,</l>
               <l>And for that fault am here prepar'd to dye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In bloomy years my Fathers greedy mind,</l>
               <l>Against my will a match for me did find:</l>
               <l>Great wealth there was, yea, gold and silver store,</l>
               <l>But yet my heart had chosen one before.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Mine eyes, dislikt my Fathers liking quite,</l>
               <l>My heart did loath my Parents fond delight:</l>
               <l>My greedy mind, and fancy told to me,</l>
               <l>That with his age my Youth could not agree.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>On knees I crav'd they would not me constrain,</l>
               <l>With tears I cry'd their purpose to restrain,</l>
               <l>With fighs and sobs I did them often move,</l>
               <l>I might not wed whereas I could not love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But all in vain my speeches still I spent,</l>
               <l>My Mothers will my wishes did prevent,</l>
               <l>Though wealthy <hi>Page</hi> possest my outward part,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>George Strangwidge</hi> still was lodged in my heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I wedded was and wrapped all in woe,</l>
               <l>Great discontent within my heart did grow:</l>
               <l>I loath'd to live, yet liv'd in deadly strife,</l>
               <l>Because perforce I was made <hi>Pages</hi> Wife.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My chosen eyes could not his sight abide,</l>
               <l>My tender Youth did loath his aged side,</l>
               <l>Scant could I tast the meat whereon I fed,</l>
               <l>My legs did loath to lodge within his bed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Cause knew I none, I should despise him so,</l>
               <l>That such disdain within my heart did grow,</l>
               <l>Save only this, that fancy did me move,</l>
               <l>And told me still <hi>George Strangwide</hi> was my love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But here began my downfal and decay,</l>
               <l>In mind I mus'd to make him strait away,</l>
               <l>I that became his discontented wife,</l>
               <l>Contented was he should be rid of life.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Methinks the heavens crys vengeance for my fact,</l>
               <l>Methinks the world condemns my Monstrous act:</l>
               <l>Methinks within, my Conscience tells me true,</l>
               <l>That for that deed, hell fire is my due.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My pensive soul doth sorrow for my sin,</l>
               <l>For which offence my soul doth bleed within:</l>
               <l>But mercy Lord, for mercy still I cry,</l>
               <l>Save thou my soul, and let my body dye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Well could I wish that <hi>Page</hi> enjoy'd his life,</l>
               <l>So that he had some other to his wife:</l>
               <l>But never could I wish of low or high,</l>
               <l>A longer life then see sweet <hi>Strangwidge</hi> die,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O woe is me that had no greater grace,</l>
               <l>To stay till he had run out Natures race;</l>
               <l>My deed I rue, but more I do repent,</l>
               <l>That to the same my <hi>Stranwidge</hi> gave consent.</l>

               <l>And give your doom, 'twixt Parents, love, and me,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I was their child, and bound for to obey,</l>
               <l>Yet not to love where I no love could lay:</l>
               <l>I married was in muck and endlesse strife,</l>
               <l>But faith before had made me <hi>Strangwidge</hi> wife.</l>

               <l>What cause hadst thou to bear such wicked spight,</l>
               <l>Against my love and eke my hearts delight?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I would to God thy wisdom had béen more,</l>
               <l>Or that I had not entred in thy door,</l>
               <l>Or that thou hadst a kinder father been</l>
               <l>Vnto thy Child, whose Yeare are but green.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The match unmeet which thou for me didst make,</l>
               <l>When aged <hi>Page</hi> thy daughter home did take,</l>
               <l>Well mayst thou rue with tears that cannot dry,</l>
               <l>Which is the cause that four of us must die.</l>

               <l>My soul more sobs to think of thy disgrace,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The deed late done in heart I do repent,</l>
               <l>But that I lov'd I cannot yet relent:</l>
               <l>Thy seemly sight was ever sweet to me,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>It was for me alas, thou didst the same,</l>
               <l>On me by right they ought to lay the blame:</l>
               <l>My worthlesse love hath brought thy life in scorn,</l>
               <l>And woe is me that ever I was born.</l>

               <l>Farewel my love, the pride of <hi>Plimouth</hi> town,</l>
               <l>Farewel the Flower, whose beauty is cut down.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>For twenty Years great was the cost I know,</l>
               <l>Thy unkind father did on thee bestow:</l>
               <l>Yet afterwards so sower did fortune lower,</l>
               <l>He lost his joy and child within an hour.</l>

               <l>And yet my guilt I cannot so excuse</l>

               <l>Had I deny'd <hi>Ulalia</hi> still should live:</l>
               <l>Blind fancy said, do not this suit deny,</l>
               <l>Live thou in blisse, or else in sorrow die.</l>
